PLEASE VERIFY <br /> <br /> You can not expect credibility in action movies where the superhero must perform an infinite number of incredible performances that are harassed in this process, but they are recovering at a fast pace and transforming harmless gadgets into deadly weapons ... especially when directs Renny Harlin. <br /> <br /> "CLIFFHANGER" is no exception. But the film has a lot of richness: beautiful scenery captured, magnificent special and visual effects (the first five minutes making and giving a movie tone), excellent musical score, welcomed lightning attempts to relax some tensions and (Stallone, star and cowriter, (Janine Turner) and one of the most dramatic villains at all (invaluable John Lithgow and deceptively female Caroline Goodall, but also Rex Linn - longer than usual, and who it is most used, Leon, Craig Fairbrass) Good, solid fun then if no credibility. As Roger Ebert wrote another movie) "It's a kind of movie that you can sit and enjoy for as long as you do not make a mistake too much thinking." <br /> <br />
