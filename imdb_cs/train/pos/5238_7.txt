I liked Top Gun. It was my interest. Predictable plot, decent character development and story line. It is quite similar to High Noon in that the people of the city look weak and are afraid to face the villain. This film has some quality actors who really do not have a chance to share all their talents. Some actors have also not been recognized for their roles. Denver Pyle was a good-looking man in his younger days. John Dehner, Rod Taylor are excellent in their roles. Sterling Hayden did the best he could with the poor material. It's hard to imagine him as a gunman. Laura, played by Karen Booth, was nauseous. He seemed to like that two men were fighting for her. Ugh. Finally, how can people travel without luggage? Especially women.
