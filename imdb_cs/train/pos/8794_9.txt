Chang Cheh's "Shaolin Temple" could be a well-known Shaw Brothers martial arts movie cycle. This exciting kung fu epic boasts an amazing cast - the real who's who of the Shaw stud. Though the conspiracy is quite standard and the fighting choreography is as great as usual, it is a Chehovo piece that makes this film remarkable and enjoyable. A sense of respect for the history and traditions of the Shaolin temple is tangible in every picture. Unlike William Keighley's famous story about legendary Fighting 69th in the same title film or John Ford's greeting to West Point in "The Long Gray Line," Cheh's "Shaolin Temple" is lovingly crafted in the same style. <br /> <br /> The cultural correlation I'm trying to do is compare the Shaolin temple with the Alamo. Watching this movie will give you the same admirable and nostalgic feelings you have experienced many years ago in the history of elementary schools when you learned of the courage and sacrifice of the doomed Alamo heroes. At the end of the movie you could also be tempted to call, remember the Shaolin temple!
