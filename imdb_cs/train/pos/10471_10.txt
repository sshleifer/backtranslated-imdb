I loved this movie but I hated it because I wanted to help this boy! I am fifty years old and I have a lot of friends in the music industry ... who are still trying to become adults ... no longer fans, groupies, money, etc. And they are so hard to adapt to regular life ... how new bands see etc., how to get the light of the reflectors ... it's almost as if they had to start over again ... this movie is a testimony of what a lot of old rockers from the 70s and 80s are going through now ... and that's where it seems to me that the film is sad and depressing. BUT shows the life of an old rock star - abandoned and lost - in a credible way. The young girl who comes to her upset house reminds me of Hollis maclaren (Scandalous) ... and she's one lady in the movie you'll cheer on. This film is a must for people in their 1950s who saw the rise and fall of bands, people who knew members, and watched them hurt them, as the age sank, and popularity was lost. This is almost perfect movie ... .Sad, but in a positive way ... due to whales. YOU MUST SEE!
