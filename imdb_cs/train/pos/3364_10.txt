I was also very surprised to see how few people voted about this movie and just had something to write about, although my comments are similar to those I've already written. film. Excellent acting between Mastroianni & Loren. The way the film is narrated: Mankind and love are slowly developing between these two sides and contrasting with the simultaneous and ongoing non-human march of the Fascist radio announcer (which is the coincidence of colleague Mastroianni) and the adherents "coming out of the show." For me, it is a very fine film about what to be human. Maybe some of you will argue that the anti-fascist "message" is too clear, but it did not destroy the film for me. My vote is 10/10.
