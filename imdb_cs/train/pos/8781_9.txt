I consider myself a bit of an expert on boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling "Gentleman Jim" for the best boxing ever. This is Robert Wise / Paul Newman, "Someone up there likes me." This film could be number one, but "Gentleman Jim" is close to number 2. The film does not just mean the rise of James J. Corbett but also shows the boxing sport for the decisive transition time. In the late 1980s, the box resigned from the brutal days of naked joints to the more "gentleman" days in the gloves of the Marquis of Queensbury. And the sport has moved away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and a time of acceptance and respect. "Gentleman Jim" is not a realistic view these days. It's romantic and yes, even a little hokey occasionally. But always so beautiful. Errol Flynn is perfect as a "gentleman" Jim, who in fact is not a "gentleman" at all, but only a quick spokesman for the working class family. Alexis Smith is quite impressive as a high-class woman with whom she has a relationship of love and hatred (and we all know it is, of course, love that eventually wins that match). <br /> <br /> The end of "Gentleman Jim" great John L Sullivan (whose famous line is NOT "I can lick a man in the world" of course ... romanticism again) that the belt on Corbett turns him over. This is really one of the best scenes in any sporting movement that has ever happened. Realistic? But not. Hey, if you want realism to watch "Raging Bull" instead. This is a much more realistic boxing movie. But "Gentleman Jim" is much more fun.
