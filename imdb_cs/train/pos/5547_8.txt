Strangler from the swamp was made by the low-floor PRC studio and is definitely one of their best films I've seen. The man who was assassinated for murder did not allow a revenge to revenge the people who accused him. He uses a rope to strangle his victims, and after a few deaths, including the old man who runs the ferry through the swamp, he disappears. The old man's granddaughter takes over the ferry himself and also falls in love with one of the local men and decides to get married. This film has a lot of hazy atmospheres, which makes it a creepy experience. <br /> <br /> Cast included Rosemary La Planche, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) as Strangler. <br /> <br /> Strangler of the Swamp is a must for old horror fans like me. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 and a half stars of 5.
