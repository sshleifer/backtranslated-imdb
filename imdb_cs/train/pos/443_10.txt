I first saw this movie in the early 1990s, when it was released for the first time. The room with view was also new out. The enchanted April had much more! I find it more realistic and earthy, the characters are believable for being "normal". By the end of the movie, I felt the same as I did when I first saw the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice, I longed for characters to find what they were looking for, whether it was isolation, peace, freedom or love. You feel that Italy is so far away from everything she has ever known to be so decadent that they risk and leave everything that is humorous and narrow. But in the hot spring of April, all of them live and relax (according to the Victorian corsets) and slowly retreat to the satisfaction of everyone. What a small piece of film! How is it not known?
