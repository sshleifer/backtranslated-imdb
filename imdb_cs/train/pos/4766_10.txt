It is unusual to see a movie where the performance of a single actor is so good that one can feel that the film will have little interest, if at all, without its presence. Despite the incredible direction - in fact, there are plenty of scenes that seemed to be filmed too quickly and carefree - a seemingly low budget, a strange story about a man who wanted to replace a crucified priest and other weekly points, Pierre Fresnay's presence is so impressive that man gets shock from the beginning to the horrible end. I have never seen and I can not imagine better performance, even Paul Scofield, who works in "Men of All Seasons." <br /> <br /> In fact, the end may be considered ridiculous if Fresnay did not play the nicknamed priest who returns to the church by committing a crime. "It's suis Maurice Morand, pre-catholique" ("I am Maurice Morand, Catholic priest") is said to be so brilliant that one can forget the madman who is doing it for this purpose. <br /> <br /> Another impressive thing that this film has is the only scene in which Morand - who, while being beaten, is a stylish priest - sets up a vast array of grapevine in the cabaret, turning it into Christ's blood. Gerard - the man who wants to return Morand to the church or replace it himself - must drink if he does not want to leave it in the cabaret. It does halfway cheer and applause from people who think they just drink three of the four layers of wine. In the next scene, the dialogue between Morand and the garbage collector is also remarkable. "Do you bring people, too?" Morand asks, who hates what he has just done. "That would be too much work" is an intelligent answer. The rest of the movie is worth commenting, but it is definitely worth seeing because of the very strong and strangely emotional atmosphere created all the time. I think "Le Défroqué" is a very strange movie, but all viewers have to see him - if good catholiques are obligatory - because it's a very rare movie in the movie. <br /> <br />
