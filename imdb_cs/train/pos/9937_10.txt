The TV series was one of those I loved when I was a child. Even though I see it now through the pink shadows of nostalgia, I can still say it's a good show, very educated, but still fun. I did not see the original French version, only Swedish. I have no idea how good dubbing it was, it was too long to remember. The premise of the show was to show you how the body works. I swear, the school has not taught me yet half of what I know of this show. It is also tied in other things like what happens if you eat unhealthy food and do not practice, with nice examples inside the body. Who wants to have another chocolate bar when you know that miniature virus tanks can attack you? : D The cartoon looked nice, very friendly to kids, of course, but with caution. Cells, viruses, electrical signals in the brain, antibodies and everything else are represented by sad cartoon characters and look pretty much the way you would expect what they should look like in the animated body. <br /> <br /> The history series (especially the life scenario) was a key part of childhood. I'm so happy to find them.
