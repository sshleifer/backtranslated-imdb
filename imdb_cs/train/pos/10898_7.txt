This movie is not as bad as I've heard. It was nice, funny, and I love what's going on around the holidays. It is totally in the mood for Christmas shopping and listening to music on vacation. When this movie comes out on DVD, it will have a place for Christmas holidays in my collection. It will be a film that I watch every Thanksgiving every year to get into the mood for the best time of the year. I hear that Ben's character was a bit crazy, but I think he just adds it to the movie and why it's so serious all the time. Take it for what it is, Christmas comedy with love. I enjoyed it. No, it's not Titanic and it will not be your heart pound with expectation, but it will bring laughter or two. So laugh and have a good time :)
