The Thing About My Folks is a wonderful film about relationships - especially the adult son and his father, but also that son with his wife, sisters and mother. Paul Reiser wrote a semi-autobiographical film about his relationship with his father. The film is funny, sad and thoughtful. It has led me to reconsider my own relationship with my current late father and my adult son. Peter Falk is excellent as Paul's father - the role could not be better cast. I hope that both Mr. Falk and Mr. Reiser are recognized in the next year's film prize for their efforts - Falk for his performance and Reiser for his screenplay.
