This is one of the best movies and it says that a lot is that it was for the television. I really want it to be a d. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt gave such a rough performance. He plays a novice policeman perfectly fired into a serial killer. When it collapses because it kills another baby, it was amazing. She is alone, so she gets to her. When he talks about his mother! WOW! <br /> <br /> Steven Weber as a serial killer was so shocking! He really brought her into his dark world. It was Oscar good. When talking about killing children, scary! When they realize who is really! What a scene! <br /> <br /> They really do not have it anymore. It was a real thriller without a horror.
