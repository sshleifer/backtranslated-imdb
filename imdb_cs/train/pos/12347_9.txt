This is a wonderful movie about a brothel in a fishing village that could best be described by scenic constellations and the direction of old Kurosawa's works, combined with Dostoevsky's themes of human psychology (O-shin-Sonia Marmelada), Shakespeare's drama and Hans Christian Andersen tragic and merry . The scenario is amazing, the scenes are colors - and some scenes that really impressed me are beautiful. The plot is interesting and unpredictable - each of the characters is very well developed and interesting - there is also a small action so if you do not like all the feelings that you would also come at your expense - It's not about the mysterious Geishas and the proud samurai whose Bushido is poured out of them, but about the life, the work, and the kinds of people they find at any time. The beautiful and fascinating tribute to Kurosawa is certainly worth seeing.
