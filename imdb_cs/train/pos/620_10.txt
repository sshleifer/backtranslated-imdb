The beautiful Stardust story was written by Neil Gaiman (writer MirrorMask) and it's a really good story. I think he would like every labyrinth, princess bride or 10th royal fan, and yet it is completely unique and he will stand on his own. And I feel that the film adaptation of this story has a far better end than what was said in the original novel by Neil Gaiman. Tristan (Tristan's novel), is the son of a deadly and merry slave who is held by a witch in the sphere of the universe. The story begins in a city near the wall that separates the magical world from the human world. When a falling star appears, Tristan promises to win it for a girl with whom he is blind. She does not realize that the star has the appearance of a girl in the world of fairy tales, and that there are more. Three ancient witches who want to use their hearts to become young, and some princes. <br /> <br /> It's a really good story. It has humor and spell and beautiful, surrealistic scenes and visuals. It is charming and I feel that children and adults of all ages can watch it. It's just magical. It's a real classic fairy tale I have not seen in the cinema since the eighties.
