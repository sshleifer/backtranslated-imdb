Bette Davis, in this 1934 film, will become a coolly entertaining performance like Mildred Rogers. The film seems to be rather dated in 2003. It is undoubtedly a lot worth watching for movie enthusiasts and fans of Bette Davis, but maybe they do not have so much attraction for the average observer of the film today. I was surprised to see young lady Davis look at this step. The actors are reflected in performances that are basically healthy and the story is meaningful and interesting. Leslie Howard is well-liked as Philip Carey, a student of medicine with a club. It's a movie with strong news about who we decide to love and why. However, "Human Bondage" did not seem to affect me mentally or emotionally. I felt somewhat indifferent and disconnected from the movie after watching it. I have the intuition that this may be the reaction the director went to. You will be judges! <br /> <br />
