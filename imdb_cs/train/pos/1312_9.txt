Chalking this in a rack for a win was a great movie. The performances were great and the script was just as great. Helen Hunt was magnificent as Riverside policeman Gina Pulasky. Gina was a complex nature. She was a newcomer to the Riverside Police Department. She eventually ended up in an affair with a coworker she knew she had a wife and children, all the time she'd taken a dangerous task, that she was about to conceal to catch a serial killer. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey (Ray Liotta looks alike) struck the job as a confused, often stuttering, police officer who had a matter with Gina. He was stoic as an officer, but he was totally opposed to dealing with his feelings and his extramarital affair. Steven Weber, most notably from the "Wings" sitcom, did a nice job as a silent, humble, tireless sociopath. He was innocent on the surface, but a cold killer lay beneath him. Weber really took the personality of a young adult child with an angry thirst to kill young boys. The whole movie was spectacular. Each scene, every word exchange, informs us more and more about nature. The production team has done phenomenal work with condensation days, if not weekly, in a 90-minute film. This movie was a good example of having a lot going with a small one.
