While 9 may seem like an unusually high score for such a small film, however, compared to the hundreds and hundreds of detective films from the 1930s and 1940s, it is one of the best and also very favorable compared to Powell's later "Thin Man". Now it does not mean that the film is similar to Thin Man, because KENNEL'S DARK CASE is not a comedy, but it's a more traditional mystery-detective movie. Now you would think that you do not have Nora Charles or Asta or a traditional comic aider (something that is in practically all serial detective films) for fun, it would be at the expense but I did not miss them because it was such an exceptionally well- written movie - have a really interesting case, as well as consistently outstanding performances all. The film begins at the show and is called Kennel Case Murder, although this Philo Vance film actually spends some time at dog shows and dogs are not a very important part of the film. Instead, the dignifiedly hated man is killed and left in a fully sealed room - an idea repeated in several other detective films (such as the closest medicine to a criminal doctor). However, as all this is explained, it seems quite trustworthy and fits together very well - keeping my interest all over. I certainly want other detective films of that day to have intelligent conspiracy and exceptional action like this one. This is definitely a goalie.
