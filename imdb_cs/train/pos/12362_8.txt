I will quickly deal with the affairs of the film: It was a very fascinating story about the devastating properties of all sorts of experiences; a young Italian woman who can not emotionally associate herself with her imprisoned political-radical fianc√© (partly because of her apolitical attitudes and carefree attitude to life) finds a comforting and passionate young lover who expresses sexual relations. The anxiety, fury, tenderness, and passion that rotate in the atmosphere of the story is equal to the restless silence that seems to flood both sides. The film borrows a disturbing mood that penetrates the entire political conflict, which otherwise loses the audience (unless you have a thorough knowledge of Italian politics in the 1980s). I found the movie convincing ... what a bit of it destroyed is the good sex scene the actress does for adventure ... it's not simulated and little imagination is left. There are other sex scenes in the film that I consider necessary because they outline the madness and loneliness in which the characters live. But the oral sex scene seems to derail my focus on a real story. It was smooth sailing until this moment, and as soon as the illustrious sexual scene (which caused a lot of outburst in its days) appears to be like hitting the obstacle. It's ugly and unnecessary, and I'm in a camp that believes the film would not be damaged if the scene was removed from it. And it is unfortunate that this particular scene can discourage people from watching this interesting film, which I think is worth a look for, because there is so much that is happening under the surface, emotions and other turbulence layered in the subtext. <br /> <br /> Overall: An amazing film slows down a sex scene that is not very much needed.
