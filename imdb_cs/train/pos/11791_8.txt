It's a very interesting short film by David Lynch and saying that the name David Lynch is probably enough for many people. This is your typical Lynch short. Blonde and brunette are in a dark room. The blonde wept, the brunette speaks in a threatening way to the blonde, and that's about it. <br /> <br /> With many silent moments, but with stunning music by Angelo Badalamenti, a weird form of tension. This short feeling is a little like "Mulholland Dr.", the movie I loved, and I enjoyed it. This is probably especially for Lynch fans, but there is a chance that you like it.
