This is a great musical with the timeless score of one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice "Parisien" atmosphere that gives the movie a lot of spells, but as for the story, it is not good there. Or at least not well solved. Also Caron's acting is not so smooth. But I liked some dialogues, liked the scene in the Seine, I liked the character played by the Levant, the colors; and of course dance, which is quite spectacular. And at 7.5 - 8 it seems to me a dot.
