The Secret of Kells is the movie I've been waiting for many years after I've seen some early shots at Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny. I'm here to tell you it's worth waiting. The cartoons are heavily stylized but not annoying, as I was afraid of. The whole movie is a thing of beauty and great imagination, especially I love an animated light book on which small figures come on the site. Characterization is wonderful, I love Brendan Gleeson's voice as a strict abbot, and I especially liked Arisling's voice. Forest is a triumph, such a beautiful place. The story is well-recognized, a mixture of reality and fantasy. and really attracts the viewer to make Brendan awaken in his efforts for the perfect materials for the Book. I am a lover of calligraphy and lighting, so the theme is close to my heart, but all the people I know who saw this and are not craft fans agree that it's a beautiful little movie. I'll definitely buy a DVD when it's released, and I'd like to say a well-done Cartoon Saloon and all the people who participated in this mammoth project. There can be much more. :) Come back here and say I bought some copies of the DVD as soon as I can and put them on Christmas, everyone loves it! And I wish them all the happiness in the world on the Oscar, so happy to see this nominee.
