Paulie was cute, cool, pleasant and quite full. I went to this film and I expected to see a typical "family" film that will find me unconscious in a few moments and fall to the floor. My mindframe changed instantly when I was quickly taken with a healthy film. It is rare that you find a family film that is thorough and can be created "healthy". Most of them are cheaply produced, written and produced purely to attract young family members who then drag the unhappy elderly into a mind that dampens 65 minutes of excessive visual gag and land. Oh yes, Paulie had a conspiracy. He narrated the story of a young girl (Marie) and her best friend Paulie, a parrot who could talk with her incredibly and quite often held talks. Mary, her ugly father, found it incredible, and she thought Paulie was harming the mental health of his four-year-old daughter and broke it quickly. We watch Paulie's adventures (and bad incidents) when he tries to rejoin his beloved owner, to meet many memorable characters. Oh, yeah, Paulie could really (cleverly) talk and have a fast New Jersey accent. Cold. The land had a strong and fun feeling that attracted me. Paulie is the best family film I've ever found and enjoyed with all my heart. At all. Seriously. Pick up a copy and sit down and enjoy a true family movie with the whole family. No sleep. I promise.
