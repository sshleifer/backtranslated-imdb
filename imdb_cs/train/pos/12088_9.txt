Hardcastle and McCormick are great television shows. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is predictable like Dukes of Hazzard, Hunter, A-Team etc. <br /> <br /> This show is pure net TV. The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is quite fun. They are often defeated on the episode several times, making the show a great deal of humor. Contains several vehicle hits in almost every episode, but who does not have a good hunt on the car? Especially with the coyote! <br /> <br /> I just hope they do a clean TV, like today I highly recommend today!
