This cheerful line is typical of what the nasty sisters say. (It's funny from its own concepts and incredibly funny.) Only two sisters are really bad. Boy, they're bad too! One is given by pinup poses and salacious reminders where e'er she goes. The other rose to look like Marilyn Monroe. She has sensual, slightly scattered lips. And do nothing, it's still bad than the other. <br /> <br /> All three sisters play starlets. The man who crashes into his life plays John Bromfield. He had some career. Today it seems like maybe the first major soft porn-porn porno ever sold. Well, of course not the first, but the youngest at the time. <br /> <br /> Girls wear as little as possible and do not forget the members of the female audience: Bromfield shows a shaving machine with a shaving machine - fetish is this? - bare-chest. He is also shown wet in his swimsuit. <br /> <br /> There is also a real conspiracy: The girl's family, see, is cursed. They are susceptible to suicide - or dramatic deaths that can be considered suicide. The film is not bad. I really do not know where it was shown. Maybe it was made for drives. Somehow, and I was wrong, I felt there was not a typical male audience here. Women are rather dressed. They are often reminiscent of ominous magic covers, such as a police detective, or a tenth-century novel. But the person seems to be the central theme. Not everyone likes the film but all girls love him. And I think it's also an audience. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun - and also of your own words.
