Writers Perry and Randy Howze created a very fun little story in the series "Chances Are." <br /> <br /> Using the idea of ​​a reincarnated man who returns home to his ex-wife after many years, plotting with unexpected, gorgeous turns. <br /> <br /> Twenty-four-year-old Robert Downey, Jr. will make a wonderful performance that is like a widow helping Cybil Shepherd as a widow and Ryan O'Neal as a good friend. <br /> <br /> This trio has just the right chemistry for this drip and plays in an elegant style. I watched this movie several times on TV and it was always the most enjoyable.
