I'm not sure if it's a masterpiece or just a dirty fog that is improved by performance and visuals. Whatever it is, I'm sure I loved it. The amazingly twisted, striding stories, from the deliciously ominous performances by Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone to the lively, cheerful color that's all captured, are top-quality baskets and it's great fun. We do not talk about sexually disturbed and gently sexually covered subtexts that penetrate the whole movie and always risk escaping from the picture into dialogue, but it never does. I would lie if I said that philosophical entertainment is not a benefit to my love for it, but is there any bizarre artwork for an unintentional comedy (or was it?) And I really did dig it. I could really get into the melodrama.
