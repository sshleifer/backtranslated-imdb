Maybe the biggest jazz movie. <br /> <br /> It's JAZZ. <br /> <br /> The initial shot continues in a terrible experience. <br /> <br /> Lester, of course, is great outside of this world. <br /> <br /> Jo Jones is always delighted (see also The Sound of Jazz). <br /> <br /> If you can, find music; this is available on CD. <br /> <br /> All lovers of jazz and film noir should study this huge gem. What shadows and light - what music - what a hat!
