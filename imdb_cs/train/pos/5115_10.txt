I did not see this movie in the theater. I know the Anti-Vinnie Barbarino bias. Who the hell was John Travolta doing movies? I remember sending this Oscar this time, and Travolta looked utterly destroyed when he did not win. How dare it when "real" actors were running? I apologize for John, you should have won. After filming this movie on the cable years ago, I fell in love with the whole movie. Bud, Sissy, Uncle Bob, Wes, all done well. I also admit that I will never succeed when I surf. I have to stop and watch. Over the years, I learned most of the dialogue, dancing my thumb in my waist, and learning to appreciate Travolty more. The only disappointment was that I was overseeing the music of Urban Cowboy. "The film is looking for love" defines the film, but Urban Cowboy was full of classics who did not play on the soundtrack. It should have been a double CD ........
