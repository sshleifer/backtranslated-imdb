I was a fan of Jennifer Connelly from Phenomena, and when I heard seven minutes in the sky, I saw it as soon as possible. The film is not just a comedy if you think that many of these things that most of us have been going through as children and not just a great film under the lead of the phenomenal Jennifer Connelly have attracted my attention that this film was a great director and I acted that it was one good thing I loved and I watched it over and over again and for those of you who like the laughter or love of Jennifer Connelly that you can not postpone to see this movie !!!!
