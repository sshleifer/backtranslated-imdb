On December 28, 1895, the Grand Café in Paris recorded film history, while Louis Lumière showed his posters with short films, all the individual shots. "La Sortie des Usines Lumière" was the first film to play and I wanted to be there to see not only the film but also the audience's response. We begin with the Lumière factory closed door. It seems that because the image looks like a photo, people thought they would just see the presentation, not something they hoped for. But then the door opens and people stand out and head home. First a lot of women, then a couple of men and a man on a bicycle with a big dog. When everyone is shut out again from outside. Whether it is the first film or not (some say that L'Arrive d'un Train à la Ciotat was the first Lumière film recorded), it is an impressive piece of early cinema. Bored for many reasons, almost impossible. One simple reason: it's only fifty seconds. But even for people who normally only like movies with a special effect, something must be interesting; you do not see such historical things as everyday.
