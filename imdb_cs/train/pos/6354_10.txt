Carrey can do anything to them. I thought it would be a stupid childish movie and it was not. it was so incredibly fun for all, adults and children. I saw it once because it was almost out of theaters and now it's finally on DVD to perform this Tuesday and I'm way excited as you see. you should definitely see it, if you have not done it yet, it was so great! <br /> <br /> Liz
