Charming, breathtaking and frightening, this stunningly beautiful film is "Apocalypse Now" without fiction. Slow pace, calm mood, gives good looks to the poisoned spots on Earth that can be signs of inevitable death. There is no doubt in my mind - nature is plagued and we are ill. Greed, the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress, has transformed us into something like cancer, on the way to consuming and dying with the host ... The landscapes produced are a pretty memorable tracking experience - at least I will never look at a toaster and iron again in the same manner.
