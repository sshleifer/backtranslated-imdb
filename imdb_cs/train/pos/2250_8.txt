It is a wonderful film about the struggle of the Mormons and their final settlement in Salt Lake, Utah. The beginning and the end are especially strong and the message is one we all need to remember - God does not speak, but he communicates if we just listen. As I write this amid the horror of going on in New Orleans and around Katrina, I was particularly encouraged by the Mormons having to leave everything and go on when Joseph Smith was murdered. People came to this country to escape religious persecution, yet they could not. The struggle of the Mormons to overcome the earth, the cost of life, the suffering they have suffered, were truly respectable and showed their tremendous power. As for the true beliefs of the Mormons, it is not heavily given, and polygamy is mentioned, but it is not at all central to the film. Cast is top-rated, though others who have commented on more about current practices and could talk about how portraits are true. But as actors, Dean Jagger, Mary Astor, Brian Donlevy, John Carradine, Jane Darwell, they are doing well with the script. <br /> <br /> Although the film could easily stand alone today, Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell were added to cast to get mobs in cinemas to see a movie about Mormons. Strength is beautiful as a young Mormon, and Darnell, like Zina, is not Mormon, but remains with her family after her father is killed. Strength does not have much to do until the end of the movie when it has a big scene, and Darnell (still a teenager at the time of filming) has even less, although they make a beautiful couple. Their fate is left unclear as to its conversion, and one is interested in polygamy in their case. But you can not beat any one for eye candy.
