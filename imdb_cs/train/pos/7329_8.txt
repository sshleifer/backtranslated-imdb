I really enjoyed this movie. Humor was sometimes absent, but I liked how the story moved between dramatic and serious throughout the movie. This is the only second film I've ever seen that Verdone works on (the second was "Un sacco bello") and I see why the Italians find it tedious, but he thinks he played his role well as a loving father. <br /> <br /> My only downside with this movie was that I knew it was in Italy - somewhere in the middle or south, I suppose, but I felt there was no place. This film could take place in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Dehli ... I always think it is important for movies to have a place that has something for the audience to relate to. (Maybe I miss something?) :) If you like Italian movies, then I think you will like it. It's not Fellini or Rossellini - it's not realism or neorealism. It's a comic story with serious moments that could really happen to every one of us.
