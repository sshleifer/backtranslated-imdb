I watched the tape, instantly overturned it, watched her again, and laughed twice. I strongly recommend this tape for those who are not hated, but uncomfortable around the transvestites. It shows you that transvestism is a feature, rather than its whole being. Comedy is not the only problem. This man is great. All comics should strive for a level of freedom, intelligence and talent.
