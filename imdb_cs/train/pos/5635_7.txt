This overview has its sole review. We'll take a weekly TV magazine to find out what's coming, and we'll decide what we're going to follow. There is a brief overview of most of the films to be shown on the five major land-based channels. In addition to prose, each movie is rated 1-5 stars. 5 means Do not miss (over 4 for Excellent!), Up to 1 position for Weak. From the vast experience we have learned that, with the exception of stars, it gives a rough taste, dirty tongue, offensive content, promiscuity, horror, blood and guts, and especially killing the hero / heroine just when everyone is happy to live. (If this is not the case, the film is detested as "predictable" - the worst offense you can imagine!) Brave New Girl received only one star, indicating that she is a candidate worthy of our time and attention. This was confirmed by the description of the film as "a really horrible story" and "stupid, just stupid". We watched it and I and my wife were glad we did. The TV magazine director also said that the film is not a "reworking of war and peace" that we must agree with. When I read IMDb reviews of this title a day or two later, the urge to pick up my pen (so to speak) to add my halfpennyworth (pronounced harf'pen'uth (emphasis on the first syllable) for the unrecognized) has become stunning. <br /> <br /> Why do we get into this movie? Well, it's just a matter of taste. We like attractive characters, trustworthy relationships between them, interesting situations, politeness and respect, good victory over evil, and so on. We enjoyed the integrity and personality of Holly (Lindsey Haun), her mother (Virginia Madsen), Ditze (Barbara Mamabolo), Granta (Nick Roth), Zoe (Joanne Boland) and two male professors. So if the plot involves the "angry witch of the West" in the form of Angela (Barbara Mamabolo), assuming it plays a role with some conviction. We appreciated the friendship portrayed between two friends, one of whom had a financially demanding upbringing to the loving single mother and the other had all the material advantage but brought a little parenting time and affection. Is it surprising that Ditz felt Holly's mum do? Is it surprising that Grant should immediately be interested in Holly with regard to their initial encounter, Holly's brilliant smiles and lively self-ownership? I think these issues and events are plausible, but it is necessary to pretend that the scholarship and other circumstances are realistic so the story can have a place. My wife and I are very blessed by not having a significant musical education. This allows us to enjoy the sounds made by instruments and voices without our critical faculties disrupting our listening experience and thus spoiling our experience. We ran both from classical songs and from pop, which got well on TV and did not suppress our lack of talent. It also did not matter that Holly's classical vocals were nicknamed by someone else. <br /> <br /> We liked the movie so much to see the DVD. The average price we paid for the disc for the films in our collection is currently GBP 4.9484 (rounded to four decimal places). The Brave New Girl was available from a trusted Amazon Marketplace vendor at Â£ 1.3516 (rounded to four decimal places) above this figure. Such a purchase would increase the average. Why not want to stay away from me is a mystery for me, but it is a testimony to our enjoyment of this movie, which we have ordered as well. This movie I appreciated the ten IMDb stars out of ten because I docked one for the enthusiastic reception of theatrical performances, one for the Britney commercial and one for something else I do not remember now. (If it did not fall, this review is an anthem when brackets are used!)
