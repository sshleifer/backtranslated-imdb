Tenchu ​​aka. Hitokiri - directed by Hideo Gosha - played by Shintaro Katsu and Tetsuya NAkadei (along with Goyokin, HAra Kiri & Rebellion) are among the best chambara films. His story about Shintaru Katsu (played by Okada Izo) works for Nakadei, who wants to become a day. Okada, being "cleaner" for Nakadei, feels like a dog - and after some time he realizes - what really is for Nakadei. But there's so much more in this movie - every fan of Japanese cinema should see it !!!!!!! (Tenchu ​​means punishment of heaven)
