This is one of the few cartoons with Bugs Bunny and Marvin Martian - and includes the K-9 Space Dog. This episode of Looney Tunes is very fun, has a good animated animation (Marvin's animation is very good) and the plot is well done. The end is somewhat weird, so prepare it, it's a little boring. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Marvin Martian was sent to the ground to capture the earth creature and bring it back to Mars. With his trusted dog K-9, Marvin sets off and soon finds no trace of another rabbit, but Bugs Bunny! He greets them with delicacies and thinks that their costumes are trick or nursing. Little is aware that they are preparing to take this rabbit to Mars ... I recommend this episode to anyone who likes Bugs Bunny, Marvin Martian and Looney Tunes in general. As for the beginning and the middle of the episode, you will probably like it. Enjoy "Hasty Hare"! :-)
