An unexpected accident that killed an inexperienced climber (Michelle Joyner). Eight months have elapsed ... The Rocky Mountain Rescue Service has received an emergency call by brilliant terrorist champion Eric Quaien (John Lithgow). Quaien has lost three big things that have within millions of dollars. Two experienced climbers Walker (Sylvester Stallone) and Tucker (Micheal Rooker) and helicopter pilot (Janine Turner) are rescued, but are determined by the traps of Quaien and his men. Now both climbers and the pilot are forced to hide and search the deadly game. While Quaien is trying to find millions of dollars and kidnaps Tucker to find the money. Once Tucker finds money, Tucker will be dead. Against explosive power, hot winter and dizzying altitude. Walker has to overcome Quaien to survive. Director Renny Harlin (Driven, Mindhunters, Nightmare on Elm Street 4: Dream Master) created a fun non-stop action picture. This film is a spectacular, exciting, visually exciting action-packed game with plenty of dark humor. This was one of the greatest hits of 1993. It is the best Harlin movie. Lithgow is a wonderful funny villain. Stallone certainly made a short return to this sharp thriller. This is probably Harlin's best job as a filmmaker. The DVD has a sharp anamorphic widescreen transmission (2.35: 1) and amazing Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The DVD has a commentary from Stallone's commentary. The DVD also has a technical commentary from the crew. The DVD has a background scene, two scenes with an introduction from the director and more. Do not miss this great action movie. Scenario Micheal France and actor: Stallone (The Rocky Series). Under the assumption of John Long. Outstanding Cinematography Alex Thomson, B.S.C. (Alien, Demolition Man, Legend). Oscar nominated for Best Sound, Best Sound Editing, and Best Visual Effects. Panavision. (**** / *****).
