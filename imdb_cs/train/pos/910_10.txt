It's nice to see Suraj Barjatya back to what's best in. A story woven around marriage. It's nice to have a movie in which there is no scene you can avoid watching with your family. Although the story is simple and does not contain any new features, you still enjoy the film because of the presentation, the performance, and indeed all the healing. Hats turned to Suraj .. The film is about engagement leading to love. Displaying changes in the way you behave as you engage is excellent. The director definitely gives a lot of thoughts and the actors have done it perfectly. Although the movie is slow, you do not mind it because you are a little interested in the story that you want to continue watching the joy of this new fianc√©e. As a typical RajShree stuff, there are many sentimental scenes that are likely to cause the viewer to fall apart (especially ladies). But when you get out of the cinema, you are very happy and feel that the ticket is worth it :-).
