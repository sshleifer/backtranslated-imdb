I saw this movie in the first few weeks when it was out (I do not remember exactly when.) I thought it was okay for Ben Stiller. This film is not for a man without a good sense of humor. Like most of the jokes of Ben Stiller, you have to think about them. Or, as I said, you have a good sense of humor. I have seen from several people on this website that people have nothing good about it and not a lot of good reviews but I would give him a bigger movie This movie, I thought, was very good and should have a better rating. Maybe this is not a movie for you. I just give you another person's opinion.
