If you have trouble thinking, you can give this movie a low rating. But just realize that this movie was not made to please everyone; <br /> <br /> Only people with humor. <br /> <br /> For these people, the movie is great! He plays old sci-fi movies and radio shows long gone, most witches where B-rated. Along the Space Spaces and Airplane 2 lines, you may have to stretch your imagination a bit to get jokes, but it's worth it.
