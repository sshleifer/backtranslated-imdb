This is one of the few comedies I look at again and again, and I'm still talking aloud. In other places, I read complaints about racism and sexism from sacred, politically correct stripes. It does not exist here unless you define sexism as a woman as a housewife and racism as a family employing a color maid. The lines are fun and all the wires have never been better. Melvin Douglas is especially great. If you ever considered or tried to build a new house, it will be easier for you to know that no matter how furious the process, no matter the wolves, you can feel, you are not alone!
