Like in the sky {SPOILER WARNING) <br /> <br /> It was a great human drama that stimulated my emotions and my imagination. <br /> <br /> This is a parable about the life and death of Christ. Daniel is a talented gifted musician who is physically and mentally exhausted and cared for. When he joins the choir as a cantor, he brings a transformation into the chorus of life, just as Jesus did in the first Palestine. They laugh, start talking openly and truthfully, their mistakes are revealed, they accept each other, they love one another, they become a vital community. It includes a mentally handicapped young man ("Tore"), such is their incarnation. <br /> <br /> Shepherd Stig enjoyed the authority by imposing morose morality on the congregation, and it gradually rejects them. When Stig dismisses Daniel, there is a revolt and Stig is crushed. Stig represents the Jewish authorities of Jesus' Day, whose insistence on obedience to the Jewish law provided a completely new contrast to the new life "the golden rule" brought by Jesus. In one dramatic scene, someone claims that "the Church invented sin". Throughout the film, this contrast between moral and living life (being). In the truth of Christ's story, Daniel is killed by Conny when he defeats him, letting him drown in the river. Another scene, we can hardly believe when the body of Daniel (resurrected!) Is clinging to his room (tombs), which are in white linen cloth (trellis!), Three women (three women kept waking at the foot of the cross in the gospel). Daniel is closely interconnected with Lena, a warm, beautiful young woman who was betrayed by the man she loved and now promiscuous (Jesus created a close relationship with Mary Magdalena-Lena - who was probably a college courtier / prostitute). Through Lenny, Daniel learns to love, something he longed for, and now finds fulfillment. Solo sang by Gabriel composed of Daniel aims to live full of life, unlike moral correctness, which leads to anxiety over sin and what is right and wrong. <br /> <br /> The last scene shows that the choir sings / buzzes in harmony, like a mantra drawing on a large audience, which is an example of harmony and interconnection that is our true human destiny.
