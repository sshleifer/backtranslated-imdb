I have been able to watch several BluRay and HD DVD movies. This movie remains a great action and a great story. Even if you're looking for a movie with a great picture, this is not the case. Failure to use this movie on DVD helped make it easier to buy. I have always enjoyed intense action and excellent acting that is not always done. Overall it makes this great fun movie. Now on the Blu Ray scale. In many Blu Ray movies you get two things. An image that is almost crystal clear without distortion or a film with a grainy HD image. I was disappointed when I made this first blu ray movie. I almost thought it was a standard blu ray. Although I know best after watching other movies. I do not believe they spent as much time as they should convert this movie to HD. This is generally a problem with some movies. And for the price of Blu Ray players and Blue Ray discs, you should only have the best shot. So I consider it a useful investment only for people who have never seen a movie or bought a DVD version.
