Unexpected pleasure because I did not hear anything about this movie. <br /> <br /> It's shameful because it's a wider audience. <br /> <br /> A wonderfully humorous story with a social message gently told, predictable in your resolution. He negotiated firmly with senior officials. Beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against gray, capturing the nostalgic tone of the film. My last glimpse into the Chinese film (Shower, The Way Home, Not One Less) was exciting, which I hope to continue exploring. China and its people are an amazing screen for movie makers. The "King of the Mask" can be highly recommended as the starting point for anyone interested in the recent Chinese film. <br /> <br />
