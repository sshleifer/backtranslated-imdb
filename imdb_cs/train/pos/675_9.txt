While bizarre around David, bizarre weather patterns affect Sydney, such as rain that fools the dirty dirt and hail in the rocks in a clear blue sky (with no landmarks such as the one that hit the school in central Australia), not to mention "deformed "A rainbow that is divided (!) into groups. As David watches the case, he finds that he is closer to the strange events that happen than he ever realized. One native named Chris (David Gulpilil) appears to him in a dream that holds a stone's blood and finds out that this man is one of those to represent in court! He found out that after special encounters with Charlie and interviews with Chris, it is quite possible that he is very well connected with the spirit called Mulkurul and that his dreams are real premonitions of possible horrors. /> Absorbing apocalyptic drama builds its story methodically and is completely original and unpredictable. When Peter Weir is responsible, the film is visually arrested because we see these extremely stunning images of a possible condemnation of civilization, but the most attractive aspect of the film is David's way of finding out that the monumental truth that he's angry about when Charlie and Chris are countless , initially to help his man get out of the crime they committed, and eventually find out what has to do with catastrophic events that happen or may happen later.
