Everyone who saw Mel Gibson's suffering of Christ and was bullied by violence would like to see this film. Although it was not a success in boxing or television ratings, the Fox Film Channel still finds a really good motive to show it annually. I liked that they trained Chris Sarandon and the men who portrayed their pupils to sing in Hebrew. Although Sarandon did not have long hair like other Jesus in other films, his view is quite close to what a Jewish man would appear. What surprised me or surprised me was the scene where Kaifa told Jesus about Pilate "And never forget that you are a Jew!" Though it may not have been a racist note, Colin Blakely tried to make Chris Sarandon look like a waste in the eyes of prominent men of those days. KÃ©ith Michell's portrait of Pilate was enormous, compared to his previous performances in "Tales of Jacob and Joseph" and "The Story of David". But if you compare his portrayal of Pilate with Telly Saval or Hurd Hatfield, you can say that he actually painted the impression of the Roman Prosecutor.
