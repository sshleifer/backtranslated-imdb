Just Cause takes some of the finest parts of the three films, Cape Fear, Touch of Evil and the Silence of the Lambs, and brings them together to come up with a good thriller of the film. Sean Connery is a liberal professor of law, married former assistant district officer Kate Capshaw, and is a crusader against the death penalty. Grandmother Blair Underwood Ruby Dee button connery Connery at the conference and persuades him to handle the appeal of his grandson. Sitting for the death penalty for killing a young girl. When Connery arrives in this rural Florida country, he is against the hard sheriff who plays Laurence Fishburne, who is equally ruthless in her crime as Orson Welles was in contact with evil. <br /> <br /> Later, after Connery gets the verdict of the postponed evidence he reveals, he feels pretty good about himself. At this point, the film decides to turn from Touch of Evil to Cape Fear. <br /> <br /> To say that everything is not as it sounds, it is slightly. Cast changes evenly in some good performances. Special mention must be made of Ed Harris, who plays Hannibal Lecter as a serial killer on death with Underwood. He will carry your skin and he will make Connery reconsider some of the comfortable liberal spaces on which he established his convictions. Many of the confirmed liberals that I learned came from ideas completely differently as soon as they become victims of crime. Of course, the opposite is true. Many conservative laws and orders, if they sometimes engage in the wrong end of the criminal justice system, really want to make sure that all their rights are genuinely guaranteed. Criminal justice is not an end, but a process and never ending for society as a whole. I think if Just Cause has morale, it's probably going to be.
