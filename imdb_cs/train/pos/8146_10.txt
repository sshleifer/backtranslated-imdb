I can not stop saying how much I loved this movie. This film is one of the least known and one of the most funny movies I've ever seen. The film follows the exploits of the NWH rap group (Ni # $% rs with hats). It starts from the beginning of the group to the end of the group, after the tragic decay. The group is documentary producer Nina Blackburn. <br /> <br /> The film is a smart budget, but it does not seem to matter, it's a very well-made, well-produced film and the performances of all these actors and actresses are excellent. The main strength of this movie is writing, there are so many great tracks and races on the film, that's unreal. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br/> <br/> There are takeoffs on real rappes such as MC Slammer, Vanilla Sherbert, Ice Cold, Tone Def, Tastey-Taste and Songs (Booty Juice, Grab Your Dick, .) Rusty Condieff created an excellent movie. The film is played by rapper Ice Cold. The film does not stop, it's fun from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The film works so well because it becomes an unusual casual but strikes the line where it's funny without going too far out. Listening to the three leaders trying to talk some philosophy was one of the best parts of the movie, like Tone Def telling the recording producer, "when you get into the bus, you get there" and the producer reacts? it's deep! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> some of the rap groups at the time of this movie, many rap groups have had problems with violence, censors, and like NWA, the band has become popular only when a great deal of controversial text has begun. <br /> <br /> I like this movie because it's insulting There's something to offend everyone in a good character The film is going to take off a good number of out-rap people, Spike Lee's most amazing creature. I can not imagine the movie has a line along the line that will lead you on the floor as I said before writing is great <br /> <br /> I am not surprised that this film has encountered such a limited release It's intelligent , ko an untransparent and even sophisticated film, which is too much for the mainstream, although it is cheerful and almost flawless in its production. There are no big stars but lots of well-known faces, including Marc Lawrence, who plays Tone Def. Take a look at this movie, at least you will have some opinion.
