Look, this is perhaps one of the best films America has to offer to the rest of the world. Hate this movie is to hate freedom alone. I remember the beginning of the eighties was a period of uncertainty. The economy was weak, communism threatened us all, and nuclear destruction was almost certain. From this turmoil came the hero, Stroker Ace. Production by Ned Beatty in this film has shown that he has never been typified as a one-dimensional victim in the wilderness. His triumph is an inspiration for all. On-screen chemistry between Burt and Loni draws a clear comparison with Brad and Jennifer. Jim Nabors is a poet. Watch this movie tonight!
