One and only was a great movie. I just looked at EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler and I thought it was a good look at what life is like a professional wrestler. Now this film was shot 4 years before I was born, but I do not think unnecessary professional wrestling has changed so much. Sad, funny and all around great! **** 10+
