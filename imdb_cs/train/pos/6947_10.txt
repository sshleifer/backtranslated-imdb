24 is the best TV show !!!!! It's an incredible TV series with incredible tension, great drawings and unforgettable characters. And the first episode of all is my best proof. Because it's just the first episode, just an introduction, and you're bent over conspiracy and continuous twists and turns. Jack Bauer is a federal agent assigned to the protection of Senator David Palmer. He can not trust anyone, because people from CTU can also be involved. And when this event came to his daughter: Kimberly escapes from the house to the party. But ... <br /> <br /> At the end of the episode you will want to watch more and more. <br /> <br /> It's just the first of the games and it's great.
