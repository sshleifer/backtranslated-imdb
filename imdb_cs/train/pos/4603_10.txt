There is one detail that is not very common for Jackie Chan movies but which is present here. He is wearing a very heavy and serious atmosphere, while humorous elements are also present. Jackie is terrible and psychotic. He is not the hero who is attacked and only then backs back (in the usual mode), but he is the one who can go and start upset. His way to get that bad guy into his glasses is amazing. Every time it is "crack!". I'm also especially fond of the scene when Jackie goes to the pub and thrashes the villains who had fronted to his girlfriend. It's one of the best blitzkriegs on the screen. In addition, the whole scene is shot against the background of an action figure painted on the wall (also looks like a poster of "rabochiy" from our Soviet era) and some lines in Russian on the left (I noticed it quite by accident). It looks amazing (and nostalgic for Russian people). I also like when the windows are broken in movies. There are a lot of things here. It's a pretty awesome look at the characters that fall / jump / run / control all kinds of tables. All three movies are great. I was preparing to see the quality picture, but I saw a perfect trilogy of senses and incredible pieces (and not all Jackie Chan's character appears in all three films - that's also excellent and keeps continuity.) <Br /> <br /> I would like to describe just a few words to each film: No.1 - great (in all respects - it's a breathtaking story from the very beginning to the very end) and fun (many scenes are ridiculous); No.2 - Rage (Jackie is really * beep * here) and painful (Jackie gets tortured); No.3 - incredible (the woman who fights along with Jackie is unbelievable) and bombastic (do I mention a lot of weapons and explosions?). As for the others - a lot of others mentioned. <br /> <br /> It's a trilogy that can be watched over and over (at least by me). Her place is in the top 10 among action / comedy jewels. Finally it was released in Russia on DVD (the second film has the best options - Chinese / Russian soundtracks and English / Russian subtitles). <br /> <br /> Solid 10 of 10. Thank you for your attention.
