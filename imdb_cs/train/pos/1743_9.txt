After seeing a lot of Greek movies, I feel very suspicious of most of them. But when I watched it, I felt amazing. The movies are great without a great attempt. You can not say that the script is so great, or the shooting is perfect or something technical. It's a real story and it's happening in Greek rural areas in places forgotten by God. The film is like a stomach in the stomach and I really would not want it to be. He is obviously talking about the xenophobia of the Greek people (ignorance) on something else. The problem with this guy is not that he is a former convict. The problem is, he is not one of these people. He is different and they do not want them (that's why all the good things he does become boomers). And he also talks about the apathy of people because there are some people who are against the king's hunt, but do not dare to express their opinion. Finally, you can clearly see the hypocrisy of a society that is religious, trying to act as God says, but at the same time acting so unfairly toward the king. This shows how easily people rationalize their feelings or their beliefs according to the established system. Finally, you can have a positive lesson from this very bad story, which means you can only understand and be part of this company if you want to become one of them. If you want to remain others and even yourself, you are lost (and it's not far from reality). I think it is tragic that the story is real and it should be a bell for everyone. No comments for the main actor because he was awarded the prize and I believe his game was great. A small commentary for Hatzisavvase (played by a policeman), it's like a dinosaur, played a lot of roles, and I'm sure this role was very easy for him, but he plays so great that you can not deny him a big bravo. I definitely recommend this film to everyone who wants to see a good Greek film.
