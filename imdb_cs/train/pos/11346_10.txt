I grew up with H.R. Pufnstuff and talented Jack Wild, and now my daughters also adore Jack Wild. This movie is exactly what the movies should be: fun and fun. This film is not limited to children. Many dialogues are adult-oriented and Witchiepoo's performance is something you do not want to miss. The music in this movie was perfect for Jack Wild and Mama Cass. And as a fan of Jack Wild, I would never have realized the ability to watch her dancing or hearing as she sings. Knowing the hard life Jack now makes this movie even more amazing, singing the opening song "If I Could." It makes me stop in loving adoration, because it gives me wonderful children's memories that I now pass on to my children. Let's all go to a lively island where friendship and fun! And keep Jack Wild's memory alive by passing Pufnstuff to others.
