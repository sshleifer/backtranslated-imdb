I saw this movie happiness just because I was going through the stage when I found a new admiration for Bill Pullman and wanted to see all his recent films and thank God I did it! This movie is stuck with me from here and remains one of my favorites! The story revolves around two girls who embark on a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they learn the true meaning of freedom. Alice and Darlene have tried to spend their holiday together before going to college, but their journey ended in a much more complicated story. The struggles that go through when arrested in Thailand and become prisoners are very moving and intense. It performs amazing, extraordinary images, soundtrack is fantastic and so right for the movie and the message transferred is definitely strong. I can not find the right words to describe how this movie feels every time I look at it. I know some people have not rated me very much, but I swear, this one, you have to see !!! I promise to stick with you!
