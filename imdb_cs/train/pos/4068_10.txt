breathtaking, this is undoubtedly the best anime cartoon ever made. For the first time I saw the castle in the sky in the late 1980s as a child and left a lasting impression. years went by and I forgot the title of the film and I just found it again when I browse the internet. after reading reviews and analyzes of other nations, I am not surprised to have such recognition and touched so many people, because it leaves an impression. a real fantastic adventure must be seen for all children and adults. the best does not give the story away, so I would say watching this movie will be a clear and open mind. if you have kids treat them with this I promise they will love. there is not much to say about this artwork, but if you have not seen it, look at it and enjoy it.
