CREEP is a direct, serious, real-time horror film that wants nothing more than to show that people have invaded an empty 85-minute underground mutant platform. That's what he's doing. Nothing more. Director Christopher Smith draws the drama as far as possible by introducing a number of characters who should have reason to stay in the meter after lockout. It also leaves the originally unclear beginnings of the Creep title (illustrating illegal experiments that occur in the 1960s underground), and for the most part works a little mystery. Unfortunately, it is undermined towards the end by actually being held back by a twist when more genetic malformations appear (they are also indicated). Yes, you heard me right - I wanted to end the ending clich√©! RUN (RUN LOLA RUN) Potente is good as a terrorized female lead and the rest of the cast is fine.
