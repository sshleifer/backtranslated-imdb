I loved the story. Somewhere the poster said there are no families like the one in the movie. Well, maybe it should be. I thought everyone looked really human and credible. Best cast. What a great soundtrack music. What's nice and what's nice, but I'm going to say two words that will recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell. , the fine depth that touched me. He was really a commanding widow who might have been a little too preoccupied to be a good dad first, at the expense of denying his own needs. Did he look like a fleeting butt? Why, yes. And you see, it was the best movie. The actor who played this character believed me to feel something, not just as if he felt something, and gave me perfectly what it was that he felt and what he felt was denied. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He refused to meet. <br /> <br /> He refused love. <br /> <br /> The loss of your love is painful without conviction, and many of those who do it will never feel that way. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie. I gave him eight out of ten.
