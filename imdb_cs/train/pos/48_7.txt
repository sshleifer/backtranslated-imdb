I'm from Belgium, so my English song is bad, I'm sorry for it ... It's one of those little-known movies that only plays once on TV and it seems. I went through my old collection of VHS videos and I came across this title, I looked at it and had an IMDb score of over 7/10, that's pretty decent. I have to admit it's a very well-composed movie and that's why I'm confused. Is this the only film of this director ...? Why did not he do a lot of movies after this very good ...? Someone with such great potential should be forced to do another movie, ha ha ;-) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I really would like to see he pulls his act together and makes another good movie like this, please .... .
