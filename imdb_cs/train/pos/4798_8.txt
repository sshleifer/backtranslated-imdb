This is not a movie for fans of the usual mysterious Lynch. Rather it is for those who either appreciate a good story or are tired of what is happening with open sentiment and Oprah-ish "This is such a wonderful movie! You have to see it!" - the semantics is true, once!) The story grows ruthlessly and we are guided by the way I believe most of us will suddenly come to know. The sympathetic, existentialist way in which we change for our past as we approach our inevitable resignation. <br /> <br /> It's free of error, cinematography (occasionally perfectly brilliant!) And dialogue leaves the viewer enough to grasp details of the story. <br /> <br /> Warm film. Not overly sentimental.
