Comedy-drama "Offside" Jafar Panahi portrays some women trying to enter the Tehran sports arena where women are forbidden. The official reason: a lot of dirty language and footballers have their feet. But of course it is the case of sexism. So most of the film consists of a slight comic relief when women try to ask men serious questions about why women are banned from the stadium and one woman even comes up with her own plan to stand up against men. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> As I understand, all Jafar Panahi films (including this one) are forbidden in Iran. The real tragedy is that the overthrow of the CIA Prime Minister in 1953 and the subsequent support of the brutal Shah gave Ayatollah Chomeini an excuse to use his narrow interpretation of the Qur'an to establish chauvinist society, and that the current policy of George W. Bush over Iran gives Mahmoud Ahmadinejad an excuse to " to deal with cowboy and tighten censorship. First of all, it is a look at people who come up with ways to attack the system. It's not a great movie, but it's worth seeing. Since all Jafar Panahi films are forbidden, I wonder how they can even make them.
