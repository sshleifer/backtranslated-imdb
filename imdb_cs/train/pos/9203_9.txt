This is one of Dev Anand's films that made great but distinct films by Hindu film industry areas such as Jewel Thief and Wizard. The story is short (if you ask me what the story is), the story is plain - the brother is looking for his lost sister. The sister joined the hippies who smoke from the pot and sing Hare Rama the Rabbit Rabbit. The film, however, shows only some of the significant events that the world experienced in the 1970s. Hippie cultures, their submission to drugs, freedom, escape from duty, family, and accepting something new, such as the Eastern religion (which was new to the white). They were processed perfectly. Zeenat gave her the best, and Dev, as usual, was remarkable. Songs are best used in this movie (as opposed to being abused for composition). They were not spoiled. One perfect example is "Dekho o deewano ... Ram kaam naam badnam na karo". Every word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful. The end is tragic, but it is not the essence of the movie. Overall, Devja, who believes in filming various films, has shown what he wants to show here. He must see the hippie culture and beautiful Nepal from the 70s.
