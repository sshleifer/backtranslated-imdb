I first saw this movie when it was released in the US in 1984. Since then I have seen it many times. What puts me in the film is incorporating the art of testing into the life of characters and visas. Throughout the film, both of them intertwine and sometimes they are never quite sure whether we look at the lives of the characters or the training scene. It goes on until the climax of the movie. All these years later, my friends and I still like to debate whether Carmen is actually punctured at the end. From the reactions of other figures to the stylized murder, there is an open debate. The passion of dance, the quality of acting, the love of art, and the brilliance of the performance combine to create a great film that once again connects and shakes the boundaries of life and art.
