We find some things first: Zombies do not exist, so the filmmaker can have WALK, RUN, hell and FLY if he wants to. This is what makes this original Zombie movie so good. Everything they did was so original. I hate it when filmmakers do everything like Romero or when fans expect everything like Romero. Some idiots think that zombies should just crook as a typical Romero movie, again zombies do not exist, so the filmmaker can zombie whistles if he wants to. Zombies in this movie look very good, but SHOW they are not dead because JUST has fallen! They are quite panicked and full of crushed cheeks and blood. One of the most beautiful scenes was the half-called cat. It looked so damn damn my daughter was screaming when she saw it. This movie got really good reviews at Fangoria and Rue Morgue so I wanted to see it. I'm glad I listened. They are always right when it comes to the taste of a real horror fan. 10 out of 10! Go rent it!
