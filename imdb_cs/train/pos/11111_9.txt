Soprano is perhaps the most serials you could ever want to watch. It's smart, it's odd, it's funny - and it carries the mafia so well that most people can not resist watching. The best aspect of this show is the stunning realism of the characters found in the underground world of criminal families in New York. Most of the time you really do not know if wise guys will punch someone on your back or buy them. <br /> <br /> Another realistic character at this show is the depth of their personalities - these are dangerous men, most of them killers, but God too if you do not like them. I laughed at their scams, I was torn off when they were mistaken in judgment, and they feared the fear of the utter ignorance of a serious criminal. <br /> <br /> The suburban setting of New Jersey is absolutely perfect for this subtext - people are not always as it seems, and the strong contrast between humor and action that these seemingly minor criminals weighed up to a few days of probability. <br /> <br /> If you have not done so yet, you should definitely.
