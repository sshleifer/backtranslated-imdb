Well, if you're one of those Katan's nuts (like me), you'll definitely appreciate this metaphysical Katana's swinging blood that's on the Samurai action scene. Cast: Tadanobu Asano (Vital, Barren Illusion) & Ryu Daisuke (Kagemusha). This Samurai war between the Heiki clan and the Genjian clan touches the zenith in the final duel on the Gojo Bridge. The number of bodies is countless. <br /> <br /> Demons, magic swords, Shinto priests versus Buddhist monks and beautiful visions provided by master Sogo Ishii will do the rest. go on a rainy summer night.
