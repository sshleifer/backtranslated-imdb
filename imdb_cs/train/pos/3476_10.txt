Let's go to the pursuit: If you are a baby boomer, you have inevitably spent some time thinking about the fact that McCartney in 1976 let fall into the life of John's Hermit and spend the day with him. You certainly also figured out how it was. I have heard exactly the same news that the writer of this film has heard from John and Paul, and I admit that I reconstructed the meeting almost like the movie. But none of my ideas could buy tears like this incredible work and acting. I found it incredibly realistic, perfectly credible and 100% free of saccharin. Now, can anyone explain why I did not hear about this championship before it showed CBC last night? I have been thinking for three years now, for the good. And yes, if you're a fan of the Beatles, it's a must! Even the soft paraphrase of Beatles' melodies in the background is inspired.
