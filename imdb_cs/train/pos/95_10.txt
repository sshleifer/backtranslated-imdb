yes, I have a copy of VHS uncut in great condition that I have converted to DVD and if anyone wants to bring back memories of Christmas classics please emil me at dmd2222@verizon.net.i looking everywhere and I did not find anything on this and I thought, I can not be the only one on this planet that has this classic on the tape there must be other people and if I fit with them it's very little that it has this classic so I consider myself luck and I have all the Christmas muppets except, that John denver did with the mumbles again I think his called smokey mountain holiday im not sure but his close.
