Street Fight is a great piece of brutal satire. It's not a movie you're just watching. It's not a nice experience, though it has some laugh-out-loud moments. This is the movie you watch when you need food. <br /> <br /> To dismiss this film as simply racist, it is totally missing. It's not just a satire of songs in the south, it's also biting comments on prejudice that Americans still have as a society. Each ethnic group depicted in the film appears to be a grotesque cartoon of their stereotypes, which are in turn grotesque caricatures of real people. Through this wild exaggeration, the filmmaker proves how truly absurd these convincing beliefs are. If you are such a person who is willing to acknowledge the ugliness of the predominant prejudices that American culture still holds, and if you are not afraid to look at your prejudice in the eye, this movie may be for you.
