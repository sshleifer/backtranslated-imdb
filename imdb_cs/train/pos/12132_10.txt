It is pleasant despite the performance of Leslie Howard. Mr. Howard plays Philip as a flat, uninteresting character. One should have sadness for this man; but I like Bette Davis' Mildred. Mrs. Davis gives her best performance (she has been nominated for the Oscar). Thanks to her performance, this rather boring film brings to life. ** Make sure you do not miss when Mildred tells him exactly how he feels about it.
