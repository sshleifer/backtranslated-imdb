I definitely disagree with anyone who could release this film as "just" fun. He stays right after a carefree, 20-year-old storm, in the early days of the Great Depression, Dance, Fools, Dance is a serious warning story in the heart with a clear message on how best to endure these difficult times. Still, this fast paced and film film is by far the smallest story about morals. In the 1930s Hollywood had the talent to break out of one funny * all without losing the frame of the film. Dance, Fools, Dance - one of four films made by Harry Beaumont in 1931 - is barely 80 minutes long, but his characters are well-developed, his story never seems submerged, and despite the many twists and turns, the audience will never stay. <br /> <br /> With the exception of Lester Vail as a kind love of interest by Bob Townsend, supporting actors is consistently strong. Worth mentioning is William Bakewell as Crawford's brother Cliff Edwards (best known as Jiminy Cricket) as reporter Bert Scranton and Clark Gable in an early supporting role as a gangster Jake Luva. is Joan Crawford's movie, and she's absolutely shining. When she was only 27 years old, this lesser-known version of Crawford is likely to be unforgettable for those who later become acquainted with her. However, there is evidence that long before taking Oskar home for Mildred Pierce, Crawford was a star in the true sense, a stunning actress with charisma to paint the picture itself. <br /> <br /> Score: eight out of TEN
