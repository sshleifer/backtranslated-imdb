I remember this movie. Very intense for 11 years. Good Editing, I felt terrible for St. Bernard. I would be looking at it again if it was broadcast again, but the signal floated on Pluto when I wrote it. Robert Culp. Around his career. I'm glad I did not get around. The 70 years. What about ten years. If it comes back, I bet it would be very violent and bloody. So what are they waiting for? Great film for pre-pubertal suburban boys. It was very intense. I think it was shot in Los Angeles. Surely not in Lodi NJ. Shot with St. Bernard was the best and probably the most penetrating picture of the movie ... and then left the skeleton on his back. Poor children.
