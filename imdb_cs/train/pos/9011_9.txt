I found this movie by accident, but I'm happy to have done it. Performance Kenneth Branagh approached the theft of this film by Helena Bonham Carter, but their strong chemistry together brought a much more entertaining film. This film brought great films that Branagh made with Emma Thompson. The carter star has gone wrong because the young women with disabilities that are trying to finish were just as good as I have seen a long time ago for women's leadership. It's hard to portray a person with a disability, but basically just her eyes to show her her pain about her life situation has made it so credible. If this movie came out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women who are "ugly" on the roles (Charlize Theron, Halle Berry), I'm sure Carter would have a strong focus on the Oscar. If you come up with the cable late at night, believe me, it's worth a sleep.
