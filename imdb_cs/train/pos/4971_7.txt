It's an absurd dark comedy from Belgium. Beno√Æt Poelvoorde (Man Bites Dog) is famously shot in black and white and is in fine form as Roger, the angry and obsessive father of the family in a small, dull Belgian mining town. Roger is a photographer who, along with his young daughter Luise, visits a traffic accident to take photos. He is also obsessed with winning a competition in which a competitor must overcome the record - and decides that his son Michel must attempt to overcome the record of constantly crawling through the door - even hires an overweight trainer to train him. Michel is dressed as Elvis and has a place on the radio show "Cinema Lies," where he describes bugs in movies. Luise is friendly with his close neighbor Felix, the pigeon. Roger is a nasty figure when Michel crosses the border during a record attempt, almost resulting in his death. Surrealist images of the Magritte type are scattered throughout the film. It is undoubtedly charming and worth it.
