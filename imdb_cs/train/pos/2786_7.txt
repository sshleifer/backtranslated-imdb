What surprised me most about this film was just the audience that attracted her. Similar films, such as Anita and I, have never done so many hype as this movie, although I think it's probably more than anything else to mention the Beckham title. It's a brilliant film that brings you a brilliant message - you can do anything if you are strong enough to think about what is a positive message for anyone watching this movie. I think it's one of Keira Knightley's best movies and I think she's a great actress and she's great for this role. Parminder Nagra was also great. Unfortunately, I can not say Jonathan Rhys-Meyers because I do not think he's a very good actor, and to be honest, his eyes were a little scary. <br /> <br /> Overall, a brilliant movie and a great story
