This is one of the films that are improving each time you see them. It's packed with so many original and unconventional ideas that you'll always find in new detail. As in the following Saba films (I have not seen "an unfortunate monkey yet, but the others are so great), failure, coincidence and humanism play a big role. Cutting and assembly is inventive and artistic without the film being artistic but very entertaining. When compared to "Run, Lola, Run", it must be remembered that "Dangan Ranna" arose a few years ago and appeared on German TV in 1997 ... so it's more likely that it inspired Tom Tykwer's film, and not vice versa. As a supplement to other reviews, I must add that I like acting and ending very much. This movie is a lot of fun in many ways and can deliver the message without being unpleasant or demanding.
