The very funny film in the East meets the West, which was influenced by the closure of GM Flint, the Michigan race in the 1980s and the rise and integration of Japanese cars in the US. Based in the western part of Pennsylvania, it features great performances by Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe and George Wendt. Music by Stevie Ray Vaughan's blues legend.
