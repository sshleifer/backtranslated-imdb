You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, is constantly shooting at his feet with all the stupid comedies he has done in this decade (possibly with the exception of "Death To Smoochy" which he bombed when he came out, but now is a cult classic). The drama he has done recently has been fantastic, especially "Insomnia" and "One Hour Photo". "The Night Listener", despite the average reviews and quick release of the DVD, is one of his best works. This is a very cool story, although it does not contain a serial killer or someone else that is physically dangerous. The concept of the film is based on a real fraud case that has not yet been officially confirmed. In high school, I read an autobiography of a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered from terrible misuse and ultimately an AIDS treaty. I was touched by the story until I read the online news that Johnson may not really exist. When I saw this movie, the confused feelings that Robin Williams so perfectly portrayed appeared in my mind again. Toni Collette is probably giving her best dramatic performance as ultimately a sociopathic "manager". Her role was far from those she had in Little Miss Sunshine. She looked for a moment at the camera where I thought she was looking at me directly. She is a good actress who plays such a role, and this is an underestimated (yet well-considered) role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation who has not even been nominated for the Academy Award (since 2008). It is unbelievable that there is at least one woman in this world who is such, and it is also scary. This is a good, dark movie that I highly recommend. But be prepared to be anxious because this movie is a strange feeling in the end.
