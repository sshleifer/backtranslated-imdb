It's as if movies have no value in themselves, it's a great way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to reading it. In the summer of 1968 I saw a movie in NYC; who are in the postgraduate school, I read the book for the first time. Some of the pleasure in reading the novel was my memories of a precisely detailed film. And for better or worse - and now I read and taught the novel for more than three decades - Milo O'Shea is still Leopold Bloom.
