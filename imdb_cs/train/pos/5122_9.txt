# 3 in John Travolty's trilogy about jerks. They dance to disco, rock 'n' roll and country. He returns to Houston to find work and love. Gilley is a hot spot and it's a mechanical bull's time. To be overcome, I went to a bull at a club in Nashville. I recently saw this almost forgotten movie on TV and I remembered how good it was and how good a 1980 was. I wore a black cowboy hat that year just like Travolta. Debra Winger was at her top. It looks stunning in its red top. There is a lot of charisma. Bud and Sissy seem to be the ideal pair, even if they are waste bins. It's split up just because they feel so good they're back together. Urban Cowboy has an amazing soundtrack. We hear Lynne's eyes Eagles and we are looking for love Johnny Lee.
