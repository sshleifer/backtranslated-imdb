From the introductory scene on board the crowded train, where the rhinestone pocket (RICHARD WIDMARK) that walks out of a woman's handbag (JEAN PETERS) is PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET incredibly fascinating to watch. This is partly due to the fact that the cast is evenly strong, the black and white photographs are sharp and add to the horror of the story and characters, and because Samuel Fuller's direction puts him in the same biggie league as John (ASPHALT JUNGLE) Huston. In fact, he has the same urgency as Huston's film about a robbery that goes wrong - but the payoff is not so strong. JEAN PETERS is great as a hard-faced girl whom Widmark describes as "a lot of knocking." She gives a lot of raw energy and sexual attraction to her role as a not-too-bright woman carrying a micro-film in her boyfriend's handbag (RICHARD KILEY), something the FBI already knows about, on her way when theft occurs. THELMA RITTER brings a realistic portrait of a woman called "Moe," who buys and sells anything to earn, and eventually spends her life for her. Especially touches her in the last scene with Kiley. <br /> <br /> This ensures that he gets his attention within one hour and twenty minutes of running. Good noir from Fox and remarkable for performances by Widmark, Peters and Ritter.
