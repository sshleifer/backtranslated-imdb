The Sarah Silverman program is ... better than the other shows. No laughter, no painful jokes, just a program. Sarah Silverman program. If you are like me, and you like comedy, it's probably a show for you. Sarah Silverman brings a very funny, and here - funny to the table. A mixture of different styles he does for himself. <br /> <br /> This program is not something you want to start comparing the war, because it has nothing to do with it (another show). This show is her own entity and I think most comedy heads will like it. <br /> <br /> Go look and see.
