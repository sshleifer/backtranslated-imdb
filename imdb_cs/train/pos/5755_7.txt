It's a pretty strange movie. It appears as an exploitative film with supernatural violence and unrealistic situations, but unusual that it is built around rural characters in war between themselves, unlike the invasion of "another." <br /> <br /> The film is an exaggerated stereotype of Vietnamese veterans in a long line of films that depicted veterans of this war as dangerous psycopathy. The last line of Kris Kristofferson is "I'm Still Not Lost War" when he meets his demise after a long murder and destruction journey, including the police chief of the city and his brother's girlfriend on a particularly cold scene. However, Kristofferson is a good enough actor and sufficiently charismatic to be able to do this with a surprising depth. Vincent is obviously a golden boy, but with sufficient intensity that is covered by his pure carving. The film has some similarity to Winchester 73, where Jimmy Stewart tries to tolerate the criminal brother until he is forced to act against him. The film has a b-movie degree of action, though the presence of Kristofferson, Vincent, the gorgeous Victoria Principal and Bernadette Peters give it an A-grade lineup. I give her 7 for being a long-lost look at the American psyche of post-Vietnam introspection / pre-Reagan, paranoia, confusion, and the film industry that was willing to solve such issues at the time. <br /> <br /> Looking at this channel is a great network that plays a lot of old movies from the 70s to 90s, regardless of political bending.
