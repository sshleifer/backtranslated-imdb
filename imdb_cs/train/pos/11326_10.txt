I watched the first 17 episodes and this series is just amazing! I did not care about anime series from Neon Genesis Evangelion. This series really is based on h-game, which I'm not sure if it was done before or not, I did not play, but it's very good from what I heard. <br /> <br /> I am giving this series 10/10. He has a great story, interesting characters and some of the best animations I've ever seen. It also has some great Japanese music! <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this series, look at it. Some anime pages are found there, it's right from Japan.
