Before George Clooney directed Sam Rockwell in his directorial debut "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," they played together in this film. George Clooney has also starred in this film as a producer alongside Steven Soderberg, which shows that they really believed this project. In Potential it also looks like a gentle and fun project that is in line with movie remakes such as "Ocean's Eleven" and "Italian Work", but in some ways this film is only half of the success or at least it's not how it could be . A film whose characters are all played by some well-known actors, but the shame is that the characters are not really enough room for development. Even though their potential has changed into fun and entertaining characters, they are now just characters who have fun, because they are mostly some of the most strange sequences in the movie. The fact that they are playing does not change much, even though they prevent their characters from becoming totally or even unpleasant or even at all. <br /> <br /> It is of course because of writing that characters are not used to full potential. I can only assume that the original Italian film "I Soliti ignoti" works much better than this film does. The film relies too much on its simple story and predictable way to tell stories. However, the film is simply still very entertaining, which can be tracked perhaps due to the same simplicity. It's a harmless little capers movie in which you just should not worry about the story. In this respect, "Welcome to Collinwood" is still a movie that works and serves only its purpose. It's a movie that you will not regret once you finish it, but it is also a movie that you can really do without ever seeing it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
