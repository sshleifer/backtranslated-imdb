I first saw this movie when I was eight years old on TV in the UK (called "Laupta: The Flying Island"). I loved it completely and it was interrupted when it was repeated for a while and I missed it. I was fascinated by the story and the characters, but especially the amazing and beautiful music. It was the original English dubbed version, which I sometimes mistakenly called "Streamline Dub" (the oak was actually Ghibli itself and only Streamline distributed), which is sadly inaccessible except that it is part of a nonsensically expensive laser box-set. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I feel that the release was partially corrupted by Disney. Voice control is fine, but the dialogue does not have the same raw material as the "simplified" oak or the original Japanese, and I think James Van Der Beek is too old to play the leader. They have made some unnecessary changes, such as changing the name of the main character from "Paz" to "Patz" and adding some dialogue. The worst of all, however, I felt it destroyed many distracting music scenes - the initial airship scene was originally silent but was corrupted by Disney's moral need to play music whenever nobody talks what I find in many movies Disney is unpleasant. The film still blows the latest animated movies and I can not recommend it so much. The story is simple, but appealing, and the film shows the taste that unfortunately is missing from most modern mass markets, homogenized animations.
