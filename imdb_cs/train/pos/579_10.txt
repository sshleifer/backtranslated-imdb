In my humble opinion, this film has not received the recognition it deserves. Robert Redford lives with me here in Provo, Utah, on Sundance. I enjoy most of my work and it was my favorite. I'm sorry that more people did not notice it. My grandmother was a passionate reader and read the book for years before she came out on a big screen. She told me to read when we saw the movie together. The film and the book hit an emotional place inside my heart and I cried a few days after I saw the movie. Sometimes love is not enough to prevent our loved ones from wounding. We see this in our family relationships, yet our love and our families and their stories will last for generations of time. The cinematography was perfect and amazing - I was amazed by my beauty and how good it brought the words of author Norman Maclean: "But when I am alone in the middle of the canyon light, it seems to me to disappear to the being with my soul and memories and the sounds of a great river Black legs and a rhythm with four counts and the hope that the fish will rise, and finally the river is cut through the great flood of the world and it passes through rocks from the basement of time, some rocks are timeless raindrops, under the rocks are words and some of them are theirs. "These words, taken from the book and spoken at the end of the film (Robert Redford, who talks as Norman Maclean), are, in my view, essentially written. Any possible shortcomings that the film may have are overshadowed by the beauty and grace of the story and the cinema. It was beautiful!
