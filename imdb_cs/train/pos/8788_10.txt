Well, I'm delighted to hear the reputation that it will eventually be released on DVD. When it happens, I do not know, but I'm gonna get him when he's released. In my humble opinion, this is the most entertaining film by Errol Flynn, especially when the career of "Gentleman Jim" Corbett begins with the film. Then it goes from a good movie to a great movie. Few people could play arrogant men, and yet it would seem like a good-looking guy just like Flynn, and this movie is a perfect example of that. It's supposed to be Flynn's favorite role, and I believe that. You can just feel how much fun he has here. Ward Bond also seems to be enjoying his role playing the famous John L. Sullivan. Bond has never been better. <br /> <br /> There is just the right amount of action boxing scenes and here they are pretty well done. Corbett's family is also fun to watch when they meet in the stands in Jim's matches. Out of the arena, constant arguments and screaming on Corbett's family may be a bit too loud and annoying, but they have a pretty good conclusion. And when he talked about the conclusion, Sullivan's speech at Corbett after the big fight is very touchy and top of the film. Some bad critics (for example, Variety) did not like this ending, nor the fact that most of the film is fictitious, but - duh - most of the films are fictitious as it is or not. And in this case it was a nice story and a nice ending. (In real life, Corbett was a fine gentleman, not a Flynn picture, but Flynn is still a good guy.) This is one of the funniest classic movies I've ever watched and I eagerly await the DVD.
