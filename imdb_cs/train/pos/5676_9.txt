SERIES THREE BLACKADDER THE THIRD "If you want to do something right, kill Baldrick before you start" Hot on the heels of the second show series returned with the current owner of the famous name down to his luck and in operation as the Prince Regent butler, a vain and silly foe for poison Blackadders played by Hugh Laurie. Baldrick is still dragged as another piece of comic jigsaw puzzle. The format is similar to the previous show, eventually finding a winning formula for changing things. We see Blackadder trying to get rich from the back of a trusted ruler in more sophisticated ways, trying to make Bladricka M.P. or trying to tear off a suitable bride for the prince. In many respects, it is one of the most accurate series historically, the prince regent assumed control of the throne during his father's madness, and some of the characters who sounded said much about the times. Samuel Johnson, William Pit, and Wellington are all going through events and everyone has managed to steal their scenes, not an easy thing with so stellar occupation
