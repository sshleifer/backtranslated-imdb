I had no expectations; I never heard of Jamie Foxx; all I knew was that the movie had some strong characters in it. I thought it was very fun; it was fun. This conspiracy was different and unpredictable to keep me interested. For me, Foxx is the original. David Morse is amazing (true, this is not his best role). I thought the hunts and pyrotechnics contributed to the movie and were well done. I did not expect much and I was happy to be surprised.
