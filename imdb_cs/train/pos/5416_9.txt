I only saw it once. It happened in 1952, I was seven, in film 13. We were so young ... But for ever I kept thinking about the strong moments of Gung's victim. <br /> <br /> I realized how long humanity is hardly presented and used by a foreign nation. Under these historical circumstances in the film, the personal relationship of friendship is a kind of friendship that is ignored, and among people who share everyday life who see faces who know each other's names but belong to different worlds, only. In the most critical moments a disturbing question arises: "Who are we, first, to be faithful?" Which people, family, patriot, person you know near you? You do not have time to give a perfect answer, the urgency is there and it is for life or death. Gunga-Din gives her answer by sacrificing herself. Sometimes we are confused with the problem, the emotion grows with the rhythm of the film until someone dies, only one life, nothing compared to many other fictions or facts we see today, because this death, this unique, miserable Life I lived, I shared with a child of unconditional friendship. He was the pupil of the spectator. That day I lost Gunga-Din forever. As I left later, my pretty childhood when I left so many worlds I lived in. I left it all for good, and these lines are a short visit today that I did not expect to do in the morning when I got up.
