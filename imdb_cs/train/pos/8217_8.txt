With this film, the only Dirty Harry movie that Clint Eastwood not only stars, but also produces and controls, you know it must be good. Although some say that The Enforcer is the best of the series, I totally disagree. In my opinion, apart from the original Dirty Harry, Sudden Impact, and Magnum Force, they are only two worthy of being in the show. Although Enforcer is a good movie with several good action sequences, it does not get the dirty and nice impact the other three movies do. This film captures all the excitement that makes Clint Eastwood good, and has quotes that make Dirty Harry good movies. In Dirry Harry it's "yeah, punk?"; in Magnum Force, "One knows his limitations"; and in that it's "Go on, do your day." Also in this movie, it's nice to see a change of scenery, as it gets a bit tired of seeing the same old San Fransisco Street in other movies of the series. With Clint Eastwood's excellent acting performance with Sandra Locke and good director Clint, I think it's Dirty Harry's best sequel.
