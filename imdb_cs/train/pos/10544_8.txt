Well, "Cube" (1997), the first film of Vincenzo, was one of the most interesting and complicated ideas I've ever seen when I was talking about movies. They had only one scenery, a bunch of actors and a conspiracy. So what was so extraordinary was all effective directions, great dialogues, and bizarre conditions that the characters had to deal with as a labyrinth in rats. His second film, "Cypher" (2002), was all about his story, but it was not as good as "Cube," but here are the characteristics tested as rats again. "Nothing" is something very interesting and Vincenzo returns to his "Cub Days", blocking the characters again in a very different space, without playing again with characters like playing with rats in the test room. But instead of the sci-fi thriller (even some of the promotional stories and trailers seemed to be like that), "nothing" is not a free and light comedy that can certainly be called a modern satire about our society, and also about the intolerant world we live in. Again, Vicenzo surprises us with the big idea of ​​such a small thing. 2 actors and blinding white scripts, that's all you have most of the time and you do not need more than that. While "Cube" is a claustrophobic experience and "Cypher" is confusing, "Nothing" is not exactly the opposite but also desperate. This film again proves that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget. Of course, the movie sometimes fails, but its main idea means a lot and balances any shortcomings. There's nothing more about this movie, because everything is a great surprise and a whole new experience I've had in Cube movies.
