This film recalls in many ways the "Enemy of the State," with Will Smith and Gene Hackman, because we have an innocent (black) man who pursues "government" with all the modern technologies that one knows. Usually, when the script is copied, it is the result of a disaster. This is not the case here. Of course I love everything David Morse does, so maybe my notes are not fair, but this movie was more good stuff. The main enemy game played by Doug Hutchison was great and the story was a great addition to David Paymer and Robert Pastorelli. Our hero, Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Foxx), however, was an irritating majority in part. He is so helpless, he makes bad jokes, and he does not make any sympathy for the audience. Or do not start, it's strange to grow up on you (and also to followers!). I did not expect much when I lent them, but I was surprised by a good solid action movie with comic bits. 7/10
