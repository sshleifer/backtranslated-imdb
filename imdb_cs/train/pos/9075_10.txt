I missed most of the first season, but when the other shows went on to repeat, I started watching. Finally I bought the whole first season off iTunes. This is now one of my favorite comic performances. Patrick Warburton is the key. His dry sense of humor keeps turning me. David Spade is funny but sometimes Russell goes far. I like other cast members (but do not say they do not add to the show). <br /> <br /> Make a favor. If you have not tried it, try it out. If you can capture the episode where "Jeff" goes to the sperm, you'll see how good this is. <br /> <br /> I hope this series has a long way to go.
