This is, in my view, a very good film, especially for lovers of Michael Jackson. It contains a report on drugs, amazing special effects and amazing music videos. The main film focuses on the song and music video "Smooth Criminal". Unlike a four-minute music video, it's normal speed and, in my view, it's much easier to watch. The plot is rather weird. Michael Jackson plays a magical "gangster" that shoots the star at the star. Throughout the movie, it transforms into a racing car, a giant robot, and a spacecraft. Especially the robot scene is rather tedious and strange. I've found it to be somewhat unnecessary compared to the rest of the movie. The child is kidnapped, Michael is trying to save her, tortured and hurt, and suddenly she turns into a giant robot that blows up all the bad guys. A little weird? Yeah. But in addition to the bizarre robot scene, it's a very good movie and every Michael Jackson fan will enjoy both the Smooth Criminal music video and the movie.
