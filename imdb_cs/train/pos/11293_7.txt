William Wyler was supposed to steer this adaptation of Mossa Map on Broadway with a musical / recruit placard, but his own military engagements hit and went to the most likely helmsman George Cukor. The "female director" has a touch on many documentary sequences of airborne training and invests them into more unlimited humanity than the genre that is generally allowed, especially in the war. Surely, a fool (and a whiter one, with the exception of one unbalanced Chinese-American recruitment), many newcomers are nicer and healthier than real-life, and the talk about home and mother and wife and guys becomes quite strong, but it's effective propaganda and no doubt mixing . Also remarkable is the versatile male actress, some of which have not been mentioned for many years: Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Buttons (drag as Andrew's sister), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb and Don Taylor. Also due to the very early view of Judy Holliday, which does not show up for an hour and a half after the painting, but has some good little sequences like O'Brien's disturbed Brooklyn relative. It's a shame that his rights are in tangle, and the only print anyone knows about is 16 mm; apparently after Twentieth Century Fox released it (to a great deal of success), the law returned to the army, and if there is a good 35mm print, it probably lies somewhere at the head of the Pentagon. It's stubborn and nasty in spots, but it also captures the fury of military training and war horror alive, and deserves it to be more seen.
