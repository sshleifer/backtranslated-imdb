I've never seen it on TV, but I rented the DVD through Netflix as soon as I found it available. I had great expectations and I was not disappointed. It's funny and the animation is great. I would only expect this quality level from feature films, so I'm surprised by some bad comments. Perhaps the DVD version improved the animation? One DVD bonus is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot. I'm grown up and I really appreciate it for adults. They are not just kids who like cute animated characters. It's nowhere near "noisy," as some say, but I see where some parents do not want their little children to see them. I am very disappointed that it has been canceled. I wish they produced more episodes. Or perhaps the movie.
