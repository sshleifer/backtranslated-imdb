Shall We Dance is an excellent movie because it shows how something like dancing can rejuvenate the flow of life in the human spirit. Dance is perceived as an expression of the existence and birth of individuality. This is certainly Aoki. There's a modest office at work, but he puts it on the dance floor and unleashes his full supply. Surprisingly, this release is clouded in Japan due to a solid culture of consensus. At the beginning of the movie, all characters are ashamed or scared to dance. They will be disdained or perceived as perverted, because they show their passion through dance. This film is worth watching to witness the rebirth of human emotions and passions. He will leave a smile on your face for a few days.
