I have never been a big fan of television until I first saw 24. I was late in the show. Season 5 was over before I even saw my first episode. It was an episode of the series 3 that was on my parent DVR (digital video recorder) box while I was a house sitting for the weekend. It was the only episode to be associated with the world of Jack Bauer. And the boy was addicted! I watched for six more episodes without blinking my eye. The next day I went to Blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited monthly ticket for twenty dollars and no need to say that was the biggest money I ever made. I followed the first three seasons in three weeks. That's 72 episodes forty minutes! I'm going to tell you what's going on, it's easier on DVD than waiting for a week. I can only imagine the expectation of watching the season 6 weekly! It seems to me slightly agonizing and cruel, but I will try it and look at it like other America! The DVR is set up and you can bet that I'm going to chomping the bit!
