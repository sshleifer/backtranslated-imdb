In the spirit of classical "The Sting" this film will hit where it really hurts ... in the heart! The primary, right female psychiatrist, hungry after adventure, meets the dirtiest and most vicious chore. A vulnerable physician drops to a career fool and asks to be involved in his surgery. While the movie moves like "slow," the top and the end are stunning! Especially enjoy yourself as the doctor "forgives himself"!
