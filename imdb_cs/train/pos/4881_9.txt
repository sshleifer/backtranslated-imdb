"Kaabee" describes the suffering of a woman before and during the Second World War when her husband was imprisoned for "thought crime." This film was directed by Yamada Youji and, as expected, the atmosphere of this film is really amazing. Although the historical accuracy of some scenes, most notably the beach scene, is suspicious. Playing in this movie is totally unbelievable. I'm confused about how they have gathered the whole movie for the 2008 film. Yoshinaga Sayuri, perhaps the most decorated, still active woman in Japan, undoubtedly wins more personal awards for her performance in this film. Shoufukutei Tsurube in the supporting role was really nice. It was Asano Tadanobu, who made the most impressive performance, perfectly portraying the humor of his character and the difficult situation in which he was. Films with pre-war settings are not my thing, but thanks to amazing directing and acting, I was totally absorbed in the story. It was not too much nonsense like "Yuunagi no Machi, Sakura no Kuni" and examines the controversial and sensitive issue of government oppression and brainwashing that occurred in Japan during this period. Excellent film, highly recommended for all viewers.
