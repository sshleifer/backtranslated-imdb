Although DiG! was considered the closest to what is in the music industry as if it were highly produced. The director deceived the audience to believe that the massacre Brian Jonestown had disappeared from the post-'98 terrain. And the rivalry between Dandy Warhols and Jonestown was touched. The truth about this is not really revealed in this film. <br /> <br /> It says this movie is infinitely sensitive and is an interesting watch when we look at two groups of highly talented musicians who make their art. One of the best for this film is a unique perspective between the indie musical scene and the larger corporate scene. <br /> <br /> We recommend mostly for music and two fantastic bands.
