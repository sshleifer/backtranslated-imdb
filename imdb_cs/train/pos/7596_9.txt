The first episode immediately gave a good impression what to expect from the series! Mysteries are awaiting for resolution and a lot of good drama! I love the fact that they are gradually revealing stories about the characters! Explain so much to keep you excited! Of course, this show has some mistakes! In the first two series there are some characters that do not appear in the third season for some reason! Many of the characters are well-posted, but some are not! Like Rose and her husband! Where the hell are they? What happened to them? Maybe he'll be back in later episodes! But it's a bit contradictory! Lost, it can be thrilled with every episode (especially the first two seasons)! This is very difficult! I noticed that in the third season, it focuses on character development rather than the mysterious aspects of the show! This is not a bad thing! It even stores some episodes of being boring! One of the elements that can be seen as the strength of this show are wonderful characters! You will love these characters! Right or wrong! But in the end I will want to see some secrets to be solved and closed! The risk of loss of "lost" due to the decline in rating is close! And that would be devastating!
