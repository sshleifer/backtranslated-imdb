that's one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen. these were rough moments, but they were full of spells. it's an Altmanesque script, brilliant physical humor and relaxed friendship was a pleasure to watch, and a slice of life most of us can relate to. and I can say with a degree of honesty that I was afraid of Steve Carell's nipple .. it really was. surprisingly, it's a good character, an infallible comedy that is basically about love and the many relationships we can meet. Catherine Keener was great like Trish and all of Steve Carell's friends were faint but friendly and so entertaining. the idea that they suspect that Carell is a serial killer is the merry metaphor of a 40-year-old virgin. but the simple truth was that he wanted to fall in love first. original, charming and very entertaining. highly recommended.
