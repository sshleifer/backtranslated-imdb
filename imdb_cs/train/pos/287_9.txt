We loved the movie. I am the mother of two little men. I like a movie that I can watch with them, where men have honesty and character. Moveis, where the money most important. And the family is forever, and love means more than words. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more of Davis' family. But over all that I loved, it left me with the same feeling that others did "please do not be behind us". We both want the actors not to change. New actors were good substitutes. <br /> <br /> My 9 year old son loved this movie too. he asked me to buy them. He's a film critic, so he's saying something about it. The family should all see this step buy for their friends. Help restore value time. We will read books now when we are addicted. I really hope we will see more. To be a blessed happy move
