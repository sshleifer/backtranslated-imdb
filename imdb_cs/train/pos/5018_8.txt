if you are like me, then you will love this great advent of teen movie.i you think there is a mess / book of love / college USA / scream / calender girl / crybaby / all great movies set in lat 50s & early sixties and has a great soundtrack.not as many songs as in some of these types of movies but still great.it is all so very entertaining occasionally and has a great love interest.all the young cast are great.I wish there were more types of these wonderful movies. My favorite film of all time is back to the future when Marty mcfly gos back to 1955 well in these wonderful films stays in the fab of 50s (early 60s), there are some films of this type better than this but not much.
