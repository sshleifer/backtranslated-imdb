For starters, it's a very funny movie with some crazy characters running around that you have to laugh (check out two Russian mistakes). Bug's Life has a classic Disney story, but it's all about good things about the movie. Family values ​​are praised and the main character of the film is subject to some development to eventually oppose grasshoppers. Dave Foley, Julia-Louise Dreyfus, Kevin Spacey (of course) also have great voices ... But in fact, this is the most amazing thing in this movie of animation. It's just great. All the details, great colors, every ant looks different, beautiful background ... And the boys and girls in Pixar all looked so realistic. Overall, this is a very nice job. This is the best animation from Disney by Aladdin.
