Taking photos of this offering is surprisingly bad. The colors are muddy and brown, and photography is very popular with her. Direction and editing are often quite unsightly and TV movie too. * * First, it seems that the film just wanted to torture its audience with clear images of sex and violence. Hans Zimmer's score is also typically a simple and insignificant work of this overrated, impatient composer. But if you are willing to watch this movie further, you will be rewarded with a very exciting family story, a European version of Edna Ferber's epos Giant family. While you first ask why Clara married this idiot man, even his character gets more depth and more backgrounds that he can judge. Clara adds a spiritual lesson to the film, a great and moving statement against the menacing events in her country. Her daughter, whose young lady Antonio Banderas is young at the beginning of her international career, understands this lesson and eventually tries to live. The way the plot was built with the end mirror was great. Everyone is doing a great job. I was wondering, "Who is the actress playing Blanc?" but of course she was really young Winona Ryder! Overall, this film really wanted me to read the book.
