To be honest, I watched this film just for my puberty needs. I think I could not get women at my age (I was 9 or 10 years old), so I thought watching Elvira's fission is a sex cubicle. In the end, I ended up with this classic cult of horror comedy, halloween parties, noisy humor, and some sexy evil that Elvira exposes. They just do not have such movies anymore ... He had a feeling of amateur effort mixed with late-night cable talk show host style. <br /> <br /> The truth is that it generated a lot of fans because of its humor and ability to play Cassandra. <br /> <br /> This is a classic that reminds me of the good days of the USA Up All Night.
