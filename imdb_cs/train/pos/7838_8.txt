If you are a T-Rex / Marc Bolan fan, I suggest you check it out. This shows Mark Bolan's moody side as well as Ringo Starr, apparently having a good time filming some scenes that are not part of the concert but fun watching and letting you know them as just people, and when a talented musician appears as a playful , so professional that the rocks and it seems to impress the screaming girls. Watch him together, you would never know that it's a rock star's job, but you're just playing some great songs with some good friends like Elton John and Ringo Starr who appear in live performances. It is true that there are a few songs I want to see there, but like every album it can not have everything. I bought it in 2006, but if I knew it came out in 1972, I would definitely buy it years ago. It's sad and weird that a man with so many songs about his love for cars would never learn to drive and die in a car crash!
