Who would not want to go for a trip with Peter Falk? The right eye has more characters than most actors today. This is the kind of funny and moving film we're all looking for as the counterbalance of all the bombastic special effects. Women will love her for all counselors for men and men will love it for being the father / son character of the study - one big little scene after another. And it's deep enough to be a real independent finding. It's obvious that it's a love job for Paul Reiser who understands how to be a father and son, as well as laughter and tears as you move around in life. The most amazing part was watched by Reiser Falk. One could say that his character comes to a new appreciation of his father and his teammate, who really enjoys a special craft by Petr Falko. Really beautiful. Hopefully, this movie will soon get to theaters across the country so that everyone can laugh and cry with Paul Reister and the people.
