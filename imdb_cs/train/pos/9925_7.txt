When I rented the Domino, I expected it to be stupid. I hate films that have really crazy adaptations and cinematography, and Domino also got very bad reviews. The only reason I followed was that I like Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken, and Tony Scott on other occasions. I also like it on adventure stories. Yes, filming and cinema were furious, the story was weak and the acting was average, but I still enjoyed this film for some bizarre reason. Domino was very, very fun and often very fun. It was terribly underestimated when it was released. I think because they all wanted more emotional paths, like Scotts' last film Fireman, and instead got great fun. In fact, I understood why everyone hated the Domino enough, even though I loved it and recommended it.
