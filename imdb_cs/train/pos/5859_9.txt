This cool superhero Marvel plays the right tribute by staying loyal to comics. Of all Marvel superheroes that were so poor with poor graphics and gameplay, Spiderman improves in both departments. It also includes the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman comics. How would you expect Spiderman to do everything a spider can do? He does more than just spin. In fact, it uses them as weapons and shields. When he does not use the web in combat, kicks and kicks. Spidey is full of hands when he fights Venom, Rhin, Mysterium, Scorpio, and Dr. Octopus to name a few. Take a look at Captain America with a buddy. <br /> <br /> Most levels are demanding, but some require patience to suppress. The only complaint about this game is that it is so short and can be completed in less than three hours. If you are a true superhero fan Marvel, this game is for you, but do not expect a long game. Better luck in "Spiderman 2" My Rating: 9 out of 10.
