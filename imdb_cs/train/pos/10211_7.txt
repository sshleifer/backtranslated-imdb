Tales? whether writing, visual or poetic epics? generally try to avoid too much of a character; readers and viewers, after all, can be too impressed by trying to track who exactly is who. This is especially true in the movie, I think, simply because we can not easily return to the cinema to restore memory. Viewers like me, however, do not have this problem because we see all of our films on DVD or VHS. A year ago, I was introduced to the French actress Audrey Tautou, whom I first saw in AmÃ©lie Poulain's Fabulous Fate (2001) and later in Very Long Engagement (2004), both of which were elaborate and complex stories with a large cast of characters. This older offer goes beyond the other two ways: more characters and more complexity. Now other directors used these techniques earlier: Robert Altman with The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993), Gosford Park (2001) and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia (1999). Stanley Kramer did it with Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World in 1963, a comedy of almost epic proportions. The difference with this film is that the director first allows us to "see" inside the head of some characters, and secondly, some scenes are repeated as a means to restore the viewer's memory as a story of a frog between different time periods. /> <br /> Basic ?? kernel, so to speak? the story is about a young woman Irene (Tautou) whom a colleague commuting a train commands to meet her true love on that day. This happens in the first few minutes of the movie. The clever irony at this point is that Irene does not realize that the young man on the contrary (Gilbert Robin) can be "one true love". Nor does he go on his separate paths without realizing the potential importance of their close encounter. However, chaos is manifesting for the rest of the day, not just for two young people, but also for other characters that appear in a series of cleverly built and intertwined vignettes that seem to be nowhere and yet ... <br /> <br /> If it was just a story, it could be boring and even quite predictable. It is not so. The script and the director meet our expectations with a host of innovative scenes that are too common but will turn into credible extraordinary events that make it possible for two lovers to meet again. For example, next time a bird hovers from the sky to his book or paper, consider alternatives; two characters make a clear choice that must appear before Irene and her fate meet again. Or what's the stone chip flying on your windscreen? Consider again what will happen ... <br /> <br /> All this is interesting. What was more interesting to me was to judge every new man who came and tried to decide whether this guy was BEST for Irene or whether he really was the young man on the train. It let me guess for a moment. <br /> <br /> I will let you think about seeing this wonderful story. <br /> <br /> We recommend everyone.
