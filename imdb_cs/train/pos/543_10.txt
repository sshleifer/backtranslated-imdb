This movie is the best horror film, bar-none. I love how Stanley was just putting women on the lake. I have been a fan of Judd Nelson's work for many years, and he fired me away. His mixture of horror, drama and romance, not so many comedies. His evil, yet charming look immediately captured me. That look in his eyes will never forget. There is something with him, I can not describe.
