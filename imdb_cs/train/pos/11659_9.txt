This animated film (co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) deals with what is definitely one of the most common themes in the film: the creation in the 9th century of the famous Light Manuscript, the Kells book. In this fantastic narrative about this story, Brendan's boy, living in a uncle-controlled monastery, with a strict abhorrence who fears preparing to defend the abbey from an attack of dreaded Vikings, must get into the threatening forest surroundings to find materials that the master master iluminator appointing Aidan to complete the book. To find unexpectedly in the forest a friendly fairy tale called Aisling. Magnificently and delicately drawn manually (there is some computer animation in several key passages) in a way that reminds both medieval and traditional Celtic art and the very creative use of color and all kinds of geometric shapes, this film is incredibly weird but it's a strange, not paragliding but opening. If a man had a nitpick - for some anachronisms, like an African monk in the 9th century Ireland? one should say that the mixture of Catholic mysticism with celtic paganism in this film never meets. And comical relief is sometimes too broad. That's why I can not give the highest rating. But these are minor problems with an otherwise gorgeous and fantastically imaginative film.
