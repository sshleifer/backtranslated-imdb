This film did not really surprise me, as it only improved and improved. I thought, "Paul Rieser wrote it, okay? Well ... we'll see how he does it ..." Then I saw that there was Peter Falk. I appreciate Colombo. Although I've never been a big fan of the show, I've always liked to look at Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> The performance of Peter and Paul was so natural that I felt like a fly on the wall. They played so well that I felt like some experience! ... And I did not drink! <br /> <br /> This movie was so good that I wanted to get to Paul directly and tell him how much I liked it! but I could not find his number. It must be unlisted or something like that. It was one of the movies I did not know about, what it was or what it was about. It just came and I thought, "Eh, why not? See if I do not like it - I do not have to look at it ..." ... and finally I loved it!
