This movie reappeared after thirty-seven years. I was eleven years old and captured it at South Beach in the long Cinema Theater on Washington Avenue. In 1969 I thought where it is! was a very good movie. But now, for almost forty years, it's not as good as it was. Time has changed and this movie is now tired of the old re-hash war between generations. It is, however, to catch a place in a time that is just a memory. It's really interesting to see fashion fashions, old Vegas, slim Don Rickles, chain smoking and hip opening song. The game was decent, the script somewhat obsolete, but the memories were still fresh. Where it is, it may not be where it is for you, but for me it was still pleasant and fun excursions along the monument track.
