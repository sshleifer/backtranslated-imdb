I saw this movie in a shop in a cheap section. Actually, I remembered alive that I saw ads and trailers for it years ago. I thought "what hey" and bought it, basically because the plot sounded interesting and Claire Danes was always something of a talent in my eyes (it was also before I became a huge fan of Kate Beckinsale). <br /> <br /> So it's about two girls going for a vacation in Bangkok, getting to the narcotics (of which they are innocent) and then being sent to jail in Thailand. The film watches what happens to them and occasionally casts doubt on their innocence. <br /> <br /> Both Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale are performing extraordinary performances and the story of the film is extraordinary and brings some nice moral discussion questions. I think this is but it could be some improvement, it could be longer ... it would help to consolidate these characters and more insight into the Thai justice system would help. <br /> <br /> However, besides, it's a good movie with some great performances. PS For all the pop culture fans are on the lookout for a two-minute role from Paul Walker. I never noticed him the first time I saw the movie.
