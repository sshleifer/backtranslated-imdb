Ed Harris's work in this film is in line with his usual standard of excellence, that is, he alienates the screen from anyone with whom he shares it, including the terrible Sean Connery. The movie, which is more than a little sacred, will only come to life behind the scenes when Harris is questioned by a lawyer for another convicted person. It's a fascinating, master class in artistic control. The other cast members are all adept and Connery is as reliable as Fishbourne, but the story itself has no ink. The conspiracy depends to a large extent on the assumption that the black prisoner will always be abused and forced by white law enforcement officers. It is the engine that drives the story, right or wrong, and makes it cheated at the end. <br /> <br /> It's still worth watching that Harris in action.
