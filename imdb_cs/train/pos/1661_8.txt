(spoilers?) <br /> <br /> While historical precision might be questionable ... (and with a lot of inaccuracies LOTR ... these things are now easier excused) I liked art. Although not really an art house. Provides from time to time some emotionally charged scenes. <br /> <br /> I have two complaints. 1. It's too short. and 2. The voice you hear whispers from time to time is not explained. <br /> <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Replayable: 5/10
