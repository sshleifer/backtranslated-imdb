And here comes another romantic comedy ... but unlike any other film of this genre, it's by far the best I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I admit, first I wanted to watch this movie because of Megan Fox and a bit about Simon Pegg ... First, if you watched a fair amount of movies, you know that Sidney and Alison would be together with the movie and similarly ... but from the beginning to the end of the movie you will not know how ... <br /> <br /> Okay, now this movie is for Simon Pegg only. I do not see another player in the role of Sidney, and I'm sure it would be a very weak film, if not for Pegg's great performance. <br /> <br /> Some great gags and jokes in this movie that kept me really sad, courtesy of Simon Pegg's character Sidney ... but I think everyone in this movie is good.For example, Kirsten Dunst is really (I usually do not think of her as an average act but she was really good at this), then it's Jeff Bridges, there's Gillian Anderson and of course Megan Fox who plays the spoiled fake star Sophie Maes ... a big role for her ... <br /> <br /> Everyone in all, while I usually disagree with her IMDb ratings, this time I would agree with them ... <br /> <br /> Go and check out this movie , it's really light and positive and I recommend it deeply ... My rating 7 of 10 ... well 7.5 actually ...
