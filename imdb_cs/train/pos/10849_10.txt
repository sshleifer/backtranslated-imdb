This is probably the best rockumentary ever - the British, better is Spinal Tap. Characters are believable, the plot is great, and you can actually be empathetic with some of the events - such as Ray's mounting problem with the band. The soundtrack is excellent. Real time, even if it's in the same key, will crazy some songs for days. What I liked was almost all-British cast, with some favorite household names. Ray's wife is invaluable ... The movie never fades, it just goes at the right pace and has really funny sections. Generator of some really good catchphrases! <br /> <br /> It's a hidden diamond.
