This movie is a lot of fun. What is great is two things: One is a straightforward way for characters to embrace stereotypes, discussions about their costumes and superpowers. There is a true parody rescue that is very attractive; the second is the basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves a special note as the subject of Mr. Fury's desire. There is a ship's talent there. I realize that some with high expectations could be disappointed, but this movie is a lot of fun and a sweet one.
