First, this film was a wild ride all the way. A story about soldier training, fighting with superiors and eventually rallying. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning to the end. This is one war that is worth seeing if you are in constant cussing (sometimes out of cause) and horror of what boot camp. The dynamics of how players interact were sometimes amazing and sometimes funny. How Bozz (Colin Farrel) deals with Paxton (Matthew Davis) throughout the story, from camp to Tigerland, and even eventually helped him. Innovative, hand-held filmmaking has added a certain flavor or taste to the film. Still moving, constant action and just constant confusion. Sometimes it was help. Others, not so many. <br /> <br /> It was more realistic throughout the movie. Some points in the movie (especially sex scenes) seemed to be too realistic, even though they added an effect to a movie that would not have been there. it was a very brash movie, through and through. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it's one of the better films Colin Farrell (if not his top performance). The game for each character was excellent. 9/10 -sysnuk3r
