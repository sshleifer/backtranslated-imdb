18 directors had the same task: tell the stories of love in Paris. Some of them, of course, showed better than others, but the whole mosaic is pretty charming - besides, would it be boring if everyone had the same vision of love? <br /> <br /> 1. "Quartier Latin" by Gérard Depardieu One of the greatest French actors has directed my favorite segment, always representing the stunning Gene Rowlands and Ben Gazzara. Funny and beautiful. <br /> <br /> 2. "Tour Eiffel" by Sylvain Chomet Cute, visually amazing (thanks to the director "The Triplets of Belleville") story of a little boy whose parents are mimic; <br /> <br /> 3. "Tuileries" by Ethan and Joel Coen Coen Brothers + Steve Buscemi = Merry 4. "Parc Monceau", Alfonso Cuarón ("Y Tu Mamá También" "Children of Men"), featuring Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier (funny); <br /> <br /> 5. "Place des Fêtes" by Oliver Schmitz, featuring Seyda Boro and Aissa Maiga (touching); <br /> <br /> 6. "14th Arrondissement", Alexander Payne ("Election", "About Schmidt"), a wonderful view of the sad side of life here, featuring underestimated actress Margo Martindale (mother of Hilary Swank in " Million Dollar Baby ") as a lonely, medieval American woman on vacation; <br /> <br /> 7. "Faubourg Saint-Denis", the crazy style of Tom Tykwer ("Run Lola Run") works in the story of a young actress (Natalie Portman) and a blind boy (Melchior Beslon) who fall in love; <br /> <br /> 8. "Père-Lachaise" by Wes Craven, featuring Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell (plus a curious portrait of Alexander Payne as ... Oscar Wilde!); <br /> <br /> 9. "Loin du 16ème", Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas (a simple but moving story by talented Brazilian directors, feat Catalina Sandino Moreno); <br /> <br /> 10. "Quartier des Enfants Rouges", Olivier Assayas ("Clean"), sad story featuring always fantastic Maggie Gyllenhaal; <br /> <br /> 11. "Le Marais" by Gus Van Sant, featuring Gaspard Ulliel, Elias McConnell and Marianne Faithful (simple but fun); <br /> <br /> 12. "Quartier de la Madeleine" by Vincenzo Natali, featuring Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko; <br /> <br /> 13. "Quais de Seine" by Gurinder Chadha; <br /> <br /> 14. "Place des Victoires" by Nobuhiro Suwa, featuring Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe; <br /> <br /> 15. "Bastille", Isabel Coixet (fabulous director devalued "My Life Without Me"), featuring Miranda Richardson, Sergio Castellitto, Javier Camira and Leonor Watling; <br /> <br /> 16. "Pigalle" by Richard LaGravenes, featuring Bob Hoskins and Fanny Ardant; <br /> <br /> 17. "Montmartre", with Bruno Podalydès; <br /> <br /> 18. "Porte de Choisy", Christopher Doyle, with Barbet Schroeder (mostly known as director of "Barfly", "Good Luck" and "One White Woman"). I could classify some segments as brilliant and others as average (or even slightly boring), but none of them is simply bad. Overall, I give "Paris, Je t'Aime" 8.5 / 10 and I recommend it for what it is: a beautiful mosaic of love and other things between them.
