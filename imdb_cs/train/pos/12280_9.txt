This is one of the few films I've ever seen in the theater. This film really loves the atmosphere and the story of the life of the tragic hero Esteban Trueba. He makes so many mistakes, but he gets a chance to redeem. Is not that a rather comforting thought? When I watched it for the first time, I thought that after the winning elections the film would be finished - I did not know the book. So the boy was wrong when a dramatic climax came up! I was literally silenced by the force of the last half hour of the film. Many people do not like this movie anymore. I can not understand he does not care. Perhaps those who first read the book are - as often as the screen edits of the novels - simply disappointed that so many things remain unknown, invisible and inexplicable. But as a story-telling film - the story of the family, the rise and fall of man, the deep compassion of the woman, the power of love, and the madness of hatred (and conservatism) - this movie is just gorgeous! In addition, the soundtrack is incredibly good and the cast is also amazing - especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons. So surely one of those movies about which the cinema was invented!
