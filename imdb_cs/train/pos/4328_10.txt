I bought a DVD of this version to compare with the current version of BBC 2005 (which is brilliant). 1985 was adapted by Arthur Hopcraft, who adapted Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for television and who died this year (2005). I remember great acting, especially from Rigga and Elliott, and the moving music. (Music in the 2005 version is far too underestimated, but very familiar.) Just pick up other commentators for a few points: Richard Carstone is a friend of Ady Claire, not Esther. Esther did not have an uncle. Charlie Drake never played Krook in any version nor did he play Toby Esterhase in TTSS! The sequel is played by comedian Johnny Vegas in 2005. Toby played Bernard Hepton. <br /> <br /> Both versions are honest and admirable adaptations of Dickens' great novel. Now read the book! It's not perfect, and sentimentality may sometimes make you angry, but I'm preventing you from crying - and laughing!
