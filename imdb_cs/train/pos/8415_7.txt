If "Cabinet Dr. Caligari" is the father of all horror films (and German Expressionist Film), this film before WWI is a grandfather. The title student, starving in an empty attic, has entered into an agreement with the devil - the devil gives him a classless bag of gold in exchange for "nothing in this room." The Devil chooses the reflection of the student in his mirror. He goes to a student who is committing a crime committed by a student who commits crimes for which a student is accused. The film is confused with some limitations resulting from the technically primitive state of 1913 filming; The plot screams for effects directly, but the film is practically all of them shot in the daylight without shadow. But the scene where the reflection comes from the mirror is still wrapped in the wall. <br /> <br /> More interesting for trends that predestine than for your own needs, Student from Prague is still worth it.
