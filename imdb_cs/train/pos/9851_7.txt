Shrek, someone? Well, imagine Shrek in the ice age. Do you remember the end of Shrek? Because you're doing it. Imagine that Shrek turns into a man, just like a princess. Understand it? Nice animation, in fact, much more artistic work than Pixar and Disney paintings that try to get closer to reality in their drawings. Strong unicorns, some social notes that kids will not understand, good boys will win. One more thing: Scrat. By the way, how does everyone know it's the name of Scrat? 7/10
