I do not have much to add to my totality, this film ranks up there with Top Gun as one of the funniest movies ever he did without trying to be. I do not think it should be taken seriously when monitored because it is very pleasant. I do not think that this brings Christopher Walken's reputation, for his reputation was on the decline. It took Pulp Fiction to awaken him from the sleep he was in. As for Michael Ironside, he was in some of the great fun without trying to be serious movies. Total Recall, Top Gun. I think that's the amazing budget of this movie. Scenes and actors, explosions, etc. They are pretty amazing, so obviously someone likes so much and was willing to risk a lot of money. Whoever or she loves them because I love this movie! <br /> <br /> If someone reads this looking for information about McBain (and I seriously doubt there is too much), you just know it's a funny movie and you should look at it with a smile!
