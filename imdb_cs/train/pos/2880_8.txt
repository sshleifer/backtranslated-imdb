"Cinderella" is one of the most popular Disney classics. And they really deserve their status. Based on the classic fairy tale by Charles Perrault, the film follows Cinderella's attempts and suffering, a good girl who is poorly rescued by her stepbrother's stepmother and equally inappropriate helpers. When the royal balls are held and all the invited young women are invited (read: the King wants the prince to marry), Cinderella stays at home while her stepmother is doing her with her terrible daughters. But there's a fairy-tale fairy ... <br /> <br /> The Cinderella story itself will not be able to skip the feature so when you generally remain true to the story otherwise, the rather random characters of the animals that use the fairy cat to get the title character on the ball, have become garbage collectors. The mice Jaq and Gus are the chief helper, and their own nemesis is the stepmother Lucifer's mother. Their antics are generally interwoven with the main fairytale plot and are largely amazing. The film will surely slow down between the main characters' performance and shortly before the old players turn to the ball, but after this slowdown, the film really happens again and surprisingly (because "Cinderella" is the most worn tale of all time, probably) will end up as one of the most involved Disney stories. <br /> <br /> Animation and artistic trends are beautiful. All legendary Nineteen-year-old men animated in this painting and the colorful stylish and conceptual art of Mary Blair (also made the concept of art and color style for "Alice in the Wonderland", "Peter Pan", "The Three Caballeros" and many others) managed to screen to handle your journey. Colors and patterns are beautiful, especially in scenes of the Fairy Goddess and Balls, as well as in those nice moments here and there. <br /> <br /> Overall, Cinderella is one of the best Disney fairy stories and is recommended to the young and everything that embodies the Disney philosophy that really does.
