Tarzan and Jane live happily in the jungle. Some men come to look for ivory and take Jane back to civilization. But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave. One of the men falls in love with Jane and decides to take her back ... even if it means killing Tarzan. This is a rarity - a sequel that is better than the original. "Tarzan, a monkey" from 1932 was good, but he had some terrible special effects and a bit dragged. It has far superior effects and is much more adult. There is a lot of heinous racism (the black man is shot dead at the point of death - and nobody really cares), but that was 1934. There's also a lot of blood, gore and violence (for the 1934 film), and pending prints make Jane do long underwater swimming completely naked! There is also obvious sexual content and Tarzan and Jane are wearing almost nothing and (supposedly) sleeping together and having sex - without being married. It would not matter to anyone today, but in 1934 it was quite extreme. Except that, the film is well-controlled, very fast and full of adventure and excitement. Seeing Weissmuller in that spotted lute is certainly a medicine for the eyes, and Jane's suit is quite revealing. I still think Maureen O'Sullivan is as bad as Jane, but Weismuller is as perfect as Tarzan. Everyone else is all right. This is perhaps the best Weismuller - O'Hara Tarzan. It's worth seeing, but not for children!
