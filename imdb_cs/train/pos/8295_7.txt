Robert Urich was a great actor, and this television movie is believable. I remember watching this movie when I was 15 years old and when I see it for the second time, my opinion remains the same. People are losing who they were when they entered this exclusive club in a California computer city. Urich tries to find out what's wrong with his family and I love the Halloween costume idea, brilliant. This movie is about the battle of your own sprit. The quality of television that exceeds the big budget, Gangs in New York. I wonder if Robert Urich was a compassionate man he portrayed in many movies? I hope! 6 or 7 of 10.
