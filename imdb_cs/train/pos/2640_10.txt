Obviously, many people have not seen this movie because no one has posted any comments. It's not a movie that you have to miss. After all, he won the George Peabody Award and the Humanitas Award. Paul Winfield was to win the prize for his amazing performance in this film. Eugene Logan, co-founder of this film for television, was also part of another film about humanity or his loss by being a technical advisor to Truman Capote Glass House. This movie is now available on DVD. If anyone is interested, I will send another letter saying that Eugene Logan was a technical advisor to a film as amazing as Truman Capote. Thank you for reading this, and I hope you can find a way to view these two movies.
