It's a pretty good movie, but it's too American in predictability. Change Kung Fu for soccer and Turkish family for Pakistani and you can watch Bend It Like Beckham (2002) almost scene for the scene. A nice feature that serves as the backbone of the film is the fight against a mysterious ninja under the road, beginning with unfortunate losses and slowly advancing until the last game is a victory against one another, as Kung Fu Master has pointed out several times. On another level, Danish life is revealed quite differently from the image of foreign people: foreign immigrants who make up most of Danish citizens, graffiti in the suburbs of Copenhagen, an immigrant girl in film stitching. Everybody portrays a different picture than one has in mind when they hear the word Denmark.
