Inspired April is a tonal poem, Impressionist painting, a masterpiece telling a message with a few words. It's one of my 10 favorite movies since it's released. Still waiting, even less patiently, for the film to be released in DVD format. It seems I'm not alone. <br /> <br /> If the records of the Amazon parent company are correct, there are many people who want this DVD title. Many people want to leave Italy with this occupation and script. Many people want to have a permanent copy of this movie in their libraries. Cast is spectacular, cinematography and flawless direction. The film is a certain holder. Many have already asked. Add our names to the list.
