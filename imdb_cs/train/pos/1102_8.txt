In Manhattan, US middle-class Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) lives with his wife Muriel (Myrna Loy) and two teenage daughters in four bedrooms and one bathroom rented apartment. Jim is working in an advertising agency that collects $ 15,000 a year, and feels uncomfortable in his apartment due to lack of space. When he sees an ad for a huge house for sale in Connecticut for an affordable price, he goes with his wife and real estate agent and decides to buy an old house without any technical advice. His best friend and lawyer, Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas), sends a famous engineer to look at the house, and the man tells him he should give the house and build another. Jim checks information with other engineers, and everyone denounces the place, and soon finds out that he has bought a "cash pit" instead of a dream house. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings builds his own house" is a very fun comedy, humorous lines and top-notch scenario. Cary Grant is cheerful in the role of a man who moves with the impulse of realizing with the American dream of owning a huge house that finds out he has wrongly decided and at the same time losing his touch in his job and the jealousy of his friend. In 1986, Tom Hanks worked in a very entertaining film, visibly inspired by this gorgeous classic, The Money Pit. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Lar, Meu Tormento" ("Home, My Trouble")
