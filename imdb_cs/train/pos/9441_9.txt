The makers of this great movie have done a great job to join with characters as they suffered from this terrible suffering. The terrible scene in the woods was so great that you forgot that these men were just actors playing parts.I never dived into the movie I have. Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight were never better on the screen, as well as the subtle performances of Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Bill McKinney, and although he appeared briefly, James Dickey, the man who wrote the book on which the film was based, like Sheriff Aintry. It is a bit disturbing and children should of course be protected, but it is a great drama theater.
