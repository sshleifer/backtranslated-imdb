Greetings again from the darkness. This one will be compared to the "Princess Bride" and although it does not change the classic, it is extremely fun and well-made in itself. The story line is a bit weird and the whole thing on the wall has never really explained, but execution is fine, and even building strong tension. Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls for a bad girl (Sienna Miller) and agrees to bring her a fallen star ... which happens to be playing stunning Claire Danes. What's happening with these two is not a lot of tension, but the exciting part comes with the evil wizards played by Michelle Pfeiffer and the Prince's son, King Peter O'Toole, who want to get back a ruby ​​necklace that has our "star" on . Lots of bad guys good. <br /> <br /> On the way, you meet the strangest pirate you see (including all of the Caribbean). Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare - hard inside and we say in contact with his feminine party. Another meeting is a great Ricky Gervais as a fast trader and that's good for a few laughs. It's not your typical chase, age or fancy, but director Matthew Vaughn ("Layer Cake") deserves audiences. A sadly bad marketing campaign is likely to prevent you from making some money. I think the video will be a great success.
