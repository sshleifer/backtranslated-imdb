It seems to be the perfect day for bathing. A normal family wants to get the advantage and takes a trip to the beach. Unfortunately, the father is trapped under a pier, and neither his wife nor his little son can help him - while the tide is rising. A woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and seeks help. John Sturges' short film (69 minutes) is strong due to unanswered questions. Stanwyck finds a person who can help, but he has to pay for it. There is a double question posed by the film. How far would you help the person you love, and on the other hand - when he watches Stanwyck's behavior towards an alien - really loves his spouse? Like a good story, this film leaves the viewer with questions he can answer himself.
