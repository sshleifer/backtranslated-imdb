I saw this movie about twenty years ago at a late show. I still remember the movie, especially the performance of Robert Taylor. I always thought that Taylor was underestimated as an actor because most critics saw him as a solid, almost boring, leading male type, and women just liked watching his movies because of his appearance. This film, however, showed what an interesting actor could be. During his long career he did not have enough roles. That's his best performance. He is absolutely faithful in a really vicious role. From what I read, he was very hardworking and easy in real life, and he never participated in such a role. Basically he would just do what MGM gave him. This film proves that he could handle more diverse and difficult roles. The second thing I remember about this movie is how uncomfortable the character of Lloyd Nolan was. Nolan was a great actor, but this character really made me worse. The last scene of the film has been lingering for me all these years. This movie is definitely worth a look.
