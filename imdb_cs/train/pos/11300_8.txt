Ossessione A debut film by Luchin Visconti, this Italian noir is usually credited with the launch of the neo-renaissance movement - well, he says right on the back of the box - and is sometimes a penetrating, sometimes lurid portrait of lonely individuals in the moral flow. He meets fascist Italy and includes a number of supportive figures - including the ingenious drifter who proclaims communist virtues - the epitome of distant despair of a country that seeks its identity from the outside, passing through soul-searching fantasies. Although Visconti's sympathy with liberation and his ability to express his affectionate conditions has already been well developed, the cobweb of scams is little - though the basis of noir is to build a protagonist manipulated by fate and femme fatale, Gino is so upset that you start by fearing he could deserve it - the cosmic irony of a didactic, illegal relationship tense with smoking. Similarly, it is sharp and substantial, although its real impact on the history of the film is certainly questionable.
