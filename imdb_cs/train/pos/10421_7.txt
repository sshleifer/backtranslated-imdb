This is the most beautiful movie. Color photography is beautiful because it shows the richness of the Metropolitan Opera in brilliant color. Other scenes of interiors in different residences, etc. They are just as excellent. As far as music is concerned, what else can be said that Lanza's voice was on the verge of singing so many known and beloved aria of the world. Amazing Dorothy Kirsten is also delighted because her soprano voice blends with Lanza in wonderful harmony. Of course, Hollywood has taken his usual freedoms with the life story of Caruso. There is little in the narrative about real events. For example, the facts about his death are completely devised and unrelated to the truth. There are some very good websites that tell the true story of Caruso and contain several pictures of it. These websites can be placed using any good search engine. There are also several books on his life history. But the fictional story line does not mean that this wonderful movie. Voices of Lanza, Kirsten and members of the choir are the real stars of this film. Enjoy, I know I definitely did.
