Riget II is a good follow-up, but it's not as good as the first one. This series does not seem as serious as the first. There's a lot more comedy in this, good, though. <br /> <br /> We are back to the Danish Rigshospitalet, the Danish National Hospital. Mrs. Drusse is about to leave the hospital because her job is done, but it does not matter. Soon he pursues ghosts, and Helmer makes everyone mad and will soon get worse when black power breaks out in the kingdom. This story involves much more comedy than the previous one. In any case, it's a lot of fun, but it makes you seriously a little less serious. The story kept many elements from the last series and added some new ones. It's well written, but some new elements are just a little stupid, but it saves it by being more like a comedy. A good story, but not so good, original and exciting first. <br /> <br /> The actors are the same with some add-on to the regular cast. Everyone is very good. It's a strange story and setting. Some parts are totally strange shows and characters are changing during the show so it's serious and to be real it's not an easy job. Although these actors can handle this situation perfectly. <br /> <br /> A great deal of good quality from the first series remains untouched. Cinematography is one of those qualities. The handheld camera, made by the world-famous Trier, brings a series of tension and reality. It gives the camera a unique ability to move and watch characters, and Trier uses these capabilities. Good motion, great lightning, and good composition and editing make it a good watch. Be prepared to see a better effect in this sequel, which was the first one. Be also ready to see more. I did not think the green thing looked too good. I thought it was non-original and did not fit. However, effects like spirits are really good. Non-digital effects also look good. A little brother looks really weird, but you accept it. I would like to say that the effects are OK to good. Music is also pretty good. Moody and nice. Some of them are really touching. This is really nice. The first is relatively little in action scenes and it works well. <br /> <br /> This is a good continuation. If you saw Riget, you can see this without being disappointed. It has many of the same features as the first series. However, I recommend seeing the first series before I see it. These two form a series you do not want to miss.
