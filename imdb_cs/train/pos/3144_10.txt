This is one of the better comedies ever seen on television. The first season was cheerful as most of the following periods. The only reason I'm giving this show 9/10 is because of the unfortunate final season. The only good part of the final season was the final. My favorite part of this show was a scene that reduces human imagery, often portraying characters in famous television shows or in the 1970s. It's a rare show that I liked every character (except for the final season ... too late to try to develop a new character and fez was not nearly as funny). The red leg in the backshells never grew nor Kelso inconceivable. Bravo on the fox that he keeps such a good show for so long, too long.
