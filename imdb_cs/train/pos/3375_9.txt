In this movie, the year 2022 looks much like the 1970s. This is fun first, but soon the viewer perceives how very different the decadent futuristic world is, despite the external circumstances, how many things we consider to be obvious could be inaccessible. Characters often act in a special way, without any tactics or behavior or respect. I think it's deliberate, not bad. After all, who witnessed social changes in the 1960s and 1970s, it could be assumed that by 2022 the inhabitants of the crowded city behave. <br /> <br /> I did not like most of the action scenes except the death of the priest: too cheap in seventy years. The data is not too polished. But great scenes and ideas - such as the death of the elephant, the way solvers and dead bodies are solved, furniture - outweigh the shortcomings of the film. 8 out of 10.
