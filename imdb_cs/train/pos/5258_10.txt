A laughing man laughs loudly, with a wide variety of occupations, as well as some very stupid but excellent scenes (including the most amusing love song he ever wrote). Ferrell is his usual quality brilliant side role. <br /> <br /> Tim Meadows plays surprisingly idiot and wrote himself some of the funniest lines you'll find in every comedy outside. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth buying as watching it every 6 months or so it will keep you laughing as hard as you did the first round. <br /> <br /> I'm excited to think at the time of writing this, it has a modest 4.7 / 10 and I urge you to vote! <br /> <br /> And remember kids - "It's more movement in the ocean"
