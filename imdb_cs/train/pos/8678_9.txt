Butch room? Apparently. After the violent start with Spike, Tom and Jerry all rock, Butch calls and wants to know why. It's a good question. <br /> <br /> "Cats can go along with dogs, do not they?" Tom asked, who nodded his head. "Mice can be satisfied with cats, right?" Jerry nods "no," and then he sees that this is not the right answer. They go in and Butch develops a "Peace Treaty" (complete with professional art pieces!). Most of the rest and the big part of the cartoon are three, which they liked each other very much. What is a refreshing change in tempo. It was fun to watch. I can have one million of these cartoons in which everyone overcomes my head. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you knew that peace would not last. A large piece of steak proclaims the death of the "peace treaty," but on the way it was a nice change and still had some common Tom & Jerry clever humor.
