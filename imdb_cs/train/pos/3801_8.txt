This is an animated CGI based on the French 2D animated series. The series ran briefly on Cartoon Network, but her run was so short that his inclusion as one of the potential Oscar nominees for the best animated film for this year left most of the people who know it's "Huh?" This is the story of Lian-Chu, a type of heart muscle, and Gwizdo, the brain of an operation that, along with Hector's fire, drains the dragon is more like a dog. Travel to a world that offers its services as dragon hunters, but they never get paid. Zoe, a fairy-loving niece of the king, who is blind, comes to their lives. The world seems to be taken up by a giant monster, and all the knights sent by the king have never returned, or if they return, they will return as ashes. In desperation, the King hires kite hunters to stop the world's eaters. Zoe of course the brand ... <br /> <br /> What can I tell others why this film is hidden beneath the rock? This is a really good little film that is completely out of the radar, except for an improbable Oscar nominee. Its a beautifully designed, fantastic-looking movie (The World That Comes, Having Floating Soils And Crazy Creatures) That Still Bring Me "Wow". English voice recording with Forrest Whitaker as Lian-Chu (one of the best vocal performances I've ever heard) and Rob Paulson as Gwizdo (you mean Steve Bucsemi) is the first. Equally great is a script that does not speak to its viewers, using some real expressions that are not commonly heard in animated movies (not Disney or Pixar). It's all done well. Is that perfect? No, some bits take too long, but it's damn fun too. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this. It is one of the better animated films from 2008 and continues on my surprising list for 2009.
