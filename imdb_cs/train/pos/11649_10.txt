What a totally stunning movie if you have 2.5 hours to kill, watch it, you will not regret it, it's too fun! Rajnikanth carries the film on his shoulders and although there is nothing else but him, I still liked it. Music by A.R. Rehman needs time to grow, but when you've heard it several times, you really like it.
