I am Belgian and grew up in the 1960s. Most American series appeared here (the original language with subtitles), and Batman was one of the first to be interested in. Unfortunately, it caused "panic hysteria" among mothers because Batman was considered too violent. Look, compare the innocence of this series with the crap that children nowadays get. Because of my over-protective mothers of the 1960s, I was given the chance to see perhaps two or three episodes! I was so frustrated that I started collecting comics and bubblegum cards (it still got them!), To make it up. I even got pictures of the View of the Championship ... I had the urge to see the Crusader Crossroads. All children need some sort of hero. A few years later I finally got the chance to see her again as a teenager and I liked it very much. Speaking tongue would have escaped me if I watched him as a child, but I understood that at the age of 17. Yeah, I noticed them all now and the occasional soul on the episode's episodes because they did not show the DVD series (to my knowledge) Tonight I enjoyed "Returning to the Bats Cave" ... it was a pleasure to watch because it was full of trivia and inside-jokes. Seeing Adam and Burt was joy and this TV movie is just fantastic in all aspects. They act alone when playing their parts in a series. I congratulate the people who have created this great nostalgic "feast" ... I'll watch it again. My advice to all Batman fans is: SEE IT! Rent it !!! Rent it from a friend !!! Buy !!! I would never expect to rate it as 9/10 ... Very good work!
