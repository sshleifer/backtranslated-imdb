All fans of Kiry Reed MUST see this. The film contends with the romantic novel Kira, who is unable to come up with new ideas. She also divorced. However, she meets this guy in the restaurant and helps her out of her shell (and clothes). They go to the corner room and they do it. Fortunately, Kira gets condoms (Now do not tell me that these Playboy movies are worthless piles of soft core fluff, remember kids, safe sex). Later, she wondered how much it was, but she did not get to her name. In spite of that, the guy finds her and goes on in the loop games. But in the end, she lost her wit and wanted to know more. When he does, all hell will relax and I will. It's the best of those Playboys movies with the gentle kernel I've seen. Try it and stare at the spectacular Kira.
