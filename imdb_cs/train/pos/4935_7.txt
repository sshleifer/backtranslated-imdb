In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant feels ill and leaves the poker game while winning a small criminal Blackie (Walter Jack Palance). He is persecuted by Blackie and his men Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), killed by Blackie and his body being dumped into the sea. During the autopsy, Lieutenant dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the US Public Health Institute finds out that the dead man had a pneumonic epidemic caused by rats and needs to find out who had some type of contact with a man within forty-eight hours to prevent an epidemic. Mayor of the city will be assigned by skeptical captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) to help Dr. Clint find murderers who are infected by mortem and inoculate them. Panic in the Streets reveals a simple story, but is still effective and with a great villain. The plot was not dated fifty-seven years old. Jack Palance performs in a debut scornful trigger and the camera works while trying to escape with Zero Mostel is still very impressive. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Panic in the Streets"
