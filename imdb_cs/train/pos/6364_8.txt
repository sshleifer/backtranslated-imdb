"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" was all that the insights showed. You will not find it often. Most of the previews only show the best parts and the rest of the movie is terrible. Not so with this. I was pleased with the original land, even though there were no sub-areas. The animation was not broken like "Shrek," but it was good. The story and the story were well presented and there were only a few slow spots. That's what interests you. I found out I was looking forward to this. "Atlantis" gets and keeps your attention. You also have to think a bit, but not too much. Once you think about it a bit, you can figure out what must happen, but you really do not know how it will happen. Casting was also good. Michael J. Fox, like Milo, was an excellent choice. His personality is great. The terrible commander Rourke was also well-chosen with James Garner. His character reminded me of his performance in "Maverick", which I liked. I really liked Claudia Christian's distinction as Helga Sinclair. Her ability to play an absurd personality makes the film more interesting. It's simply bad he's a villain. <br /> <br /> Despite all, it's definitely worth it (8 out of 10).
