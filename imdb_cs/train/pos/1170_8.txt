The Night of Living Homeless is a funny spoof of the 1978 movie (and remake 2004) "Dawn of the Dead". Just this time ... with the homeless. The episode has homeless people all coming to South Park, and people can not figure out why they treat homeless people like zombies who want to change and a few of their parents end up on the roof of a supermarket like in the movie. So now it's up to the boys to find out where they came from and how to get rid of them. It's a pretty funny episode with some good moments, like boys singing their own 2pac / Dr.Dre song "California Love". Overall good episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
