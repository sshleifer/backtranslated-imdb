Indian directors need it hard. They have to compete with films such as Laggan, where 11 villagers, castrated men, defend their villages and half of them are certified idiots. "Devdas", an unhappy, fedar-chef, a strange return to drink in oblivion, with figures running in endless corridors that do not know the feelings or feelings of someone - unfortunately, they live in the ornate purple of red tapestries and nobility. But to make a good movie, you have to calm down to comfort the front guests who are kventessential gaper who are fascinating with Split skirts and Dishum-Dishum fights the nitwit "Bollywood" leading actor who is marginal handsome. So you can get in touch with a director who wants to tell a story about the head of the village of Leonine, who in his own words "defending his village" is considered a violent movie or too male for a male audience. There are very few actors who can provoke anger and pathogens like Nana Patekar (Narasimhan). Nana Patekar will let you in her courtyard and look at him beret and laugh at Politicians when his loyal admirers burst out laughing with every word of satire they throw at him while his daughter buys his grandson. This is an equally authentic scene, India. Nana Patekar is a basic actor who belongs to an old school of acting, a vanishing breed in Hindi movies. Violence depicted is an intricate piece of storytelling with songs and dances that are cast for pupils without whom movies will not be sold - the sad but real state of affairs. Faster it will change for "Bollywood". All in all and done is a good movie.
