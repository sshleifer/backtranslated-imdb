He saw this movie for the first time when he was drunk at a motel in Canada. When crossing the channels, the Easy Lube section came in. My friend was still spinning, but I told him to come back. Something about the name of easy lubrication simply did not sound right. I watched the rest of the movie that was pretty funny. He wrote a couple of credit names and returned home to look. It looks like the first movie of Chevy Chase. I did not remember him. He did not remember much about it, so I rented it and gave him a second inscription. It's pretty funny and fairly graphic. It's just like the Kentucky Fried Movie, but not so fun. I love my fingers, a light bottle, and I'm the presidential part. Dealers of skit is also quite cool. I give him 6.5 or 7 out of ten
