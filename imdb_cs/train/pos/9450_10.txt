Like Peckinpah did STRAW DOGS and KUBRICK with WATCH ORANGE, director John Boorman brings an effective film about Man's violent side in DELIVERANCE, probably the definitive horror film of the 1970s. Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty, and Ronny Cox show four businessmen in Atlanta who decide to take a canoe trip on the wild Cahulawassee in the north of Georgia before they get into what Reynolds calls "one big dead lake." /> <br /> But the local mountains are obviously losing sight of these "urban boys" hiding in their woods. And the following day, continuing on the banks of the river, Beatty and Voight are blamed and sexually attacked by two ominous mountain men (Bill McKinney, Herbert "Cowboy" Coward). So what began to be wicked changed as a result of the Appalachians to a nightmare in which our four protagonists came to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we call barbarism. /> <br /> James Dickey has adapted the script to his own best-selling book and the result is often a grabbing and disturbing shock. Often known for its "SQUEAL!" and the "Dueling Banjos" sequence, DELIVERANCE is also quite a throbbing pain, with four leading men outstanding in their roles, and McKinney and Coward do for the two most frightening villains of all time. You have to see the movie for those who want to have a chance.
