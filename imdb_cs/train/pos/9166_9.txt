If there was more master adaptation than this, you do not have to look for it; you will find everything and more in this almost perfect presentation of the masterpiece of Charlotte Brontë. I have rarely seen a movie that would urge me to read the novel on which it was founded, but I admit it here. Although I did not read Jane Eyre, I am convinced that I missed a lot of dialogue and conspiracy or intensity and emotion. I just want to explore the novel because of the tremendous curiosity and emotion that this masterpiece has created in me. <br /> <br /> I do not have to wonder about the plot. Let me tell you, if you are not sure whether you should watch or read the beautiful story of Jane Eyre, please do not doubt! Every atom of power and spell that raised Jane Eyre as a popular classic of English literature was successfully captured in this film. What Brontë did not bring, Clarke and Dalton managed to translate in the spotlight with tremendous intensity. The success of the film is undoubtedly due to its acting ability. Love Jane Eyre loves or hates her, but appreciates the richness, vitality, truth of the story; love characters; love actors; just as you would love what is great in the cinema.
