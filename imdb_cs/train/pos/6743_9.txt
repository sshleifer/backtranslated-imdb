Dana Andrews is one of the actors I've probably seen in a dozen films, but never really made a call for me. Often sober, silent, playing the same kind of role and looking somewhat like Glenn Ford, an understatement, he is an actor who makes some effort to really appreciate; but once you hit the right movie ... And that's it. Preminger's moody look at New York's suburban is as dirty and frantic as just about 50min of noir, and Andrews is in his element as a too hard policeman Mark Dixon who just does not know how to play the game to get ahead: he hates criminals too much for it to always play according to the rules. Early in the film, he accidentally kills a murder witness who looks at the illegal game he founded by a gangster whom Dixon hates for personal reasons, and spent the rest of the film trying to conceal his involvement and bring gangsta to his kind of "justice." On the way, he gets involved with the alienated wife of the man he has killed (Gene Tierney) and also has to try to get his father out of the hook for murder. Amazingly photographed by Joseph LaShelle, the hard and effusive dialogue of Ben Hecht and a really strong end with elements of tragedy, he discovered grace in just minutes or two, it's another noir for years and can be my favorite Preminger movie - it's all well like Laura.
