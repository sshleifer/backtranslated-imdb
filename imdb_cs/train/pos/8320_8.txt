Farrah Fawcett spent most of her post-Angela career, which had been bending us, with occasional remarkable acting that was among her Playboy quarrels and Letterman's escapades. But if it turns out we can not deny that this girl can act. Far from the story of epic proportions, this well-filmed TV movie is soft, quiet and sometimes moving. Fawcett plays a fleeting daughter of a black sheep who returns home only to find she missed the last days of her life as well as the funeral, until the disappointment of her more stable and probably more meaningful sister. Brad Johnson plays a loving interest, and the story unfolds from all the typical elements of the telefilm track - but then it's always seen that the terrifying Farrah watches, and she really remains extremely attentive. (And yes, I admit it, I had the Farrah poster on my slope back). Silk Hope gets three and a half stars (out of five) on a crusader. Bosley would be proud.
