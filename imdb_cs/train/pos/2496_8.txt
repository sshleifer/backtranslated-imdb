No waste - not where it would be near garbage. Is not it the original? this is the last thing that could be said about "2.4 children". Predictable? definitely not! Although it was a somewhat unusual series for the BBC, it was funny, funny and humorous. I really liked Belinda Lang and John Pickard - whom I believe were great. Gary olsen was also very good and so were all the other cast members .. I was never quite new why it was not possible until today we overlook the death of Gary Olsen a relatively young age. I would like to have a comedy of this kind, much more (and to show them here in Israel).
