"California" is a good Hollywood odyssey of horror and horror that tells two couples who run a run to California to share the gas costs: Lewis & Pitt and two Wannabee artists, photographer and writer (Duchovny & Forbes). Pitt "nails" his character, which focuses on this somewhat predictable thriller. Good patrol for those who deal with psycho-killers.
