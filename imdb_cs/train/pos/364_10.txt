Steven Speilberg's adaptation of the popular novel Alice Walkers is not without its share of controversy. When the first members of the black community for the first time criticized their blacks while others were asking why the white man was directing this film about black women. This is the story of a young black woman named Celie, who grew up in rural America after the turn of the century. He has two children, whose shameful father is in his hand since birth. Her only comfort in her unhappy life comes from her sister. Celie (in later years starring Whoopie Goldberg) has married his wife (Danny Glover). The husband is humiliated by his sister, and he is quickly removed from Celie's life. The story is often heartbreaking because Celie hopes to meet her sister and children one day again. During his lifetime, he meets an assortment of characters, including Sophie, hard as a wife's nails to her stepping son, and Shug, a loud and delicious salon singer who teaches her about love. [Speilberg's leadership is throughout this picture, which offers brilliant cinematography and some stellar performances. I dare you to watch this movie and should not move! The Color Purple film captures the essence of a complicated story. While it tends to minimize the lesbian aspects, as well as the African story that was so vivid in the book, the film remains faithful to its themes, allowing Alice Walker's voice to live. <br /> <br /> I could not begin to react to the discussion that surrounded this movie. It is enough to say, however, that this is one of the few films I can watch over and over and left an indelible mark on me. <br /> <br />
