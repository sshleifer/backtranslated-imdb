"Insignificance" is far from a great movie, from the stageplay by director Nic Roeg. In Roeg's film, it's above most of his post-work "Do not Look Now," which is characterized by the rational use of Theresa Russell as the main actress. It's really good, and far from the problem in other Roeg's movies like "Bad Timing" and "Cold Heaven". As "actress," which is Marilyn Monroe, Russell is very effective, portraying her as a deeply depressing, but siren. He plays well alongside Michael Emil as Einstein, who is the smallest. The look looks admirable, and while Theresa Russell does not look exactly like Monroe, it's certainly attractive enough to be true. Other players are adequate if they are not as much arrest as Emil and Russell. The well-functioning, intelligent scenario is well targeted by Roege, but certainly not brilliantly, like "Walkabout" or "Performance". As with other Roeg films, he tends to rely too much on unclear, insignificant flashes that add little to the film. In many ways, the movie would work better as a shorter (say, 60 minutes), a modest piece. Still, a fairly acceptable, transient film. Occasionally quite outstanding, but somewhat lacking. Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
