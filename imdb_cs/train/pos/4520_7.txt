Still somewhat long and overhanging towards the end, this comedy is a totally gorgeous, never excruciating or ridiculous look at the problems of a "strong man" who likes to wear a woman's dress on a thread. <br /> <Julie Walters is beautiful as always, but Adrian Pasdar is absolutely trustworthy and steals the movie. He (she) is absolutely beautiful in high heels and silk stockings.
