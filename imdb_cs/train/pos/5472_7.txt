Barbara Stanwyck as a true hard cook, a waitress for the working class (and prostitute in the hands of her father) who escapes to New York and uses her feminine curts to get a job, went to a mortgage and escrow and later as a second secretary to the bank's headquarters . The dramatic study of a female character that was not disgusted, did not lose its power over the years, with Barbara performing like a storm (showing a woman who learns to be a first-rate actress in her own right). Catching a little Nietzschean philosophy into her horrified life, this lady will crush the sentiment in order, but will never lose our fascination, our esteem. It's a simple, hard-boiled cone, but it's not a fuck, not a human being or a woman hated. This girl is for herself and as we expect her to eventually learn about real values ​​in life, her way up and down the ladder of success provides stunning, sexy fun. John Wayne (with thick black hair and too much eye makeup) cares well as an assistant in the office, although all the support players are pretty good. *** z ****
