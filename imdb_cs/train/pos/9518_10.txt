Great display of one of the worst aspects of that time. I loved the visuals - very suitable for the story associated with the graphic novel. I thought Tom Hanks was really great in this, he was very good at someone who was hard-pressed by his work (he did not choose himself but still wants a normal life for his family.) He does the best he can to You do not want it to come out - but you have to see this movie if you're a man who wants more from the movie than the usual shoot / em up action / gangster format. (But it's violent.)
