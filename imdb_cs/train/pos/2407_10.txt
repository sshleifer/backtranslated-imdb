The first time I saw this movie, I loved it. It was different. <br /> <br /> I am a Christian (the Bible believes). I do not want to go with the crowd of right-wing believers. I dropped this atmosphere. <br /> <br /> For me, in an attempt to take over our government, they are doing what Judas was trying to do. I call it Judas's syndrome. Judas did not, even though Jesus said his kingdom was not from this world. This film has certainly shown some of that. <br /> <br /> I also liked that Jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his disciples. <br /> <br /> He was also a very beautiful Jesus. <br /> <br /> It's a show and a movie. Very satisfying.
