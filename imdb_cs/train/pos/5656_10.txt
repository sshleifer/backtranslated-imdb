I never remembered the name of this show. I used it when I was eight. I remember that I was late when I was not supposed to just watch this show. It was the best performance for me. From what I remember, it's still great. It turned out that he played Lucas Black and became the first boy I ever lived with. I'm from the ground, so boys with an accent have no challenge to me, but I would definitely have made an exception for him. Which, after seeing Crazy in Alabama, Friday night lights and Tokio Drift, you should see why. He's a great actor, and he's been a kid ever since. I miss this show and I wish she came back. If anyone sees where they sell in the season, send me an e-mail. kywildflower16@hotmail.com
