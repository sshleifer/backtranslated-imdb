One of the best real-crime movies ever made, and a very faithful book by Truman Capote, who invented the genre of true crime novels. Haunting Quincy Jones musical scores and awesome acting by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake as Dick and Perry, killers. Why did Wilson not be a great star after this film is a mystery to me. Black and white cinematography and adaptations in this film are top-notch. The renewal of the murders is terrifying, and since actual murders leave your imagination, they are even more terrible than if they showed that the shotgun would set off. The film was filmed in a real Clutter house, which was sold to another person after the murder. The film has a very documentary feeling - in addition to scenes on the real Clutter home, other scenes are shot at petrol stations and store the killers that actually went. Nancy Clutter's beloved horse, Babe, is even in the movie. Geer will have a big turn as a prosecutor on a short test scene, not only filmed in a real courtroom, but he also has several real Clutter murderers who have shot a jury for the film. <br /> <br /> This is a solid movie, scary every time you see it.
