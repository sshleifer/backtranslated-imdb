An amazing film that would theoretically be boring, but it comes with the finest and incredible action I've long since been desperate for what I've ever found. Instead of relying on clich√©s and overly dramatized moments, the story lies in a series of incredibly realistic moments. The characters are not perfect, so they are related to people you know is easy. The film does not try to laugh or promote the ideal to the audience but simply shows us the possibility of true love in all circumstances. <br /> <br /> Now I'm waiting for the weekend so I can see the sequel. A moving, thought-provoking, humorous view of love that, in my opinion, should be an absolute romantic classic with Casablanca and a breakfast at Tiffany. It will ease the hardest heart.
