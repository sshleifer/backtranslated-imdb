Maybe SPOILERS: Sure <br /> <br /> While watching The Lion King 1 1/2 I could not help but had mixed feelings about the whole movie. It's definitely a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes. But there is nothing about it that would give you the same feeling as The Lion King did. The story for those who have not read other reviews is about how Timon and Pumbaa meet and how they affect events in the original Lion King. Basically, there are some very funny jokes. film. My favorite part is when they point to a Simba-increasing couple. For me, however, the worst part must be when they show that Timon and Pumbaa directly interfere with the events of the original. I can never look at the "Circle of Life" or "You can feel love tonight" sequence the same way again (I'm fine with the "I can not wait to be king" sequence). <br /> <br /> The voice talents are excellent. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella do a great job, like Matthew Broderick, the one who makes Rafiki, and hyenas. Even the actor who makes the young Simba sounded like me Jonathon Taylor Thomas. But why do they even include a voice actor for Zazu? He literally had only two rows, and none of them was much needed. Adding Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller just add talent, though you still can not hear Timon's voice and you do not think about Marge Simpson. There are some scenes that seem to be inappropriate to the original, the one that comes to mind when the end of the pride is at the end. How did they have time to enter the initial battle with hyenas? As for the DVD itself, you do not have to help, but feel that the 2 disc set is especially lacking in special features. They could easily fit a comment or other aspect ratio on the 1st disc. I liked the game "Who wants to be the king of the jungle", even though this is the worst example of the crusade I've ever seen. Some of the questions are really difficult. Overall good movie, though not as good as TLK or even TLK2.
