SOPRANOS (1999-2007) Number 1 - TV Show of Every Time <br /> <br /> Everyone thought it would be a stupid thing that would not go beyond the pilot episode. The soprano has become a cultural phenomenon and has generally agreed as one of the largest television shows ever. James Gandolfini plays the mysterious criminal boss of New Jersey, Tony Soprano, accompanied by starvation. Edie Falco is excellent as a disturbing, loving mother from a high-class middle class; Tony Sirico is huge as a superstitious, gray consul who is often very entertaining. <br /> <br /> While the show was often criticized as a negative stereotype by Italian Americans as Mafia and to a certain extent it is undeniable, I see so many positive examples from the show. Expressing strong family values, friendship, love and compassion; could it be present in a gross gangster TV show? Yes. In addition, other burning issues such as terrorism, social inequality and injustice, homosexuality, drugs, etc. are being discussed. It is not a shallow, boring show about hard boys and violence. It has much more. Many of the problems we see at the show are very real. <br /> <br /> The font, which was almost perfect, has so successfully fulfilled the current problems and has succeeded in strengthening it in people's lives, making it all the more interesting. <br /> <br /> Credit has to go to David Chase, who has created an excellent TV treasure and James Gandolfini, for the show, the most comprehensive and exciting TV. <br /> <br /> Simply unusual. <br /> <br />
