In my hand I did not see a new version of "Baby Face" with Barbara Stanwyck until I got her on the TCM. What a great movie! In short, Lily lives in espionage, she has been separated from her father since her 14 years of age! Then he's still going to explode, and he killed that Lily (Stanwyck) had his own black maid Chico played by Theresa Harris. Lily goes to a big city (New York) and decides to get her to the top. It does it in style! He is seducing a crazy official to get to the ground floor and keep going through the men as a one-time candy! One flinches a fiancee and kills his close father-in-law, also Lily's daddy, then sucks! Lily is barely flashing! STanwyck is amazing as a girl who really does not know what love is. Then, in Paris, he falls to Courtland, played by George Brent, marries, but when he's in deep financial planes, she's screws. Almost free Chico and a half million, realizing he loves court! Lily is trying to find him, but will it be too late? <br /> <br /> This is the Hollywood subcode at its best. Stanwyck is huge and the look and the music in the movie are perfect. It reminds me of "Original Sin" with Angelina Jolie, another unfairly ignored woman with an amoral woman, those who do not like movies that have ultra-romantic inclinations will love Baby FAce better, those with faith in sex, love and power love it. Highly recommended! Do you see that!
