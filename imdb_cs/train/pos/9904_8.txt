Slaughter High is about a boy named Marty. He was bothered and picked up at high school. A group of children played several pranks on it, and these pranks were really bad. The last jam ended tragically. <br /> <br /> 5 years later. The gang of children will meet the proposal again. One of them did it at an old high school. The school is now abandoned and has to get inside. For some reason, the Janitor is still there, but tells them to go on and have fun because they gave him a beer. party and viewing old cabinets and seeing something Marty. One girl apologizes for Marty, but another guy will calm her up. <br /> <br /> When the killing starts, it's great. Each killing machine is creative and cruel. We see a figure in a camouflage of a jester, who is throttling all over the school. Marty seems to have returned to exact vengeance. After the first killing, they find they are stuck in school. She starts looking for a way out. <br /> <br /> Now there are a lot of illogical things in this movie. Above all, I do not know who has a 5-year rally. Second, after the girl's first dying, the girl gets blood. Everybody runs out of panic, but runs into the bathroom and finds a bath. Her boyfriend just killed her and she decides to bathe! More importantly, why is the bathroom in the bathroom. In any case, it seems that the bathtub does not really work ... and dies with terrible death, it's the 80s. that's a horror. WHEN she does, if she has some illogical parts. I do not for one. This movie has really great deaths. The end ... it's a twist. When I recently saw Haute Tension, I can compare them. The only way they are similar is that a twist appears, which disappointed me ..... And then immediately after turning around, a great, if not the best killer will appear in the film. <br /> <br /> After the last killing, the killer looks at the screen and does something crazy and it was the perfect way to end the movie. I have it "wow ..."
