The fence intellect is about as light as feathers. But the advantage here is the classic rejection of baby boys and girls that we are accustomed to in "The Gay Divorcee" and "Top Hat" is now missing. Instead of a typical random friend, the dance duo is the former lovers of Bake Baker and Sherry Martin, who have been lovers since their dance. <br /> <br /> Of course you are a 30-year-old musician, there are problems with poorly understood romance, elegant transience and mild irritation sabotage audition with the bicarbonate soy Ginger award for something strange. And then in a great tradition of declining finances, nothing better is Hollywood's best fun than the exhibition. <br /> <br /> Throughout the show, the adorable numbers from Irving in Berlin meet. Top hats and evening dresses are kept to the end, which remains a refreshing change. Fred and Ginger are out there to enchant the world ... and the Navy magic. Everyone and everything is just fun. <br /> <br /> Pure classical stupidity at best. But with Astaer and Rogers, we know it must work. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.25 / 10
