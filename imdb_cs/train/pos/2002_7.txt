To some extent, I enjoyed this film better than the original VAMPIRES. I find that the film is quite misogyny. As a woman and a horror fan, I'm accustomed to the fact that women at risk are the basis of this genre. But they just slap Sheryl Lee around too much. In this movie, Natasha Wagner is a full-fledged figure and the main thief is gal! Arly Jover (who played the assistant in BLADE) is very strange and deadly. Jon Bon Jovi ... all right, yeah, no great actor, but he's okay. At least he does not start singing. If possible, secure it on the cable. It's in action Encore this month.
