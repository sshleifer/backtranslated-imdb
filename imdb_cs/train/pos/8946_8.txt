This impossible story is about a female wizard who follows a dead man in a deadly world. Its "community" is open among its members, but it hides its witchcraft from mortals. Hmmmm ... it starts to be noticeable. LOL. It's not your typical movie. The very "campy" performances of Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs keep things out of boredom. Kim Novak is always a pleasure on the screen, but I found her pairing with James Stewart unusual (but not fatal for the story). With a new interest in all things hot and dark, this film deserves to discover and re-discover the old and new audience ...... It's still a HOOT!
