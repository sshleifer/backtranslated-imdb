I really loved this version of Emma the best. Kate beckinsale was amazing because Emma and the strong brand were very good as a knight. the only complaint I had on a mansion of wood ... I can not believe that one could cheer so much, or be so selfish with his daughter's life ... she was a smart girl in the end. as always, I love the places where these films Jane Austin were shot. settings are so spectral. that's why I would like to visit England as much as Ireland and Scotland) I think the actors selected for this movie were also a good choice and all the other stories are getting closer to Emma! I'm glad I should have looked at this.
