Absolute classic! Direction is flawless, playing is simply excellent. Words are falling for this great job. The most definitive film about the Bombay police. This movie became a test of time. Om Puri gives stellar performance, Smita Patil no less. All the actors have done the most, and the movie races are excited at every moment. This film will sweep all your bad strength and force you to rethink many of the questions facing our company. This is the story of a policeman (Om Puri), who begins his career as an honest man, but eventually degenerates into a murderer. First attempt at Bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about Bombay cops. Kudos to Nihalani! <br /> <br /> After this film, there were many Bollywood films that uncovered a crime-politics-police link. This movie was really a trendy setter. This trend has dominated the Hindu film scene for more than ten years. <br /> <br /> This movie was a mild box office hit. <br /> <br /> You have to see for the demanding fans of the movie.
