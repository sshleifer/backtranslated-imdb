I never met one person (out of hundreds) who would hate this movie. Assume anyone who votes is a small saboteur or the victim of one. This movie has everything. Ask yourself, "Are you a fan ...?" Then look at "Laputa". <br /> <br /> It's not my favorite movie, but my favorite IS is run by the same person (Hayao Miyazaki). In any case, this is my first five. And I saw a lot of movies.
