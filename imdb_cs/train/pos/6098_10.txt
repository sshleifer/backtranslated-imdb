This is a horror movie show that will do the right thing. Friday's 13th series had no connections to the movies. Poltergeist Heritage: I'm not so sure. Maybe he was loosely connected to the movie. They feel as if they were just throwing a famous title at the show, so the fans will watch it. It shows that Freddy burned Elm Street's parents (in the first episode I believe) and the number of parents was disappointing. With all the children who went to the first three films, you would expect them to have more parents. But well. Freddy is basically a narrator for the show. He observes how sometimes someone is involved in some people's activities in the real world. Just as other anthologies look like tales from the crypt, there is a supernatural or surprising ending. The activity lacks, but believe it or not: violence sometimes overcomes the film. This show lasted several seasons and was performed around the time of the 4th film. I heard it was canceled because of the protesting parents. I looked a lot of R rated things like a kid, so his parents who had the damage had to destroy everyone. After the series came four more films, so it was not a complete loss.
