I've seen this movie for at least fifty times, and after watching it for the first time last week for a long time, I still believed it. The story itself was unbelievable, but Spielberg's experience and splendid cast included Whoope Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover and Margaret Avery. Akosua Busia earned an Oscar nomination for her short but powerful Nettie display. <br /> <br /> When watching this movie you will experience all human emotions. I laughed, wept and mourned. Like most of the great movies, he looked at the Academy with a number of nominations, but without a victory. But this film is undoubtedly one of the best films of all time.
