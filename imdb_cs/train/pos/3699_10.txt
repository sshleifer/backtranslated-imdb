"Whoever loves the sun" walks through someone's prickly object with enough joke and grace to make the story not only impressed but also cheerful. It's a moment that I found such a touching, thoroughly enjoyable film. <br /> <br /> The film is beautiful, drawing an eye with beautiful scenery and tranquil scenery. Silent images contrast greatly with the tension between very human, very defective and yet very sympathetic figures. Thanks to the excellent cast, all five major players are incredibly exciting and dynamic. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Who loves the sun". It's a really funny movie that looks really good for the pain we can interact with, and for the amazingly difficult but equally enriching process of forgiveness.
