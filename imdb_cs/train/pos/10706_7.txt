This is a good example of a film that, despite the low rating, is more than just attentive. The story is nice and it does not last long until the chitrin between Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin draws your attention. This is the first class and the characters are well represented. Sometimes it seems that the director could not decide between drama and romantic comedy. Ben Chiller is a portrait of a legendary and shy Englishman with pornography by S.M. magazines hidden in the bedroom create a lot of moments of laughter! Just like Nicole Kidman's eyes when she offers John her first intimate taste for a long time ... Otherwise, actors and especially Nicole Kidman give this comedy a quite professional drama.
