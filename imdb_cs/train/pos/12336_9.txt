Outstanding time-killer melodrama, with Fontaine playing effectively against its naive flower so far, in the role Olivia DeHavilland allegedly refused. That's fine because Fontaine is amazing. Scripted by Charles Bennett, who wrote for Hitchcock in the 1930s, and also later wrote an excellent screenplay for the classic British horror movie Night of the Demon. The opening scene, in which Ivy visits a sinister osteasin player who plays amazing Una O'Connor (hell of James Whale's glory), is a tour and power, and the film keeps interest in a whole host of horrible machinations. I hope to see this movie on DVD sometimes, but the desperation of what is happening, because it seems like I do not deserve a dark movie. Luckily, I've seen it at AMC seven or eight years ago, but I have not seen it since. Catch you if you can!
