An amazing romantic comedy about an Italian widow (Cher) who is about to marry a man (Danny Aiello) until he falls to his crazy crazy brother Nicholas Cage. The script is sharp with lots of great lines, the acting is amazing, the accents (they say) are the perfect letter and the cinematography is beautiful. New York never looked so good on the screen. Must-see especially for Cher and Olympia Dukakis - they are both fantastic and richly deserved the Oscars they got. Beautiful, funny movie. You must see!
