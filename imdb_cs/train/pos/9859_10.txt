Ice Age is not just Animation of the Year (in my eyes), it's also the best animated movie I've ever seen! Teaser excited me last year and I spent many happy hours on the website. Scrat is fine! And so are the rest of the Sub Zero Heroes. <br /> <br /> Animation is great. Your heart really goes to the characters in this movie. They have good dialogue lines and are well developed. It's hard to say which one really stole the picture. I experienced their journey with laughter, tears, and astonishment. Nothing has been forced or completed. The emotion was real, especially in the dramatic second half. The last film that influenced me deeply was Anastasie in 1997, also Fox Production. And before that, it was The Land Before Time 1988. They all have real charm and try to entertain the whole audience, not just the cynics. <br /> <br />
