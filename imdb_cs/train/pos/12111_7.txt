When I first started watching this anime, I never thought it would be interesting, but fortunately I was wrong. From the moment I started watching her, the anime simply pulled bread into the world, I was addicted. The biggest advantage of this anime is humor, which is very intelligent and very entertaining, with some repetitive gags. But the animation, soundtrack and character development are below average, while these drawbacks are not seen so much in the first episodes, because of the great work on this anime, it really starts to show in the last 20 episodes, when reactions and repetitive gaggles just get old and not so fun as before. As for me, if this anime ended with an episode of 52, I would give him 9, but the last episodes just leave a bitter smell that unfortunately can not be discharged by amazing 50 episodes. <br /> <br /> 7/10
