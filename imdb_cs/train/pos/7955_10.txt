This is one of the biggest movies for children and pets ever created. She crys every time I see Shadow shout: "Wait, wait for me Petro!" how a family car pulls out. It is necessary to see if you love animals! Best movie ever! The lines in the movie are sometimes stupid. Just as when Sassy says Chance; "Cat's rule and dogs are falling!" Lines like this I could do without, but when I was six, I bet I loved this line. The story may seem playful for some, but I like it. A shadow like an older dog that prepares a chance to take over for him when he is gone really moves when you think about it. It reminded me of my baby's dog. I think everyone can find something in "Homeward Bound".
