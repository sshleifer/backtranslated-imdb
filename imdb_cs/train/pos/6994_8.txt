Bela made 9 pictures for the Monogram, but it was only at TOHO, the 4th, that things started gathering. All others in a row would use this as a basic template for production, writing and character development. From here, better or worse, the series would also address one basic theme: a scientist (usually Bela) conducts experiments in the basement or in an old house (sometimes in the basement of an old house) that causes things to melt. This was also the first time Artistic Director Dave Milton got the chance to spread his wings. He came aboard for the BLACK DRAGONS before he appeared, but THIS is the place where his craft will begin to knock. Lewis made a great atmosphere for nothing but nothing and was around for all the other Monograms. Casting is the key to this, and it's a pretty good B movie wise, here. You'll get Barclay and Harlena (also from BLACK DRAGONS) along with Russell, who will star in Lewtons' CAT PEOPLE ... and Rosetto, from SPOOKS RUN WILD ... a nice piece of Poverty Row talent. If you have limited time and budget, start with this ... summarizes everything they've learned up to this point, and gives you something you can compare with others. Plot? Bella steal the yellow juice to keep her unhappy woman young. Both loved sleeping in coffins. If you can read and smile, the rest will be easy.
