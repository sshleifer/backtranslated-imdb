Well, what can I say, other than these people are in every respect Super. I like Sharon Mcreedy, I enjoy this clean Nostalgic series And I have a box set of 9 discs 30 episodes, I did not know they did so, I also think it's a great shame they did not do more. I wish I had these powers. Imagine being unlucky somewhere, and when he's betrayed, then he wakes up in a special hospital. Later I will find that my body has improved. Just like Richard Barrat. These stories are 50 minutes of pure action and tension all the way, you can not fight these 3 people because they will beat you in all forms of weapons. The music is well written and for me it has a wonderful picture of 3 super beings in my mind. The kinds of powers that champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cat, Improved sight, Improved hearing and touch. and the power of 10 men for Richard and Craig and the power of three women for Sharon. Who thought she was beautiful and intelligent. When I was a boy, I had a great grieving for her !!!! Now I see why, on my DVD set. The box is very nice and comes with a free brochure about the series. I also thought Tryman was a good boss, but it's done!
