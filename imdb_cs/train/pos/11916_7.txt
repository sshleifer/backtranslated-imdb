With all the grown-ups for adults in today's family movies, it's nice to see where you do not have to worry about just sitting and enjoying your family with your children. Yes, this movie can have several promising words (it's a time when Knox swears, but does not allow you to hear full words), but for the most part, this movie is as pure as it comes (including back-to-back movies in the day). Not only is it very nice, it's one of my favorites and just a great clean and fun movie she's watching with her family. The only thing I have against this movie is that it's too short and I wish there could be more of those unforgettable parts that are in it, they will not be mentioned because I do not want any spoilers here. <br /> <br /> Everything in all the pretty done and great movie you can watch; so go out and get kids, do some cookies and watch this movie!
