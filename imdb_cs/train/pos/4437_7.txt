This police procedure is no worse than many other times and better than little. It's obvious that it's in "Dragnet" and "Naked City," but it sounds like a nice programmer. The best thing is that the world that is now a long way to go, has a blurry look ... the lower class of New York from the late 1940s and early 50s. Here it is in all its glory, from old school salons to cheap hotels to greasy spoons. These old police films are like travelogues to the past and very hot for anyone who does not like the disinfected, soulless panorama of today. <br /> <br /> Also interesting is the emphasis on the nuts-and-bolts scientific aspect of the solution of the crime ... in this case the murder of a tattooed woman found in a deserted car. Our main heroes, detectives Tobin and Corrigan, are doing their feet, but without the hard work of "lab boys" they will not get anywhere. Although this technology is not in the same league, policemen use the persistent persistence of C.S.I. to find out what their husband is. The way some reviewers wrote about this movie thinks they would be controlled by Ed Wood and were bonuses from his films. How much! I liked John Miles as an ex-Marine gang, who became a policeman Tobin ... he had a happy, happy and easy access to a role that is a welcome change from the usual stone faces of most of the film's longtime filmmakers. Patricia Barry is cute and adorable as her exciting girlfriend who helps solve the crime. Walter Kinsella is exhausted and droll as the older detective Corrigan. I really liked the chemistry of these two and did something slightly different than a robotic approach "Dragnet". The secret itself is not too deep, and the final pursuit and shot will certainly not be among the classic crime films, but during its short run, "Tattooed Stranger," more than my interest.
