Club 700 provides a great view of world events. Some called it rude or cheese. I consider the program to be informative and inspirational. It is natural that many people throw mud on a program that has proved successful. There are very few shows that can show the 40 years of success story in the world of television media and the 700 club is one of them. While Mr Robertson may have mistakenly said that someone should be murdered, I do not care that so many people literally go over to criticize. I have certainly said some foolish things in my life. I would certainly be willing to forgive Mr. Robertson because he culminated in a great show.
