The main problem of the first movie "Vampires" is that none of the characters were sympathetic. Carpenter learned from his mistake and this time he used a favorite vampire hunter and charismatic vampire. The female vampire Una is surely the best vampire from Blade's Deacon Frost. Unfortunately, while there are some good concepts such as a relaxed restaurant restaurant scene (why Carpenter does not use more of it?) This movie is not as good as it could be. I expected to see strong vampires in action and at least one long-lasting well-choreographed combat sequence (for example inside the city) and was a bit disappointed. While "Los Muertos" advances at a fast pace than its predecessor, it is still stretching somewhat in some parts (though nowhere near as bad as "Vampires"). Like "Vampires", however, this peak of this film near the end is not too intense. Most of the above may sound like "Los Muertos" is a bad movie, but definitely not. This is generally pleasant and belongs among the better entries into the genre. It's not even a non-original Dracula remake (like just about every other vampire movie out there), nor is it an unintelligible action show like Blade II. It could just be a little excited. <br /> <br /> I really want to see a third installment from Carpenter, but it probably will not happen. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING the end was too predictable. One should get away - it would make the film quite unusual.
