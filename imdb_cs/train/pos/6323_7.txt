"Welcome to Collingwood" offers some of the most fun dialogues in recent memory. Watching this comedy, directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Russ, reminded us of maybe another movie we saw in the past, but because we lacked the initial credits, we had to wait until the end to find out that we were reminded. 1958 Italian film "Big Deal on Madonna Street" directed by Mario Monicelli. The Russian brothers made a magnificent actor performance and presented all the characters in the film. Anything with William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, late Michael Jeter can not be bad. Since it is a piece of the whole ensemble, all the characters will get an opportunity to shine on. The film presents us a group of unnecessary, safe baker's bakers from hell. No one could think that these men could do a job like the one they perform. Anything may go wrong, and that's what he's doing. George Clooney has a small look like a master cracker, who is also seen as a rabbi, only to be confused with the priest by members of the gossip based on Cossim's funeral. The best way to enjoy the movie is to sit and relax, and let all these little time cheaters do their thing. Let their funny lines laugh at you because everyone can see that this gang is doomed from start to finish!
