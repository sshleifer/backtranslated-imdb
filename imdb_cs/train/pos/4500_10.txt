Hunky Geordie Robson Green is Owen Springer, a young doctor who moves home to Manchester to be close to his father. On the way, she drops to Anna, a 20-year-old woman who has become the wife of her new boss, Richard Crane. Despite the warnings of her new colleagues, Owen continues to get Anna for herself, going so far as to Sabothy Anna and cheat Richard's marriage. This is a romantic drama with many humorous undertones and quick jokes. Actors are excellent: Green "Student Prince" and "Touching Evil" smelders on the screen as a cunning but warm heart Owen; Annis of "Dune" fame is alive and proves to be good with Green; Kitchen, from "playing the King" is the right threat as Richard, whose comic mistakes and snobbers underline his masterful, building hatred for Owen. It is a perfect love triangle, and despite the weaknesses and mistakes of our three characters, you can better get to know and watch them.
