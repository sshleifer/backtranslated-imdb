I enjoyed this movie on late late television and all the interest saved my whole picture. This amazing spooky, yet mysterious English home, with poor looking decorations and exhausted furniture, and rooms that ask you why someone would like to rent this house or even own it. There are four (4) Stories about this house and every householder encounters all sorts of problems. You will notice the beautiful lake and pond in the vicinity of the home and the sweet singing of the birds, but do not let it deceive you, there is horror everywhere. Peter Cushing, "Black Jack", "80 gives great performance as one of the living people and even Christopher Lee," Curse of the Crimson Altar, "68 and his little daughter, Chloe Franks (Jane Reid), a wonderful exciting story together, his daughter for some reason loves reading WITCHCRAFT BOOKS! If you like spooky, terrifying and mysterious movies, with lots of surprises, it's a FILM FOR YOU !!
