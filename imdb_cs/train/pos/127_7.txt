Zentropa has a lot to do with the Third Man, another filter-like noir between the debris of post-war Europe. Like TTM, there's a lot of inventive camera work. There is an innocent American who is emotionally involved in women he does not really understand and whose naivety is even more striking in contrast to natives. But I have to say that the Third Man has a more well-done storyline. Zentropa is somewhat unadulterated in this regard. Perhaps it is deliberate: it is presented as a dream / nightmare, and therefore is too coherent it would spoil the effect. <br /> <br /> This movie is unafraidly cruel - "noir" in more than one sense; one never sees the sun's rays. Grim, but interesting and frightening.
