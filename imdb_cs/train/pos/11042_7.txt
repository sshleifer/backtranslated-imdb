In prison four prisoners occupied a cell: Carrère (Gérald Laroche) who used his company to commit fraud and was betrayed by his wife; lover Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and his protegee, retarded Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud) who ate his six-month sister; and intellectual Marcus (Clovis Cornillac) who killed his wife. One night Carrère finds an old journal hidden in a hole in the cell wall. They realize that the book was written by Danvers (Geoffrey Carey) at the beginning of the last century and is about black magic. They decide to read and use their content to escape the prison when they find the truth about the fate of Danvers. "Maléfique" is an original, fascinating and claustrophobic French low-budget horror film. The story is practically the same, it does not have the cliché and attention of the viewer until the last scene. I am a great fan of French cinematography, mostly novels, drama and police stories, but I remarked that I recently saw some good French horrors such as "Un Jeu d 'Enfants", "Belphegor" and "Dead End." My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Sinais to Mal" ("Stamps of Evil")
