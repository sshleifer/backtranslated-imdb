This movie has everything you want from the action movie. Blasts, shootouts, bad guys and worse guys. It's fun to see James Belushi, who got out of his humor to get out of the trouble he got because he stole $ 12 million from top boss "The Skipper" It sounded like it was, of course it is. I'm having fun watching this movie. It's much better than any direct DVD rubbish that is being done today. If you can get over a silly plot before you find that this movie has quite a few surprises in the store. You could guess how it can be predicted, but the rapid pace of this film does not give you too much time to think too much, which is a blessing, because this film does not concern the revelation of the final reversal. only the title is a bit misleading, and that could be the reason why so many people hated this movie, probably expected a movie about gangsters instead of some cheaters who crossed each other.
