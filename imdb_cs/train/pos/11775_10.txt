This, along with "Hare Tonic," is one of the best Bugs cartoons, which is really one of the best Bugs. There are some remarks about how the mistakes in these cartoons are "basic," which means I think it's not yet fully developed. I really prefer this "basic" version since the mid-1940s (Chuck Jones was the best version), which is actually much more rabbit and much more fun than any long-legged version that ran through Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck. Errors of the last day have become more appealing and more sophisticated to my liking. See also "Hare Hair Raising" (1946) and "Rabbit Punch" (1948) for great examples of classical mistakes and classic Chuck Jones.
