This show has all the characters in a comedy: a good guy, an idiot, a degenerate, a rich girl ... but it's set in the 70's. That's the only difference she has with other television comedies. I do not know how you like this show. His humor is pathetic! I mean, the jokes are so straightforward ... The typical dialogue is as follows: "Fez: Oh, Jackie I wanna have sex with you (the audience laughs) Jackie: You're a perversion (the audience laughs) Fez: Oh, audience cheers and clapping) "It's not funny. I think if she did not have the laughter (I do not know what you say in English, I'm sorry), you will not laugh at all. This is not a smart comedy, it's an insult to the public. I like most American comedies, but that's not good at all. I could have 4 out of 10 (I'm sorry I am again poor English.)
