Sharp and well-shot documents focused on Mardi Gras beads. I've always liked this approach to making movies - I've been telling ideas about a bigger, more complex and often unpredictable phenomenon by sharing the problem with something familiar and close to home. I am sure most people have heard stories about the shops and understood the basic motives for profit and capitalism and the influence of globalization on the poorer nations (but people feel it). Rather than explaining these objects and getting to the soapbox (not that it is not a bad thing, other than such documentary films usually preach to converts), this documentary simply shows Mardi Gras beads as they are produced, what people and under what conditions and how consumers are used at the end of the process. It opens and thoroughly investigates the motivation of all those involved in the process, including workers, factory management, US importers, and ultimately end-user consumers. I felt a little wrong; but also the way in which workers in China have adopted their situation as normal and parallel to the course (although they have some objections to the details they are controlled). The footprints of the street sweepers, which at the end cleared the beads from the streets, made a special impression. But it was just my reaction; I see how anyone else could read this document a little differently. Unlike other documents on this issue, I do not think you have to have any particular political opinion that would be affected. This is ultimately a story about human beings and our relationship to the goods we produce and consume. If you've ever purchased a product made in the Far East, you should think about it. <br /> <br /> Excellent and highly recommended. You need to see more documents like this one. Whom all the creators of this film.
