I do not understand your objections to this movie. It's a tense, exciting extension of the character created in "Basic Instinct". The only part of the story that is least unrealistic is the fact that Sharon Stone's character is still alive and is not in jail at this late date. SPOILER ALERT: As the film progresses, we are presented with three theories of what is happening: 1) Characters Sharon Stone kills all these people because he is a "Risk Addicted"; 2) Wicked cop David Thewlis kills these people to create the character of Sharon Stone; 3) David Morrissey's analyst kills these people for revenge. It seems that what most people worry about is that none of these theories ever express themselves as a "real" story. (Although the analyst is in a psychiatric care facility for killing a cop, the only killing that appears on the screen.) I think this is a brilliant fence in the spirit of "2001, the cosmic odyssey." WHO DOES YOU WHAT IS REAL? The blonde is really crazy, the cop is really bloody and the analyst really wants to avenge. The interaction between these and other characters in the story is important. As in real life, everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks, and reality is more complex than film. Get over it!
