***** Spoilers here ***** <br /> <br /> What really scares you? Are sharks a murderer, or perhaps spirits trying to bring a message? Maybe it's a motorbike with a psychopath? Maybe. These concerns, however, are not even the same with the horror that people dare not even talk about - not the death of their own children. "Pet Sematary" knocks on this base, the primary adult fear, and then takes her to the places she could not carry the most. I have read comments on this movie that contain bad acting, characters make stupid decisions, etc. I disagree. The game is actually the first rate for such a movie. Perhaps it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario. But movie events are not only logical but they can be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario was possible. This is the real horror of "Pet Sematary": It is not that pets and people from the dead return as evil killers who hunt knives and scalpels that anyone who lost a child could be so desperate, the crimes that Louis Creed . Despite the warnings or even the past. The film takes those who want to go into the depths of the desperate human heart. The protector's heart tries to heal that he is unable to protect himself. And the results are frightening. In fact, when the movie sinks into the slasher territory near the end, it's almost forfeit, though I believe it's totally logical how it got there. I am a true horror fan, and I say this is one of the most horrible horror films ever made. If you do not think so, you will see it again after you have children.
