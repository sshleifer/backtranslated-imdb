This movie is amazing. If you take it too seriously, of course you will hate; however, the amount of "guys" and "right ones" brings laughter and faint memories about 15 years ago. I like his ability to just want to reveal the jokes and stupidity and the ability to make me want to watch my predecessor, "Bill and Ted's Outstanding Adventure" (1989). If you are looking for a movie full of jokes and full of humor, do not look at it; However, if you want a movie that is humorous and stupid, yet smart and engaging, you will enjoy it. I really wish that another form of painting appeared in today's theaters. And hey, that's Keanu Reeves, who acts like everyone's parodying as acting ... right ... it's not much better than this :)
