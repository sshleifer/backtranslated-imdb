Give this pleasant music MGM is invented and only occasionally entertaining, dealing with espionage and romance, but the film's attention is properly focused on melodic interludes featuring an extremely gifted and athletic faucet dancing Eleanor Powell, instigated by Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, featuring Ziggy Elman, Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra. Red Skelton shares the highest billing with Powell, and he and sidekick Bert Lahr get most of the comedic minutes, though Skelton is more effective when he, if it can be believed, acts as Powell's loving interest, Virginia O'Brien actually provides the most humor of the film as a dancer companion . Powell's technical brilliance is proven during one unbelievable scene in which Buddy Rich contributes to his drumming and has to be seen several times to allow breathing to catch up with its precision. Director Edward Buzzell uses his big cast well to be able to move after the action, regardless of the rather incoherent scenario he has to deal with, and allows Powell's kotangent inability to manage the matter as appropriate.
