Herbet Clutter, wife of Bonnie and their teenage children Kenyon and Nancy were very popular and respected in their small town of Holcomb, Kansas - but in the early hours of November 14, 1959, all four were brutally murdered. A rather unexpected crime caused an impression on the author, Truman Capote, who plunged on the scene and followed the story of the case. The result was an IN COLD BLOOD. Controversial, shocking and extremely well written, it has become an international bestseller and remains a milestone for this criminal scene. The film version of Capote's 1967 work is almost as remarkable as the book itself. The film is black and white in many places in real life, has a slightly documentary quality, icy and separate - and the overall cast is exceptional. This is a film on which Robert Blake's reputation as an actor is, and deserves it. Like Perry Smith the killer, Blake captures you between deep reluctance and shock of unexpected sympathy. it's a masterful performance from start to finish. Like Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is just as gentle. Like Capote, the film opens with Smith and Hickock as they travel to Kansas and bring them to Clutter's house - just to suddenly disappear around the crime in more detail to investigate, which eventually led to their arrest and conviction. The center of the movie was always the moment when we finally saw what happened in the Clutter house; actually shot in the house of Clutter itself, is a sequence that is terrifying and deeply disturbing. Director and writer Richard Brooks leads the film with a very strong sense of deliberation, erroneously only in the sense that it allows the film to preach slightly. However, due to the overall strength of the film, it becomes a trivial anger. Strong things - and recommended. GFT, Amazon Reviewer
