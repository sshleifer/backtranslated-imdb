Although Lang's version is more famous, Borzage's work is not rid of interest, far from him: his "heavenly" succession is even better. The Metaphor of the train (possibly borrowed from the end of Abel Gance's "la roue") is ultimately more convincing than the "heavenly world." <br /> <br /> Borz√°g's tenderness for his characters shows in the character of Mary, and love for the grave is one of his favorite subjects (the end of the "three comrades"). the park seems to be everywhere: we see it even when we are in the poor house of Mary. I do not think the sets are very rich, they are stylized to the bug. The fair at a distance almost gives sci-fi the feeling of the film. <br /> <br /> Borzage has never forgotten his social interests: he is rich in the celestial train, can not concentrate on it, but as a "chief judge" he says: "There is no difference here" <br /> <br /> This is not the main work for Borzage (or Lang's version), but to find out if you are interested in a great career by the director.
