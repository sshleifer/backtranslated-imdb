This is a cute and sad little story of cultural differences. Kyoko is a beautiful Japanese woman who escaped to California to escape from an unsuccessful relationship in Japan. Ken is a Japanese American handmade worker with rock and roll aspirations, but has little concrete to offer a potential partner. Kyoko has "married" Ken so he can stay permanently in the United States, although they will live together until he gets a "green card", but marriage will be in the name. Soon, the sides are not at the same wavelength - or perhaps in the same "time zone," and hence the name of the film. As an immigrant lawyer, I saw such "arrangements" for my own life, so I was pleased to see how well the filmmaker developed the dramatic possibilities of this situation.
