I only had the worst day in my life. Then I came across this cute movie, looking at it, and now I'm ready to go out and kiss the street lamp. I have to admit that I watched it for only two reasons: VERA-ELLEN FALLS. But it's a lot more. The conspiracy is actually quite smart and creatively woven. It's almost like a Shakespearean comedy with all its wonderful misunderstandings. And of course it's also ... Vera-Ellen's Feet. The only unfortunate aspect of this movie is that the version I bought (the "100 Classics Family" from Mill Creek Entertainment) has the best video quality, and I've heard the same version of Alpha. Brightness and contrast are a little too high, so many scenes look faded, especially when Vera is dancing in white dress. But I think you can control the control of your TV to compensate it. I can imagine how it looked like on a big screen in 51. Stage sets, costumes and colors are otherwise dazzling and wonderfully scary - as if in the vein Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. As far as romance is concerned, it's just perfect. It's not sappy, it's not fancy, it's not melodramatic. Only 100% ahhhhhh. Damn, you bad schmucks, your miserable life will never be as charming as this. Har har. Wait for what I laugh at? My life is as angry as you are. Damn it. It's time to watch this movie again.
