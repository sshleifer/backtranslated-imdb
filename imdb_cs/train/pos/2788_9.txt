These are so-called "feel good" movies, but it's a bit sad. Why? Because I had talent, but my parents did not allow me to study at the sports academy, as well as the fact that at the age of 12 I decided to end football. And football is the red line in this movie. Along with the fight, young people have the expectations of their parents. Anglo-Indian girl and her parents with their traditions and strong family ties and on the other hand an English family with a lady who dresses like a boy and plays football ... a combination that her mother fears! This film also defines the lives of ordinary people as well as the Indian communities in England. It's about believing in your dreams and living one's life (where we heard it earlier). Paraminder Nagra (Beautiful Women!) Plays Yasmindu, a girl who does not care about the boy, new clothes, make-up and typical 17-year-old girl things. Contrary to your sister Pinky, fill in the opposite of Yasmind. It must be real to see how a young beautiful girl is struggling with her parents' traditions and eventually finds her happiness. With great music from Blondie, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, Melanie C, as well as Indian hit songs. Pleasant to watch, but if you have ever played football like I did and I never did it up then this movie will do melachonic.
