Now either you like Mr. Carrey's humor or not. Me, I and Irene had audiences who walked in glory, and on the other, they cheered and collapsed in piles of joy. Bruce Almighty is a little more mainstream, but you were warned. <br /> <br /> If you are not sure, check out the trailer. I saw the trailer three times and still laughed with the same gags when I saw the movie. If you do not find a look at a dog that sits down after using leo funny, do not bother with the movie. Carrey, a reporter stuck in a college covering "brighter news", takes God when his life seems to go to the pot. God takes the challenge and asks Carrey if he can do better. Carrey gets into the swing that she has all the powers of God by raising his girlfriend's breasts (Jennifer Aniston), upsurfing and responding to all the prayers with one command of the computer. a spectacular film or even unforgettable, but it is very well done within its very limited intention, providing almost continuous laughter to Carrey fans, and even all religious cheese is probably harmless to all but to the most successful goddesses and anti-horns. <br /> <br /> At a much more thoughtful level, the film tries to speculate about her own career, Carrey - stuck in her "comedy" that has largely failed to make her impression as a serious actor after the victory of two Golden Globes. His most successful "direct" role, The Man on the Moon, is less well known for his comedy romps - or The Truman Show - where the academy jumped three nominations while circumventing Carrey.
