The Cure is an amazing movie ... so exciting and just REAL! I was lucky to have captured the show "The Cure" at the NYC premiere and completely kicked me off! I also heard that she won the prize from this particular festival and definitely deserves it. The first thing that hit me was cinematography. Eric Giovon did a great job. The style of shooting a love scene in the middle of the movie was amazing. In this movie, a love scene was needed, and Jafri gained exactly the point, but he also retained a tasteful scene. Giovon and Jafri are an excellent creative team and they should definitely work together on future projects. Judy Maier's story was so unreal, but sympathetic to my heart, I felt what the main character felt. I'm a very tough critic, but I must say that The Cure is one of my favorite movies .. JUST LOVE IT! If you have not seen them yet, look at it!
