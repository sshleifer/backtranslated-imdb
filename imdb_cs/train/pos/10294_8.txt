Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman together with Jennifer Aniston combine one of the most amusing films for this 2003 season (late May) and a good improvement on Carrey's past crazy and personally forgotten roles in past comedies. With slightly weakened Carrey's browns, but with the fascination and cracking of his old self, Carrey has this movie laughing ridiculously, and some dramatic, tepid dark moments. The elements of Jim's real acting skills continue to appear in this film. This gorgeous summer fun strikes most of the buttons, including dramatic elements along with strange moments that fit perfectly with this script. While he lacks a perfectly polished comedy / drama, Bruce, the omnipotent one deserves recognition for being a great movie, along with a firm message and gentle spiritual cynicism and parody that preserves its good character. Eight of the ten stars.
