I saw it last night on TV and was quite pleased. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that helps you feel comfortable and warm around the heart and you believe that there is still goodness in the world (all neighbors pretended not to see what grace she is doing to help her and protect her her - old policeman is my favorite), even if you know this story is not entirely realistic. I loved acting (they all looked just as ordinary, ordinary people living in the small picturesque English coastal town), but the greatest in the movie was the joke and humor she has! Just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies after their "tea"! Perhaps the end was a bit confused, but he did not really stop me, he really enjoyed the whole story!
