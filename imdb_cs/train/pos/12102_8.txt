It starts with a bet between Edgar Allen Poe and a journalist ... Poe bets that a man can not spend the night in a haunted castle. Of course he can do it, but he will be without hesitation? It's hard to tell all the weird people who do not hurt, including Barbara Steele. This is a rather strange film in that the presentation is both in French and English, and it goes back and forth several times. Maybe it happens because the bits of dialogue are lost? It's also somewhat dark and claustrophobic because you do not see much behind a small circle of light that plugs and generates candles, and there's always a sense of fear and impending doom. This version (Synapse) is also uncensored, and I was wondering what could be censored in the 1964 movie until I saw a starless scene, I guess it will probably be. Overall, it's pretty good and in gloomy black and white. Barbara Steele is also making a movie. 8 out of 10.
