I went to see Ashura as the 2005 Fantasia Festival Kickoff. Man, that was a great start. The director was supposed to be at the Canadian premiere in Montreal, but for health reasons he's still in Japan ... oh, I hope he'll improve and make a lot of other movies. is rather simple but somewhat original ... demons are born in Edo in Japan and the Swordsmans call it "Demon Wardens" kills them and fears the rebirth of Ashura, the goddess of demons who sleeps and is supposedly a very kick-ass. /> <br /> He brings us to Izum ... an elite fencing called 'Demon Slayer' and his friend Jaku, who is a typical violent jealous fool ... Does it seem boring to you? Well, now it collapses .... Izumo took his retirement from the killing of demons because he killed a little child to "the impression" that he was a demon, he never knew but he had killed her. So Izumo continued with his life and recycled in the Kabuki Theater. In a joyride boat on a beautiful night, Izumo hiding a girl hiding on a bridge, changing her life and repeating to kill the demons ... for the good thing, the cause of love ... and damn ... the man knows how to handle the sword and pull out a fun massacre. <br /> <br /> Izumo carries the film in terms of playing ... it's a total package ... he knows how to fight (hell yeah he knows), he's funny, he's smart and he has a mark. You do not have to scream: "NO IZUMO, IT IS TRAP" The guy already knows he has a common sense. He's a real hero. As for cinematography, aesthetics are quite interesting. It's by far the film that looks the most like a manga. It's creamy full of special effects and nothing at all costs prevents this movie from looking realistic ... it's pretty amazing. Lots of colors and "unreal" photos, besides ... it's pretty simple ... but as I said, the main character carries the film And he has to see, a story led by master hands
