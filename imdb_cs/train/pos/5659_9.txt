AG was an excellent show of drama, tension and thriller that is so rare for US television. Sheriff Lucas gave viewers a lot of viewers. We buried Caleb as he tried to resist the prejudices of Sheriff Lucas. We became interested and frightened when we learned about the unthinkable connection between the two characters. The weekly manipulations to fear what Lucas would do was really surprising. This show turned into a "gothic" moniker in ways that American entertainment so rarely attempted, much less mastered. Suits definitely made a big mistake when they did not support this show. This show hides the current transition of "real estate" shows - which are less so than satisfactory tracking. The challenge for the DVD box is well established. This show is a high-quality viewing for a demanding market that is hungry for quality tracking. The public, who is tired of overexposing realistic tariffs, welcomes this gem of real stories. Bring the DVD set!
