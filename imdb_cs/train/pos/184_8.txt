There are no people like "Show People" Marion Davies (like Peggy Pepper) and William Haines (like Billy Boone). My introduction to Mrs. Davies was a "clip" of this film; gorgeously spoofing in which it reduces the scarf and reveals various emotions. My introduction to Mr. Haines was just watching this movie; although it's possible I saw him in a less memorable role. Haines makes an incredible impression when he joins Davies to the Commissar meal-throwing his hat into a circle with some beautiful pieces at the dinner table. Haines and Davies actually deliver great comic ideas. The story begins with Dell's Hollywood daughter, Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper), to be the latest perception of Tinseltown. In fact, Davies and already accepted Haines become comedy stars. But Davies desires to become a true playwright. Davies leaves Haines and collaborates with temperamental dramatic Paul Ralli. But the audience favors Davies in more comic roles; maybe director King Vidor offers a case for life-imitation art? <br /> <br /> Full of great location in Hollywood, both on set and out. Full of large "portraits"; in a studio lunch on the Davies table, sit between Douglas Fairbanks and William S. Hart. The best "bit" player is Charlie Chaplin, who has enough nerves to ask Davies for her autograph! While actresses are entertaining, they and episodic sequences help "Show People" become a less important film and a more important historical document. <br /> <br /> ******** Show People (11/11/28) King Vidor ~ Marion Davies, William Haines, Dell Henderson
