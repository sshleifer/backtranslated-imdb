when I read another comment, I decided to watch this movie ... <br /> <br /> First of all, they were specially cast by Michael Madsen and Tamer Karadagli; well enough ... <br /> <br /> The film is very intelligent and interesting because it has a lot of international special European actors and actresses, such as Turkey and Russia ... <br /> <br /> Second, the story is basic and you can guess, but if you have an interesting action a good game that you will like ... <br /> <br /> Third, the closing chapter is not special or interesting, it is regular as other action movies . . Finally, I recommend watching this movie ... And I hope you will like it: D
