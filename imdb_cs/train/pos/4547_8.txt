That could be 10 if it was not for the reasonably predictable and Hollywood scenario. Daniel Day-Lewis confirms his position as one of the leading actors of our time (why should not ask at all) and the rest of the stand at a very high level. Personally, I was overwhelmed by Hugh O'Connor, who played Christy Brown as a child. The first scene I watched was really strong. Wow.
