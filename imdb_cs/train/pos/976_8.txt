Takashi Miike's intrusion into children's areas drove me almost instantly, demonstrating his nerves and bravery in dealing with fantastic elements. This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark. Even as a child, I thought that in most fairy tales there was something ominous; horrible things have become people in most children's books. Miike understands that these classic stories are a little more frightening (and more disturbing) than what seems to be at first glance. The filmmaker took the child's archetypical story of a wonderful pre-school class expedition. It highlights the very real concerns of a world full of endless dangerous missions. Westerners like to worsen the severity of sleeping stories written specifically for children. I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. It's going to juggle the story, but it also shows tracks. But Miike is more and more foreign than most of the creators. I thought it was a great movie. Highly recommended.
