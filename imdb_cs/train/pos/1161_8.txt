It was an extremely low budget (some scenes seem to have been uploaded with a home video recorder). However it has a good plot of plot, and its easy to follow. 8 years after filming her sexually abusive step, Father Amanda is released from the psychiatric ward with the help of her physician with whom she has a secret affair. The doctor ends up renting a house and buying her car. But during the first 20 minutes of the movie, Amanda kills him and loses him in his backyard. Then she sees that her neighbor Richard looks at him and stops at him until he reaches him. She behaves innocently, but after another neighbor Buzz finds out that Amanda has killed the doctor and tried to kill Richards' wife Laurie (that's Amanda and him in the whirlpool). Then he stops acting so innocently and kills Buzz and later attempts to kill Richard, whom he supposedly loves and cares for. And you'll have to borrow a movie to see if Amanda dies or not. All in all, a good movie reminds me of a lot of my life, you know that you're all falling to your neighbor and stopping in it until you connect it.
