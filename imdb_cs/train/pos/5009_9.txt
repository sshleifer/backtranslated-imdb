As the first of the television specials offered on the complicated box set "Barbra Streisand: TV Specials" released last November, this disc is released separately for those who do not want to see dollars for all five special offers. As an investment, it's really the best when it comes to Streisand's purest and most eager attitude. Being so brilliant is her key legend. Signed on a long-term contract with CBS on the production of hourly varied shows, nowadays almost lost format, this CBS was the first broadcast in April 1965 to Streisand all 22. At that time, her acquaintance was limited to a handful of best-selling albums, a few brilliant television performances and talk shows, and her successful Broadway in Funny Girl. <br /> <br /> Movies are shot in sharp black and white, the program is divided into three different parts. With the creative transient use of Disney's "Alice in Wonderland," I'm Late, the first segment cleverly shows that she's growing up from childhood through numbers as diverse as "Make Believe" and "I'm Five." She opens with a comic monologue about Pearl from Istanbul, the second part moves to the elegant Manhattan Bergmann Goodman where she is elegantly dressed in a series of charming clothes while singing songs from a period of depression such as "I Got Plenty of Nuthin" and "Best things in life are free "with comic irony. Back to basics, the third segment is a straightforward concert that opens with the torch version of "When the Sun Comes Out," featuring "Funny Girl" medley and ending with its classic melancholy "Happy Days Are Here Again" over end credits. It also includes a short introduction, which she shot in 1986, when she was first released for the first time on VHS. For those who know Streisand only for expensive concert tickets and political fundraising, it's the real eye for the eyes of why she is now so honored.
