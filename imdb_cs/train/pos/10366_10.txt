Unqualified "10." The level of writing and playing in this Australian film recalls the best of the "old" Hollywood. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are very good together. Neill coincides with Streep's line and takes it for granted - it's one of the best showcases of her great acting talent and is in his sexy and gorgeous best, no matter the intensity of his role. This fascinating film is an attraction for every film fan who loves the fascinating dramatic drama depicted in the most human but unsentimental concepts. The film - which has won some of Australia's finest awards - boasts not only an excellent actor and director, but gorgeous and authentic Australian sites. It proves that people are the same throughout the world. And after all these years people are still pleased with the repetition of the famous Streep line, the accent and everything: "Dingo ate my baby!" Including that imp "Elaine Benis" to "Seinfeld."
