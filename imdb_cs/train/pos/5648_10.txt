I recently bought a complete American Gothic series on the DVD and remembered it alive. I was very grateful to see for the first time episodes that were never broadcast. I loved the "Fire of the Ring" especially of stories I did not see for the first time. Gary Cole is fantastic as "evil, sexy" Lucas Buck. Lucas Black as Caleb is also an excellent player. I thought Brenda Bakke as Selena Coombs was also excellent in her performances. In fact, the entire cast was fantastically talented and had great chemistry with each other. It is a pity that the series has been networked (in secret with a growing audience of censors) because it was actually designed for adult viewing. The combination of comedy, tragedy, farce, satire, gothic novels and horror genres has offered great characterization supported by genius-level negotiations. <br /> <br /> I had the finest lust for the devil once in my life. Long live Gary Cole (Sheriff Lucas Buck), the most expensive "fallen angel" at all.
