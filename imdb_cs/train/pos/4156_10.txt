I've been watching a lot of episodes of a cold case since its premiere (especially now that Immediately follows The Amazing Race, but it was one of the best examples of writing and playing that I saw from the Bruckheimer's home.) Casting, especially younger officers, was in place, and scenario and editing, soundtrack and acting made this episode of the tour of force.If I was a producer I would give this episode for Emmy consideration. It's amazing how complete the portrait was made of Coop and Jimmy within a 48-minute episode, which means there are plenty talented people who do the best. I hope he is warned in advance when this episode is repeated because I'm sure I will notice a lot that I did not notice for the first time.
