I'm just looking at the two Pang brothers, The Eye and One take. When I watched The Eye, I was a little disappointed with these two boys, whom I had heard good words about before. The movie (eye) has a really bad script, especially the end (childish, clich√© and in my opinion is too consistent), but its still good pictures and experimental pictures. So I decided to look at One Take and I did not disappoint again. Still great photography, amazing picture, MTV style adjustments, great music and this time the story has a lot of indie spirit, logical and beautiful, you will see some tiny plot of holes, but it does not cause any trouble with the story line. The only problem with this movie is that I have a bad DVD.
