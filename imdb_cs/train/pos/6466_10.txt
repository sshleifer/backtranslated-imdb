He really loved this movie, just like the audience I saw in Los Angeles. After the film, many people cried and said how influenced the film was. I see why he was such a huge hit in his homeland in Sweden. The film is masterfully controlled, and each character is greatly exalted so that by the end you really know these people and care for them. Music is very natural and the main song in the film is quite hearty, but inspiring. Certainly, this film would recommend everyone to see - even people who do not normally go to movies with subtitles. He definitely deserved an Oscar nomination due to the deep film themes that were reflected without prejudice in a small-town community with ordinary people. It is a film that connects us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit. YOU MUST SEE!
