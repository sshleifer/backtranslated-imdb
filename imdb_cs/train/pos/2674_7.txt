If there is a redundancy to leave the ship, the ship, the bus, the bus ... it's a way of losing time, then you should go back to Hollywood movies that wrap this part in one assembly to get the money of the shot. and it will leave you unconnected and in the cinematic language that results from the fact that you do not really see the reality of life. The long-lasting travel sequence actually allows the viewer the same frustration and sense of waiting in the rows that the characters must endure. Frustrating? Yes. Vital? Indeed. the language of this journey is the key to the "indifference" of this Turkish family. Beautiful movie with great acting performance. Sad, but worth it.
