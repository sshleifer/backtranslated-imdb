Either or, I love pausing a conspiracy formula in this movie. I've visited them many times and it's always going. A bit too stylized for some, but I think every lover will love it. Norman Jewison, a Canadian colleague, has tremendous chances with his films and casting and almost always pays off in movies that are out of center and somehow tastes like this. I have often been interested in the inadequate role of Cherov's role, whether she has decided to minimize this part of her life, or she does not get enough good roles to chew. I found out she is a great actress who can retreat to a role like this one, or be loud and courageous and wild as in a "mask". Sometimes I discovered comic corpses (the Cinderella hairdresser), but that was the intention of both the writer and the director. Nicolas Page plays the horror tenor of the opera, all the extravagant gestures, in one place demanding a knife to cut his own neck. Brooklyn's scenes are magical, that's Brooklyn under moonlight, romanticized and dramatic as well as opera. Overall, a very satisfying film that did not make a long shot, I loved the end, all united as a Greek choir, each part was finely nuanced and mixed with others, the camera pulled down the corridor and let the player speak. 8 out of 10.
