<br /> <br /> If you like rap or hip-hop, watch this movie, although it's funny if you do not find references as a direct comedy. <br /> <br /> They did not see much of the CB6, but what I saw did not have the heart that this little stormer has. <br /> <br /> They did not hear from the people who participated in it, which is a surprise. The film is very similar to Spinal Tap, which is not a bad thing, and I think much of the dialogue, though in tap it's invaluable, is more fun here, probably because I'm more than rap rock days so my own judgment to talk about tom. <br /> <br /> Rap songs are fun as hell and basically it's the place for most of the movie, not all are on the face, which means physical comedy and one-liners get priority before takeoff. <br /> <br /> Great fun, one to watch twice, if ever a movie.
