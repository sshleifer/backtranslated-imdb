Another great taste, such as the superhero movie after Batman: Dead End, which only helps to stimulate our taste buds and leaves us wanting more! That's what a real superhero movie should look like and feel! Even heavy it's a fanfilm. Attention to detail, character and activity is undoubtedly real. Although it is a limited production of resources, the big, starved, hyped production of "other" superhero-related movies is shaming. Here the main and supportive characters act and appear to be real people. Finally, a superman who actually looks "super" and looks like a real thing! Batman, as it should be, without appearing crazy rubber, ripped the armor to the body to cover the gnarled characters for the over-paid actor they did not deliver. I just wish some rational Warner Bros. exec made it OK to make a complete adaptation of this jewel. I do not care if it goes to theaters or directly on DVD, I never enjoy watching. Only the land itself is worth the fact that I scared the dough very hard. I hope that "bigwig" on Marvel & DC's productions will look and see what a really great superhero movie should look like. No more "Batman & Robin", or Hulk, Daredevil, etc. Learn from these little time directors and learn that there should be no reason to "re-discover" the movie hero just to have a "bomb" of theaters. Mr. Collor ... We need more directors like you!
