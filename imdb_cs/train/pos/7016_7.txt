Even though I can understand the bad things someone talks about this movie, I still thought it was absolutely amazing. It will touch you, and if your critique does not go deeper into the shortcomings and accidents of each movie, or simply does not touch anything, it's worth seeing. Do not go to the movie, you're waiting for anything, just have a tissue box and an open mind. It's beautiful and acting is great. I think Will Smith, despite having another lonely depressed individual again, is amazing. I believe that a good actor is someone who can really portray feelings and emotions that we all have in our worst / best experiences so that they get to you and cause you to feel something. And that's exactly what this movie does. Give him a chance.
