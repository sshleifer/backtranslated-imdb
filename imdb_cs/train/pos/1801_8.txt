I saw this movie when it was originally released in 1989. I was pleased with it and I still do it. But now I realize it's a "mature" G rated movie, especially the notion of dying and going to heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work great together, and Reynolds's singing is good for dogs. There are some good songs, from Let's Make Music Together to "Home to My Heart". I found it good, even if one or two times tangled. The last scene of the film with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the saddest I've ever seen in animation. The movie is worth the effort.
