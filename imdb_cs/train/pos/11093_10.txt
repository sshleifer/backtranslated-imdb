It's a great "little" movie. I say "little" because he does not have a hundred weapons or a dozen blasts, as in John Woo. Outstanding performance by Roy Scheider and three "bad guys". It seems that John Frankenheimer is more lucky with small productions these days. The movie is very easy to watch, the story is rather a yarn than a washing machine - instead of everything that happens around and around, it looks as if things get worse when the fence is shrouded. An amazing end, very positive. I have never read Elmore Leonard's book, but he can not differ from the film because it seems like watching Elmore Leonard's film.
