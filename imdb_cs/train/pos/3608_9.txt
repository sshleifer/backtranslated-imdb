Sports films have never been my business, but a small part of them works for me. The best ones are those who are less focused on sports and characters such as Raging Bull, Wrestler and Girlfight. This is a great directorial debut for Karyna Kusamy and an excellent first performance for Michelle Rodriguez. The girl feels both realistic and engaging, it's enough to become an unforgettable film. Diana Guzman is in his fourth year of high school, but the expulsion is about to take on collections in the corridor. As a possible means to unleash her anger she enters her boxing lessons at a club where her brother is trained (at the request of his father). Within ninety minutes, we see something extraordinary from viewers. Diana almost literally changes from girl to woman. We see it in her body as well as her behavior, especially when one of the boys in the club finds her approaching her, and she gets into it. The movie is not a bad scene or a bad moment. The only bug I would say could be corrected is that one of the subplots ends in what feels like an unfinished note. In addition, Girlfight is a great movie.
