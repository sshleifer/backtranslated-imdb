Gorgeous Barbara Bach plays Jennifer Fast, a television reporter who travels with her crew (Karen Lamm and Lois Young) to Solvang, California to cover the Danish festival. The problem is that their hostels have fallen and all hotels in the city are full. So they travel outside the city to a remote location and take advantage of the hospitality of seemingly friendly Ernest Keller (phenomenal Sydney Lassick). You would not know, Ernest and Virgin Mary's humble partner (Lelia Goldoni) are hiding a great secret in her basement: angry, deformed, dressed in juniors (Stephen Furst, in a remarkable performance) that eventually terrorizes girls. <br /> <br /> Delicious Lassick plays the true monster in this disturbing horror movie. Slowly, but surely, builds on an intense confrontation / climax which gives horror in small doses until the last half hour. Hotel and Cellar Prejudice - Big echoes "Psycho" here - are great settings. The predominant conspiracy lies primarily in incest and patricide, allowing the film to get a truly dark quality. And yet it becomes feverish to realize that Junior is not a one-dimensionally bad bogeyman, but just as a victim as a girl. The last shot is particularly sad. <br /> <br /> "Invisible" is a small horror film worthy of discovery. <br /> <br /> 8/10
