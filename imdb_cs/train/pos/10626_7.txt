It's a decent little film in Michigan, about a guy who's impressed with his past, with his inappropriate stepfather (Gunnar Hansen), and he grew up not so well dressed. In fact, it is totally insignificant, but it tries to be too obvious. He also has an escort, his own little demon and an angel who followed him. The demon never speaks the word, but he does not have to, and he is Max Schreck - scary. Let's just say that the angel is turning around in this regard because Eric is busy doing things that make him feel better, as the "liberation" of people that he chooses to need, mostly beautiful young women. It's a decent picture of madness and you're a little bit self-conscious to see what's going on, but overall I've been watching it from the very beginning to the end with a very focused on the movie because it definitely took my interest. In some areas it is a little inadequate, but nothing I can really put my finger on. Dignified effort and worth seeing if you like serial killers.
