A great movie and a true story. Dan Jansen the greatest skater ever. A sensual and beautiful film that the whole family can enjoy. The story of Jane Jansens is fighting cancer, and Dan Jansen loves his sister. The important promise that Jansen had obtained to win the gold medal to prove that his sister Jane was right that she believed in her speed skating talent was justified. This picture is worth it. I wish they made more films of this quality. Thank you for a great movie with great actors and a great story. It is a very moving story about beautiful family support and faith for your children and a special dream for their youngest son and sister.
