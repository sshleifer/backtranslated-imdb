I rarely came out of viewing the movie with such a warm, happy feeling. I felt like I was really good friends and had a great time! I look forward to this film. The acting was great, even though I would have to mention Bill Nye in particular as an absolutely perfect performance. Bill is a great actor and would like to see him in more films. Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail are also popular and always like to see because they are so powerful. And Billy Connolly, as always, absolutely beautiful. It was a great show of all the participants. Such a refreshing experience to see a well written, great acting and good-looking movie.
