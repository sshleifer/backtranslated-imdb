Most of the complaints I've heard about this movie really came to one thing: It's not Versus. Yes, the cast and crew are basically the same. Yes, Kitamura throws a few shots in combat scenes that come in the second half of the movie, but that's where similarities end. Versus takes place virtually everywhere, proving that Kitamura has the ability to create an interesting B-movie in natural sites. For Alive, almost everything takes place inside. In small, confined spaces. Here is the design of art embossed into your face and what art design is! We are treated into several very complex and interesting spaces and our characters are largely limited to these spaces. The key difference is that we do not care much until the end of the movie. Versus was all about action and cool, here is much more emphasis on the characters and the situation and the confusion of your mind. That's why Alive is a much more interesting film than Versus. You can not jump and go to a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of cold zombie bloodshed, but you will sit stuck to the screen for almost two hours watching the interactions of some really interesting characters. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Now I'm extreme that I ordered the DVD despite some naysay. You should also! But be aware that this is a different animal than Versus - it is often slow and requires a little thought to make it as good as possible. I hope that Media Blasters will take over for the release of the R1 DVD title!
