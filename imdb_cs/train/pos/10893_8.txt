It's a good thing I leased the movie before I saw ratings from this site. It was a great movie to add to my Christmas selection. The theater was greatly chosen and Ben Affleck plays a good role. I would say to viewers who did not see the movie to go and buy. I rate it with Christmas. The film was very entertaining and well written and Ben plays eccentric rich power very well. The things they say and do is how I imagine a person who has too much money to negotiate. The movie is much more fun than Santa Claus and Christmas with the Kranks. In addition, it has a good story and teaches the real meaning of Christmas that you can not buy love with money.
