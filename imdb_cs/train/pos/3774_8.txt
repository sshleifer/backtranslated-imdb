In the sequel to Brilliant Bill and Ted's excellent adventure, Bill and Ted are threatened by the future, as evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as Bill and Ted, to kill Bill Bill and Ted to change the future. <br /> <br /> In a great comedy pairing, Winter and Reeves excel to give the audience a delicious humor in this fun sequel. Although lacking the sharpness of the first, Bogus Journey still has big phrases and dialogues from the lead couple, not to mention the funny performance of William Sadler, who brings humorous figures to a deep figure, a poor javelin. Look at the game sequence, the best moment in the movie, but one of the many great techniques used to justify the genre. <br /> <br /> Although this film is still full of humor, this film has a more dramatic film, with more serious concerns and risky situations. <br /> <br /> This gives the film a great dimension and another love affection. The creators also stretch the boundaries of the genre's fantasy and the use of realism, with hell and the sky is strongly symbolic and present in the conspiracy. The fantasy genre is back in place with this amazing machine for travel per hour, though again somewhat confusing at points using timings and objects and situations that are placed before it happens in the present as seen in the last pair of the scene. The first watch I hated this sequel, but the second time it was a real joy because I appreciated the jokes and the story more and although the jokes and the plot are not as strong as its predecessor, Bogus Journey has ample feelings of good motifs, jokes and a fairly constant plot to become a good family film.
