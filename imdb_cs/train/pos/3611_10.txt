I saw this movie after seeing Blue Crush and other Michelle films, I thought she had a meaningless future in this store. I was extremely bad after watching her show at "Girlfight," and I was surprised to catch the emotions of a fighter but also a fighter. In this film, the way she confronts her father about her and her brother's treatment, anger when he gets hit.Her characters learning the curve in the movie she cant always build a wall and hide from love, or just because she has a strength that will not win. I believe that this role was perfectly good for Michelle, although she had no previous experience, the director saw talent, I criticize for not seeing her talent.
