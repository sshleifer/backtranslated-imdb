Probably the most straightforward installment of the first season, "Shore Leave" has its ups and downs; some parts are stretched too long and others are inadvertently shortened, but they can not deny that they used everything except the proverbial kitchen sink to make it a fun episode. It seems that Kirk and the crew have found the perfect sea-holiday planet after a long tour of duty left everyone on board who needed rest, rest, and so on. It seems to be a uninhabited Earth, with beautiful scenery and an ideal climate. The first hint that this might be a little bad is when McCoy, the leading forward team, captures Alice (from Wonderland) to a big white rabbit with a vest. Kirk shuffles and finds others who report similar bizarre events and encounters. The only thing everyone has in common is that each crew member was thinking about the person / place / thing they discovered just before they discovered it. It does not immediately return to Kirk or anyone else. Another special feature, including the observation of Don Juan, the Siberian Tiger, the WW2 fighter, etc.; Kirk meets Ruth, a beautiful old girlfriend (of course) and bullying from his academic days, Finnegan. Chase / Finnegan's fight scene takes too long, but at the same time McCoy is riding a horse and apparently killed. Eventually an older man appears and explains what's going on. The Planet is a futuristic "theme park" where visitors only present something to appear. Nothing is still; McCoy is not really dead. Once it is explained, Kirk decides to order a holiday for everyone. Despite the fact that "it was all a dream", after all, "Shore Leave" is the first episode of the first Star Trek season.
