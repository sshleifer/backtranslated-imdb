I do not understand why they chose to release this film to put American viewers on the dynamo that is Jet Li. Fist legend would be a much better choice. But the black mask is not terrible, but it's definitely not great. The final battle order is well presented by Yuen Woo Ping, who continued the coordination of The Matrix. However, the English edition suffers from gross editing and dubbing. (I want to study in Hollywood to unleash these films without a title.) Jet Li shows her distinctive charisma in the lead role and Francoise Yip has a great but short role as a 701 female <br /> <br /> The Black Mask has a special Gothic style , which brings a certain interest but is overloaded with a weapon and an explosion. More focus on the fantastic physical abilities Li was fine. The black mask is a decent film but do a favor and pick up the Fist of Legend if you want to see a huge movie that really shows the skills of Lion.
