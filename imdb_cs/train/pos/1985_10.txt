I'm not usually a lover of musicals, but if I had to choose what would be my favorite, it would certainly be Oliver. This movie is so well prepared, the characters are well-drawn, the costumes are in place, that the acting is good and the songs are great, my favorite creature. "Reviewing Situation'sung by Ron Moody, who gives a brilliant portrait of Fagin. I was not old enough to see Oliver when he was released in the late sixties, but my sisters were, so for weeks I had to sing with them singing bloody songs, usually it was "Who buys my beautiful roses," so I already knew all the songs before I saw the film. It's a timeless musical, you certainly could not do it, it's on its own, it's not accurate to this book and I do not think I do not think Charles Dickens was disappointed when he wrote to Oliver about poverty in London, children's homes, jobs, and what the poor had to resort to survive, and that it would work so well if it were. the movie shows them very well. So another great reason to watch this movie is Bullseye the old type of English bull terrier, noticed his long thin legs, this was reared from the breed many years ago, they had hit high and low to find a pattern like and he is just like the English bull terrier would look like in Victorian times. He found scars on his cheek (which is probably a make-up), Bill Sykes probably used it to fight dogs or a rat pit. The Victorian bull Terrier recorded a record number of killings in the rat's cage. He's a beautiful dog in any way, and he notices that he does not listen to Bill Sykes after killing Nancy, apparently has his standards that his nephew Bill Sykes thought it was not. a great musical instrument that interests you if you like musicals, and if you do not like musicals, try it anyway, there's something for everyone in this movie.
