Perhaps the film itself is not one of Jackie Chan's best films, but I think everyone agrees with me that fighting a small town is one of the best fighting scenes ever made. There were also some unforgettable pieces that were so impressive that they made this film a classic action. This film has influenced a number of other action films, and I think filmmakers should learn from this film, who could learn today (as if they could break out of the chase scene, with modern technologies doing better). There have also been some fun scenes that make this movie enjoyable even though Jackie has not been fighting. I think they could put more combat scenes in this movie.
