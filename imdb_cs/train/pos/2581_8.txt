People are too hard on the film. Sometimes we should just sit down and enjoy the story without "evaluating" it. The whole thing is hiding when Hackman decides not to pull the trigger, but his target is still falling. Then the fun begins, because everyone around him is also "going". Just think that JFK and all the people who somehow got involved with his murder, who's life ended up in sudden and dubious ways and appreciate what's implying in this film. <br /> <br /> I think it's an excellent explanation of what could have happened. Although the EXACT RULE my story was not followed (back view here after Jim Maars "Crossfire"), but that's what it is suggested to be interesting. I'd like to get a copy of it to repeat it. In light of what is known today, the Domino Principle is directly on.
