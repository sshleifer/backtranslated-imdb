<br /> <br /> I suppose it's not the best movie I've ever shot, but I voted for ten stars. Mainly because of my feelings at the end. Me and all the people around me just touched. This is something you do not often feel. We all got a little cynical and full of sentimentality, lazy manipulation, or preaching in modern movies. The story focuses on Jane, a young woman in the late stages of the MND, and the friendship between her and Richard, a man on the brink of decay. It could be so unobtrusive and worthy work, but it's so humorous, humane, and it lacks the sentimentality of winning you and it's likely it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> Branagh and Bonham-Carter's acting is particularly great, the second one, which is always believable and powerful in its role. Chemistry between the two also lifts the film. <br /> <br /> The name comes from the masterpiece of Richards, an aircraft made from junk mail and its old paintings. Flying here is a symbol for both Richards and Janes, who lives to the fullest that one can continue and the other can face the end. <br /> <br /> A beautiful and funny movie I'd recommend to everyone. Do not let the topic postpone.
