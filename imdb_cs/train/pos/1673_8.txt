An excellent Martino ride, it is a lively and friendly giallo with a gentle performance from a good looking cast and with two outlets, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg. <br /> <br /> For me, the sketch of the plot puzzle is so intricate and confusing, just sitting and enjoying rather than trying to predict. When everything seems to be solved, another series of twists, pleasant twists, we must be told. <br /> <br /> Sexy with a lot of bloodshed kills this well-done film with London, Athens and Greek coastal sites. The superfans on the Aegean rocks wound things up, and they all had fun.
