Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites. It's amazing how much he throws himself into every character he's playing, making them real. I remember that many years ago we had parties in our house - friends came, we sat around the table, ate, drank wine, talk, laugh - have a good time. The TV was turned on - it was a movie we did not really care about. Then all of a sudden they all stopped talking and laughing. The glasses did not squeeze, the forks did not move, the food cooled on the plate. We could not tear our eyes out of the screen where a young man was crippled, whose entire body was against him, and who had only control of his left foot, lifted a piece of chalk with his leg and what seemed to eternity attempted to write only one word on the floor. When he finished it, we all knew we were not witnesses to one, but three triumphs - a triumph of human will and spirit, a triumph of cinema that could capture such a moment in the movie and a triumphant actor who did not, but which became his character. Jim Sheridan's "My Left Foot" is a thrilling, unsentimental bio-drama about Christy Brown, the man who was born with cerebral palsy in the Dublin Slum; who became an artist and writer and who found love for his life. <br /> <br /> I like everyday from Day Lewis (I have mixed feelings about his performance in GONY) but I believe his biggest role was Christy Brown in "My Left Legs"
