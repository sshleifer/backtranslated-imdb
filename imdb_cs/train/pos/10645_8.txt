Advent Hitler's manic urge to save his will to the rest of the world is the subject of this second in a seven-part series of films made by the US Military Department as an instructional tool for new soldiers entering the armed forces during the Second World War. Hitler's plan was methodical and well-conceived, beginning with the conquest of Eastern Europe, expanding into the European heart, and then moving to "World Island," consisting of Europe, Asia and Africa. His last step would be to reach the oceans for the ultimate conquest of America and the world. In 1935 Hitler ordered a national army duty, while the rest of the country fell under his evil spell. School children sang their praises, and young German boys attended training and indoctrination in military camps. He marred ruthlessly to Austria in 1938, Hitler succeeded in joining a strip of land adjacent to Germany and Czechoslovakia called Sudetenland. In 1939, Hitler captured all of Czechoslovakia. Later that year, the world was overwhelmed by the fact that he had learned that Germany had signed a treaty on non-aggression with its deadly enemy by Russia, which was trying to delay Hitler's military involvement on too many fronts. Immediately afterwards, Germany invaded Poland and brought Hitler's conquest to the Russian threshold. He could deal with her later. During this period, Britain still refused to stand up against Hitler across Europe. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain felt he had won a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with Germany and his infamous "peace in our time" statement. It did not work. <br /> <br /> The most interesting information we can find out in this installment, at least for me, was provided with a small snippet of the German record for the Hitler rally in the mid-30s. It was led by a German American, who turned straight from his homeland. Venue - Madison Square Garden!
