This movie has no story. It's just about a group of men who tortured an innocent young girl to death. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> , turn it on a chair until it starts, exposes her to loud noise, pours boiling oil on it, puts worms in her ulcers, crushes her hand with a muscular hammer, and finally puts her needle through her eye. The film was so realistic that if I did not know it was fake, I would think it was a snooping movie. Although I was disgusted with this film, I really liked it. It scared me. I think it fulfills some purpose. I give it 10/10.
