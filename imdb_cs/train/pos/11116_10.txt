"Godfather", "Citizen Kane", "Star Wars", "Goodfellas" None of the above comparisons with the complex brilliance of the "Sopranos". Each character has layers of absolute truth, completely and completely three-dimensional. With all our heart, we care about Tony Soprano, although in the simplest model of good vs. evil is evil. Soprano is the most progressive, intricate and fascinating protagonist once created for this point in history. If you are in the mood to be openly attacked by the viewer and always change your feelings for entertainment, watch "Soprano". I do not agree to sit down and watch the first episode of Season 1 and not want to continue the series. Each season is brilliant in its own way. DVDs are essential for every 4 **** collection
