one of the most fun mario I've ever played. levels are creative, there are fluid regulation and good graphics for your time. there is also a number of mad bosses and enemies to fight. Sometimes the levels are frustrating, and if you omit some of the hard levels and still need to get better in the fight with the boss, it may be unpleasant. another complaint is the camera angle; Although it works quite well most of the time, it can be pain in certain situations. if your big fan of mario time; this is for you. Even if you were not his huge fan, I would recommend this. his big game and getting what you need may take a while, but it's very satisfying. good for playing in short time slots. will almost certainly keep your interest; it definitely holds mine!
