I also came back from Redeye's advanced screening and I have to say that I have not seen a movie for a long time. WES CRAVEN is in his best time at all. It brings us the amazing end of the summer thriller I desperately wanted. This is the thriller of the year ... no doubt. <br /> <br /> All the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun. F / X were great. It is still creating tension. I was at the edge of my place most of the movie. It was a time when I heard the audience happy and applauded and excited at the theater. <br /> <br /> If your summer is looking for excitement, action and a good plot in the summer, REDEYE delivers. Go for it!
