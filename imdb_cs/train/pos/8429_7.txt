Absorption (though repetitive and rather didactic) analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way forward or upward where it seems to be the only option to try to feel better by breaking and removing the one who is below you. But here too, in this desolate waste of lost dreams and without the future, it does not work, and the addressing of something or someone to comfort and share with a simple charity gift gives some reward even though it only makes the present bearable by reviving the memories of the past. Although there is little real violence on the screen, it is a brutal and brutal film about a small deployment of oppression (politically and personally) that does not allow easy entertainment. It is clear that, based on the play, with a small cast, a wider wider relationship to the general social and political environment helped the film reach a wider audience.
