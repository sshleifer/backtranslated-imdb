Children aged 7-14 have received such a huge kick from this film that we have passed a copy to all the other children on our birthday list this year. They all loved it! Children aged between 2 and 7 are watching it repeatedly and often, and we get kicked out of sight with them. It is rare that the movie entertains children for so long and offers laughter for adults, too. Most enjoyed more than the first one. <br /> <br /> The highest production and outstanding cast, led by Christopher Showerman as an outstanding George - athletic, energetic and utterly trustworthy, with blatant innocence and a peculiar face that took a tree into his face - well supported by Christina Pickles as an evil mother-in-law , Thomas Haden Church as a bad opponent and everyone else. This is fun.
