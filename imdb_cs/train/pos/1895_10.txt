I've seen it over the Christmas season, I do not know why, but it reminds me of Christmas, so I watched it so we're there. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a movie that I look with all my strength with a big, smelly smile on my face and its mix of special performances, great cheerful music and scenarios by cracking the joke and the charm that make it happen. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore makes a character that can be very easily hated (spoiled, rich, lazy drunk who feels sorry for himself), but transforms him into someone you love. Liza Minelli is great as Linda Morolla Queen Waitress, who can pull from the hard / soft inside of Mrs. Arthur almost to give up her world. John Gielgud gets all the juicy lines and polishes them. <br /> <br /> I can watch Arthur again and again and I always feel good, check out if you need an elevator for his beautiful movie.
