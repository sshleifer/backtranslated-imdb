as a habit, I always want to read through the "hated" reviews of the movie. especially one that I would like to comment on. and it is not such a counter-agreement; I just want to see what people say about what's going on. However, I want to deal with one thing. many people who hated it called it to paraphrase "beautiful but shallow", some even went so far that a normal desire, but still the inability to help its brother, was at best a space conspiracy. > I would disagree. <br /> <br /> As a brother of a sibling who has similar dysfunction, I can relate. every day you see that they abuse themselves because they only know that their current journey will inevitably lead to self-destruction. and that's not about the specifics of what they did when; how or why Paul decides to accept gambling and associate with dubious people; it's a lot more how they're connected. on the one hand they are real geniuses and on the other hand painfully self-destructive (they are more like people like Howard's hughes - the same forces that drive them are the same forces that separate them) and all the time you see this you know and what it's worse, you realize you can not be damned. Norman Maclean, the river passing through this was probably the way to find an answer to why the tragedy had to occur and who was guilty. in the end, no one is, and there is often no reason. but it really requires personal grief to really come to that realization. sometimes it takes a lifetime. and sometimes it will never come.
