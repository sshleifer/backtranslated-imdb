I think that this film contributes to diversity and is very accurate in terms of historical reconstruction. The way it shows that different communities are leaving together in Thailand is very interesting ... Portuguese, Japanese, and various communities are governed by the King. The paintings around the courtyard are, as usual, a struggle for power with great betrayal. The wardrobe is all right. The film also takes place in Thailand in reasonable production. The scene with elephants as bailiffs is very interesting. It's fun and I think it's also usable in schools for its historical accuracy because it shows that Europeans in Asia were objects of local kings in a way very different from the traditional Hollywood perspective.
