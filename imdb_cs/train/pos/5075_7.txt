Well-prepared run-of-the-mill movie with a tragic end. Pros and cons: the way the story moves - begins with Soory, who is trying to live, followed by a long flash of why he's there. Music. An unbiased look at the lives of police officers. Minuses: Violence and gore, but I think they deliver realistic effects. Yet it would be possible to avoid human heads that were cut and sent into boxes and sacks. <br /> <br /> No complaints - 7/10
