If there is one thing that should be recommended about this movie, it's interesting. The presumption will surely attract the audience, because it's a secret, and there are signs around the film that there is something dark about it. However, there is not much tension, and Williams's slight maneuvering does not mean that we would associate with his obsession with the boy. Collete is much better than women whose true nature and intentions are not very clear. The production felt hasty and the holes were obvious. It certainly feels like a preview for a much more complex and better effort. The book is probably better. One thing is certain: Taupin had to write something really good that inspired at least one praiseworthy effort.
