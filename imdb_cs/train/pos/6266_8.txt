This image is very high for me, because it is an extremely entertaining and fun spoof Alien Invaders taking over the city and many of its' folk men. The city and the players are all categorized in a 50s style style and the whole movie has a deliberate, shiny and cheeky feel. Some scenes are funny like the birth of extraterrestrial creatures. All actors give full and serious performances that make the film even more fun and special effects, and strangers seem at least deliberately the third measure to add to the fun. <br /> <br /> These types of films often deserve cult: <br /> <br /> 8/10.
