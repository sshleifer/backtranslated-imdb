For the first time, I saw that this movie was in the eighties, but this time this thriller is still re-evaluated. Some more recent films focus on similar topics but do not match this French milestone. <br /> <br /> The president - of course JF Kennedy - is shot in an open car during a public performance. The resulting huge investigation finds that Lee Harvey Oswald's film is guilty, but one member of the jury insists on further investigations. He reveals some surprising evidence ... Unlike JFK Oliver Stone - a film with the same conspiracy - this does not play with emotions but focuses on the exciting description of the plot and how it all coincides drawing a new picture of the assassination. Even a real psychological experiment is used to explain this crime scene. Compared with JFK, this film is more sensible, intelligent and exciting. You can find parts of the plot in a lot of newer movies, in some cases I've had some dejauu vu, who sometimes sits in the cinema. <br /> <br /> "I ... the funny Icare" is "must see". Its unique and brilliant and Ennio Morricone's music is wonderful. This movie deserves a very good rating, if it was a production in Hollywood, it would be famous. <br /> <br />
