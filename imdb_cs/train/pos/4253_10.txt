really great movie, one of the best I've ever seen. It touches and is just - like life, sometimes you cry, sometimes laugh and it's beautiful. not too much, just as it should be. He really loved the idea of ​​the film, no one is bad or good, all or just people, sometimes they make mistakes mostly because of the pressure of society, everyone is trying to stay strong and some succeed more than others and the most important thing is that you have no reason to be upset - you can do it, but eventually the anger disappears, and then you have to suppress love, even if it's hard, lies real happiness. <br /> <br /> Great actors and cast, the film really gets you into the feel of the movie. <br /> <br /> Nice nice nice. I recommend to see this, especially if you like the life of Italians.
