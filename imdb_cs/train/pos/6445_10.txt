In addition to the excellent direction, production, acting and predictable drama is an important message in the script: <br /> <br /> "Listening is going all the way." Listen to the voice to flourish. voice, listen. To get closer, listen. To listen to the needs of any situation or other, listen. It seems that scriptwriters broadcast the "secret of life". Listening leads to self-awareness. It awakens other senses, especially vision and extends the horizon. One soul can also be discovered. The art of this film, "Like in Heaven," gloriously showed the development of life, not only his joy and sadness, but ultimately the hope of life. All this according to the first instructions of the head of the congregation; <br /> <br /> "Just listen, it goes all the way"
