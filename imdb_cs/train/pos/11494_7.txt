Unborn is the production of Roger Corman and as such is ugly and tasteless. If you hate pregnant women, look at this movie because it's full of preggo killing and miscarriages. Brooke Adams plays in Virginia. Her wife and her wife are going to some decorative clinic because they can not have children themselves. There they meet Dr. Meyerling (James Karen of ROTLD 1 & 2). Dr. Meyerling has a very high success rate in getting pregnant couples. (Insert joke here) Is it because it creates some genetic killers of supermutans? This is what Virginia begins to think when it begins to have strange side effects and extreme moods of treatment. That's when he starts taking things into his own hands. <br /> <br /> You will need to get the remaining details somewhere else, because if I told you all the good things you could hurt yourself, you would add it to the queue of Netflix lending too fast. It's a bit slow movement for some time, but as soon as it rises in the last third, all systems are going! I am very strongly advised on the strengths of my non-PC fetal violence. 33 1/2 of the seven hundred stars.
