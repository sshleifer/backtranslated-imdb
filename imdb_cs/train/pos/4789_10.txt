David Lynch (1999) The film John Roach / Mary Sweeney's story is set in Iowa and Wisconsin some time before the film's final release. We will come to life Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) late in life. His health is poor, his life is mostly behind him and he knows it. It does what she decides to do, even more remarkable and cute. He decides (and at any moment in the film he calls his actions in his own name) to put a few things straight. Alvin is a man with great experience in his life, but a modest means. His daughter, Rose (Sissy Spacek), struggles with a speech barrier that makes communication a great effort on behalf of the audience. But it's worth it, because Rose's story can not help, but it does when the film progresses. This film is the story of a journey. But like all the ways, it is a journey in a geographical sense and in the human sense. Soon in the film, we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey that no elderly man of Alvin's age should reasonably be attracted to. But on the way, we slowly learn how Alvin has so many qualifications that make it possible for him to achieve his unlikely goal. Its goal is very simple and straightforward. His brother is sick and probably dies and wants to visit him. He had to fall with him many years ago and did not speak for a long time. <br /> <br /> Alvin meets with many people along the way. The way they behave and the benefits they know are the essence of this film. We'll find out who Alvin Straight is, from what Alvin Straight does. And at the end of the movie we know who we ... better.
