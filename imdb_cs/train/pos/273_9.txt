It's hard for me to criticize everything Mitzi Kapture does. It just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress. Despite the fact that the conspiracy was predictable. I think if Jill HAD slept with Richard, maybe it would have made him a little more crazy than he was, which would add to the tension. It was also nice to see Jill and her husband learn about a small problem with Richard and his ex-wife, perhaps a little more. I was a bit disappointed at the end of the movie. I'd like to see more closure with Zack's death and possible closure with her husband. But I have to say that I can never look at the rifle and I can not see her standing there. It was a good end to Richard. Of course, Mitzi ROCKED! I look forward to her future projects.
