I think the "Blackadder Third" is the best of the series. In fact, all the episodes are fun, I really like an episode of "French invasion," but with superstitious actors, "MACBETH" is also really funny, the way Rowan still plays with them is really humorous the highest level. Actors: Blackadder: Rather than MACBETH ...! <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Rowan and I have most of his work , but I think he made the Blackadder series especially well. /> <br /> I hope Rowan will continue his great style, but I think we can rely on him because he's already working on Bean 2, <br /> <br /> I am giving this 3. Blackadder 9 out of 10 ratings.
