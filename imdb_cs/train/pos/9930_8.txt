I am absolutely surprised by some comments on this forum and many reviews. I think Tony Scott made a good movie here. Yes, it's very stylized, crazy and over the top, but it's very fun. I'm glad Ebert and Roeper agree with me :) This movie may not be for anyone but if you like over the top, dark humor, cool action and dialogue, you should see it. <br /> <br /> I've seen Scott's Man in Fire, Crimson Tide, and the Enemy of the State - all good movies, but I like one more. It's like a mountain bike ride, a great selection of soundtracks, visual styles, and when all the movies seem to be pg13, it's nice to see someone afraid to show nakedness, violent violence, and have a clear dialogue. <br /> <br /> It will not hurt that Keira is super-hot and even shows the nipples in this, either ...
