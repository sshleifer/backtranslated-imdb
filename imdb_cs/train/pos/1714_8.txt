I was watching the film in a very light mood, and this film is bright, but the end of the movie is simply unexpected, leaving a long lasting memory in his mind. The film begins with Abhay and his profession being witnessed during the marriage of the registrar. Soha comes to marriage, and his friend will not, and Soha goes to a street that she can not go back home, and in this situation she has no business to live here. Abahy seems to be her helper, that's the basis of the story. The rest is just observable and the end of the story is bitter sweet that Abhay has to face, which will keep you on the edge of the seat. <br /> <br /> Dialogues and music are good songs are in good direction OK, and so like the scenario that you think the movie is slow but looking for the story request, it's okay. And really observable especially with a slight mood I used it at home with coke and peanuts. my rating is 8/10
