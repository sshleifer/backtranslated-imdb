I found this movie available for streaming on Netflix and I thought I'd try. The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt) who eventually saw each other after their father died. Ryan and Theo initially argue about who did what. But later, Theo finds out that his brother Ryan is not just gay, but he's dying for the ultimate illness. So Ryan and Theo spend time by improving their differences. <br /> <br /> It's such an incredible movie. I saw Colm Feore in Season 7 of 24, but it was phenomenal. David Cubitt, an actor I've never heard of, has also made a phenomenal job. I would recommend it to all who are interested in the genre of gays and lesbians. This is one movie you do not want to miss. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 10 stars of 10. Excellent movie!
