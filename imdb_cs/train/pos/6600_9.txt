I have this review short and sweet .... I saw on this trailer and I thought I'd give it a vortex for 5 minutes and my first thoughts were "what the hell is this?" But after 10 minutes I was addicted and after 20 years I jumped out of the ground. This film is a great example of how another film can be, and it is also French. This movie is a high quality eyeglass wrapped in a neat futuristic movie noir, movement is a very clever and black and white animated style that does not have gray even though it did not initially make me completely interested in the end of the film and I found out that she wishes everyone the movie was such. I think my opinion was supported by a big dubbing that it would be very easy to destroy it if there were not so many respected actors how many voice actors does not give any sense of character (Just look at any Hong Kong legendary English movie, a perfect example) 9, even though I gave her another 2 because of how fresh and new is the whole thing ...
