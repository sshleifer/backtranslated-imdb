The first time I saw this movie in the 1980s and now in 2006, this movie still belongs to the best movies I've ever seen! I would recommend someone to look at this movie. You will not regret. It is well solved, so real and never boring. Actor acting is excellent and location makes him a movie as if you were there. From the beginning to the end, this movie is the type that has lost your attention. The actress does a great job of presenting a girl who has survived this terrible plane crash in the Amazon and shows how she managed to survive in the Amazon herself. It is unbelievable that someone could survive under such conditions. That's why this movie is so tempting. The fact that this is a true story makes this film even more interesting and thinks that a young girl could survive this suffering is stunning. I found this movie, which I can watch again and again, and the one I will never tire of. This is really a compliment because I have hundreds of movies! I think it's probably my favorite movie and the best I've ever seen!
