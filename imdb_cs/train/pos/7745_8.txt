"Life struck our face ... we must try to stay beautiful" Debut film by one of the best Belgian artists (singing songs) Tom Barman. The long-awaited movie and joyous happy joy of space for Flemish work - it's really worth watching and promising! He takes us into the life of 8 main characters who live on Friday and at night. The title says a lot about the way we spend time with them: they sailed the way they do it for a Friday party where they meet. <br /> <br /> It's a rhythmic style that's very "thought out". Excellent use of music. Sometimes it takes the upper hand to the pictures and then you feel its strength. Gainsbourg! QOTSA! Party scene (20mins ???) is an exciting visual experience of the way it is shot. It keeps you alright when it's set in a small place with a lot of people who have a big party ..... so heavy to shoot. Thank you, Barman, for making this courageous film these, for some years, the bad times of the Flemish movie. You did my day!
