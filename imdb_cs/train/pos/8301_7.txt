Gary Busey is the title character, Frank "Bulletproof" McBain, your standard problem, a ruthless Maverick cop who deserves his nickname, because no matter how many cartridges I take (38 and counts), he never stops the wrong. <br /> <br /> <br /> When the American tank called Thunderblast is moved across the border to Mexico, it is loaded with revolutionaries / terrorists led by General Brogad (Ren√© Enriquez) and Libyan Colonel Kartiff (Henry Silva) with Russian villains. Army employees are held prisoners, including Devon Shepard (Darlanne Fluegel), who is formerly a friend of McBain. McBain is then taken to the Army for a rescue mission. <br /> <br /> Busey may not have a physical presence say, someone like Schwarzenegger, who would be another suitable leader for such a movie, but he's a blast like a self-confident dude that is fast with wisecracks. Fluegel is a great woman; She not only looks incredibly sexy, but she does a great kick action babe. Enriquez, Silva, Juan Fernandez, and always welcome William Smith (as the Russian major) are a nasty crowd in the classic action film tradition. Support for cast is quite full of well-known and reliable actors: L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong, Thalmus Rasulala, Lincoln Kilpatrick, Mills Watson, Luke Askew, Danny Trejo, and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. <br /> <br /> T.L. Lankford and B.J. Goldman adds a script based on the Lankford story and Fred Oleen Ray's B veteran. It's a kind of script where you just know that writers have their tongues on their faces: they know their material is absurd and cheesy and just enjoys throwing credibility out of the window. Veterinary action director Steve Carver keeps him on the move and brings a respectable amount of bullets, explosions, and general global chaos. <br /> <br /> "Bulletproof" is a good fun for action fans who do not mind turning off their brains ever since and just enjoying a generous assortment of violence and humor. <br /> <br /> 7/10
