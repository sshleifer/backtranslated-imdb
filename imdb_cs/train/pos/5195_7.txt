As a lover of bad films, I definitely hit a payoff with this one. The conspiracy is not really that bad, but there are a few cases when you really have to ask yourself, "what's going on here?" There are plenty of things that make him the most funny bad movie ever. First, Rudy Ray Moore became so fat and slow when the film was filmed that special effects consist in speeding combat scenes to double the time. There are also scenes where slow playback is instantaneous, jumping on a ten foot high wall (by playing back from it), naked men are capitalized, and sex that literally lowers the roof (with the cable keeping the roof captured in fireplaces). Of course, no Rudy Ray Moore's film would be complete without a completely unreasonable and random comedy club scene where Rudy makes fun of all the customers put in people doing some special dance. There are so many things that are bad in this movie, but they are fun and if you look at the movie, you can get another mistake. Rating: 1/10 for actual value, 10/10 for cheese factor, 10/10 for picking up bugs and goofs, averages up to 7/10.
