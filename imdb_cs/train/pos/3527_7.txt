Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) meets a mysterious woman (Fay Helm) at the bar and calls her to meet him. She agrees to the condition that they will not exchange information about themselves - not the names. Sometimes the best dates are. However, when he returns to his apartment, Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team are waiting for him. Scott's wife was murdered. His alibi is a mysterious woman, but no one can remember her, and Scott is sentenced to death for murdering his wife. His secretary, Kansas (Ella Raines), is not convinced of his guilt and is trying to find a woman who can save him from the death penalty. It's a good movie and the viewer is 100% behind Kansas's attempts to get to the truth. We watch her through some unforgettable scenes, such as her pursuit of Mac Barman (Andrew Tombes) at night and a claustrophobic place where Cliff drummer (Elisha Cook Jr) to hang her, drinking and dancing while he gets stuck with his friends. This is such an obvious view of sexual desire that it is an extraordinary part of the film, because each one is intensely and rhythmically connected for the duration of the scene. Ella Raines is good in the female leading role and Thomas Gomez is a nice policeman. Alan Curtis started well as a confused, innocent man, but when he was arrested, his performance went to the left when Kansas became completely unpleasant for any reason. God knows why he was with him. The film does not keep guessing who the killer is, as we know half of the movie, but that does not matter. In fact, it contributes to the tense and dramatic story development, as Kansas will find out what's going on, and then we get to hell! It's a good movie with some great scenes, but although Elisha Cook Jr has an unforgettable role, I never loved him in anything I see him ... somebody gives me a tie .....
