Victor Vargas lifting is a movie that you must surely see. It was a very heartbeat and he had a lot of humor that gets you sucked in directly it's as much as real life with what the teenagers have to go through. Viktor, a funny young man, but with a good heart at the end deals with love in all the right places that deal with girls and family. Finally, Victor learns the true meaning of love after he really uses the old mom and girl he wants to use. I recommend people watching this movie because it's like watching a real family. That's how much this movie feels. One heart felt the moment when Victor's grandmother threw the winner over something simple. Victor was really heart, and he could not believe he'd do something like that. I felt really sorry for him, as if it were real. Overall, I give this movie B +
