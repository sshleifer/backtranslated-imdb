Stylish, moody, innovative bloodshed revenge. Also cheese, of course, and sporadically very cheese. It reminded me of a lot of The Big Heat because it has a vengeful plot sparked by exactly the same event and the girl comes to the side of a good man because of the same bad behavior of a bad guy. It's sad that it's not Gloria Grahame, but it's so fantastic that it's Alain Delon and not Glenn Ford. Could anyone be as beautiful as Alain walks in a cashmere sweater and trenchcoat? Yet it is totally hard and icy. No one can touch him today - though someone like Jude Law could try. It's hard for any girl to look good with him. The music was funky and perfect and there were some great hunters (and you are not usually my cup of tea) - especially one wolftail in the woods. People also faced creative and bloody ways, such as bushes. But for the cheese, the overall atmosphere worked and pulled away expertly. More creativity, excitement and freshness in this "forgotten" movie than most of what I have seen recently.
