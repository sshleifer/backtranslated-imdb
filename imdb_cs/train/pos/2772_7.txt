I always believed that David and Bathsheba were a film originally designed for Tyrone Power in the 20th Century Fox, although Gregory Peck was well reported to be King David, a monarch with a tangled eye. <br /> <br /> This film captures a lot of biblical objects, adultery, redemption, sin, punishment, and generally what God expects from his followers. When you are a king, even a king in the Bible prophecy of the kingdom, you certainly have plenty of perfection that we do not have. King David has many women, including one truly ominous in Jayne Meadows, the daughter of Saul, David's predecessor. But his eyes capture Bathsheba in his garden in the evening. She shows she is unhappily married to Uriah Hetejca, for David is quite a few women. Uriah is one of David's army captains. David sends to Bathsheba and he is the king, she comes in running because she had an eye on him too. What will happen, affair, pregnancy, and carefully arranged death for Uriah in the battle. But everyone sees and knows the deity that has all caught them and not only punishes David and Bathsheba, but the whole of Israel's kingdom is punished by drought, sickness, and plague. The Sexist Law day calls for Bathsheba to suffer stone death. David shows weakness in his previous activities, but here he stood up to the plate and asked for the whole thing to come to him. He even puts his hand on the contract sheet, which was instant death, as seen in the film. My interpretation is that God admires courage even though you are wrong and he leaves David and forgives them both. Bathsheba becomes the mother of Solomon, and she and David are the predecessors of several successors in the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah until they are both conquered. Susan Hayward is welcome to Bathsheba captured in a homeless marriage with Uriah starring Kieron Moore. The only thing that Moore wakes up is a good battle. I liked Kieron Moore's performance as a brave and somewhat stupid horse. <br /> <br /> No one can set a law like Raymond Massey. His Nathan prophet is consistent with the character of John Brown, who played in two films, equally intense. <br /> <br /> So when his own law called death, why did God save Bathsheba and keep David on the throne. Perhaps it was the fact that he simply did not want a trainer coach for this job. He has already replaced Saul and David. <br /> <br /> But I think that Christian interpretation may be that it was the thrill of the upcoming New Testament that one could sin and receive mercy if someone had asked for it Christianly. I will let biblical scholars present my interpretations. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie and come up with a whole new theory.
