I can not believe we do not have the show anymore. I have all eight seasons of this 70th year! I absolutely love it! I lay in bed every night and watched several episodes before bedtime. At the end of a long busy day, it's nice to break up and sleep before sleeping. I was so sad that we managed to take over the show ... at least we still have re-runs !! I hope and pray that she will come back at least with reunion ... Just as maybe when Donna finishes college and we finally meet her and Eric get married !!!! It would not be terrible !!! It would be even better if they continued for several years!
