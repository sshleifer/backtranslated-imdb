Sitting, writing? Nothing is the last "what ever?" Fest offered Vincenzio Natali and play David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller as two defeated. One has relationship problems, gets out of work (due to relationship problems), and police are driven out of work (due to their work and relationship problems). Another guy is an agoraphobic who refuses to go outdoors at home, meets an annoying girl's guide who calls her mother to claim to be bothered when he does not buy cookies from him. Oh yeah, the police are after him too, after the girl's mother calls them to arrest him. <br /> <br /> Man, what day. <br /> <br /> What if you could all disappear? This is the whole assumption of "nothing." Are two fools aware of cops, scouts, cars, lawns, roads, everything? dissapear. There is nothing but white space! This is an interesting concept that I thought. I was also watching this time, 30 minutes in the movie, and I still have an hour in the movie. Could two actors do this work and let us have fun for 60 minutes? Although the actors are trying, 60 minutes is a long time and there is clearly dead air in the places of this film. But these two actors, who are lifelong friends among themselves and director, have such a big repertoire among them that it's fun to watch the dialogue and improve the turn around. There are plenty of supernatural elements, but it's more of a reaction to those elements that eventually see this movie.
