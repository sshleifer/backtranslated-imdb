I highly recommend this movie. In the future, in 2054 in Paris, he appears in a classic movie noir script: a lady in danger, a sister trying to find her, an honorary policeman fighting against all. Fortunately, he avoids stereotypes and combines a fairly good story with interesting and innovative visuals. The film would remind you of Sin City in appearance, but it has a sharper, even more graphic look that I thought was really convincing. Each slide looks like each sequence looks like it could be pulled out of an experienced graphic designer's desk. As for the story and artwork, you can find nodding in the 1990s (or even earlier with classic views of the Eiffel Tower and Sacre Couer) and movies like Casablanca as well as a glimpse of the gloomy future where our goals are controlled by corporations. Do some excuse to see this movie.
