Tom Hanks was in hit movies like Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan and The Green Mile. Most of the time, his roles have become good guys that we have been cheering on. In the way to ruin, his character Michael Sullivanis is a bit different. In Sam Mendes Road to Perdition, based on Max Alan's graphic novel Collins, he portrays the story of a man and his son on the road during the Great Depression in Chicago. What is different in this little way is that Sullivan is a hit-man who is now hunted by his former partner. His boss or former boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) loves him more than his own son, Sullivan's partner, Connor (Daniel Craig). After work done badly due to Connor, Sullivan and his son, who should not be there, witnessed his mistake. So Connor is trying to pull Sullivan and his family, but he only gets a wife and another son, Peter. Sullivan overcomes the hit and goes home to find Michael Jr. sitting at the table ... just sitting. With his wife and child dead, Sullivan set out to find answers. The story follows two when Sullivan tries to do things right in remembrance of his wife and child and for Michael who feels like he's guilty of it all. He feels his curiosity killed his mother and brother. Tyler Hoechlin does a great job like Michael Jr. It brings maturity and also the feeling of being youthful. His loss of innocence is well resolved when he travels from city to town and leaves nothing behind. Mendes's previous hit was American Beauty, which received five Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director. This film did not do nearly as well when Oscars won only one of the Best Cinematography awards, but he won five other nominations for music, sound, and best actor in a supporting role for Paul Newman. This film is a great story that takes you on a Midwest ride and to the legend of Mike Sullivan: a husband, a hit man, and a devoted father. This film is a sleeping film that should be watched for years to come.
