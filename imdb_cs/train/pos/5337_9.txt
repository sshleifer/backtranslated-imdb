It can be a remake of the 1987 autumn story after eleven years, as Director Mabel Cheung said. Mabel employs rock music as a medium in this film and expresses her personal attitude to life, in which love, desire and subsequent frustration play a vital role. Rock music may not be the best way to carry the deep sentiment, and yet it is not too bad to use it because the life of musical rock musicians is all the more intense than ordinary. The director focuses on displaying subtle love and ultimate vanity of life rather than mere rock music. Love between father and son, lovers and friends is deliciously and tactilely delivered thanks to great performance. Mabel does not attempt to beautify rock musicians as an artist, instead attempts to reproduce real life on screen, and makes enormous effort to work on this project for years and gather information in Beijing's pubs. <br /> <br /> Daniel probably has the best performance in all his films so far. His innate confusion and restraint perfectly match the blue mood of the film.
