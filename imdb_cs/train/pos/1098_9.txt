Modern viewers know this little movie primarily as a model for remake "The Money Pit". Older viewers are observing today with nostalgia: Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas were all "superstars" in a simpler, less complicated era. Or was it? Time, of course, has a way to modify perspectives, and so many films that today are actually diluting social and political commentaries, it is natural curiosity to think about controversy in older, seemingly less provocative films. In the movie "Mr. Blandings builds his house of dreams", it can be more than what the audience was looking for in 1948. There is a political commentary, whether fine. Finding the house in the late 1940s was a truly dizzying experience, with the slightly softened arrival of Levittown, and so on. Politics in the movie? Blanding's children seem to be talking about progressive ideas they learn at school (which would make teachers accuse of communism in real life). Even in real life, Myrna Loy was a housing, democracy and feminist activist. Melvyn Douglas was not even a democratic fireworks: he was married to Congressman Helen Gahagan Douglas, who was accused by young Richard Nixon of being a communist soft (who destroyed it). Jason Robards, Sr., has a small role in the film, but his political activism was no less obvious. More importantly, his son, Jason Robards, Jr., will be a very active liberal democrat for many years. Almost strange partner was Cary Grant, whose sharp conservatism reflected most of the political sentiment in Hollywood, which had already slipped. But this was 1948: communism was actually perceived by the threat, and the black list was just around the corner. It would be another decade before political activism reappeared in the mainstream films, and then less so.
