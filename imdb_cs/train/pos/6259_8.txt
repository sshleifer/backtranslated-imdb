I am really indignant at the comment I read that this movie was "boring" and the beautiful scenery was marked by black and white affairs. It was made in 1925 !!!! I think it's absolutely unbelievable that it's time! <br /> <br /> The way these people had to go through is totally remarkable. It took them a week just to cross the river. Women carried their children in heavy wooden cradles on their backs and climbed a solid rock, sometimes barefoot in the snow. I want someone to do it now! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a wonderful movie with some amazing shots and an incredible story.
