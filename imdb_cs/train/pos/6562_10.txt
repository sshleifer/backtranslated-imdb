Simply the best example of reality he has ever done. The first two seasons (the only ones that matter) are on Hulu. I urge everyone to watch the first three episodes of season 1 and did not like it. I guarantee that you will finish the season. Then I guarantee you will watch season 2. Other quick reasons why you look at it: 1. Anderson Cooper is cheerful 2. Places in Europe are amazing 3. Games are psychologically demanding 4. It's very interactive 5. In one episode, a player responds to the desperate player of another player: "I try as much as possible!" with the same despair, "not necessarily." <br /> <br /> You can find out ... Who is the mole?
