These were the most visually stunning, moving, amazing and incredible stories I've ever experienced. Frankly, even those adjectives can not describe it. I can not choose one scene that appeared to me. I suppose if I had to bring a couple, it would be the fireman's reaction to the casualty jumping accident; the reaction of people trapped in the elevator who did not know what was going on when they eventually appeared on a terrible scene; shock and disbelief of viewers; and finally silence. <br /> <br /> That day, and even now, I remind Star Wars (1977). Obi-Wan says, "I felt a strong distraction, as if millions of voices suddenly screamed in terror, and suddenly disappeared." It's amazing how accurate it is in your description. There was actually interference in the Hall. This document clearly reveals this disorder. Feelings are incredibly visual. Anger, frustration, shock, fear, exhaustion, and the realization of its vast scale. Everything is there. It's not the missing thing. It's a powerful and moving documentary and deserves Emmy. Not only because it documents 9/11, but because it's just everything that should be. <br /> <br /> If you plan to follow, make sure you grab a tissue box. You will need them. I know I did it.
