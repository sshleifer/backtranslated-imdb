Note that I did not say that it is better ... just better. Lack of social commentary and realism helps keep things moving. I was actually a little surprised that it was not the movie Troma because it has all the Troma marks, including the splashing of acidic liquids, a crime after each murder, a ridiculous curtain scene (which is a bit hard to get angry because the rapist is a snowman) and stupid MPs. <br /> <br /> It is a lot to love:> <br /> 1. The snowman, who is marked to have no legs or feet, is driving a police cruiser around the city. <br /> <br /> 2. Although it should be near (or below) freezing, no one is breathing and there are no signs of a car exhaust when the car is running. <br /> <br /> 3. Snow reminds you of a lot of ingredients or peanuts made of foamed polystyrene than real snow. <br /> <br /> 4. Teenage girl gets hots for her boyfriend just a few hours after her brother is severely murdered. It is said that he will get into the sheriff's house, from all the places to get on. But first he tells him he has to put a nice fire in the fire and open some wine. <br /> <br /> 5. After Jake's head is cut off from a cross-country slide, his father claims with the sheriff that Tommy, the Sheriff's son, has something to do with it. Sheriff claims that Tommy would not be afraid of Jake because Jake "is at least two feet taller than Tommy." At that moment somebody in the background says, "No more!" <br /> <br /> 6. When the evil snowman finally begins to melt, the sheriff struggles with a flat snowman that has been made of some fabric for a long time. It is much better than Tarzan match with rubber crocodiles or gladiators wrestling with stuffed lions. If I were an actor, at this point I would not be able to keep a straight face. Overall, it's a fun movie. There is not so much blood.
