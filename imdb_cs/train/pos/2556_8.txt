And also made for television movie, this movie was good. it was in it and the conspiracy was so great. this one of the movies I've seen, I felt I thought I thought I thought that after I saw it, I was afraid that Reaper would come to kill me with my computer. There were only a few small things in this movie, but it's very easy. Antonio Sabbato Jr played a great role in this film, along with Janine Turner and Robert Wagner. this movie just has so much strain and caused me to want more because I never thought the low budget of a television movie could be so strong. After reading, I read the novel on which this film was based (four times) and was also great. If you've ever seen this movie come to TV, watch it. The effects in this movie have been pretty well done, I honestly do not know what a living living person would look like, but as FX did the movie, I was amazed and all that shows is that all these bad for the television movies there with low budgets should not be so bad. <br /> <br /> Watch it. It's really good, not really!
