It's not about the best Bella Lagosi movie, but it has a good old-fashioned approach to horror entertainment around 40. <br /> <br /> The brides fall on the altar like flies. I think I put down the wedding after it's captured by a friend, but it's a horror movie, so I think people for some reason ignore the danger. Lagosi is a mad doctor who needs a young woman's blood to keep his old, sick woman healthy and happy. He always avoids the Keystone Cops by hiding the bodies in the funeral home (who would think he was looking for a corpse in the stroller?) And the brides are just still holding on to zapped. No movie like this would be complete without a female reporter like Lois Lane, who wants to catch the criminals himself. Good at dealing with crime, bad mouth preservation in all bad times, guess who Lagos chooses for his other intended sacrifice. I like the "creepy house" where Lois Lane gets into the storm as a guest in Lagosi's ominous dominion. Hidden passes, vampire wife, evil dwarf Igor assistant and so on. Good thing. Relatively good stimulation keeps motion of the film and the story is solved in a typical but satisfying way. If you like old horror movies, it's worth watching.
