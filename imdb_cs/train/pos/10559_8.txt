I wrote about IMDb for the longest time, but I felt compelled to write it! Looking at this movie, I found one particular review that invited people to see this movie. Do not pay attention to this ignorant person! NEVER is a fantastic movie full of laughter and above all ... fantasy! Are you sick and tired by bringing power to the same old cycle of bubble waste? Sometimes the movie comes as NEVER and gives you something you've never seen before. I do not even care whether you like the movie (I do not even hate it), but no one has the right to discredit the movie. IMDb has a monumental impact on the reputation, and no negative reviews should discredit the movie like this. Just say you hate it and why you hate it ... but do not try to tell people they should not look at it. We have our own mind and thank you for it. <br /> <br /> If my judgment is good, I would say that this film will have more people than those who hate it. <br /> <br /> Give your mind a little eye-candy! NEVER!
