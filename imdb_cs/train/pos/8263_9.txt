This movie, along with WESTFRONT 1918, is my favorite Pabst movie, and I liked them more than his much more famous films played by Louise Brooks (for example PANDORA'S BOX). This is probably because they are very similar to the neo-realistic films the Italians have been able to improve in the 1940s and 1950s. This stylish movie called after using non-actors (just typical people) in everyday conditions to create intense and realistic movies. In this case, the film is about French and German coal burners, so people in roles seem to be miners - not actors. The central conflict, as the film begins, is that there is a large flask on the Franco-German border. Instead of one large mine, the border is divided and German workers are not more in the French mine, even though there is greater unemployment in Germany. This, the linguistic differences (illustrated wonderfully in the dance hall scene) and the WWI, conspired to create a huge division between the factions - which led to the idea of ​​WE vs. THEY. Later the explosion will cause a huge collapse in French and the Germans refuse to sit and do nothing. The risk of their own lives proves that there is a real connection between miners and men. The film is a strong critique of xenophobia and vainly tried to get a German audience to see the vanity of war and hatred. It was a beautiful moving film with some of the worst and claustrophobic images I've ever seen. Taking into account history, the impact of the film was at best minimal. It's a real shame like this one, WESTFRONT 1918, GACANCE, and ALL THOUGHTS ON THE WESTERN FRONT (Milestone) have a great message of peace and harmony, but ultimately they have failed in a positive publicity. So from the historical point of view, it is a wonderful and sad monument that is worth seeing.
