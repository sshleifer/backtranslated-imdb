Although I was part of Sheffield Hodges in this film, I still managed to make me jump in several places and believe I'm not that easy. You could say I was interested in the film and, OK, I was, but I did not see the end product until 27 February 2006 and I was extremely pleased. I'm not a fan of a horror movie as such, but I love old movies "B" and black and white Sci Fi movies. This movie "thinks" you know when something happens, then no, then it does. It will be perfectly balanced. I would suggest watching the movie first by the director's notes and special features. It's so well written, directing and shooting, and I can personally tell you it was a real joy to work with this actor and crew. I sincerely hope to be part of Brian and Laurence's future projects.
