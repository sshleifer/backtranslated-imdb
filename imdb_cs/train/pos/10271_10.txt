This film should not be compared with the movie "The Sting" or other movie films caper / heist / con. What makes such a great movie experience is what to say about relationships, deception and trust. It is also a relatively critical critique of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is ice cream that is so easily deceived and then released in a primitive way in the final. Math Mamet had an unhappy experience with therapy? High, immensely recommended!
