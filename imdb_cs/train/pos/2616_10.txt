The Lion King 1 1/2 is a very cute story, going along with The Lion King. Basically, it follows the original story of the King of the Lion, but with several twists. The explanation in the film is explained by different characters. This story is still original. <br /> <br /> As for the sequel, Disney is not so great that it should be useful. This one, which is the third part of The Lion King (Simba's Pride is the second one), has in fact an original idea that brings fun first. Timon and Pumbaa travel and search for an ideal place to live. After searching the broad and wide surroundings, they find the "Hakuna Matata" site. They then meet a little lion named Simba and go through many things that parents are going through today. I think it's a very good movie and I like to add it to my collection.
