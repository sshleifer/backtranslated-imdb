I am a member of a canoe club and I can tell you the truth that Deliverance is synonymous with the peace and tranquility of this experience. When we put our boats into the water, the banjo echoes in the back of the conscious mind. This film is timeless because it is the philosophical place of man in the nature and the technological effect on man's relationship with nature. We see it in fishing with a bow. We see it in the home tent. There is also contempt of the city and a sense of superiority of the countryman "cracker". The fact that the Atlantean banker (Ned Beatty) has "bad teeth" is supposed to place him on the same level as timber who also have bad teeth. Ultimately, the struggle of life and death will replace the "civilized" human hope of "law." This canoe trip ends too early for the viewer, but unfortunately not too early for the characters.
