Other than Susan Hayward's wooden van in this movie was as good as any biblical film. Henry King handles this film with respect to the epic in all the small scenes, and Peck is as good as ever. The mixing of Alfred Newman's voice with a thirty-thirds Psalm is unforgettable even after many years. The scene with Goliath is a bit on the hokey side, but not everything that was wrong when the movie was made. This is happening well in addition to minor epics of the lesser age, "Song of Ruth" and "Esther and the King". It is worth watching and Raymond Massy is excellent as the Prophet Nathan. The film is rounded off by James Robertson's righteousness as Abishai and Jayne Meadows as Michol, David's first-stolen wife.
