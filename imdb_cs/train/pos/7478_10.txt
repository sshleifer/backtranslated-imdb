I'm from Romania, I will try to speak English. All I want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my highest number one. He has seen it at least 30 times and has seen it for many years. She has all the things that I like in the movie, it's very moving to scream. It shows a lot of twisted love affairs and questions about love and reality, and about real things that are important to different people. It's the way it matters most to me, love, the soul of man, the inner being and I see that in this movie. Maybe for me it's a lot more than a movie, it's proof that it can actually exist and that you make the most out of every moment you live with your opponent. It's a long way from reality to science fiction, but ... what if. What if capitalism disappeared and the economy would have fallen, would it fall? We would all be alarmed by other questions, and my thought lies in the fact that on your deadly bed there is no bigger thing you remember, wealth, not adventure, not the land you've visited, and the people who remember you. But true friends and your true love and hope that after your death they will all be damn perfect and people will be good and care more. Show this movie and will probably drive you through my life, as it was with me :) Save from Romania
