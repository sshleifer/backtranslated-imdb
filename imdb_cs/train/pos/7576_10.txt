The third and final part of the "Hanzo Razor" is the most specific. "Training" will even be completed during the first five minutes of the movie. Not for everyone, this film describes in detail that Hanz's credit shark investigation is carried out on the order of blind monks. It also makes a historical commentary on the proud rejection of old Japan to incorporate Western technology. Where the first film, Hanzo, was just a funny and harsh ride with a small connection to his conspiracy, "Hanzo 3: Who Has the Gold" can combine everything and eventually bring it all. Absolutely perfect finale. Yeah yeah, Hanzo still has a lot of sex and there's a lot of unnecessary blood and violence (that's, after all, Hanzo Razor).
