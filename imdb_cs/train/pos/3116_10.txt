The final installment in the action thriller franchise is only likely that the heaviest shot of the three films. It is also about playing the anti-Bond theme. Bourne does not like what he's doing, and he wants to know about his blurred past. Everything about this film comes from a nail from cinema to choreography / stunt work on an acting script. The film starts in outrage when Bourne runs from the Moscow police. It seems that the story rises right where the first movie has stopped. Or yes? Time is a bit confused, but we get the fact that Bourne remembers things. A sudden memory when you're trying to clean up is almost gripped, but it can do and kill no one. They are not his goal. From there, we get more intrigue of our past with new player Noah Vosen, who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect him at all costs. Pamela Landy is back as well as Nicky Parsons, who seems to have a past with Bourne. Cinematography is in your body that follows closely to virtually everything. The movement of the car is even more intense if it seems possible than what is happening from the first two. A veteran plays Bourne is great with a nice part of Albert Finney. It also has mild political overtones in relation to extradition and other government policies, but it is tiny and very well incorporated into the conspiracy. Overall, this is the best of the trilogy's conclusions this year, if not the best action trilogy ever.
