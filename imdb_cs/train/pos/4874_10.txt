Kusturika did it again. Another masterpiece. A coral comedy full of landmarks, with a frenetic rhythm and many famous moments, we were laughing and laughing at what party! Music is everywhere, just like shooting, animals, crazy fools, sex and amazing gadgets and inventions, all colorful visual to have fun. Clean cinema basically. Wonderful experience. And one is particularly grateful because good comedies are so rare and so amazing. Well, that does not matter, and if you enjoyed Kusturica's previous movies, he will love it, though, as in all comedies, it is a chemical reaction and you have to be in the mood.
