Have you ever wondered how far a movie can be? <br /> <br /> Schizophrenic tirelessly examines the world with Harry Russ. <br /> <br /> Harry is an aggravated writer, murderer, and drug addict who quietly stops to destroy those among him and madness. Led by the demonic voices of his tiny tickled teat, Harry begins his killing. <br /> <br /> From Ron Atkino comes the first installment of the worst story ever made. The only movie I've seen alike is going to become the 2nd installment called Schizophreniac Necromaniac <br /> <br /> This is a really low budget movie and it will not be for everyone, but if you're looking for something disturbing, different and awful, then it would was a great choice. <br /> <br /> DO NOT USE ANYTHING MODERN HORROR DAYS (such as Scream) <br /> <br /> We recommend confident viewer
