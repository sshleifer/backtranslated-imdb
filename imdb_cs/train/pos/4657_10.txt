Hot Millions is a great movie in every direction. A fun, unconventional story with amazing performances by four of the best professionals ever working in the business. Peter Ustinov is brilliant, as usual, and Maggie Smith - definitely one of the greatest actresses ever - is absolutely delighted. Karl Malden and Bob Newhart round off and are also perfect. If you want a movie that has the perfect casting, that's it. What is so impressive is the way these people effortlessly try to create lots of laughter and fun moments. Peter Ustinov was a genius with a wonderful sense of humor and this is one of his most memorable performances. Direction, shooting and editing are also first class and it's a great London capsule in the 1960s. It's definitely on my favorite list of all time.
