Peter Weir is the first international success, LAST WAVE is a predominantly efficient cooler with a fascinating story based on the native myth. Richard Chamberlain performs well as an advocate, whose life is increasingly lost from reality as he deeper into a murder involving the native rivalry of the natives. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects who are trying to lead Chamberlin through the Dreamtime, an alternative reality / timeline that is the focal point of indigenous Australian history and indigenous customs. A heavy atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in rendering, the film builds on a worrying finale that is somewhat reduced by bad effects, probably due to budget constraints. However, an interesting film whose overall impression of the mystery and fear that lies just below the surface of what we perceive as "reality" will remain with you.
