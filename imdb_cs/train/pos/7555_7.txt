Gender Bender plays a bit in x files. This episode has an interesting assumption, a good story, but the end that wanted it. Gender Bender is also a debut about x-sets for actor Nicholas Leo, known as Alex Krycek. In this episode, Michael plays a man attacking one of The Kindred. You need to see this episode to see that Nic Lea is less than a magnificent beginning. An interesting thing about native "power of seduction". When Marty makes her victims, they turn to him. However, when Andrew conquers Scully, she just because she is disoriented and horrifying and does not become attracted to Andrew. Maybe it's because Marty has more experience than Andrew. This episode reminds me of why it would sometimes be miserable to shoot in British Columbia. During the episode it is so wet, wet and muddy, it could not have been such fun. Despite disappointment, Gender Bender is still a good episode.
