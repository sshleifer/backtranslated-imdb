I saw it in the theater during its first release and it was disturbing because I'm sure it will still be. It was the first part of '68 and it still makes a round in cities all over America and there was a recent mass murder in my hometown where I saw where a guy went to the rampage shooting. The freshness of this near event, combined with this dramatically narrated story, brought a very disturbing theatrical experience. It really brought to life the excellent acting of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. I was familiar with a novel based on Truman Capote's real events, and Richard Brooks's script and direction brought the event and Truman's interpretation into a convincing stone adaptation. Quincy Jones' music really evaluates his story. I only saw it a few times. It was too real. Almost as a witness of the crime itself and along with murderers. It could be 9.0 possible 10. The company is so desensitized to violence and crime today that it seems slow and tame and could be seen with lesser effect but more than fifty each will be a characteristic feature in the investigation of a criminal offense psyche.
