This is not among Jimmy Stewart's best movies - I quickly admit it. However, while some see his film as pure propaganda, I wonder what's wrong with that? Yes, of course, just like the FBI TV show, this is obvious when the Bureau does some PR work to try to improve support. But as far as entertainment is concerned, it does a good job. Moreover, surprisingly, what has happened has made the film more focused on crime rather than espionage and "Commies". Instead, it is the fiction of one of the earliest agents and career he chose. Now he thinks the agent plays Jimmy Stewart, then he is pretty sure that acting and writing are good - because it was a movie with a real budget and study that did not accumulate a star with a third step. So overall, it's worth seeing, but not so great.
