I saw this movie with my father. I had to be pretty young, around 15. One afternoon he was on star movies. The film started somewhat vague, but you could say the thieves gathered to score. It really hit the pace after the first half hour. All the actors are great, especially the Blades and Lou Diamond. I think it's a set, they play so well. I can watch this movie anytime. I think it's the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters that try to deal with a very strange point. Jokes are not ominous, but they are both subtle and extreme, so they are so cheerful. A perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon.
