Words are seriously deficient, expressing the emotional power of this film; it's one of the most offensive you ever see, but the end is one of the most loving, gentle and emotionally fulfilling ones you could hope for. Every actor in every role is a stunning, especially wise and compliant Jamie Lee Curtis, a hardly wounded and furious Ray Liotta, and a heart-stopping Tom Hulce branch that should have him at any cost in the book. (This is the first choice for Best Actor in 1988 in Danny Peary's "Alternate Oscars"). The last half hour bordering on the melodrama, but the film gets every one of its tears - and if you're not from stone, a lot of them.
