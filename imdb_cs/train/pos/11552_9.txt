Here's another movie that really does not need a lot of recommendations. It's a classic comedy, very entertaining and entertaining, and of course inspired a successful TV series that many would say is even better (both I like in person). For some, it's hard to warm up to Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they were put on a TV show with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or maybe the other way around). But what we have in both cases are four good actors who, in real life, felt the same as their film counterparts to have done these characters. It's funny material, Neil Simon, who is key and where he laughs really. <br /> <br /> For those who have never heard of CUDD, it's the story of a nervous and anxious pure freak (Lemmon) who is thrown out of a 12-year marriage by his long-suffering wife and takes over his home in Manhattan's careless and absolutely irresponsible friend (Matthau). Pitting these two unlikely roommates together in the same four walls makes for some great funny problems.
