Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. She secretly attracts her to her normal neighbor, Shep Henderson (James Stewart). She casts Shep's spell that forced him to take off his fiance and fell for her. Things are going pretty nicely until Gillian knows she really cares about this dead man. She decided to tell her her secret. But how will Shep react when he finds himself "cheated" to fall in love with Gillian? <br /> <br /> When it comes to comely comedies from the 1950s, Bell Book and Candle are good but nothing spectacular. It's a very nice watch and is looking forward to almost everyone who sits with it. It's just not going to be the biggest thing to eat in the movie than the sliced ​​bread. The movie is cute, entertaining occasionally and eventually touches. Kim Novak and James Stewart do the best and have some real chemistry. Novak (as others have emphasized) looks rather unbelievable. Supporting casts with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold and Elsa Lanchester often laugh and emit a lot of spotlights from Novak and Stewart. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle can not quite decide what the movie wants to be. Is it a comedy with a screwdriver? Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a supernatural comedy? If Richard Quine was stuck with only one approach, the film could be even better and more memorable.
