Kate Beckinsale steals the show! Bravo! It's a shame that knights are not as good looking as Jeremy Northam. Mark Strong did a wonderful job. Bernard Hepton was perfect as Father Emmas. I love the ending scene (which is a supplement to the novel - but well written) when harvesting and Knightly dines with his laborers and friends of high society. Emma must show she's accepted it now. She's a changed woman. That's too fast, but OK. I'll buy it. Samantha Bond plays Emnon's former enthusiast and confidant. She is amazing. just as I imagine it. I believe that when the United Kingdom makes Jane Austen the best. American versions of English literature are made for money and not for quality. Look at that!
