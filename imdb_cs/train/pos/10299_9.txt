I'm a very big fan Jim Carrey. I laughed at the ASS during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. I also love it in my serious films, especially at the Truman Show. This is the cross between his Witty Side and his serious side. In this movie, of course, VERY fun, but there are parts that are very serious, and he pulls it out with great ease. he is indeed a multifunctional actor. As for the rest of the cast, I was happy with Jennifer Aniston's acting. I think she's more than a few nice boobs and a great ass. Morgan Freeman makes a very cold god. As for Steven Carell, his limited scenes are very funny, especially on the anchor scene. <br /> <br /> Overall I would have to evaluate 9. A good acting, fun scenario and some very serious situations make it a very good movie.
