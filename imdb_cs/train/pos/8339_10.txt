I.Q., in my opinion, is a sweet, charming and cheerful romantic comedy about finding the right person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) was really boring. For me, Ed (Tim Robbins) was more suitable for Catherine (Meg Ryan) than James was. Anyway, anyone who has participated in this film has done a great job. Finally, I recommend this sweet, charming and cheerful romantic comedy about finding the right person for every fan Tim Robbins or Meg Ryan who has not seen him yet. You are a lot of laughter, so go to a video rental shop, borrow it or buy it, kick off with a friend and watch it.
