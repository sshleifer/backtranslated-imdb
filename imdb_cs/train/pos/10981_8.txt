Hey, your really Theater found this when he slipped videos on the flea market in an almost new state, and when he read the back of the box, he saw it was somewhat "cult hit" so of course he came back home. <br /> <br /> What a strange movie. Aunt and cousin of former first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis live in this disintegrating 28 rooms in Long Island (Suffolk Co.) and share a house with raccoons, cats, fleas (eyow!) And who knows what else. Suffolk Co. were at one point everywhere over them to live in dirt, and old Jackie came to get things right. Anyway, it's a strange pair, Big Edie and Little Edie ... Edie (daughter) always wears something overhead and dances, sings and gives small pages a camera that rarely makes sense. Great Edie (mother, age 79) obviously likes to run naked, and while we get the hints of what might look like, fortunately, it was tastefully (?) Made to the moment we are mercifully saved. These women speak, speak and speak, mostly about the past, and do not have a lot of meaning except for them. They live in absolute dirt, cats do their business everywhere ("Look, the cat goes to the bathroom behind my portrait!") And one bedroom seems to be the center of their action. I close my eyes and listen to the voice of Edie, reminds me of my own aunt, who was from this region of the country and had the accent of Lawn Guyland. One scene has Little Edie, which is repellent with fleas, beautiful, you see that all the cats still scratched to attack the place. Box says these two women are "eccentric", and I must say that in this case it's just euphemism for "thrown out of their gourds," but this movie is not without moments when you really feel something for them. That's the same part of the haunted, sad and nasty, but I could not stop watching once I started. This is not my "normal" type of film, but I found it somewhat fascinating. But it will not be guaranteed for everyone.
