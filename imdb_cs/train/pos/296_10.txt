Sublimity is the way we have to achieve Beauty. And sublimation is the stuff from which this film is made. If that's not the best, it's my favorite of all Bogdanovic films. This unique work reminds us, like most of the director's other films, what life is (or should be): love, lost (or failure) and hope and faith and love. As the song that interests the movies (Gershwin's well-known song), the film makes the impossible right and tries to realize that no one can judge anyone; all with ease of comedy and the timing of the master direction (the first ten minutes, with detective ladies, almost without a dialogue line, based on the appearance and look at the characters - with the "Bogdanovich touch" on the basis of the view - is the class on Cinema Language, what PB was well taught by its admired directors from the Golden Age of Films). With the excellent cast and famous soundtrack (including the best Sinatra films "Trilogy"), this film is full of self-esteem and compassion and far from self-esteem and emptiness (as some critics have written) deserves a better place in the history of American cinematography than it has been. It's not "long style, short content": it's complicated in its simplicity and beautiful, absolutely beautiful.
