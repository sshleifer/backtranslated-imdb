I love this movie because I grew up around the race. Pat Boone reminds me of my father, who is attracted to trotting, because unlike purebred jockeys, men of normal height and weight can be. <br /> <br /> Yes, home in India in 1944 is a better movie, but it's also a very different film. April Love is easy and easy to watch, a good movie. (Discussing that Pat Boone's religious / moral views have forbidden him to sometimes kiss the girl! A pretty change from today's standard fare.) The home of Indiana with Walter Brennan (shot in black and white without the hint that someone sometimes breaks into the song) captures stresses and fights better, thereby satisfying the ultimate success, but requires more emotional investment.
