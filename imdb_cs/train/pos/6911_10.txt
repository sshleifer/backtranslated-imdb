While "The Kiss of Spider Women" occupied Raul Julia as a political prisoner in an unidentified Latin American country, this time he works for a dictator in a fictitious Latin country. In particular, the dictator suddenly disappeared, so Julia replaces El Presidente with the acting actor (Richard Dreyfuss) by filming the film in the country. From there, Dreyfuss has to figure out how to be a dictator while balancing it with his own life. Is it appropriate to transform the tense situation in Latin America into a comedy? Well, "Moon Over Parador" does a good job of doing so. No matter what they do in this movie, they drag them away. Just show why Richard Dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors of our time and what we lost when Raul Julia died. It is definitely worth seeing. Also starring Sonia Braga (who played together with Raul Julie in "TKOTSW"), Jonathan Winters and Sammy Davis Jr. <br /> <br /> I agree: the first lady is hot.
