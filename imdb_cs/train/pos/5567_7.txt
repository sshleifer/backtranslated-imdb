And I'll tell you why: who decided to adapt this movie to make it suitable for television was very bad. Everything about the drug is ruled out and hidden! How do they do it, can you ask? Well, they are not doing well, that's for sure. Anyway, instead of the marijuana Cheech and Chong have, they have diamonds! Still, the characters are moving in the haze of marijuana smoke and stoning others on the road without any explanation!
