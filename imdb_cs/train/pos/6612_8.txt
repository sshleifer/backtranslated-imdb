Just like Final Fantasy has brought CG to a whole new level, it's rebirth to capture motion. Neither a movie nor a cartoon, this film looks like a tribute to Noir, Akira, Sin City, Blade Runner and the new generation of European cartoonists. You see Paris as much as it can be, the characters look the same as you and me. They are flashing, trip, shaking as real actors as they have never been before. <br /> <br /> Do not forget that I hope to find my mind. You're most likely to figure out when you're halfway away from the movie. The script is definitely too simplified compared to famous thrillers, but it is definitely blissful to the eyes.
