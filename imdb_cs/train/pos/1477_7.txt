I watched this movie on Friday, April 7th. I did not see the last scene (because I talked to my brother about my mom at the same time). Anyone can tell me what happened to her? I watched a bit that her husband heard that someone was talking to his wife in the bedroom and then opened the door, she was dead. What happened to her? Did she kill herself? How could she arrange everything like phone calls while she is at home when her husband speaks with this strange admirer? I'm so curious! (I finally read that she suffered from Multiply Disorder Personality). <br /> <br />
