I loved this movie. Not just because I'm a big fan of Moritz Bleibtre, although it's in virtually all the German films that count. But also because he is not the main actor. Leadership was taken over by Barnaby Metschurat, who was the only reason why he looks at Juliet in 2001 and who actually carries this film on his shoulders. The family moves from Italy to Germany and is looking for a "German dream" (that's my own invention and irony ...) cheap jobs in the steel and coal industries. However, they end up opening the restaurant and the way the movie to this point itself is both poetic and fun and charming. From this moment on, the story is mainly about the two brothers of this family, Giancarlo (Bleibtreu) and Gigi (Metschurat). Gigi's dream of becoming a director is threatened by rivalry with his brother and his mother's determination to return to Italy. What follows is a great - and utterly neutral - view of what life can become the shape of your decisions. Finally, this film does not say which life (Gigi or Giancarlo) was more successful or fuller or more interesting. It just gives us a tremendous insight into what it must be like looking for identity when it comes to two countries and a mentality. and this view is not driven by bitterness or contempt for one country, making it such a great film for every country that deals with the tensions that emerge from immigration. The fact that director Fatih Akin moved to Germany from Turkey in the 1970s also lends this film a great deal of credibility and emotional accuracy. Pasta on the cake are fantastic performances of the entire cast, especially Metschurat and - I have to really emphasize this - the little boy who plays the young Gigi. The performance of this child would be a hard act that you should watch for almost everybody! Great movie, go for it.
