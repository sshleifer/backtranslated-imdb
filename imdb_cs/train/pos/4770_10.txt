The only show I watched since 90210! Why did they stop it? It was the only show that captured the essence of Hawaii and made you feel like you were part of all! At least they should go on DVD! <br /> <br /> I looked at similar shows but nothing is coming. The cast had an incredible chemistry and I look forward to every episode of great anticipation. <br /> <br /> They made a big mistake by pulling out the show. If anyone has any information about where to get DVD North Shore, send here a few lines. Thanks! Aloha!
