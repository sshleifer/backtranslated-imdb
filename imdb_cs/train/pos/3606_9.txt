I really liked Girl fight. Something I could watch again and again. The acting was fantastic and I thought Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the movie. I would say very convincingly. The film shows how women should stand for what they want to do in life. She had so much sympathy and yet so much hate at the same time. To deal with an ignorant father did not really help her. Even though he loved her, it was really hateful. Her mother died when she was younger, and it also rocked. Love story was a part that I really love in the movie as well. I felt the passion I had with each other. Then the drama reappears and then it's how she chooses between her boyfriend and her lifelong dream. I thought it was done right. That was the kind of end where you have to decide what's going on for them in the future. For all those people who like a movie based on sport with a good conspiracy, I recommend that you check it out
