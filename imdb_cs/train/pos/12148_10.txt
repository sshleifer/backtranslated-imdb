This movie has a lot of comedy, not dark, and Gordon Liu shines in this. He shows his comical page, and it was really strange to see him pick him up. His training is "unorthodox" and who would have thought the binding knot could be so fatal? Lots of great pieces and choreography. Very creative! <br /> <br /> Add Johnny Wang to the mix and you have a great final showdown! Do not try to mumble with the criminals; they are ruthless!
