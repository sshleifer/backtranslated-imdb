Although throughout the film, Andy Griffith plays again his role in this CBS television movie. The story is easy - Griffith's character dies and his last wish is that his wife and children scatter his ashes is a place he named (Mountain somewhere). Although it will never be seen on television and will never be released on video if you have the opportunity to watch this - GET it.
