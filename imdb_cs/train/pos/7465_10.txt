Warning: Contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie and do not plan so, just stop reading and taking the word for it. You have to see this movie. I've seen it four times, and I still have not realized what really happened in the movie. That's all I want to say, because if you did not see this movie then you will stop reading right now. If you still read, then I will ask you and maybe even if someone has some answers, you can send me an email and let me know what you think. I remember my English language teacher 11 is pretty good. His name was Mr. Krisak. For me, he was wise for his years, and he always had this skillful way to teach you things that might not have been too excited. If we did not like Shakespeare, he changed this story into a modern novel with a modern language to understand. Our class room was never a room, it was a cottage, and we were reading a book in the lake in our own free time. This was his own indelible way of indicating something in our spongy mind. <br /> <br /> I started this overview of Vanilla Sky with the description of this great man because he once gave us a task that was fixed in my mind like a long-lost phone number of my best friend and it made sense to me when I was watching The Matrix. Now, if I did not know better, I should have thought that the Wachowski brothers are really just the alias of my teacher, Mr Krišák. But because we have doubts, we assume it was not him. But this was the first time that this order was more than intangible. <br /> <br /> He asked us to prove to him that they were real. Show me how you can say you're real. It got the class to radiate all the usual ideas that I'm sure you can imagine. Everything from the pain, the sense of touch to the feeling of loss, to the feeling of hunger, has been resolved by our teacher to prove that we are real. After every script we gave him, he will return with one answer that would leave us without a word. <br /> <br /> "What if you're nothing else than hunting someone else?" <br /> <br /> What if you were another dream? What a bad question. It was a question / scenario that presented to us 15 years ago the astronomical use of the Internet and the rapid development of computers. How could that be? But if you look at today's technology, ask yourself what you were part of something else. Another great but surrealistic film this year, Mulholland Drive by David Lynch, has explored similar areas. But Vanilla Sky goes deeper than any other movie might hope for. In short, it's one movie that literally (if you leave it) blows your mind out of all the possibilities that surround you. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a young, hot shot, fair, full publisher and owner of several magazines. He inherited it from his father and although he has talent and business savvy, his board of directors, the seven dwarves, thinks he's a rich dink was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He feels he has done nothing that deserves the sum of success that each of them thinks should go to them. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, we meet one of David's wonderful toys named Julie Gianni, who played with the devastating but bombastic perfection of Cameron Diaz. David and Julie play a good game, and both claim to be there only to use each other, and the little ones are a bit interested in a monogamous, determined relationship. This is a type of relationship that is proportional to the other David attacks he had in the sex life of his life. And though both speak a good game, we can say that only one truly tells the truth. <br /> <br /> Then we meet Brian Shelby, who plays with the brilliant ceiling of a good friend of Kevin Smith Jason Lee. Brian writes the book that David gives, but they are also very good friends. This is something David has in his life very little and you can feel real self-care in the movie. Brian has one famous line that David has repeatedly said. And that's "sweet is not so sweet without bitterness." He further says that one day he will find true love, and not just this lover's condition, which seems to commit all the flutters that occupy his bed for a night or two. <br /> <br /> On David's huge birthday celebration (so huge that Steven Spielberg wishes him a happy birthday) Brian enters with his date, Sofia Sorrano, of course playing Penelope Cruz with what is best performer this year by the actress. It's just an invitation, and it seems first and foremost that David and Sofia are interesting to each other. And in the typical David fashion, despite being the best friend, she starts flirting with Sofia. To make matters more complicated, Julie appears uninvited and begins to spy on David. David then spent the night with Sofou but only talks and draws the cartoons of each other. There is no hanker. The next day, when David leaves the apartment in Sofia, Julie greeted her, offering him a ride and from there ....... well, I think we all saw the ads. <br /> <br /> That's all I really say about the plot, because that's where the film is bothering us with what's reality and what is blurred perception. We are acquainted with the character played by Kurt Russel and several other shady characters who all play a role in this labyrinth like a fog. There is a subtext of death and a possible cure similar to all that may or may not create the possibility of eternal life. This is just one of the exciting possibilities the film offers, but it does not end there. <br /> <br /> Just like many movies that are thriving today, this movie has a secret. The sixth sense may have started this foolishness, but it looks far back, and maybe you can thank Angel Heart for starting madness. No matter where it comes from, Vanilla Sky has one of its own hidden intestines. And what makes you so much fun is that the film will give you many obvious tracks along the way, but it is not enough to provide an apodic solution to the sleeves of truth and lies that you have just experienced. I've seen this movie four times and every time it's been because I want to see if there's anything more I can pick up, something more I can understand. To be able to work in the theater, letting him open new possibilities is something rare in the movie. All ersatz "Best Pictures of the Year" were good, but nothing spectacular. They lack substance. The beautiful soul was interesting but flat, The Royal Tenenbaums were interesting but unequal. Vanilla Sky is a rarity, because it's a movie that lets you crave more, but it guarantees your satisfaction with the movie and those you care about. I know that this movie has received mixed reviews, but I think those who do not like it do not quite understand. <br /> <br /> This is what the film is supposed to be about. That's what the film should do to you. It's supposed to feel something. Most other films this year were just empty spaces. This is not. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 Best Movie of the Year. I would like to see that this is going to be nominated for the best film and I would like to see Cruz as the best actress, Diaz for the best support, Cruise for the best actor and Jason Mewes should be footwear for the best actor. Cameron Crowe would have been there too. None of that must happen, and that's a shame. This is a movie that should not be missed. <br /> <br /> And finally, I'm sure Mr. Krisak would love this movie and maybe it's the movie that can answer his question. Can you prove that you are real? Or are we just imagining someone's imagination? Are we artificially transplanted for someone else? This is a movie that creates more questions than answers. And I'm sure he's okay with him. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes
