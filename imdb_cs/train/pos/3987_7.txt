Mother is one of those movies that you know are good, maybe even great, but it's like eating vegetables or doing homework for a child - too much work and a lot of pain to invest in. <br /> The story is potentially unpleasant in many ways: the death of the character during the first half-hour, the novel from December to May, the idea that a man cheats on his wife and then cheats on his lover with his mother, a collection of weak and somewhat unpleasant thirties, the apparent indifference of adults to children in their lives. This film was made in 2002 or 2003, but is thrown back into a collection of British (usually made for television) films from the late 1980s - it has a moral seriousness that never lets up, which produces surrounding pulsing angst. <br /> <br /> The mother is flawless, but that is partly a problem; if a film that deals with so many sensitive issues has some shortcomings - scenario discrepancies, some smaller actors - it's becoming an edge, but if such a movie is perfect, the experience of watching is raw and painful. Even technical features - lighting, adjustments, etc. London in this film is light and open, filled with rough light cutting. <br /> <br /> If you are tough as a nail or you are one of those super-sensitive people who love torture with sad movies or novels, then you will enjoy Mother. Anyone between them, make a mistake or be ready to brighten up. And be warned: how hard as a movie is from the beginning to the close-end, the worst comes. At the end of the movie, her mother asks her daughter what she can do to get her (because she sleeps with her boyfriend), and her daughter says she thinks about her and wants to hit her. Mother coincides, both stand up and - instead of a well prepared slap - the daughter raises her fist and gives a boxer's wound. Argh !!!
