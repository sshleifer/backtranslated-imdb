This movie is great. I find it very interesting. I thought the Wendigo legend was pretty cool. It was also great acting, as well as costumes, production, photography, direction, and screenplay. <br /> <br /> A very happy family, the holiday happens in the middle of nothing when a deer strikes. Then a hunter appears and is very angry and outraged at the fact that one of the antlers deer is broken. Then she starts to give birth to the family and they become strange things. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. It's worth it. Kudos to cast, crew and creators. Two inches up!
