I recall that I had appeared years ago when I first came out and was replaced by Parker Posey's performance. And the movie was pretty good. For anyone who spent a little too much time in the nightclub / hour after scene, this movie will have a special charm for you. It's not too serious, mostly fun, and Parker Posey is stunning for his talented journey through this indie jewel. I especially liked Diaz's character (reminded me of every fighting DJ I've ever met). And many other films could have inspired this film to preach the virtue of responsibility without being boring and clear. <br /> <br /> Babaganoosh!
