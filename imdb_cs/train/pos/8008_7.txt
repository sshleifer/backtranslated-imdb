As far as I know, this show has never recurred after the British television show since its original run in the late 1960s / early 1970s and most episodes are now sadly "missing anticipated deletions". 1971, however, still exists in full, and recently I got the chance to watch it all, the best part after 4 decades. After hurrying home from school, Freewheelers were essential for me and many of my contemporaries back in those halkyon days of angry trousers, Slade and Chicory Tip. And watching it again brought the nostalgic chest into the throat. It does not matter how bad the hammams are, they fight in the unintentionally entertaining scene, they make holes wide enough to pilot a large ocean yacht and "terribly, terribly" RADA accents of leading players. <br /> <br /> Do not forget about it all. As Freewheelers return to the previous child's television drama (when I call the "golden age") when the performances have just become fun and not taken so seriously. Before they become obsessed with all the damn "ishoos" that today's screenwriters young protagonists overturn, such as relationships, pregnancies, drugs, STIs, etc. There is no doubt that it would be a "modern audience" in these days of ubiquitous political correctness, was a black woman, one of the young male heroes would be a Muslim, the other would be crazy about her sexuality and the girl would be a ubiquitous go-getter with IQ beyond the scale that would forever get the boys out of scratches and make them look silly - in other words million million miles removed from Wendy Padbury's lightweight pad. <br /> <br /> It is a show that is very "of your time". But is this a bad thing? I do not think so.
