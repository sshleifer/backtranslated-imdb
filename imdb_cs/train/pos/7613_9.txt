The first episode I had seen from Lost made me think, I thought of what some people were crashing and persecuted by a giant monster. But it's not so, it's much more than that, because it's not a monster at all, and every episode you see on Lost is always better. a deserted island with an underground bunker, and especially a connection between people who crossed each other before crashing. That's a real secret. This series runs and I can not wait to find out what's really going on. I hope they do not make air in the last two episodes, this series deserves 9 out of 10
