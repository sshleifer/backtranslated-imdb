This movie is not great, but it's a good and enjoyable movie. It feels like an indie movie that consists of a gameplay scenario. Morgan Freeman basically plays, though the director swears that the script has not been written for him. And there's the little irony of an actor who goes to the supermarket to devote himself to research on a film he has not yet dealt with. I think he finally shot the film and we watch it :) I thought the level of dialogue was too favorable for my taste but refreshing, however. It's a movie that inspires the viewer to look at his own life and choose the direction to go. Somewhat strong emphasis on appearance if you ask me. Bottom line: a nice little movie, made in two weeks, basically two actors and a couple of accessories, dialogue drive, makes Morgan Freeman look good :)
