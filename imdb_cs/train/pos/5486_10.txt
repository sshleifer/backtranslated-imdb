Yes, the cameras were in the right place at the right time. It is so interesting to see how a world leader (such as Ch√°vez) who supports poor people in his country can be so low in the US. His worst "sin", in my opinion, takes care of those who are at the bottom of the barrel. What can be so bad? I have always fascinated the US response to the government + media reaction to Fidel Castro. At first Castro was a good guy (around 1959) when he replaced Batista. Soon Castro began transforming corporations in Cuba into the needs of the poor instead of fat cats. We are a decent country, but why are the media and the government having such a problem sharing with the poor? If these people are "dictators", then we could use more "dictatorships", especially where the poorest of the world's poor live.
