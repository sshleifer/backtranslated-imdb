Paul was utterly torn by someone who was most important to Dave. It's the same story, not funny. <br /> <br /> Paul told me this morning about Sammy Davis scene singing a new hymn parador. came to Brazil after a long flight from vegas, three planes, drove by car, etc. was beaten. he could hardly stand, he had to use a stick. he stayed in a trailer the size of his bathroom. He did not know he could do it. then saw a crowd of 6,000 surcharges, paid $ 7. he revived and shot the scene for two hours. he was magnificent, then almost collapsed. Paul is a great guy, though very liberal. real talent.
