Such masterpiece as the first of these two Snowy River films was, the sequel to "The Man From Snowy River" is all that should follow. He will not go to the fingers of his predecessor, preferring to leave the legend, which was the first film alive in some unique immortality. The man from the snowy river II is based on the return of Jim Craig to the country of the snowy river after a three-year absence. The film gently tells the story of a change in the nineteenth century, Australian history, legends and horses. The story shows the Hollywood touch in lighter shades, an aspect that was absolutely absent in the first film, but this clearly unites with the clear sense of Australian patriotism. The conspiracy is much more vivid than the first film and is much more exciting, with special aspects of the previous one included in the film, yet The Man of the Snowy River II has all the basic characteristics of the first film; sensationally beautiful cinematography, the amazing focus of the Australian tall country, the second most impressive track of horses they ever shot, and the fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack by Bruce Rowland, which is primarily equal. Geoff Burrowes has done excellent work with this film and is highly appreciated, especially with regard to the quality of the Australian film industry. The surrender of lead, from Tom Burlinson to Sigrid Thornton and the well-changed Brian Dennehy, conveys their parts with this desire and difference as the first film. As for the sequel, the Man of the Snowy River II is a masterpiece; deeply moving and inspirational experience again.
