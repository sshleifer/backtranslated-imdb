I'm not a big fan of most anime, but Gundam Wing is really different. The Gundam Wing lacks all the stereotypical melodrams you might think of when you think the anime, since the number of jokes done over the course of 17 hours will be only in double numbers, Gundam Wing gets into business. <br /> <br /> Gundam Wing is just like a political thriller as an action series. Large parts focus on the diplomatic engagement of the war, not only in battles. Although the battle of animation lacks extreme detail in cases where it would be just the pain to animate, individual battles between gundams are almost artwork with regard to the animated use of complex mechanics and fast moves. <br /> <br /> According to my knowledge, this 49 episode plus one film series was picked up in 2000 by a cartoon network and then professionally dubbed. dubbing is simply flawless. not just that every word is called a match, but voices actually make the characters more credible. many think it's best to watch anime with a subset in English, but I just do not have the commitment to do that. <br /> <br /> Not only that the votes are good, but the score used in the series is quite impressive. I'll just say he left me to wipe the net wisely to find a soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The plot of this series is what really kicks off the audience and no, do not move like some major dramatic drama like Lost, which was made for the sake of throwing you. explaining the story deeply would lead to many spoilers because many of the characters even have no names up to several episodes in the series. The harsh idea of ​​the series is that the country and its now independent space colonies have trouble keeping peace. This is how the war broke out, which led to military coup and the advanced diplomatic situation. I feel that further details will begin to provide information that is decisive for the plot. <br /> <br /> I'm going to end here when I say this series is great for anyone who likes anime, anyone who thinks ALL ANIME is stupid (they have a good reason to think about it) and everyone, who wants to get into the anime with a serious tone.
