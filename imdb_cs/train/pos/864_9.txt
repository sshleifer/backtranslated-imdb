Certainly one of the French films of the decade, a strained, atmospheric thriller that takes full advantage of the main characters who hear the obstacles to use sound in a way rarely explored in the cinema. Emannuelle Devos gives a truly amazing, versatile performance, sometimes frantic and manipulative, otherwise open and vulnerable. Another reason why those who appreciate a quality cinema should have eyes open to offers from France.
