Here is a precious gem for those of you who have not seen it or even have not heard it. During the 1980s, Dennis Quaid was a hot commodity, but in the early 1990s Dennis Quaid disappeared from the scene. In 1993 he returned to a big screen with three films, unfortunately the bomb. "Wilder Napalm" is a crazy movie about two brothers Wallace (Quaid) and Wilder (Arliss Howard), who are ... starters: yes, they have the power of pyrokinetics. Wilder decided not to use his power after a deadly event during his youth, where he and his brother exploded an abandoned house that killed the man who was inside the most famous of them. Currently, Wilder is a firefighter and is married to the murderous Vida (Debra Winger), who is behind home arrest, guess what, arson (see the movie to make it better). Wilder also did not talk to Wallace in five years because Wallace lit his hair during his bachelor party. Wallace loves his pyro force and uses it as a fun. He also runs carnival and is the main clown. When the carnival comes to Wilder City, Wallace decides to re-enter his brother and also see Vidu, whom Wallace has loved! Vida arrests the house, but Wilder is busy. So Wallace enters and the fun begins. Brother against brother ... fight with fire! <br /> <br /> Some great fireball that fits in this movie ... eat your heart out, Drew Barrymore! The movie also has really strange but funny elements like Wilder's Fire Unit singing acapella songs during the shootings and after the separation. Jim Varney (worldwide known as 'Ernest') appears as Wallace's carnival friend. "Wilder Napalm" is brilliantly shot ... and cleverly assembled ... very wall and avant-guard. Look at this ...
