My interest was raised as I walked over and saw the name of Iphigenia. My name is Eugenia, so I thought it was okay. I'm so glad I stayed on the channel. What a wonderful, wonderful story. Drama, sadness, some over the top, but wonderful time. I look at it and it makes me sad that all the ugly things that the film industry will culminate overcome these beautiful gems. Try Iphigenia and hope you will like me as well. I even got my kids (27, 25, 20 and 17) to enjoy them. It starts slowly, but the drama stays and you are drawn into the story. Watching this beautiful film made me dress up for another Greek tragedy and pathos.
