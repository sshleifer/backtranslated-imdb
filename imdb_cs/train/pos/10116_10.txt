A great and accurate film ... McGovern is making a great effort to explore and document his script and pay off. She is not afraid to tell the truth, though she could draw adverse reviews and comments from those who like the stories clean, sweet and shiny. McGovern again brings Christopher Eccleston, though not in such a high profile as he played in Hillsborough. I found this film as accurate, well performed and well presented as Hillsborough, and I will look at McGovern for his fiery unapologetic writing. Good work and my hat is gone to writers, actors, production crews. Great movie!
