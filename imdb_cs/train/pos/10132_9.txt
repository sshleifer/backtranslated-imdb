In this first episode of Friends, the 6 main characters of the series are: Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Ross Geller, Joey Tribbiani, and finally Rachel Green. We found out that Rachel, a wealthy girl who is a girlfriend of Monica since high school, left Barry's fianc√© on the altar because she found she did not love him. She also decides to live with Monica and become independent of her father, gaining her new job as a waitress in Central Perk. Ross, on the other hand, found his wife a lesbian and lost her to Susan, her partner. (We see that he moves to the new apartment in the episode) Monica emit (and finally sleep) with Paul "wine" in this episode, which gave her an excuse to be impotent because he divorced his wife. But in fact, he simply deceived her. Ps: I'm just enjoying Joey and Chandler's hairstyles in this first season! =)
