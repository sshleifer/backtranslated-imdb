I grew up in Brazil and I was visiting and surprised by the beautiful coast where the film was shot. The area is called "Parati" and is part of the "green coast" of Rio de Janeiro. It is about 150 kilometers from the city of Rio de Janeiro. The film brings to life a 16th century Brazilian world where Europeans barely begin to occupy a coastal area that was still in its original state and sparsely populated by various native tribes. French and Portuguese have fought each other for the territory and the upper side of the timber trade in Brazil, and have been negotiating with the natives who have fought each other for whatever reason. he is allowed to die by his countrymen, but he can escape and is imprisoned by all sorts of indigenous tribes.As he is the "slave" of the boss, according to the custom of the tribe, he is allowed to live in relative comfort for months, until the time is right to be killed and worn by the ritual of vengeance > <br /> What I love about this movie is that she loves the details of the indigenous villages and their way of life (walked naked and cannibal) and asks us to recognize and accept life in these times as it was: in the beautiful garden in Eden, life was dirty, violent, full of pathetic superstition and bizarre habits.Europeans come and bring their own problems, including more violence with better weapons and greed.There is no romanticized "noble savage" or "heroic explorer" who are trying to survive in a tough world. The film is neither inappropriately sympathetic nor reluctant to the native . From what I know about the topic, the display is quite accurate, giving the uniqueness of the project: how many movies have you seen about the life of Brazilian natives and their early issues with the Europeans?
