The fourth Pokémon film screamed me when Celebi died. Do not dare say that Pokémon is upset! I do not like it when people say that ... I liked Pokemon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should enjoy Pokémon, including this movie and other Pokémon movies. So without further comment, please say that the Pokémon is great and should be enjoyed by people of all ages. And why do Pokemon hate give low scores for all or most Pokemon movies? I do not understand .... They should not do ... There is absolutely no reason why people should only vote without showing that the Pokémon is upset except that: 1) The Pokémon is intended only for small children. 2) Pokemon is stupid. and 3) People would not like Pokemon. I think that's why people do not like Pokemon.
