The film begins to describe a movie: a person writes a movie or rather this film. It's quite a reference for yourself when it comes to thinking that it will be a black hole. A writer writes something and happens, or something happens and writes about it. It is very philosophical, like "Crazy Life", but more Zen-oriented and, accordingly, much better, in my opinion. At one point, there are conversations between people on the street, and then you see shots of those filmed people, and then you find that their answers are written when you're still in the forefront. Beautiful scenes and optical illusions are available. I hope it will come out on DVD so I can examine it again. He was seen at Cinequest (San Jose Film Festival, CA) on February 25, 2002.
