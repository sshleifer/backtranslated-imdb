... may seem like overstatement, but it is not. What is so hard to understand - why not make other music shorts like this? Was not beauty obvious to him? I think not. So short shorts were made only for business reasons and with some luck there may be some artistic value. Is that one exception - the only one? - where the director seems to have a vision and clearly appreciated music as art. Why did not anyone ever think of making Lester or Charlie Parker live? Fool, man. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that there was no sequel. If you've seen something like that, give it to me!
