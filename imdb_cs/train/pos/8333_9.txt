IQ is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that extends the largest and deepest thinking mind of the 20th century as Cupid's helpers. Concentration of heart and mind is the central theme of this subtle and thoughtful film. You do not know how to respond, because part of the time you see is doing stupid things to great scientists that feed on love but you hear that you are discussing some of the deepest riddles of space / time of our age. The end result is a funny film with surprise. Walter Matthau is the perfect Einstein, Meg Ryan creates an unpredictable, scattered mathematician, and Tim Robbins brings to life the contradictions of an ill-educated working man who is fascinated by science. They all make a false trip with love and science, mind and heart.
