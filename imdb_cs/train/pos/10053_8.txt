I have to admit that when I read the description of the Netflix genre as "Steamy Romance," I was a little skeptical. "Steamy"? In the film of 1968? I was ready to be disappointed. And when I realized he was shot in black and white, I knew my erotic hopes were interrupted. Boy, I was wrong! Not only does this film have all the elements of rock romance - the discovery of the first love, the fear of the mystery that emerged, the sudden unexpected journey - but occasionally this film was completely erotic. You will soon forget that he is shot in black and white. Cinematography deserves every prize it has gained over the years. And the performance of two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) is intense and unforgettable. OK, so they both tried to play school girls in their twenties. It is 1968. Do you really expect teenagers from the 1960s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this? Many adult women at that time attempted to meet their sexuality. Anyone looking for real teens is expecting too much. I think this movie was a long time ago. The level of eroticism was an unexpected delight; but he still managed to leave a lot of fantasy and decided instead to give us poetic descriptions to add what we were shown to. I have no doubt that the lesbians will be identified with these characters. As for you straight boys who love watching lesbians in action: Though it is not all you expect, I do not think you will be too, too disappointed.
