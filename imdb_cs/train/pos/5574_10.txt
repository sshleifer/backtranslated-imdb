Peter M. Cohen is wearing the winning satire, which twisted and turned inside. Critical film intimidation in major media publications as "offensive" and "hopeless" only underlines its intensity as a refreshing and focused drink of human sexual desire and passion. It's a tradition of what I call the "reality" of satire that follows the footsteps of "The Men's Society," "Chasing Amy," "Your Friends and Neighbors," and "Two Girls and Guys." Cohen's dialogue is cheerful and I am always interested in how he perfectly captured the real pace of today's interviews. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber and Jonathan Abrahams are three distinct, inexorable sexual obsessed predators, who, along with the film of their recently married couple (played well by Judah Domke), are reversed with a fever in their own words, Amanda Peet. Under the satirical surface is a romantic comedy that is much more satisfying than most candy-colored studio products.
