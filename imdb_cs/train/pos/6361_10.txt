I'm looking at the beginning of this movie for months. As a huge fan Jim Carrey I could see how he could get to Seins Grinch and make his own character. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie was pure magic. Carrey is a master in his business, and no one could do that perfect, like him. There has been a lot of experience for both adults and children, and this movie will surely become a timeless classic for everyone who is looking forward to coming years. I've seen my young daughter sitting year after year watching this video remake, and I undoubtedly look at it and laugh as I saw it for the first time. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey wrote all over the world and I do not believe it would happen without him. The supporting cast was, however, charming and entertaining in itself, most notably the adorable Taylor Momsen, which was the perfect foil for Carrey's excitement. A set of design, music scores and costumes all lend a hand to the magical, fabulous end product, and I believe that everyone involved can be proud. <br /> <br /> It's not an easy task to get a 22-minute cartoon into a feature-length live action movie, but Howard has managed to fly. For those critics who disagree, maybe it's your heart, which is too small in size.
