It's just two episodes in a five-part drama, but I can say it's one of the best things I've ever seen. It's on television, in silver screen or even in reality. <br /> <br /> As a writer, it's so good that it's almost demoralizing! As a viewer, it's so fun to be angry that episodes are more than fourteen days instead of Monday to Friday. It is clear that all these negatives are really positive. I am a modern person who has turned from television drama. Compared to movies, TV drama always seemed to be dated, quite tame and well, generally boring! "Five days" really brought the television to the 21st century, so at least my mind is changing for me. Go to him.
