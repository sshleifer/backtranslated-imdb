It takes about a year after the events in "Basic Instinct". Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London. During sex with a footballer at a speed of 110 km / h (you do not ask) he goes out of the way and ends in the Thames. She survives - no. The police hired psychologist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to find out whether he is psychologically competent in court proceedings. Naturally, he begins to play with his mind place and lots of murders and sexes to follow. This film was condemned before it even opened. It took forever to get a cast and a director, the problems with the script were constant and the cast was not happy (Morrissey complained about the film often). Yet it is not too bad. It's a lot like the first - there is a fresh musical score, beautiful places, lots of sex and nudity (it has to be adapted for R), a pretty complicated conspiracy and good acting - but that has no impact. She feels like the protector first. People are killed here with a leash (in my opinion) ... just as people have been killed by one ice. In one odd moment Stone picks up the ice carpet and stares at him. She also plays soap games with a man and might get involved in murder. Similarity is too obvious. It's also very rated - there are lots of explicit sexual discussions, male nudity (Morrissey looks much better than naked than Michael Douglas), nudity on the woman (Stone still looks great) and some bloody murders. Playing well on the pitch. The stone is fantastic; Morrissey looks miserable, but he's fine; Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis are good at supporting roles. <br /> <br /> So it's not bad at all, but I feel like a remake first. However, I recommend this. People have just attacked because Stone is not very fond of thinking that it is stupid to do the sequel to "Basic ..." 14 years after its inception.
