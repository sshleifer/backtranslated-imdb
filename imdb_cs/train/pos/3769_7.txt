Come on, learn some fun. When I was little, oh, this movie was Oscar-worthy for me. I thought it was totally hysterical. One of the best movies I've ever seen. Now it's a little foolish, but come on. If you like "Outstanding Adventures," you should probably have fun with "Bogus Journey". This was the movie before "Dude, where is my car?". Just this is really fun. Like I said, it's just a good time. It should not be taken seriously, and if you enjoy the first, you should like "Bogus Journey". It's just a fun movie with some unforgettable characters. Just look forward to seeing yourself, let's go and remember it's a stupid comedy. That is all. <br /> <br /> 7/10
