One of the most sensitive comedies that hit the Hindu movie screen. Remake of Priyadarshans 80s Malayalam hit Boeing Boeing, again remake of hits of the same name in the 1960s. Garam Masala improves the level of comedy in the Hindi cinema. Akshay Kumar once again proved to be one of the best Hindi super stars to make a comedy. He was well connected with the new piece of John Abraham. However, John still stays in the shadows akshays and can not rise to the opportunity. The new girls are cute and make the full justice of their roles. They have to watch a comedy. Let your brains go and laugh 2 hours !!!! Laughter is the best cure! Ask Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar !!!!!
