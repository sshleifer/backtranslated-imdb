the film is much more sophisticated and more intelligent is its exploration of sexual tension than such American attempts as nine and a half weeks ... the scene itself the scene itself ... with the couple joins in the cage while the heroine asks for orgasm ... It's amazing ... I have not seen this movie in 20 years ... but it does make indelible pictures in its mind ... it is rich in texture and it successfully creates a world where sex is the engine of all activities and it's a yawn at its bottom, which lives in us all ... the conspiracy is European, and it turns a bit, but also life ... especially when you are 17 years old and you have a constant claim ...
