My favorite police series of all time will turn into a television movie. It works? Yes. The rider runs for the mayor and is shot. The killing hall of fame appears. Pembleton and almost all the police officers who have ever played in this series. A lot of flashes will help you, who did not see the TV series, but also the fans entertained. The last five minutes deal with another murder, and two dead cops appear at the very end. And a short look from my favorite coroner Juliana Cox. That's a good movie.
