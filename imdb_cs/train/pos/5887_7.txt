So Mary and Rhoda aged - who was not? I was a teenager when Mary premiered, and "young adults" when he left the air. Yes, it was great to see Mary and Rho together, and yes, maybe the film did not keep the comedy of the original series, but there was plenty of time that remembered the spirit of the series to be honored. Example: a producer who hires Mary and then dictates the idea of ​​a new series of "old people". Is not that typical of the mentality of today's Hollywood TV and film bean counter? It does not have to be MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW at best - but it's a pretty damn good look back at one of the best shows we grew up in the 1970s.
