This is an excellent movie and is a treasure that can only be captured by sporadic cinematographic performances because it is not available on a video / DVD. The way the movie begins with the two lovers arriving and ends up leaving (though there is a lot going on between them and not staying here) gives you a sense of closure and the feeling that everything is right with the world. If you have a chance to see this movie, then do it. I can not wait to see it again, and I want it to be possible for a general release.
