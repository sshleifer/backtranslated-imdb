*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** A pack of unforgettable moments (as quoted above, beaten by Primus), Deliverance tells the story of four guys who went on a wild forest trip to go rafting on white water and get out of the big city for a while just to find out that their fun will soon have a bad turn. It's not a Hollywood movie. There are virtually no special effects, the setting is extremely realistic and nothing is sugar-coated or nicely. City boys look like urban boys, and even the hard man Louis who Burt Reynolds accurately portrayed is obviously at the mercy of the wilderness on this journey. It's a perfect example of a movie movie. What if a couple of friends got into a river in a forest that none of them knew, and in the end he was desperately trying to avoid trying and sentencing for murder that they had to commit to saving their lives? > <br /> It is clearly a very strong element of the film that deals with the social and class structure and relationship (or its inadequacy) between rural and urban nations. When the four guys arrive in the woods at the beginning of the movie, obviously they do not know how to meet and talk to people living there, as if they are not sure they understand or will be able to communicate. This communication block is most memorably illustrated on the scene of dueling banjoes in which they try to climb a car and truck and get someone who drives the vehicle down for them. While Drew, apparently an inbred and probably mentally inadequate boy on the porch, is fighting guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the movie), Louis has some trouble buying gas and Bobby comments on genetic flaws and how amazing it is all. When the boy turns away from Drew, who offered him to shake his hand after his amazing jam, Bobby tells him to give the baby a few bucks because he knew none of them was quite sure how to respond. /> This is the kind of thing we see in Deliverance, which creates the so much tension that follows. This gorgeous scene where there was a lot of fun (including the funniest scene from the dancers, when the Brother, where are you?) He ended up with the fact that everyone is misunderstood what to do around him. These people are apples and oranges and live with completely different rules of life. The people with whom Louis, Bobby, Drew and Ed meet in the hills, have grown from modern society and modern laws separately and have lived according to the natural rules that do not include that you will not kill. Confused by their clumsy behavior, four friends set off on the river, hoping that the strange affair would end and begin an adventure. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) When they are briefly separated from each other and Ed and Bobby hit the hillbillies next to the river, which quickly become unpleasant, uncertainty about the way these people live - as determined by the above scene - comes into the game, creating the most tension during the scene. I think a good sign of a quality thriller is that the tragic element of the movie, specifically attacks and real killings, takes up very little time on the screen but remains some of the most memorable parts of the film. There is no ruthless violence here, it's all for obvious purpose and it has a surprisingly powerful effect. This step is about the violent collision of two very different kinds of people and what can happen when they are unintentionally in the war. A trip to the rest of the river after an attack that takes up most of the movie brings some spectacularly effective tension and keeps you on the edge of your seat without bombarding you with so many events that you are numb. It's surprisingly effective when we find that Ed can very well kill the bad guy upstairs on the cliff and the tension in the film will not leave as the three surviving team members get to the bottom of the river because they explain to the police a dubious explanation of what happened on the river , and why a Member's brother-in-law is missing. It is a very disturbing film that is a testimony to his success, because it is quite obvious that such a film is a bit of a shudder. Hillbillies are human (ie, more realistic) versions of sub-human rednecks seen in childish but relatively similar films like Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2, without ever being compared to a timeless film such as Deliverance. When we follow these four men through our fatal weekend in the woods, the natural element is so real, and we recognize the man so well and so gently that it's almost like we, as individual spectators, really the fifth team member. It's not often that such a movie could get.
