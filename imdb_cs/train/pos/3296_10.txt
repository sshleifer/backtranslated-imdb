Mina Kumari has more styles and graces, just moving out of position, sitting on the floor before you find it in most other films. The director has created more unforgettable beauty scenes than it seemed possible. Music and dance are of the highest quality. You may notice that on the first dance scene, the director has different things in the background: another girl is dancing, drunk down the stairs, a lot of work, but he knew we would watch the Mina dance and bet, you saw it many times, you did not notice everything. Perfection. JQ
