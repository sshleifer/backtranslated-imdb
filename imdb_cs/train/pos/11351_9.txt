Excellent movie. The whole picture was shot in Budapest, so I feel proud. My little problem was that the trains in the movie belonged to the Hungarian State Railways (M√ÅV) and it is obvious that they were used on a large train, not on a local railway - according to the Chikatilo story, he raised his victims to the local railway station. In addition, the film is excellent.
