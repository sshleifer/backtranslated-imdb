There are some great things on this movie. Marion Davies could act on the right property; she is great in comedic roles. William Haines could act and you can see why he was one of the most popular front men of the screen. (Until the potential scandal has led him to do business). The story is a bit tricky, but so beautifully he managed not to notice. King Vidor's leadership is one of the main reasons. Manufacturer? Boy genius, Irving Thalberg. It's about making movies and you can look at the process as it was in 1928, cameras, ensembles, directors' directors and emotating actors. You see (briefly) some of the main stars of the day; even Charlie Chaplin turns around looking for a signature. You will also experience the glimpses of Eleanor Boardman, Elinor Glynn, Claire Windsor, King Vidor and many others who are otherwise just names and old photographs. <br /> <br /> Please, even if you are not a fan of silence, take the time to capture this movie whenever you can. It's really a wonderful journey back in time.
