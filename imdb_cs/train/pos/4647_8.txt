It requires a very special kind of person to make a movie that is so feeble, charming, disgusting and nasty, but it does so, it also makes brilliant and quintessential personal cinematographic liberation. Crispin Glover, in all his "out there" antics and predispositions, really did something unique. In a world that has become sharply partisan, it seems that this film avoided the standard lines of creativity and art and effectively scared everyone. <br /> <br /> Right now, the film is interested in a rather remote paradigm (if there is a model) and initially shapes it with similar Shirley Temple in front of the swastika and naked women with the pleasure of a man with cerebral palsy. It's rather shocking, but if you had a chance to hold Q & A after screening, it opens up a worm sack that lets you wonder whether it's an art or just the lowest common denominator. In your face you can feel the tremor that will eventually cause this movie. They will never be accepted, nor are they supposedly auteurs of the world who boringly talk about the human condition. Maybe you do not like it, but it is definitely worth watching.
