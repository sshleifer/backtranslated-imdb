Johnnie To's Election has some great music on initial credits and a nice introduction design, a kaleidoscope of Chinese characters and those Asian mobsters who solemnly promise or publish some sacred things; in fact, a great deal is greatly appreciated. I found out from you that Bishop Seraphim Sigrist was quite eager to see the movie That. The one I started with, the choice, is exciting and interesting and only slightly violent of today's standards - moderately and also violently; the story of an asian bloody intent, uses a puzzle of elements, violent reality from the lives of mobs, a scepter race, true details, and, like Coppola, we assume that we think some of the morally enchanted mafias are demanding and kind. The performances are rather fun and colorful. The election is well done in a pleasant, rather careless style of tourism in Hong Kong; the end is bitter, right, straight and scares the children.
