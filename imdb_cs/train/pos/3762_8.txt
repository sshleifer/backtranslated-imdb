Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves return as two San Duas effects that are sent to another trip because someone in the future feels the opposite of the way he was introduced in the first film. <br /> <br /> The only difference is that their journey is "somewhere" between heaven and hell and ends with both. When they meet Grim Reaper, they get the chance to end their lives to play it for a chance to come back and stop the two evil robots in order to destroy the future they have. In addition to playing roles, they have ... er ... improvements, play (and revive a few more sales in the process) some classic games (even I have the original copy of the Battleship in the closet). <br /> <br /> The reason I liked this movie better than the original is that it deals with "how it can be" instead of "what it was". Without damaging the movie, I can not give you any information about this (I think you'll just have to watch and decide for yourself 8 out of 10 stars.
