A pleasant story about the Pimlico community in London, which, after the explosion of a bomb exploded in the Second World War, found a royal charter stating that the area in which they live forms part of Burgundy. This movie works because it appeals to the fantasy that many of us have to create our own rules and we will not have to listen. A solid cast of British figures, especially Stanley Holloway, makes it more credible. <br /> <br /> There are very nice moments in the movie, for example, when people fill in supplies and other Londoners on the other side of the barricade's side starts throwing food and other things on them. <br /> <br /> Although you've always known that Pimlico will once again become part of Great Britain, the people of Pimlica and, as a result, the viewer does not make sense when it happens, you will leave a pleasant feeling. It's amazing to think that these low-budget films from a small London studio are still so popular fifty years later. Manufacturers must have something right.
