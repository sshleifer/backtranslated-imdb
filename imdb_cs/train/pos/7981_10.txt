In Mexico City he used to be a former CIA assassin, and nowadays alcoholic decadent John Creasy (Denzel Washington) hired industrialist Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony) to recommend his old friend Rayburne (Christopher Walken) to be the bodyguard of his daughter, Pita (Dakota Fanning) and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell). Pita changes the cold Creasy's behavior, brings him to life and smiles again and feels great love for her. When a girl is kidnapped and Creasy is informed of her being murdered by criminals, she swears to kill anyone who is responsible for kidnapping. <br /> <br /> "Fire Man" is almost a masterpiece and will certainly be a classic in the future. The story is excellent, never left, and despite having 146 minutes of running, the viewer does not feel the time is running. The cast is made up of outstanding actors and actresses, their performances are excellent, emphasize Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. Cinematography has wonderful moments and the script has stunning lines. I personally loved when Charles Walken explains to Manzan (Giancarlo Giannini) that Creasey's specialty is death and prepares his masterpiece. I agree with the user who commented that "Man on Fire" is one of the best, if not the best film of the year in this genre. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Chamas da Vingan√ßa" ("The flames of revenge")
