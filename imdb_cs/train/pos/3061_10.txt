This movie shows the kind of work you want in each movie. Barbara Bain and Donald Sutherland (who play a husband and wife) are positively paralyzed and discussing "family business" as if it were a grocery store or a dry cleaner. Macy, Campbell, Ullman and Ritter are also amazing. They play each other as members of a top theater company, who realize that a quality product requires each actor to support others in the world. And finally, Sammy (David Dorfman). What a wonderful performance from a child ... and what a special look that Ullman has, whose son is playing! <br /> <br /> We are treated with a unique story in "panic" and it is a rarity in these days of tired superheroes. The dialogue is sharp and clever, and this relatively short film still has the power to bring a whole host of emotions from the viewer. There are places to laugh, be shocked, be horrified, be sad, be excited, angry and love. It's not a movie that lets you jump out of joy, but when you're done you're more than happy because you knew you spent the last 90 minutes experiencing bad work. <br /> <br /> More of us would go to theaters if we were treated with a quality ride. When are the forces waking up in Hollywood? It's a real shame if something like that gets into festivals and households that are lucky to have a cable.
