I basically like the movie Verhoeven, because in my movie I'm looking forward to the great pscychosexual story I've seen before in "Basic Instinct". It's really a wonderful thriller that I enjoyed a lot. So, of course, it's for me to watch another Verhoeven movie. <br /> <br /> Well, it's his previous direction before his block bourter hit "Basic Instinct" and for that I was very curious to watch the movie and yes, the film fulfilled its hopes and expectations. <br /> <br /> This "Fourth Man" movie is a great pscychosexual drama that is lit for some audiences. the story of this film is about a gay writer called "Reve" (Krabbe), an alcoholic who lives on his own moral values ​​and sees many visions that can warn him of a future accident. At the end of her lecture she will introduce a seductive woman named "Christine", which has a mysterious past she does not want to reveal. She meets her in her house when she is a boy. The next morning she looks at her sexy, the person she met at the station. She is curious to meet him and tell Christine to invite him to his house. <br /> <br /> That's it. I do not want to reveal the whole story because it's a Verhoeven movie and the end of the movie is really surprising! I especially like the character "Reve," which is a great playable "Krabbe". Actually, I'm like his acting, because as a homosexual person I'm clearly identified with his character and yeah, I like his charming face. I would like to thank Mr Verhoeven for making such a black comedy. </ br /> <br /> Rate this movie: 10 out of 10.
