Everyone, my name may sound strange, but it was nothing else! <br /> <br /> Some way, I did not see anything like this so crazy! Of course it's a good thing. It's a humorous movie, and my absolute favorite thing is to nest things in one! Just like little chicken, a fish that pretends to be King Kong and says a pig says: "King of the King who killed the beast", world war, and more. Walt Disney NEVER lost his touch, perhaps not for this. Also, as they did, they were watching the movie and it was like a home cinema. <br /> <br /> Some parts do not fit. Like the original lion king, was not Timon and Pumbaa with Simba when he defeated Scar? They are not in this movie! fought against the hyenas behind the scenes. Even more, the reason why Pumbaa is not so sure is that he was separated from other animals, and it's just Timon, Timon, Timon. Someone realizes that only Timon's story was said while pumbaa only memories? But besides, that's great!
