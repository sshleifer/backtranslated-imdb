The "Footlight Parade" is fascinating on so many levels. There is no way that "theater prologues" are supposed to be, of course, produced in any theater on earth. Think about huge swimming pools and three-storey high fountains, for example, for "Waterfall". (Berkeley directed John Garfield in "Make Me a Criminal" six years later and had Dead End Kids singing "at the waterfall" when they took their showers.) "Shanghai Lil" is the best serial number in the picture. It's a catalog of sensitivities of the 1930s Warner Bros. Note that African boys mixed up with white and Asian prostitutes. You would never see blacks integrated into the social scene in other films of that time unless they were carrying a train or maid in a big house. Here the blacks sit at the bar and sing with the others. I'm also excited when military dancers make a presentation of Roosevelt's "card section." There is also the NRA Oracle - the logo of the controversial national administration of the renewal of the new agreement. The FDR was a new president, and the hope was so high that he would pull the nation out of the crisis. You would never see something that MGM would of course focus on. Warner Bros. He wholeheartedly supported the rise that dictated by F.D.R. management. Dear Little Miss Ruby Keeler has never been better than playing the Chinese Lil Pro. She barely looks at her feet as she dances, which was one of her signature defects. <br /> <br /> The thing in front of the code is fun. The "Waterfall" number is amazing in this respect. The girls change into their bathing suits on a crowded bus and run across Times Square with all their lights. The girls spreading eagles that swim above the camera provide crotchings that would not be visible for 35 years. Within a few months, the Code of Conduct will remove such nasty pleasures.
