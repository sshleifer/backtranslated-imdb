Well, I have to admit that I have never seen "Rhoda" and just one or two episodes "The Mary Tyler Moore Show". Although I know nothing about this comic talent duo, I still enjoy this movie. Mary will return to work. Rose is lucky to be a comedian. Rhoda faces a photographic career. And Meredith ... what exactly does she do again? These three stories, which follow in two hours, are fun and entertaining in a way. When two long-time friends meet, it makes only a better movie. <br /> <br /> I was surprised how good it was. The little jokes of Mary and Rhoda were fun. The scenario itself was very well compiled. In recent years, I have seen Moore and Harper in other films, and I think they are very good. But I did not think they worked well as a team. While both actresses are doing their part in fulfilling the title of this film, they never lose me. (During this movie.) Joie Lenz and Marisa Ryan play their roles in order, but nothing great. The rest of the cast, like Jonah, Cecile, and ... everyone else works well. <br /> <br /> As this is a meeting, you would expect fans to enjoy some shows. From a non-fan I still enjoyed this little meeting. Good story lines for each character and two main characters make this movie very good. (The newest versions of the MTM also do not hurt.)
