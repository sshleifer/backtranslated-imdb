Emma is true romance. If you love volcanoes, charged with joke and foolishness, you will love this movie! It's the truth of a novel that is very important, with some twists and turns added for pleasure. Gwen is not one of my favorite actor performances, but she played a role that required everything she had to offer. She shines in the role I think no other actress could do the right justice. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam, as a hero. how are you shocked? I have never seen him as obviously handsome, but hell! What the right role it can do for you! It looks as good as the sensual, royal Mr. K, that I literally looked at him in the new light. He does and excellent romantic leadership. The charm and character that brings to your role is great! Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi brings the rest. good partition. A good movie. If you are a fan of Jane Austen, check out this movie along with pride and prejudice - and most importantly, buy books. Improves the film to extraordinary heights
