Critics need to examine what they consider to be a good film. I think the critics have seen too many action films and have matched the movie Matrix. Europe is a breath of fresh air, a film with so many layers that one view is not enough to understand or appreciate this excellent film. Lars von Trier shows that old shooting styles can create a beautiful cinema and build drama and tension. The over-projection effect it uses during the movie wakes up and expands the characters and focus of the conversation they have. Other effects she uses such as color and black and white in one scene, like Hitchcock, and a red coat girl attract attention and drama and drama. The commentary is excellent and has a hypnotic effect, again emphasizing the central characters of the scene and the action there. I could talk about the effects more, but I think you would all agree to push this film into your own category and really reinforce the drama of the film. The movie you buy, if you do not already have one, and one to see if you are. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Do not miss this artistic noir movie of one of the best film directors.
