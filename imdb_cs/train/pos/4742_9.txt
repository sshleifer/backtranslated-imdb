This movie contains more actions before the initial credits than in Hollywood movies of this kind. This film produces Tsui Hark and stars Jet Li. This team has brought you many good Hong Kong cinematographic productions, including the Once Upon and Time series in China. The action was fast and furious due to the amazing wire work. I only saw two-wire wires. In addition to the action, the story itself was strong and not just a filler. To find more action movies to compete with, you need to look for Hong Kong cinema in your area. They really are worth checking out and usually do not disappoint.
