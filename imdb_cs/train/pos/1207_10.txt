I still love 17 years after I first saw it; in fact, I found out that I had lost my copy and was very upset. Despite the fact that I did not like the original (like a child I have never noticed and like an adult), this should be cartoons *. Just dark enough to be interesting and light to be enjoyed by everyone. I'm more than happy that my parents have picked me up on such a thing rather than the cartoons we see today that we will teach our children. The music is great and it gets stuck in my head forever ... I downloaded the whole soundtrack at one point or the other.
