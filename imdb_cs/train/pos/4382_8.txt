The focus of "Braveheart," released in the same year, two costume dramas asks for comparison. I admit that I am interested in Mel Gibson, and yet I retain the rational preference of Rob Roy. Both "Braveheart" and "Rob Roy" convincingly portray the history of the Scots in bloody, romantic fashion. "Braveheart" is an epic paean of individual honor and courage and gentle revenge of imagination. It is also melodramatic, anachronic and maudlin. Note how slow movies are used. His violence is both ugly and so famous. This is the second quality that makes it more appealing to teen thinking. While "Braveheart" surpasses "Rob Roy" in the utmost level of the massacre (not to mention his adventurous run), the final film is ultimately ripe and satisfying. His activity is more undervalued, but more surprising and smarter. His sex is less spectacular, but very erotic. "Rob Roy" also has a better romantic interest. His dialogue tries to bring the poetry of the period closer. His rotting teeth in the actor's mouth attempt to approach the dentistry of the era. And Tim Roth is a superlative villain. Also recommended are: "The Last of the Mohicans" and "Patriot". You can find it more like a "brave heart" with an emphasis on the desire of blood, with the former more like "Rob Roy" in tone. All the above films deserve their R rating for violence.
