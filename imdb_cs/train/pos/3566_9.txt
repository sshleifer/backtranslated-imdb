In 1954, Marlon Brando was a hot actor after appearances in Streetcar Named Desire and On The Waterfront. Frank Sinatra still had to re-emerge on the silver screen. But Sinatra's portraits like Nathan Detroit helped restore Sinatra to his fans. This is a great screen of great game and the choice of lead and support players is amazing. Imagine a movie where Brando sings? It was his only singer, as he portrayed Sky Masterson. In addition, she leads women Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine (she played the game phase as Nathan's long-suffering friend Adelade). Special mention is dedicated to the great Stubby Kay (as beautifully beautiful) and with all respect for Eric Clapton, no one seems to have Rockin 'The Boat approaching Stubby. Sheldon Leonard, who would be famous as a television producer of such shows as The Danny Thomas Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show, makes Harry The Horse fun, BSPulley is great as the rough and rough talk of Big Julie and even Regis Toomey offers his perfection as "Brother Arvide". It's one of the fun musicals to see, a good comedy, and you get Sinatru and Brando. Soooooo "Luck Be A Lady Tonight" and brother ... "it's your dice"
