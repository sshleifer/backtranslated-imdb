Doctor Feinstone is a dentist. She has a beautiful woman and a huge house with a pool. In short, he finds out that his wife is talking with a pool operator - he realizes that for every clean one there is bankruptcy. He starts to torture his patients ... Corbin Bernsen is brilliant as a frantic dentist - he's absolutely incredible. He is surprisingly a little gore, but the scenes of dental torture are quite ugly and grotesque. We highly recommend: "Dentist 2" is also worth a look!
