Welcome to Collinwood is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Excellent cast occupancy, close fitting and gorgeous direction. A taper film that does not bother with standard tricks. <br /> <br /> This movie does not talk much about this movie without spoiling it. The tag line says everything - 5 boys. 1 Safe. No brains. William H Macy and Sam Rockwell lead an amazing cast. George Clooney should congratulate us for making this jewel. <br /> <br />
