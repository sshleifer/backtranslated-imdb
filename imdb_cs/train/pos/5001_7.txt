Aardman does it again. In addition to Pixar, Aardman Animation proves once again how to properly animate. I had a great time watching the first episode of Creature Comforts. I thought it was well translated for the American audience. My only interest is that most of the audience will not have a good humor in this show. <br /> <br /> When I was a fan of the BBC version and short film, I knew why I was when I sat down to look at it. Animators have done a great job, which corresponds to the recorded voices of the animals with the perfect result. Check out the first episode with a goat that sounds like stones and dogs on the street who call each other "dawg". Is it for everyone? It's not a long shot. In fact, I would like to see that the show will last throughout the season. But as I said earlier, the audience will not have it.
