The radio was not 24 hours a day 7 days a week when I grew up in the thirties of England, so the Hour of Children was a matter for me when we had batteries and a battery that would save energy. Several programs I've heard make a great impression on my young mind, and the three I remember are still "Toytown," one of all animals in the zoo, and "Gray Owl," which talks about the animals he called his "brothers" . Only recently did I find out that the gray owl is not really "Indian," but the debt paid by Sioux boss gives me great sense "Man becomes what he's dreaming." We could all dream of a world changing and beneficial like Archie Gray Owl Belaney. The new gray owl could influence world leaders to clean up the environment.
