I got into this great program in Season 4 and since then I've seen all the episodes got all the episodes on DVD and they are still improving and improving in Seasons 9 and 10. Now Richard Dean Anderson does not have to, but now Ben Browder and Claudie Black still gave the show more power and the original even after 10 seasons. Sadly, now the science fiction channel has got rid of this amazing show without the hope of a relay for Season 11 doing two directly on a DVD movie and hopefully more. Atlantis is still strong in its 4th year. And in the third part it is the third work, where the star gate approaches death. This TV show must be seen for all sci-fi fans and genres of people because it has so wide a variety of things that appeal to all ages and all types of people. Watch IT !!!!! 10/10
