A film with an excellent shine and a horrifying and unusual love story, Luzhin's defense is an intense attraction of the eccentric genius and woman of beauty, depth and character. It gives John Turturro the truth (thank Ralph Fiennes for not murdering her.) Similarly Emily Watson shows the wealth of her experience (from her excellent background on the stage). To get to the tortured chess master (Turturro), her character must show intelligence and feminine love. Watson does not express the sexuality of beauty, but brings to her self-confidence, which is tempting. In a casual encounter between Natalie (Watson) and Luzhin, she inconspicuously prevents him from losing a chess piece that has fallen into a hole in his garment - a specially crafted piece that we realize later in the film came to symbolize his hopes and desires. Later, as their love affair unfolds, she gently compares dancing with chess (Luzhin learned to dance but never with a partner); she encourages him to lead her "with courageous, brilliant moves", allowing him to relax enough to play his best (and also realize that she is her lover) later. the woman who inspired man to his greatest success and finds her own deepest fulfillment, emotionally and intellectually (or that leads us to conviction - at a time when Natalia is rather a liberated woman than someone who behaves like a stereotypical wife and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> is only a photogenic backdrop for the development of emotional and emotional film, even though it is treated with this game enough to convince chess players that the characters exist, although the tragedy of remarkable heights by the classic author is the ultimate revelation surprisingly uplifting.
