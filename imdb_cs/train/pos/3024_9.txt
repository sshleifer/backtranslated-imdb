A film that dramatized the obvious reluctance to deal with the inevitable coming of World War II when the Spanish Republican, sent by his soon overthrown government (Charles Boyer), penetrates into England and seeks support by trying to influence owners of rich mines not to sell coal to fascists in Spain. It captivates local residents, defeats convincingly in one scene and later in a movie that faces an angry mob of miners who see it as another threat to their clumsy livelihood. Regardless of the socio-economic hierarchy, xenophobia, and world politics, this film penetrates into a dark and thrilling intrigue that involves unfaithful compatriots playing Katina Paxina and Peter Lorre and is professionally filmed in numerous darkly illuminated scenarios that were placed in the terrible hotel James Wongem Howe drives more than once to get under his skin.
