I'm sad to say I disagree with other people in this episode of Columbo. Death Lends and Hand is sincerely the kind of boring Columbo to me. Several times I was bored and changed the channel. I still love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in my roles, but the story was weaker in this episode than in others. First, Robert Culp plays the investigator for the character of Ray Milland. He urges him to investigate his young pretty wife, played by Patricia Crowley, to find out if he has an affair. In return, Culp's blackmail figure cheats on a wife who plans to expose her plan to a husband who has ruined his career. Culp kills her with anger by striking her face and putting her body elsewhere. I do not know. Maybe I did not care about this at all. Of course, Columbo will finally get it. It's just a question of how.
