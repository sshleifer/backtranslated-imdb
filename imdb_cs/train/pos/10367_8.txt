When I first saw "Screaming in the Dark," I did not know what he was doing. But when I saw it, I was shocked by what it was all about. When I saw it for the second time in Australian cinematography, I realized the second point: communication problems. You see, when Dingo grabbed the child of Linda Chamberlain (Meryl Streep), she and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) were saddened but not shown. As Adventists on the seventh day, they believed that God wanted it to happen and therefore could not mourn her. But when people across Australia saw their sadness, they all started to believe Lindy did it herself. The most important thing is that the bad news was reported to the public and that people turned away from Linda. Although it was a pure accident, it still happened. It can be one of the greatest disasters caused by the existence of mass media, regardless of the political views of any media. <br /> <br /> As for the performance, Streep does a very good job with an Australian accent (no surprise there) and Sam Neill is just as great. You will probably be blown away just by what you see here. Definitely one of Fred Schepisi's best films.
