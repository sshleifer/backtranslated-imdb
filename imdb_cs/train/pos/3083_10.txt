It deserves 12 out of 10. Absolutely refreshing show with real characters and real stories. This show has to come back, I've seen every episode, and that's real quality. The show centers around a few New Yorkers, plays with the concept of six levels of separation and cleverly connects their lives. Bridget Moynahan and Jay Hernandez are stunning, and so is the adorable Caseman. The scene is amazing and the wardrobes are beautiful. We need more shows like this that makes viewers feel like they are intelligent individuals, not hopeless drones. If it never returns, six degrees will unfortunately be missing.
