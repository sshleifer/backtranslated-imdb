I was interested in the film mainly because Dianne Keaton is my favorite actress. I do not agree with some other places because the plot was not complicated. I had no trouble with her (maybe some people had too much eggs at night). The film was also sad and moving. What more do you want? Alexa Davalos is a great new talent (also beautiful) and Tom Everett Scott also does a great job with his role. The relationship between mother and daughter could be a bit unrealistic, but the behavior of young people in the film was not. She was tragically sad, but instructive. It certainly beat other shows that took place on TV series New Year's Eve
