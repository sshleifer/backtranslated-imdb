The film is totally stupid. But were you expecting an intellectual movie based on a comedy called Slam Dunk? Really? The effects of Jay Chou are not exactly the most interesting thing I've ever seen, but I definitely enjoyed the movie. Was it somewhere near the amazing level that someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow could produce? No, not really. Was it really fun if you were just taking Surface Value? Absolutely. It's a movie about some Chinese eye-candy idols and musicians who can play basketball at an unbelievable level of expertise. There's a bad triad guy and a clever clever guy who got involved with Jay Chou. Interest in love. It's formal, but really, for a moment, suspend the mistrust. Come in. It's called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you really think you have signed in? Do a favor when you look at it - I found a copy of some of the English subtitles that made the film unintelligent to be wise, but we made a great laugh. They seem to be extremely fixed on Jerusalem and numbers 1, 10. I laughed, I cried, I cast myself. I looked at it again. <br /> <br /> Especially for this fight scene in the bar. Well choreographed and well shot. I especially like plexiglass with an illuminated billiard table - I'd like to play on one of those. <br /> <br /> Marine, but kicking on the trash.
