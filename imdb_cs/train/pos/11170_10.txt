There's something about Pet Sematary that I've never felt anywhere else. Perhaps being a child when I first watched her made this experience so memorable. But as I keep looking at it, it never gets older and I'm never bored. From the initial credits with that horrible opening song to the very messy end, there is something strange, sad and frightening at the same time and it still rings in the head: sometimes the dead is better! <br /> <br /> I do not think it would be useful to re-link the whole story. Everything you need to know starts from point A (the most perfect situation for a happy American family) and step by step drowns on point B (which is, believe me, the end of any joy). Music is perfect, the story makes sense, special effects are cool and Pet Sematary is the last place on Earth. As I said, sometimes the dead is better!
