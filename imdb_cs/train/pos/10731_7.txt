I noticed that the DVD version looks like there are no scenes or lines between FRF sending and commissioning. <br /> <br /> They have to prove they can win the right to sit in a different FRF than in a green team. <br /> <br /> The next scene is like when they fail in simulation, Kevin gets Joaquina. I think VHS editions other than ABC can have all the missing stuff. Otherwise, I'd like to know which DVD release has missing items. <br /> <br /> The DVD I watched feels edited for television.
