Crash stock exchanges from 1929 and depression followed the nearly destroyed American musical theater, in fact it was the last mortal blow to vaudeville. Those who stand behind the curtains have been hit as badly as those in the front. In an effort to stimulate showbusiness and their own personal economy, director James Cagney of the working theater comes up with a wonderful idea. Stage live relevant prologues to films that are depicted in various cinemas that appear overnight from old theaters. Some other competitors get into the wind and the competition is turned on. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is my favorite movie, Busby Berkeley. This gives James Cagney a chance to show some of his versatility as a dancer as well as a tough guy. In his retirement Cagney said that while he manifested his little and far among the musicals a lot, he could hardly be harassed with some of his equal dramatic movies. He wished he would make several other musicals in his career and I wish he had it. Of course, the production of these extravagant Busby Berkeley on the scene of the film palace overrides all logic and reason. But it's so creative and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell sings three songs in the Footlight Parade, Ah Moon is here, Honeymoon Hotel and Waterfall, the last two with Ruby Keeler's next cementing screen team. Ruby sings and dances with Powell in the past two years, and she works with James Cagney in my favorite footage from Shanghai Lil. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell is Cagney's nonsensical girl Friday at the theater. As with Blonde Crazy, she is the one who has the real brains in this duo, and it's her quick thinking that gets rid of some domestic problems she has at the top of her theater. One of the best roles of Blondell. <br /> <br /> Look at Dorothy Lamour and Ann Sothern at the Corps by IMDb Site for Both. John Garfield is briefly seen at Shanghai Lil. And in the scene at the beginning of the film, producer Guy Kibbee takes Cagney to the cinema where he shows B West Star with John Wayne. The Duke's voice is unmistakable. But what is still unusual is that the short film shows him in the scene with Frank McHug, who plays another assistant Cagney in the Footlight Parade. I think the Warner Brothers played a little joke there. I have to believe the clip was deliberate. The Footlight Parade is Busby Berkeley on his unbelievable best.
