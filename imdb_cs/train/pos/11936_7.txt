I really enjoyed this film as a young guy. At this age, I thought the stupid baseball swing was fun and the movie was "cool" because it's about sports. Now, a few years later, I can look back and see what a well-designed movie is. This film opened my eyes as a small child in the struggle with the other children they were dealing with, and the real world's problems. This type of exposure is nowadays largely missed in children's films that I do not think is beneficial to our society. Sure, baseball antics seem to be really stupid, but they were attracting children. No seven-year-old is asked to see a movie about foster children, but they will be asked to see a baseball movie. Disney has realized this and used it to teach these children an important lesson about the world. As a young adult performance, Al and other angels seem far less impressive, but I will believe both children and Danny Glover, who all had a fantastic job.
