Something about "Paulie" touched my heart like several movies. It's a funny, humorous and emotional movie. I'm late in becoming a fan of this movie. I have not seen Paulie until May 2004 and have since ordered a widescreen DVD from a vendor on eBay. The special effects that show Paulie talking are excellent. My son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases. Probably my favorite part of the film is when Paulie is in Gena Rowlands (Ivy), followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays a great role as a good guy. You make it all the way through the movie for him. <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong rent or buy this movie!
