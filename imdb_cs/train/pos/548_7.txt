This movie was as good as some of the other westerns produced by Anthony Mann and James Stewart as Winchester '73 and Naked Spur and much better than Thunder Bay and Bend Of The River. This movie begins as a miller western run, but it is more complex when it goes on. It starts with Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan arriving in Seattle, and Stewart is accused of murder. He was found innocent, but he stole the cattle of a corrupt judge. Stewart agrees to do something, but I forgot what it is, but Stewart only cares about getting his cattle back. As the film continues, Stewart just takes care of himself, just like his Naked Spur character. In the middle of the way it gets much better after arriving in Alaska. This is one of Stewart's better westerns.
