Finally, I watched these episodes in 2008 and I had to go back and verify when they were actually made. They are absolutely scary because they make a place for fun about what the future will be. Either Parker and Stone lived in Texas and they were witnesses to Gob Bush's idiot, or they are strange, spooky people who pay attention to things. Boo, scary! Bush brothers kill White House dressed as Arabs with rifles? Bush "by chance" did anyone do? (No, wait, he did it as a gov.) It may have seemed like a failure as a sitcom at the time, but now it has to be considered brilliant if it's scary, convinced.
