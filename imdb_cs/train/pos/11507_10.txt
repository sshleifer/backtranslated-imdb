I remember the original series live mainly because of its unique combination of humorous humor and dark subject. Kolchak was from the fairy tale of the big town Ben Hechta, who was heavily beaten, and his frantic determination and frantic horror did even the most successful episode that was very attentive. My personal hobby was "The Spanish Moss Murders" because it's a completely original story. The poor, troubled Cajun bachelor from Louisiana Bayou is participating in sleep research to analyze dreams. Something is inexplicably going wrong and literally dreaming of the life of a swampy creature that inhabits the dark folk tales of her youth. This malicious manifestation seeks out all the people who, in their conscious state, are harming the dreamer and brutally suffocating them to death. Kolchak explores and reveals this terrible truth, much to the desperation of police captain Joe "mad dog" Sisko (famously invented by disgusting Keenan Wynn) and head sleep research starring Second City improviser Severn Darden,. The sadly funny, crazy final takes place in the Chicago sewer system and is a serial light. Kolchak has never improved. Timeless.
