Often I did not feel the movie could be a visionary. But clearly this film has seed of premonition. We should not be willing to be alarmist and see the Armageddon in something because it seems to fit our emotions of the moment. But did not we say "1984"? If James Orwell knew that the Internet became a reality not long after 1984; In fact, it was in 1994; he could reconsider writing his story just as he did. Hindsight is rewarded. <br /> <br /> It does not matter. What is important is that we are often considered to be superior to our surroundings, but it will actually become emotional about "apple love" when necessity knocks at our doors. Right now we will be a moment. <br /> <br /> No matter what time limit is going to be for us, we know we have not experienced its start. <br /> <br />
