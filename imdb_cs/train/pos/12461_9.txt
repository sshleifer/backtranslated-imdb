The clever script from the late SEBASTIAN JAPRISOT series and the intelligent performance of two male directors - ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON (or it should be the opposite), will result in a fun and entertaining thriller. <br /> <br /> Adding to the above-mentioned competent direction from veteran JEAN HERMAN and a sparse but effective score by FRANCOIS DE ROUBAIX, it's easy why this film has a special timeless quality. This is a friend or friend with two loneliness, both disillusioned and a tired world, coming back, probably from Algiers. Like the other colonial powers of this time (after the Second World War leading to the 1960s), France tried to keep the outside. The loss of Algiers was a hot blow. ADIEU L'AMI (the original name) records the actions of our two (anti) heroes who tried to go after their launch. /> <br /> One thing happens after another and the viewer really has to pay attention because JAPRISOT is with his script slim and economical: if there is, there must be reason. <br /> <br /> It is enough to say that these two men fight physically and mentally, one long weekend. Their motivation is quite different, their aims are different - their survival depends entirely on themselves. That ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON are so different from the outside - a former, probably pretty boy, and the other ugly thug adds to chemistry. <br /> <br /> The quest makes a great story, which in turn makes a great movie. <br /> <br /> Not to forget that women are true in this film and are true to the Japanese method, they are also unforgettable, though not nearly as fish; To say much more would be spoiling someone's joy in discovering their true nature. <br /> <br /> FAREWELL, FRIEND was released in the UK; ANAMORPHIC IMAGE, 16.9 EXTENDED; Only in English (even subtitles for the deaf); RUNNING TIME OF 110 MINUTES; MONO SOUNDTRACK, but the music of DE ROUBAIX has a lot of blows! <br /> <br /> We are highly recommended.
