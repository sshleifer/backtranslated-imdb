The Indian cinema is typical for police officers of two major categories: they are either an honest guy or a bad guy. Honorable guys always shout at the top of their voice and fight the system, while bad cops are greatly pleased but suffer in the end. This film at least breaks the usual formula and gives a refreshing look to the police and their lives. Direction takes an inner look at the life of a young ambitious policeman who, Music is interesting, and editing is a trench of trend in Indian cinematography. The film is sometimes slow, and the dilemma that Anbu faces when it comes to the Maya is sometimes distorted. But I would still put 9/10 just because he has many first to his credit.
