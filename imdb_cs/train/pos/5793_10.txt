Moonwalker Michael Jackson is a real adventure movie for the whole family! Before the real story begins, we get the Bad Tour (The Man in the Mirror) and start a great movie. Then we get a collage of Michael's carrier as it was until the Moonwalker came out in 1988. After several musical videos (Speed ​​Demon, Leave Me Alone, etc.), the story begins. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically that Michael and his three children (who are children) are being chased by the dirty story of "Mr. Bigem" because they discovered his evil plans to keep children around the world hiding on drugs . During the pursuit we see fantastic segments, fx. Michaels video for Smooth Criminal, which is absolutely fantastic with his dance sequence, etc. But then one of the children are kidnapped by Mr. Big, and Michael will want to save her before she gets a drug addict. <br /> <br /> We see special effects not only amazing for today's standards, but also impressive today. Take a look at, for example, Michael, who turns to the robot / spacecraft to protect his friends! It's so cool! The film ends with a concert of Come Together (later published in Michaels' double album HIStory) and the film is left with a magical feeling. Amazing! <br /> <br /> I recommend this to any family who wanted to spend a nice night with candy and popcorn in front of the TV. And now some parents can stand up and say: "But Michael Jackson is an allegedly abusive child!" Yeah, it's true, but come on, we all know it's not true! Wait and see ..
