I just thought it was great and I still do it. I'm grateful for being able to see other things before Hollywood is almost overwhelming us. Saving Grace is smart and enjoyable - those who feel offended by marijuana can better see the American bride as a movie. Saving Grace also shows that the fun movie does not have to be stupid. Most of the time I laughed, but I also thought about what the woman was supposed to do to pay the debts of her dead husband. In Brief - A humorous story with typical English humor and good acting and direction. You can not ask for more. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
