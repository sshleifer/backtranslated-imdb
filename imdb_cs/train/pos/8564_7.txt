I do not expect this movie to be well understood by viewers from Romania. It is definitely a value or perhaps a lack of versatility of the film, but also about how different histories and even the lives of ordinary people in Romania have been compared to other countries, even in Eastern Europe. <br /> The film is the adaptation of the novel Marin Preda, a controversial writer who died during the Communist government shortly after publishing the book. He tells the story of an intellectual, professor of philosophy, whose life is crushed after being imprisoned on false accusations at the end of the Stalinist era. In essence, the first part of the film tells the story of his struggle for survival in prison, the second describes his attempt to restore his life after he was released. His dismissal is indeed obvious, Romania's 60s ask him for various kinds of compromises and crimes, yet his struggle for survival is as morally moral as in jail. The film is greatly acting with some of the best Romanian actors. Stefan Iordache, who plays the lead role, will be in a different time and second place a mega-star, we can get a good look at his wonderful acting. Although he suffers from a hesitant narrative of stories and sometimes drops in insignificant details or comic characters, the film is still an important landmark for the Romanian cinema as well as the process of restoring moral and historical values ​​in Romanian society.
