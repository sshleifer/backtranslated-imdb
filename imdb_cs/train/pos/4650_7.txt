As an employee of the Swedish Air Force I enjoyed in this film the nice flight scenes Gripen and Hkp 9 (MBB Bo 105). One of the few disappointments was the EWS 39 jammer below, in this case the inert RB 75 (Maverick) painted black with the letters "EWS 39" in white along the side. The real jammer pods definitely do not look, at least what I've seen. Besides, it's a funny movie with a very fun ending (last minute). Anyone interested in seeing different Swedish troops, including now the legendary SSG, should see this movie. <br /> <br />
