The film celebrates life. <br /> <br /> The world prepares for innocent and pure souls and everything has "Happy End" as well as the final scene of the film. <br /> <br /> The movie has a wonderful soundtrack, a mix of Serbian neo-folk, gypsy music and jazz. <br /> <br /> This film is a very refreshing piece of visual poetics. <br /> <br /> Observation is like you, I was sucked in another colorful, romantic and sometimes harsh world. <br /> <br /> Just like it should be Mr. Kusturica.
