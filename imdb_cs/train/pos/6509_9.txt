I can not believe some of the comments on this show! The show is just brilliant! Of course it does not come out of proven and true, but we as consumers always want us to get the same things over and over again. We should not be able to sit down and enjoy something new. The style is not as realistic as the previous "Scooby Doo" shows, but it should not be. A show titled "Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get a Foot", what part of this title states that the whole beloved cast of other renditions is constantly involved in the action. And nowhere to say it solves the mysteries and that they can not even become monsters, why would they? I'm really glad to have a few long stories running on the Scooby-Doo show. Still have jokes, clumsy hi-jinks, quick change of clothes in pursued scenes, standard guráž, and even Scooby. In fact, I'm glad this show is out because I just love it. I'm even glad to get rid of the rest of the team for a while and focus only on two main characters and a villain. Sure it's ridiculous, it should be! Certainly it is different, it should be. You should laugh at the villain and encourage the idiot robotic butler to win over all the disturbing pests, no matter what size. You should get a routine joke "Roobi-Roo". The whole thing is just so connected so well, there is not one thing I think is wrong with it. Writing, acting, animation, all the best. The title music is awesome (my computer plays "get CLUE!" When it comes in) and the background music just grabs.
