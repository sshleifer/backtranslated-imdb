As a well-known fan, I recommend this film as a true fact and a good act. As an 11-year-old living in Istanbul, I heard several friends talking about a new musical sensation that caused the girls to shout. I thought yes, when they like girls, it must be bullshit. My only records were Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers and Ricky Nelson. Soon after my family holiday at the Military Cafe in Ismire, I heard a song (which I later learned of "Love Me Do") and was spread out by the difference between her and every song I have heard so far. When I heard the album "Meet The Beatles" of my older brother, I was alive. After reading the definitive book of their beginnings (Davis), I was surprised that this film was very good at tracking the facts, except that most of the sexes and some drugs were used (this involved methadrine / dexadrine). >
