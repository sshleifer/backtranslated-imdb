This is one of the movies / pilots that if you knew that BattleStar Galactica helped, but it is not necessary. What makes it an even more believable story than BSG is that it is not that far in the future. It is so deep that it is quite amazing that it was not drained theatrically. Leadership could not be better suited to such experienced and quite talented actors. Eric Stoltz is great as a father who does anything to be reunited with his daughter, whether real or not, and he does it regardless of the price. Paula Malcomson of the fame "Deadwood" is great as his wife. You are not quite sure of its motives, whether it's love, money, or both, but that makes this pilot even more interesting. I see a star in the creation of Zoe, played by the relative unknown Alessandra Torresani and her performance. Esai Morales is amazing in his desire to see his beloved man again, and how bad he is even to consider what he wants more than his moral objections. I did not think it would be a good idea when it was announced, but from the pilot myself I'm excited to see how we got into the BSG scenario. It is great to see Adam as a child affected and influenced by the different types of robots that are beginning to penetrate life at this stage. I just hope they can keep stories so we can find out more about how robots have written Humanoid. He is almost a perfect pilot and I hope they can keep fantastic stories. Even visual effects are better than most garbage you see on the big screen. If you did not get to BSG, try at least and bet that you will become a fan and you will want to see what the story of BSG was.
