... so what's in those 10 minutes that were so bad they had to get them out of the original movie? We were three years in the film production code ... Barbara Stanwyck was playing in the original game, but here, Carole Lombard plays Maggie King. What star Fred MacMurray is probably best known for "Double Indemnity," with Stanwyck, as well as his hit television show "My Three Sons". Watch out for young Dorothy Lamour (Bob Hope films) and the fabulous Franklin Pangborn, who spiced almost every film on tape. Of course she works in a beauty salon on a boat! Add the noble Charles Butterworth and Anthony Quinn. Good timing and clever doubts at the beginning. Maggie's friend Ella plays Jean Dixon, who was the best friend in "Holiday" and "My Man Godfrey". In "Swing High", Maggie tourists meet a soldier who leaves the army. Maggie misses her ship when she leaves the port and gets to the soldier. The small scenic 20x Quinn has a small scene at the local bar in Panama, where Johnson (MacMurray) played on a pipe. Maggie, Harry (Butterworth) and Skid band together and try to find out how to return to the states. Some good singing from Lamour. Good (but short) acting Cecil Cunningham as "Murph", the wise, helpful owner of Panama's local salon. While others have a lament about how bad it was, it was not that terrible, and it's even a little exotic, with a fake Central American setting in the first half of the movie.
