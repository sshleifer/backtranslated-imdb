Madhur Bhandarkar goes on taboo questions and gives the most realistic picture of modern society. Man gets the impression of the director from his earlier films, such as Satta and Chandni bar. The problems that have just been mentioned in the second film are here investigated and revealed. Casting is amazing and from many angles we see the judgments on each scene. Mostly the film leaves you thinking about a lot of facts. When you start guessing things, you end up being closest, but in many scenarios there is no brand. It remains a lasting impression. Actors to watch include Konkana Sen Sharma, Boman Irani & Atul Kulkarni. Dialogues are well written and you feel like you've been living one of these people. Still there are scenes that think about you more deeply. Songs are in the background and saves time, and La≈•'s voice in the very meaningful song "Kitne Ajeeb" leaves you feeling like you are left alone in the middle of modern society!
