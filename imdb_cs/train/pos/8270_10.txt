This is an extraordinary movie that constantly harms you. He seems to be heading for clich√©s in several places, and then something stunning happens that will actually surprise you. It would be too much to be much more, but stick to this movie and you will be richly rewarded. William Haines is absolutely beautiful - he is certainly a star that deserves to be re-discovered. The homosexual subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford is amazing - there is even a scene where Haines deepens Pickford's chest (Pickford's cold). Both actors play this subtext textile and with great depth of emotion, so there are moments that are very moving. And I never thought I could get involved in a soccer match like I did in this movie - and I do not even understand the rules! Also excellent is the son of Francis X. Bushman Ralph as Haines' rival for a girl (yes, it is not a completely gay movie). Amazing Silent Classic - A great example of twenty commercial cinemas.
