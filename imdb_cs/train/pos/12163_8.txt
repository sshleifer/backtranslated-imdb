I found the film quite expressive, the way the main character was lost, but much clearer about certain things in life than about those who mocked him (for example, his roommate). You loved him when you were watching torture! she had this scary side that was frightening, but we all enjoyed seeing it again. It was like a game character or pan-man through a swamp or an enemy and we like watching him under attack by a sniper or by fire, but then we are happy to survive at the end ... <br /> <br />
