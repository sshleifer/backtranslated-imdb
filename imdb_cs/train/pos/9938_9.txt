We bought the DVD "Es war einmal das Leben" (German) / "Once Upon a Time ... Life" for our bilingual children because everyone loved "Es war einmal der Mensch" Once in a while ... man "The series is very well made, it does not show its age, and our children in different age categories are really looking forward to learning things that our parents did not know until now. The series includes everything that happens to the human body from organs, all senses, blood, infections, antibodies, and much more in animated episodes 20-25 minutes Topics that some people may consider to be "sensible" such as digestion and reproduction, are covered in a tasteful, discreet and childlike way (the reproductive episode begins to cover especially where the baby starts to grow) while still (as typical) informing and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Children are usually fascinated by the way their body works and understand episodes in the context of their environment. The format of the episodes switches between the outside world (family with two children) and inside the body. For example, in an episode of infection, the boy is accidentally clipped and the wound is infected and the episode deals with how the body responds to this. Similarly, episodes in senses, such as hearing, vision, joining what is happening within the body with the context of the outside world, and an episode of breathing and circulating oxygen in the blood cover the whole life cycle, including (briefly) the origin of the oxygen (plants). <br /> <br /> This is one of the best programs for kids - I think it's a must for every family with kids!
