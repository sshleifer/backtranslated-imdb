LADY FROM SHANGHAI proves that great genius Orson Welles could lead mainstream movies if he wanted to. Compared to its more, more artwork, this film has only a slight amount of craftiness and almost no esoteric elements. The exception, of course, is the final scene in the hall of mirrors, broadly the same, that is one of the greatest scenes in the history of the film. This in itself is worth the rent. <br /> <br /> The sweet surprise was excellent acting Rita Hayworth. Her acting during the beginning and in the middle of the movie is so great that the other actors appear as cartoons instead of characters. Even the big Mr. Welles.
