This document brings you around the world. It contains a rare and amazing sequel of wilderness. It shows you how diversified and how fragile our planet can be. The future of a polar bear is highlighted at the beginning and end. After all, its bleak future is closely linked to the consequences of global warming. However, this document is a simplifying approach to such a serious environmental problem. However, it can be easily seen in small children because it is mostly descriptive. Scientists could be disappointed because it is not the remake of Al Gore's "Inconvenient Truth," but honestly ... what a description! Then there may be a question: Is it not necessary to maintain the beauty of our world? Because this document proves that in 2007 such beauty still exists despite various pollutions. When we live in cities, we tend to forget that we are part of this kind. Everything that we consider to be a document reminds us that we have a common treasure called "COUNTRY".
