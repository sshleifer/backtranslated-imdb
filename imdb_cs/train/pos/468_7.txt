Vladimir Navokov's literary genius will appear again on the screen, and many of the cultured people will notice it. The director will review us with the story of Alexander, an absent chapelist study of chess addiction. Nastasya rests in the resort with a marble column where the chess championship is hosted. He and Alexander meet to pick up the queen he drives through his pocket. Magnetic attraction develops when he proposes the next day, mother has alarmed husband telegrams. He comes and casts doubt on Alexandra that we are getting into the past, "The Godfather II", where we see young Alexander, a child's miracle. He takes him under the wing of teachers and uses his genius for ten years for huge sums. Thinking that Alexander reached his peak, he would leave him, but he would become a legend. The old teacher returns and causes damage, trying to win the old opponent of Alexander. In a serious chess game where world chess champion win is one of the ways of immortality, the chess clock knocks, the match ends until the end of the next day. That day is Nastase's wedding, the old teacher hits and Alexandr is sent to a nerve jam. Nastasya, holding her belly, looking over her cloak of love, looking for her strategy for the match, and watching the moves. Although the film unfortunately enjoys its Russian roots, his dress is beautiful, Alexander plays his role immensely. Overhead has underestimated its audience as soon as we get to play and the only hint of The Luzhin Defense is after trading with the queens, isolating the opposing king with three paws and king, sacrificing a castle for a friend. Nastasya is a great match, but he feels that his conclusion deserves more intensity, but maybe the emotions were right for chess to be more than she. Luzhin's defense elegantly gives Navokov the honor, the complexity of his work in paintings is a world event that you must not miss.
