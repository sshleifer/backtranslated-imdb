It started slowly after the excellent animated introduction, because the director had plenty of characters and the school environment to develop. Once the bet is on, however, the movie raises the tempo because it is a time match to see if a certain number of worms can be consumed by 19:00. We had a good opportunity to discuss with our sons on the way home: horrors, help for others, mind over matter when you do not want to do anything. A special note is the girl who played Eric (Erk): Hallie Kate Eisenberg. The director unexpectedly skips her, and when she's on the screen she is breathtaking. It's one of those "Hey, looks good" faces, and then I remembered that she was a girl Pepsi had imagined about 8 years ago. She was also in "Paulie," a parrot movie that tries to find her way home. Eisenberg made many television and film performances in 99 -00, but he did not see much in the next few years. She is 14 and grows up as a beautiful woman. Her smile actually warms up the screen. If she could get some other good roles, could she have such a career (or better?) Than Haley Joel Osment, another three actor's name, but hopefully without some of the Osment's recent problems. <br /> <br /> <br /> Anywhozitz, according to my 8 year old son, who just read the story, did not seem to have touched the book at all, but he enjoyed it. The ending of the movie looked like a great setting for some sequels (How to Eat Cooked Slugs - Escargot Kid's Style?) That may not be such a bad thing. It was nice to take your family into the movie and you do not have to worry about language, violence or sexual scenes. Another good aspect of the film was the respect / fear induced by the director, Mr. Burdock (Discboard). Movies today tend to show the characters of adult authorities as buffoons. While he had one particular nasty scene, he was in control of the school with a firm hand. It was also nice to see Andrea Martin doing something.
