This spectacular movie is one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen. It shows China that I have never seen or imagined and I believe it proves that China in 1930 is the most REAL light ever seen in the movie. In so many situations, it is totally heart because he sees how hard life is for the characters, yet the story and the end are incredibly joyous. In this film, you really see the depths and depths of human existence. The actors are all perfect, so you feel like you really have entered another world. <br /> <br /> I simply can not recommend this movie enough. Maybe it will change you forever when you see it.
