This show is fast, colorful, dark, but fun, hip and still clean. Cast, including the amazing rotation of special guests (Molly Shannon, Paul Rubens, The-Stapler-Guy-From-Office-Space) is electric. He has murder, romance, family and zombies, without ever becoming a cartoon ... Somehow. You really connect with these characters. All production is an unlikely magical act that left me, something skeptical when I say it, completely calmed, and every Wednesday night I will go back to the next. I read it again and sounds a little like paying someone to write it. It's really good. I just heard the rumor that it was canceled, so I thought I was sending the excitement of goodwill. This is one of those shows that are under radar because network suits can not figure out how to do sexy and sell cars with it. Make a great favor if you have not done so yet and enjoy this gem as long as it lasts. OK, so one more thing. This show is smart. What does it mean that every Christian critic / writer in Hollywood will put a stick out of the way you know how before they sit down to look at it and defend the words, "I could write it," a renovated Hollywood hotel room. In other words: the internet. This is a general interest / anonymous site. Before giving your Wednesday TV hour to Dirty Sexy Money or another Hot Model Repetition or any other out and out trips of these internet "critics" do not comment, put my favorite show show. It is fun. Good and easy fun.
