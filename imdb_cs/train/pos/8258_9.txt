At the risk of it sounding slightly sacred, at first glance I'm so inclined to be equal to "The Shaun of the Dead". Now that, as I see Simon Pegg as an undisputed comedic genius, I realize it's more of a claim. And to what extent you agree with this last statement can be a good preliminary indication of whether Fido will prompt you. <br /> <br /> In this way, comedy picks up where 'Shaun' is back in the original stereotypical Central American town of the 1950s. Zombie Wars ended and the zombies themselves became more useful and useful members of the community. Being informed at the outset is largely due to the scientific progress of good people in Zomcom - maybe a nice game for a romantic comedy? <br /> <br /> The beauty of the film lies in its deadly depiction of a respectable neighborhood that maintains the core values ​​while creating a space for the zombies and special dangers they pose. The spell and balance with which it is doing is almost perfect. The themes you could expect from a guitar comedy with a main stripe come - a veneer of good clean living, the maintenance of appearances, suppressed emotions, confused parental values, social honors and the situation of a stolen individual. <br /> <br /> It's a story with a happy heart and a broad, attractive story that brings live live feature film. It is one of those works that really proves that all the participants have gone downhill. It is also fun to imagine what Billy Connelly taught his script had to be like ... So in the end it is likely that you will appreciate the humor of this movie if your father did not try to eat you.
