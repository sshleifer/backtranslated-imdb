there have been very few chess films in the last few years, but this is more than just a chess film whose story about the need to be loved and the need to win, John Toturro plays a psychologically challenged man, nothing important to him accepts 64 squares and 32 pieces, confirms it as a man when he loses the game, loses one thing that makes sense to him and John Torturro expresses it in a beautiful way, even the woman's love was not enough to save him from his sad existence. Wondering if there are other Luzons who are obsessed about this game, I'm sure they are, if you're a chess fan, it will not hurt you when you look at it. It is an intelligent piece of well-done and well-done work, it achieves its goals, unfortunately I doubt if it will continue.
