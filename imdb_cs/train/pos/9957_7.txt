This film is dryly underestimated on IMDb. Like so many films, it's not Shawshank. But it is quite good if predictable, a dance competition / personal growth film. If you want to spend an hour and a half hour watching a 8 Mile for a female dancer step before I think you will like it. In the IMDb rating, my guess is that this film was approaching the top 250 and was "voted bombed" with many 1s as it did with many movies that do not concern the crowd, have no special effects, or contain non-white or irregular characters. </ p> <p> It's an American movie, but it's not an American film. Toronto most often has irritated hints, and some viewers may think it's set up entirely in the US just because the final competition is in the Detroit border town. I enjoyed music. I liked the dancing dance (but I was not convinced it was worth $ 50,000 ... but what I know). The characters were easy for the eyes. <br /> <br /> I agree that the title is upset. I do not remember anyone in the movie saying these words, and he should have "s". (No, it's not a foreign language). <br /> <br /> There is not much to hate about this movie (and let's be honest, voice 1 means you hated it) so I can only assume it's a hate speech to the people in it, and It is sad.
