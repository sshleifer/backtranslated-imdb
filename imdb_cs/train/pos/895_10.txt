I saw this movie. This film is the best of today's needs. Dying in marriage is the biggest problem today. When presenting this issue, this movie is best. In this movie, Indian values ​​are very well presented. Today's youth must understand this problem. She is less a girl's girl. And because of this problem the vena of the girl committed suicide. If this problem continues, the day when there is no child is not far away. So, keep in mind this claim, today's youth must understand that we can not take a dowry in marriage. We must learn from this film that the dowry should not be taken. And when we understand this problem, we see a new trend in society. This is the major change in society.
