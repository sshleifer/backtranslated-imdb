It's a tricky thing to play queen. On the one hand, the actress must be magnificent and imperial, and on the other hand must show vulnerability in a difficult situation as well as gathering courage and decision to overcome the chances since almost all the films about queens baseline land. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is pretty brilliant like Victoria, but it's not as full performance as I'd want, nor any guilt for her. I can not help, but I feel it's Mills & Boon's romance adaptation compared to the darker and dramatic film about another young queen, Elizabeth. That's why Blunt will not achieve a number of royal emotions, at least not in full, because, you know, young Victoria. To see old Victoria, look at Mrs. Brown. Jean-Marc Vallee is an interesting choice for the director of the film. The last one was awarded by C.R.A.Z.Y., who was excellent and led him to glory. It was quite a different film, but I remember that it looks beautiful and it is probably the main similarity between the two films. But while Vallee wrote C.R.A.Z.Y., this was Julian Fellowes, and though I really liked his Gosford Park, the story for this movie was much less interesting. I soon lost myself to all government policies. Maybe it was less involved because there was no potential flogging of the monarchy. I'm just saying.
