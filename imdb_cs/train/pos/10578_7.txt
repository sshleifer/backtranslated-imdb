"Footlight Parade" is just one of several amazingly glamorous musicals that Warner Bros. manufactured at the beginning of the 1930s to avert the crisis. During this era, the "42nd Street" series and the Golddiggers series were also produced, and literally millions of Americans have forgotten their troubles for a short while. Though most of the films produced had great talents Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, only the Foolight Parade had an incomparable James Cagney. Almost ten years before her most famous musical "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Here he is dancing in the most original dance style, with his hands as a rule lowered by his side and his legs make all kinds of ripples and kicks. It is easy to see that he enjoys himself, and that makes us even more. <br /> <br /> While almost all the music sequences appear at the end of the movie, it's worth waiting. I believe this movie was created just before the production code was installed, so some costumes and scenes are a little risky. But it's all fun. It does not matter what the story of a movie is, just know there is a lot of laughter and superlatives. In addition to what we have already mentioned, Guy Kibbee is in his wrong place. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
