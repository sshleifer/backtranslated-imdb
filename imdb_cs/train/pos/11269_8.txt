Did you ever want to know the extent to which Hollywood could have reached before Hayes's law was officially introduced? Well, unfortunately, the "Convention City" is lost, so you have to watch "Tarzan and his mate" to find out. For 1934 there is a remarkable amount of sexual cues and even exposed meat. Just look at Jane's naked swim. While Tarzan is often thought of as b-adventure films for young boys and nobody else, this picture proves that the series was originally very mature. More than seventy years later, it's still as sexy as it was when it came out. Besides the envelope that pushes taboo nature, it's a great and exciting adventure story. I've always enjoyed the jungle movies that Hollywood fired in the thirties and forties, but there is little of a genre I would call big movies. "Tarzan and His Mate" is by far the best film of this long-gone subgenus. Sequences of safari attacks on either apes or natives can still create tensions today. Animals are also too cold (especially monkey throwing boulders). Actor soon does not get great prizes, but it's definitely more than good for this type of painting. The film is stolen again by the cheetah, the smartest monkey in the jungle. One of the most fun examples of the Hollywood prequel there.
