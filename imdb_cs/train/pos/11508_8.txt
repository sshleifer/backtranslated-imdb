I would rather give Kolcak a higher rating, but the show quickly went from spooky / exciting to stupid. ABC error. They moved the show to Friday night at 20:00, known as the "Family Hour". He should never be in the first place on Friday. I was a high school student and loved early episodes! She first came up against a police woman at NBC. ABC had huge problems with Friday nights. The bad season for them altogether until Barney Miller, Baretta, and SWAT debuted in January '75. Kolchak should be hit. Darren McGavin begged for the contract to end the show. The pity that writing was not in original television films by Richard Matheson. Still, McGavin made Kolchak himself, as actors can do. Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden and Caroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker. The INS Institute with handwriting machines and kneeling teletypes seems quaint and ancient today, yet it was part of the appeal. They were very happy that Simon Oakland of the television films repeated "Vincenzo".
