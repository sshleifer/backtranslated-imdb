This movie is amazingly beautiful. The art of Goldsworthy really benefits from the film because you can see art in its most beautiful, moving, changing and blooming areas. I strongly recommend this film to everyone. I can not think about what to say about it. It's just the movie you MUST see because it's so visually convincing and it keeps me very refreshed when I leave the theater.
