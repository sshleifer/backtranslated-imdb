The fabulous film version of the Best Selling Book and Breaking Broadway plays about the lives of Sadie and Bessie Delana, two African-American nuns who have both lived for over 100 years and told about their story about the testimony of centuries of American history. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll perform very well as Bessie and Sadie. Amy Madigan is also good as Amy Hill Hearth, white reporter of the New York Times, whose article about sisters has published a book, etc. Many flash scenes and even many contemporary ones are very strong, if not as inspirational as the book. This is the only real drawback, combined with the fact that some aspects of the story are not clearly presented, such as between the mother's racial background and why their father was so strict. But besides, a very well done, great-made, powerful movie.
