Arrrrgggghhhhh, some people take life too seriously !!! Take a look at this movie for what it is, sit down, relax and take a moment. The film does not suffer seriously, so we should not even have it. If you like James Belushi, you will love this movie. If you are not your cup of tea, give it to me. <br /> <br /> I like James Belushi, so I liked this movie. So it just is not? :-)
