* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is only the second pay-per-view that I've given the perfect 10, the first was in 1991 Royal Rumble. It was full of exciting games that were not memorable, just for single use. And that's why I like it. <br /> <br /> The first match between Razor and DiBiase, as well as Ludvig Borga vs. Marty Jannetty were the only low points. It was OK, but DiBiase deserved a better result in the final reward. Nowadays, a game like this one would have hits and a bigger climax for the first big Razora girl. And Jannetty, fresh from the Intercontinental title, could have a better match with Borgo. But I do not think anyone really cares. They only needed Borg to pay for television. IRS and The Kid were great, just like Michaels and Perfect. I wish he could win Perfect, but Michaels is not for nothing. Notice how right after that, he left the WWF so he would not have to work with Razor. Bret Hart had two big skirmishes with Doink (note how best everyone is against Hitman) and Lawler. Their rivalry was classic; that's why the "Feud of the Year" was low. How often do you see that two legends win Feud from this year late in his career? <br /> <br /> Match Steiners-Heavenly Bodies was one of the best in the year. Who knew the body could keep its own against one of the best teams at all? Many people claim that the Undertaker-Giant Gonzalez match was a waste of time. But I loved it. Remember what caused the old WWF (as in, before the WWE) was a great mix of athletics and freak show. Is there a soul that did not like Akeim? The main event was not bad, although it is nowhere near the match of the year. Dali Lex Luger was good, but they made a reasonable choice when Yokozuna was holding the belt. It was the first tilt from Superstar Graham, who held the belt for more than two months. Currently heels are champions all the time. But from the beginning of the WWWF through the WWF of the 1990s, when you blinked, you missed the title of the pat. <br /> <br /> As a fan of an old school, this and SummerSlam '88 are my favorite.
