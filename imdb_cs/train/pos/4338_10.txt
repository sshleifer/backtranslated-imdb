The film was very moving. It was gentle and fun at the same time. The landscape was absolutely beautiful! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser won the awards. Olympia Dukakis was great. I understand because of the story line its part should be short, but I wanted to see it more - it is true for. You will be able to remember the experiences of your own life, hopefully to see this movie. We were lucky to see Paul Reiser on Q and A after watching. He is a gorgeous man, smart, eloquent and "real man." It was a really nice night! It's a movie that you have to see. You'll be so grateful that you went.
