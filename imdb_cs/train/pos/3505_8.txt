I do not know how IMDb sorts reviews, but I know that, as is often the case on Amazon.com, there are a number of very negative reviews for this film that repeat the same, somewhat dark speech points, almost literally. Campaign? Only IMDb knows. <br /> <br /> As far as this movie is concerned: it's ok. It's fun, cute and very straightforward. Since I worked in Brooklyn, she lived in Queens and visited relatives in the southern Bronx, for over ten years. However, I found nothing of what was unjustified or exploitative of these children. Is Granny a bizarre nature? Yeah. Does dialogue and action do this? Yes, thanks, they do it. Are other movies set up in LES and featuring Dominican / Puerto Rican kids possible? You betcha. Does this mean a crime? as some comments suggest (my eyes, astrologers)? Hardly. Let the flower of a thousand plastic flowers bloom. <br /> <br /> This is better than any episode of Degrassi JR. High or Degrass high. Compare the comparison, but we never had it and I touched the core, because this movie has a modest sense and a gentle spirit. I would say I would like to know, behind all these conspiracies! :-D
