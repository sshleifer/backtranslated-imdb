Since this film is entirely in the Swiss dialect, it is probably very difficult for most German speakers to watch this movie. I'm not from Switzerland, but I worked for several years so I had the opportunity to understand this great spoof of the Lord of the Rings. I've seen lots of movies of this kind (like Scary Movie, a lot of Scifi spoofs, etc.) But this is the best I've seen so far. I give 9 out of 10. The only reason I can not give 10 is because there are some small details that could be done better and because DVDs were not supplied with any subtitles in any language, so there is almost no chance of non-Swiss to understand.
