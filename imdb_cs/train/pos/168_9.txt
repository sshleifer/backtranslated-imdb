That's one of Joan Crawford's best talcs. It was the first pair of Gable-Crawford and MGM and the audience showed that they were a spitting team that led the studio to create seven other films along with them. The film convincingly shows the declining slumber of a brother and sister who, after their father has lost everything from the stock market crash, has to take care of himself and work for his livelihood. Life is depressing hard, and soon, their attempts to find legitimate work turned out to be vain, and retreat to the underworld. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford is outstanding as a socialite-turned-minor. It is smart, complex and believable. She even tempers the theatrical stiffness of the early Talkie actors. Clark Gable is a diamond in a harsh, male and cruel as a frozen gangster who gets involved in Crawford's character. The same year would play a similar and even more successful role than Norma Shearer in "A Free Soul," which will ensure his position as the best male sex symbols on MGM. <br /> <br /> If you like Crawford in this type of role, do not miss the "Paid" it made a year ago, which is also among her best early Talkie performances. <br /> <br />
