What I like is one of the series you need to see but you are not sure you would see, the beginning is fine and yours combines in the series just for fun, the second part and the 2-3 season that are more outdated, come and go to what you want. what is happening with many series is that it does not end up with something special because the second part of the series always goes down to the drain, it also does a bit, the third part is the one that destroys and destroys the whole series, usually, but it is not, this end is perfect for the series, it's perfect, in fact I was quite angry with all those people in Val's life, actually I wanted to end up with Jeff, but later it changed, they decided to marry Vic in the series after almost 3 years periods without him, and that was the biggest surprise and also what made the series go to the top. to see that many times the series is actually very cool just do not expect the second part to be so good that it is not, but the third part does what was needed and made a series that is worth the whole thing, I would say that I am happy and happy about the series and now I'm going to see two guys girl and pizza place when I see the whole series I'll be back ...
