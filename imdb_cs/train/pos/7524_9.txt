For a movie that seems to have sex and skin, she has no right to be as strangely sweet as she is. The story of Betty Page, a good Christian from the South who is a mother, would not want her to leave her until she got married who moved to New York and eventually became the most successful lifting of her age is powered by a great performance from Gretchen Moll. Her site can not quite combine the images she takes (no one can touch, it's all fun and respectable) with the pornographic exams and the alleged ill effects that her paintings have on the world around her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . Rather like that movie, in fact. Filming in black and white and the famous technicolor, it's a great way to spend a few hours.
