With Ralph Bakshi, most of his films seem to be like two-edged swords. You will get something amazing from him, but only if you stand silly and unnecessarily furious. The Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation of the story, which may not always have been in the animation department. Fire and Ice is a great success from Bakshi from an animation point of view. Rotoscoping is much more detailed and animation has a vivid look at it. You still get some blunt static cells and a little blurred background, but all the way around you definitely got Bakshi's last fantasy. Animation is almost realistic-naturalistic, and unlike LOTR, where this style often disagrees with actual content, the unique atmosphere of the film improves. <br /> <br /> The film unfortunately can not create a meaningful story from its simple set-up, and in fact most of the character's motivation is quite blurred. Lorn and Tigra are easy cases, but Necron's main villain was difficult to track without mentioning Guy with Furry Face Mask (also known as "The Guy"). Although most of the voice actors were suitable, there are some peculiarities in the audio department, and the Tigra looks really terrible, whenever she screams. However, I believe that the philosophical value of entertainment will outweigh the unnecessarily silly implementation of the land. The unusual canvas of characters is something you will never get, but it will help remind you that perhaps this film has not even intended to be taken too seriously. It's still cool and really funny.
