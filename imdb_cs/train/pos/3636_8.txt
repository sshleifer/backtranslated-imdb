It's a good movie, one person's dreams, and how to drive them. It's a beautiful and inspirational film. Why do some people try to find a mistake about each movie that performs, especially the good ones. Dennis Quaid gives a good solid performance in this true story by Jim Morris, science teacher and baseball coach in high school who is pushing his team to take another shot in a professional baseball career. With excellent support for the cast, including Brian Cox, as a gruff old ex-ex-naval officer who left so many of his son's successes without his support. It was good to see him as something other than the villain in the movie. If I have one complaint with this movie, this is: Never let Royce Applegate re-sign the national anthem. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie belongs to a bunch of great baseball movies such as "Field of Dreams" and "The Natural". It throws two thumbs up and big "well done".
