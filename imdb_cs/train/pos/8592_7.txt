Good for evening entertainment - but the plot was unconvincing. Garrison's affair with the first lady was unreal and without passion; the president was a cardboard cutter. And who were the real villains? Nothing has been developed or explained enough. I still do not know why they wanted to kill the president or how the mole began to deal with. The villains were powerless and unprofitable, so you have never been involved in their conspiracy. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland have done everything to bring reality to the story - persecution and confrontation were good. But Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria were incredible in their roles, Basinger was totally lacking, and Longoria was not a secret service agent. It could have been a very good movie, but somehow it did, with too many unanswered questions. Totally disappointing despite some very good scenes. And did they use the West Wing for scenes in the White House? - I was always expecting CJ or Charlie to appear!
