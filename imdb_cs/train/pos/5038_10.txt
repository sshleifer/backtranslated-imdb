What a true treatment and completely unexpected. This is a real thriller movie. I hit the video rental shop, caught the movie without reading the glimpse of my back and hoping it would be the best. I was totally surprised and pleased. I really liked the actors and their characters. I thought everyone had done a great job and made their characters realistic. The story was well thought out, well written and directed. You've been wondering what interests you from start to finish, and I've never found a boring one minute. This movie I highly recommend to those who like thrillers, especially thrillers that are great and those that will keep you. Definitely it's 10 out of 10 people.
