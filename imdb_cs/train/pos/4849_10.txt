Ghost Train is an experience for those who appreciate the typical humor of the 1940s. Includes World War II, but not as much as I originally believed, and characters are a unique blend that plays their roles quite well. Askey, who plays Tommy Gander's role, is what brightens the story about works that could be portrayed as boring or "dragging". The story of the scary station is really scary even for today's standards. It's unique and the way the characters communicate with everyone is fantastic to revive the mystery that is the Ghost Train. Gander is basically annoying to all other members, while others are doing pretty well. He is always the focus of attention and can be called "annoying," but it is he who does not know what humor 1940. His humor is innocent and childish, which is sweet to watch. If it was not for Askey / Gander, this movie would be shorter in action, joy and the result would not be as effective in my opinion.
