I saw this movie at midnight on On Demand another night, not knowing what to expect. I've heard about this movie, but I've never had any ideas about it at all. I must say I was amazed by what I saw. In some parts, I was really scared, and I definitely recall that I jumped several times in my place. <br /> <br /> Blob looked scary. Now I look at the jelly jelly and wonder if they get on my hand. Steve McQueen was really good as Steve Andrews, the protagonist of the film. I also liked the old man. <br /> <br /> For the 50th horror film, it was very well done by today's standards. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
