This is one of the most popular favorite movies. Parker Posey's character is above average fun and the library theme will not happen for anyone who has ever worked in books and around the world. <br /> <br /> If you are a student of the library, RENT THIS. Then buy the poster and hang it on the wall. The soundtrack is also highly recommended. I showed this movie to more friends in the library than everyone else - they all fell in love with it.
