Because I'm not a fan of Snoop Dogg, as an actor, I was even more eager to see. I recall that he was interviewing "Jay Leno" and said he refused the role in the big budget Adam Sandler's comedy "The Longest Yard" to be in this movie. So creativity data close ï‚¨ Voluntary. We will not exaggerate Snoop for his performance at The Tenants. Surely there are better rappers / actors, like Mos Def, who could do more with his role. But it's Snoop did a "good" job. It does not seem to pull some of his body movements in trademarks and vocal niches, but that's something that Jack Nicholson has the trouble to do. The point is that I found him in a convincing way and the tension between him and the personality of Dylan McDermott. McDermott, by the way, gives the best result in the movie, though its subtle effects will most likely be overshadowed by Snoop's not so delicate action. Being a great reader and an ambitious writer myself, I could not help finding those characters and a rather fascinating story. It has made me worse how Snoop's character is constantly asking McDermott to read his work and makes him criticize him. But you know what? I'm sure a lot of writers are like that. His character was as bad as McDermott's, in his own right. My only slight criticism of the film would be his end. For some reason, it seemed too nasty to me, although the distinction certainly made sense and was motivated by characters rather than conspiracy.
