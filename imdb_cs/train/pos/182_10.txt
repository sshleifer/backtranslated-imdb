If you are uninvited in the Gundam world, it's a good place to start. If you are burned in star wars or Star Trek, there is a convincing and realistic science fiction series that you can dive into. It's not a simplifying story about the robot you thought was a complex and emotionally cosmic cosmic drama where the line between "good" and "bad" boys is definitely less than obvious. Gundam 0080 focuses on the story of Al Izurah, a young naive boy living in a neutral space colony. He spent his days smiling at mobile suits and playing war with his friends. During this series, Al is friends with "enemy" soldier Bernie Wiseman. Finally, little Al learns a hard lesson about the real state of war and the necessary suffering and sacrifice. I loved this series of FLAs with their cool mosses that included the story and the loving characters. I recommend this series to anyone who likes a realistic SF anime, or to those who think anime is just stupid or sexy fun.
