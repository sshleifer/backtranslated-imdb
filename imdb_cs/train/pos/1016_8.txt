If Claudia Black did not stop in it, I would give this absolutely amazing series of 10 votes! Its incorporation as a stupid "Vela" brought a series down to my estimation. To bring it up as regular and alongside Ben Browder to replace the RDA, it was a mistake. Unfortunately, we just enjoyed the loss of "Jack" and really did not need this great series to become a new episode "Farscape". I was a big fan of "Stargate," and when the series was first announced, I had reservations that she could only live after the movie, but after watching the first episode I must admit I was addicted. I've always been looking forward to new episodes of great anticipation
