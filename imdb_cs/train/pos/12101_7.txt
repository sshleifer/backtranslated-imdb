I remember seeing this movie at the West End Theater in Louisville, Kentucky when I was a boy. The scene where dr. Carmus finds the gardener's coffin and the breathing body in it, it was the most important part of the film, amplified by the darkness of the film. I was also interested in the fact that the people at the end of the trees hang out of the tree until I get to know the part of the movie that changed the surnames of the Blackwoods from Blackblood, because in family history there was a figure known for its many people's hinges. Sir Thomas Blackwood apparently got his kicks from joining the death of his family. I also noticed that when Foster first enters the graveyard gate, he is cautious when he notices the sharp subject of the gate where he meets his end. I would not hesitate to recommend this movie to horror lovers.
