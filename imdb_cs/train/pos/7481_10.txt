I could not concentrate more on the quote "this is one of the best movies ever shot." If you think Vanilla Sky is simply a "re-make", you do not have to be bad. This film has a huge depth: visually, musically and emotionally. Visually, because the film is sometimes soft and delicate (early scenes with Sofia) and at other times powerful and intense (Times Square, post-climatic scenes). <br /> <br /> Music and sounds fit perfectly with this movie. Without music, the story is only half. Nancy Wilson has created an emotional, yet eclectic score for a movie that would not be more suitable for such a dream theme (although it has never been released, I could get my hands on the original score for about $ 60, you can find a copy yourself). Crowe's other musical selections, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, Monkees, etc., are also the perfect hobbies for the movie (Crowe has the ear of great music). <br /> <br /> More importantly, the emotional themes in this movie (ie, Love, sadness, regret) are very strong and intensified tenfold by visual and musical experience as well as brilliant dialogue; I admit that the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes again and again. The best part of this movie, however, is that it is so intelligently created that every once you see the movie, you will see something new - so watch carefully and be ready to think! Sure, after the first or second watch, it will become an obvious topic, but the story is more and more than you think. This is Cameron Crowe's best work and overall brilliance. Much of my film and musical inspiration comes from this work. He sincerely touched my life, because true art tends to do it. I am always surprised that there are many people who can not appreciate this film for what it is (I think I understand real art is art in its own right). Bottom line: Vanilla Sky is in the league of its own.
