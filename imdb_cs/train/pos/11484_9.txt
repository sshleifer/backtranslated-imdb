I just came back from the Montreal premiere of the Null Day ... and I'm surprised to find a negative commentary on the movie. Basically, it is the guilt that Coccio makes a simple and exaggerated social message ... well, sir, I'm a reviewer, it's an easy and exaggerated critique of social filming movies. <br /> <br /> Not that I want to expose my life here, but I come from a small town with a school similar to the guys going. Rejection and ignorance in the offer. The thing is ... I understand how young children can be so horrified. Secondary schools have become battlefields of consensus. It's a really ugly look. You need to fight your way to being like others. It is difficult to explain that many people are unaware that universities are becoming cemeteries of human intelligence. So far, their parents are closing their eyes and smiling as their life in a comfortable suburb is perfect. The real motive of the film is not about what drives them. It is this quiet, quiet suburb and everyone closes their eyes and tries to create the atmosphere of a perfect city. Cal has expressed it well. It's awakening. Drama is everywhere and can be every shape. In this case, small drama (like Andre, called the Fagot for wearing a J.C Penny Shirt) is becoming the worst nightmare of the city. Andre & Cal took the most amazing way of expressing their pain. Trouble in the irregularity when it is necessary to be more than ever before. <br /> <br /> I particularly like the last scenes when some guys are burning the Andre & Cal crosses, as if with the pain they told, Cal & Andre told their blind anger to their community and refused to think about the causes of some acts. <br /> <br /> It could seem aggressive as a movie, but Coccio meditates more than wailing or speaking. What Andre & Cal is, is a fact ... and a terrible thing that can get to other kids. <br /> <br /> Disturbing movie ... Home and strong feeling Ben Coccio makes a very worrying film.
