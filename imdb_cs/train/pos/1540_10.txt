It's an incredible movie. I can not remember the last time I saw the Swedish film that lay on it. It's fun, it's tragic, it's convincing, and it's mostly a piece of Swedish little urban life. It crushes the cliché and deepens it. You feel connected not only with the main characters, but also with all the characters. A great girl returning to her roots to her little hometown, celebrating her father's 70th birthday, people she had met for several years. Though the story itself is not unique, it offers a new approach. The center of the story is the relationship between the three sisters (at different stages of life) who are not too close. Or at least you do not realize how close they are. One of the main reasons why it's so easy to connect with people in this movie is immaculate cast. First of all, I am more than delighted by the fact that there are no so-called Swedish A-list actors in this film at all. Usually there are a handful of actors who can find their way to almost all major productions in Sweden. This time, the production company has managed to keep it true by taking on actors who really love their profession. Sofia Helin is probably the first Swedish actress ever since Eva Röse proved that you do not need words that could tell emotions. Writing is also very attractive. Dialogue is more than credible and compared to other Swedish films over the past year or two, it's a mile ahead. Maria Blom checks everything from scratch, and if you did not know, you would never have doubted it was the first time to write and direct a feature film. I can not wait for another. <br /> <br /> When you start watching, you really want to see it.
