When I was 17 years old, I studied Bye Bye Birdie - which is not a big surprise, because it is the perfect middle school material and is considered to be the most famous musical of the world. <br /> <br /> I'm a music student and I keep a strong memory of the production and her songs, as well as the continual non-response to the film version of Dick Van Dyke, who (intentionally) masked the Elvis reference, and the drawbar is for the smart 60. < <br /> <br /> So, when Jason Alexandra was playing in my cable TV set in 1995, I was thrilled with what I saw. Alexander will perform as exceptional as Albert, which is performance in contrast to his famous person from a television series. The rest of the cast is fun and convincing in its role (Chynna Phillips is perhaps the only one who does not seem to be part of her, probably a naive and innocent school girl). But best, musical figures known from the scene are preserved in this film and act as phases of musical songs should be (allowing the absence of a scene). So, if you know the musical (and few do not), then look at this telem. It makes the scene show justice in a way that probably does not improve, which is good enough for me. What is better than doing the author's work faithfully, colorfully and stylishly?
