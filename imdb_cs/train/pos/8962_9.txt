Like Pagan I have to say that this film has little if it has any magical meaning. It's a "funny" sorcerer's film and it does not teach us anything but love is the strongest Magic of all and I never use it in a controlling or revenge way. This is a lesson that everyone has to learn, not just Pagani. <br /> <br /> It has been said this movie is beautifully written and beautifully executed by Kim Novak and the venerable Jimmy Stewart. <br /> <br /> Hermione Gingold brings starring performance as Bianca, Elsa Lanchester (with too many movie affairs except that Ms. Jane Marbles of "Murder By Death") was as beautiful as Mrs. Novak, Also Playing Jack Lemmon (fabulous performance) and Jim Kovacs (brilliantly funny). "" Witches can not cry why they can not pass through a single tear because their heart is full of Magic. they do not have time for stupid things like love. "Queenie." Gillian Holroyd (Novak) and her brother Nicky (Jack Lemmon) are the witches in Manhattan, deeply hidden in the secret underworld of those in Craft, among whom New Yorkers live as one of them Shepherd "Shep" Henderson (Stewart), a perennial, non-senseless, committed trader who is engaged to marry Gillian's old colleague rival. <br /> <br /> Special the use of Magika, with little help from Pyewacket (known by Gillian, trained by Robert E. Blair) and Queenie, begins Gillian to work on this nice new dream to come back to your old enemy. But Magick should never be used to control or hurt, and Gillian learns the hard way in the most cruel way. Not only has to face it she did, but she had to face Shepa in her guilt. <br /> <br /> From a critical point of view, the film changes seriously. The effects are very dated to the state of a clean camp. Some of the scenery was seemingly shot in the basement of someone's small home, but at least the characters were strange and fun. <br /> <br /> A personal note, Pyewacket steals the show. Great cat! Great training by Robert Blair. <br /> <br /> As a note of Trivia, it is the roots for the beloved Bewitched TV sitcom. This will introduce the original Samantha and Darrin. All note characters are present and charged. You just have to look, see for yourself. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites and I often look at it. <br /> <br /> This movie gets 9.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
