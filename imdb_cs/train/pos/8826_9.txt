If you are entertained by direct turnings that are logical in that illogical situation, you will enjoy this spirited 8-minute Spanish film. A woman enters a small caf√©. The scene looks normal, but the guards, the customers and the two musicians seem to be a bit compelling. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the musicians play and one man starts singing the title song, dancing over the tables with musical comedy gestures. Customers, initially immobile, at regular intervals of ringing (wrong but gamely) with the phrases of the song, read from the sheets of paper in their palms. Turns on and off and dances (inadvertently but seriously) in choreography, such as backup singers. But why ??? the woman asked. The answer is revealed when the solo jacket opens and she sees what is pressed over her chest - just before the explosive climax ... Even if they do not catch the song (probably ironic) lyrics, the situation - the perfect performance should give you a smile and a taste ... I would like to see it again!
