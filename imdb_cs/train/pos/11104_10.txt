As a saga called Godfather was a look at the mafia from the executive, this series is a complex story of the mafia from the point of view of the worker. If you've never seen this show, you've been for a long time. Yes, it is violence and nudity, but it is never justified, and it is necessary to contrast with Tony Sopran, the gangster of the thinking person, with the reality of life that was born, and quite frankly that he would never leave or know how many of his associates ended up . Tony Soprano can talk to his therapist about Sun Tzu, then beat a man with death with a razor-shaped pan and smash, sit down and watch television and eat peanut butter from the pot and smash his body with his nephew and give this nephew advice on their upcoming marriage as if they were just finished on Sunday afternoon watching NFL football. Even Carmella, his wife, when given the chance to go out, finds out that she really prefers life with Tony and the benefits that come with him, and she looks in the opposite direction to her indecision and life on her own. If you've been watching the whole thing, you know how it ends. If it is not, believe me, you have never seen the end of a TV show.
