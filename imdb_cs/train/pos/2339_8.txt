I love this show. Now I'm not a big fan of many sci-fi serials, so if I do not like them, I did not notice it. I love high-quality film cinematography. I even love the love story, even though I look forward to how I like it, how the hell that part of the story really can develop when Ned does not touch Chuck or otherwise ... well, you know. I even like Chuck, I did not find her annoying at all, and I generally hate too sweet, nice and perfect characters. I even like the narrator's voice, even if it bothers one of the family members and resembles some Walgreens advertisements. I could tell everyone else about Ned's troubles and how the writers will deal with them in the future, but I prefer to look and wait and see what the writers bring together.
