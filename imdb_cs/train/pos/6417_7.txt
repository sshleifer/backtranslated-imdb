Inspirational story Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a black man who grew up in poverty in Kentucky and then joined the US Navy, and strives to be the first black Navy Diver master in the history of the navy. We are watching the series of childhood struggles that Brashear has to overcome to keep his dream (and then keep him alive). The least of the problems were the Master Diver Bill Sunday (Robert DeNiro), the diving school head the Navy sends to Brashear, who is not particularly sympathetic to Brashear's goals but who eventually becomes an unlikely friend and supporter. This is a good movie; fast and with lots of action, even if there is no "action" pic in the normal sense. There is also a very human story and an interesting study of racism and struggle to overcome this reality; there is also a sense of struggle that took place in the 1960s between older and younger naval officers (the "Old Navy" and "New Navy"). Performances are pretty good - especially Goodings. I thought DeNiro might be a bit on top of his Sunday portrait (though who knows Sunday might be this extreme kind of free cannon) and a portrait of Sunday woman Gwen (Charlize Theron) also asked me if these parts were "jazzed up" to provide entertainment value. <br /> <br /> Good movie, though. I never really wondered if it was worth it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
