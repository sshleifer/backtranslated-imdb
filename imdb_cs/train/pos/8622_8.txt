I can not agree with the above comments - there are plenty of exciting and truly amazing movie frames, unusual structure, and moving well towards a terrible top sequence that is remarkable for effective silence. What's more, it examines the strange impulse of suicide in a very honest way, without pulling any strikes in what it shows without unnecessarily exaggerating the subject. has hints of documents about him as well as about horror and art in the cinema and deserves a place among the cannon of "various" horror films such as the Blair Witch Project and the original ring (both of which preceded and could be well unconfirmed). It's definitely worth seeing if you're interested in the edge of a horror movie theater.
