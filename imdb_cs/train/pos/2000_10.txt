I participated in a small mini production when I was 8 and my mom bought a video. I already loved it! When I was younger, it was the songs and the spectacular dance sequences I enjoyed, but since I was looking older I appreciate more fantastic acting and character portraits. Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were great. I can not imagine anyone playing Bill Sykes or Fagin. Shani Wallis' Nancy, if it's the best character for me. She tried with the guys so much, I think it's such a strong figure and its final scene when ... Well, you know ... It always makes me cry! The best musical in my opinion of all time. It lasted all this time, it will live many more years! 11/10 !!
