Finally, I sat down and saw this movie all the way, and I must say I was very impressed. Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses - it's not just that she * can * act * but that she chooses the roles best suited to her that are more meaningful and important than what they seem to be. I have read some comments that express their relief that it was not a terrible feminist thing, as they thought in advance, but I definitely disagree. Diana is a feminist. She follows her dreams and believes in herself inconsistent with what practically everyone around her thinks (except her caregiving brother Tina and her coach and manager Hector, who turns out to be a more paternal figure than her real parent). the word "feminism" is about everything. It's good to see movies like this that show the real aspect of feminism - that it's not a lot of wealthy people - but they have dreams and can do anything. Diana is herself as she still falls prey to love, and she and Adrian have a more realistic and complicated relationship rather than something that works magically. Girls' fight is a real taste of reality and gives faith back to my perception of people. Thanks, Michelle. <br /> <br /> 8/10 - a very important film that is associated not only with young women but also with all who want to go far into their lives.
