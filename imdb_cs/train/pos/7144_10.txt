I saw the film Holes and I say it must be the best movie all year round. Involves a child in all. I mean, who would come up with the idea that boys with boys kick holes like their punishment? Louis Sachar to who. Although the film differed from the book, it was still very good. For example, Caveman / Stanley was supposed to be the biggest. Weight wisely and higher, but ZigZag / Ricky was taller and Armpit / Theodore was bigger. Also X-Ray / Rex was one of the smallest boys, but he was not. The only thing I did not like about the film was that the flashes were somewhat persuasive and long. I'd rather see more than the past, but it's just my opinion. I especially like boys' work. Like Squid / Alan, who played Jake M.Smith was supposed to be a moody and tough guy. Jake M.Smith has just performed and did a great job, just like almost all the actors in the holes. So I would say that if you did not see holes, then you should definitely see it coming out again, or you're going for all the fun.
