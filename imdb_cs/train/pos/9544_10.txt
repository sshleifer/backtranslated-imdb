Meatball Machine is an amazing splashed movie, has an original conspiracy with young love, blood buckets and strange extraterrestrial creatures that move people into wild robotic war machines. Now, the film is not for everyone, people who love filming movies or film Tetsuo: The Iron Man will applaud him. The special effects may be cheese in some parts of the film, but you do not have to assume that you will take the film very seriously <br /> <br /> However, it's all fun when you find that novice romanticized with slimy tumors like fools, who are trying to destroy each other in bloody foreign crazy battles.
