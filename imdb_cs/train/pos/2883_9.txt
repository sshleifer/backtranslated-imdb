Cinderella is a film about a young girl whose mother died and her father married again. As soon as her father died, Cinderella's stepmother became very reasonable and made her do all the work in the house as if she had cleansed her two bad nephews. One day the king sent a message to all the women who attended royal balls in honor of their son to find a wife. Of course, Cinderella did not have to go, but her advisers did. Cinderella was very upset and thought there was no way she could participate in the Royal Ball until her fairy tale appeared. So she made a spell and made Cinderella a beautiful woman, but she must return at midnight, because that's when the spell changes. While at Royal Ball, Cinderella loses track of time and the hour strikes until midnight, she runs out of the palace and loses her glass parrot. Then the King orders the Dukes to find the women who wore that parrot. The Duke searched every house, but eventually found the women he belonged to, Cinderella. Clyde Geronim, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske directed one of the best animated Disney movies in the 1950s. This film is a magical fairy tale. At the beginning of the film Cinderella was a servant of her own family and did not have to love her, but with a bit of magic, her life changed and finally found her love. My favorite thing "Cinderella" is music. When Cinderella's fairytale book appeared, she sang the song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a kid, it was one of my favorite songs that sang around my house so I will never forget it. I also liked Cinderella and the Prince singing a song That's love while dancing because they realized they were in love. Overall, this movie was my favorite film when I was young, because every little girl wants to live a fairy-tale life.
