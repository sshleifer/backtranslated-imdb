I'm just confused why damn FOX canceled the season3 although season2 was not as good as season1, which is really great !!! I like it so much that I'm thinking about buying a DVD on Amazon. student and it's inconvenient for me to get an international credit card and $). I just hope FOX can return DA in some way!
