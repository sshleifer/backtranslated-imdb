I was treated to browsing the Cracker Bag last night before looking at Disney's holes. I do not know who decided to show but I'm so glad they did. The Cracker Bag is an absolute jewel, the image of Australia in the early 1980s, which is seen through the child's eye. "The talks between Eddie and her brother were merry and, like the rest of the movie, they were so lively. Each shot brought a great sense of nostalgia, because it reminded me of my own childhood (at the same age as the director probably helped a bit) and the sound multiplied the feeling. I just hope the Cracker Bag one day will appear.
