What a gorgeous film, suitable for so many labels that never gets: Science-fiction, film-noir, with a screenplay and a high intelligence dialogue that requires an educated, cultured audience ... before 1960 in England (and it turned out only in American movie theaters when it first came), and it never happened in the US. Main Men in a White Suit Men (1951) Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood commonly use polysyllabic scientific reference words as "polymer," discussing and explaining the terms chemistry as "long chain molecules," and then communicating the importance of these factors to the average person and the benefits that science provides him. > <br /> The man in a white suit (1951) is the opposite of explosive video cameras that now (2009) dominate world cinema and certainly dominate the great American cinema ....... it's a careful act, intelligently telling the tale supplied by gifted and faithfully educated English (who cried education and perfect people), all with comedy, magic, pathos and a sense of irony that the old Greek playwrights would approve. Everyone should see this movie and once, some dignified filmmakers and supporters should do something like that. <br /> <br /> It's beautiful.
