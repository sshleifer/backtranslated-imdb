I absolutely loved this movie. I bought it as soon as I found a copy of it. This movie had so much emotion and I felt so real that I could really sympathize with the characters. Every time I look at it, the end makes me cry. I can really identify with the character of Busy Phillip and how I would feel if I did the same thing. I think all colleges should show this movie, maybe it will leave people wanting to do the same. I recommend this movie to everyone and everyone. Especially those who have been hit by some school shooting. It's really one of the greatest movies of all time.
