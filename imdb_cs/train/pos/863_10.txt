I was totally involved in this film from the first minute to the last minute. He is greatly shot, with many interesting and original camera angles and techniques. The story surrounds a deaf woman chosen by friends and colleagues. She selects an assistant at work whose real purpose is to find love. She is an ex-con, and she uses it to avenge those who have hurt her. In return, he must help with a robbery that requires her ability to read lips to pull her. The film moves into a dark movie noir, with some really great scenes and an even finer finale. The real beauty of this film comes from the way a director uses disability of the front person. The use of sound keeps the tension strained and dramatic shifts from silence to noise keep pumping blood, that's for sure. Slip into a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual repression you have great movies. It's the film Hollywood really wants to do, but he can not.
