In 2004, I saw "The Truth", a contribution by Tom Tykwer to Paris Je T'aime. When I saw it, I loved her and I was excited. It became my favorite short film and it made me appreciate the format so much. Of course I wanted to watch the whole movie and I would even check who is connected, etc. <br /> <br /> Yesterday, I finally saw it, courtesy of the Internet. <br /> <br /> I must say that it looks amazing. Photography is FINE in every short and shot, in the worst case there is nothing special - but still great and clear. Later I read the trivia and maybe it is how scanning in 6K gives more justice to all DP work. My special favorites are the first scene of "Quais de Seine", Sin City-esquire (but better for me) "Quartier de la Madeleine" and "14th Arrondisement" - but you know what the hell I like everyone else: "or" Faubourg Saint-Denis "still makes me nervous with those brilliant colors (my eyes, they shake!) and" Quartier Latin "is gold trapped in silver. Beautifully. <br /> <br /> Yes, these are some SHORT short films. Now we get to the content. Power (and I mean, MY LOT) is similar to eclecticism that feels so successful. You never had the same theme or treatment between the two shorts and I think the formula is sufficiently restrictive to allow all these artists to explore the beautiful and deep things inside the shorts. I loved a simple love story in the crazy chinese-musical in Paris with Barbet-Schroeder in a social commentary on the terrorist comedy into a humble monologue. I like surprise! And this movie is mine! It's great that they've managed to leave all this director's body out of things that are not usual in the main cinema (which I dislike very badly). It's not hard to experiment, but I can breathe the breathing space these people have. <br /> <br /> I like little time and I love acting. I love simplicity and I love love. I like simple feelings and beauty and eclectic, and generally it's a movie that is very nice to see alone or with someone. Just feel. He left me feeling very good. <br /> <br /> There is something about the seriousness in it ... it's so honest ... What I did not like? Well, there are two short shorts for me that are not the best - "Quais de Seine" (which is good nature, sure and perhaps even necessary but feels too much like advertising) and "PÃ¨re-Lachaise" even though I like acting , I felt they were motivated. But of course it's just me. "Tour Eiffel" I also did not love, but I think it is probably due to my very different sensitivity from Sylvain Chomet? I do not know if this film has a special interest in people who already know actors and directors, so they can please them by interacting with each other, by surprise (paying attention to Alexander Payne in a funny role), and basically "what does that director do?" Great question. I really liked it. <br /> <br /> I repeat now: Most shorts I loved and all of them make up a beautiful and energetic blend. I certainly recommend it. Definitely!!! See if you like Eclectic Beautiful Love!
