This documentary (now available for free on Video.Google.Com) is a fantastic demonstration of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice. Everyone has to see this. <br /> <br /> Chavez was elected in 1998 with a loud voice. Its platform was to divert fantastic oil wealth from 20% of the middle class to 80% of the poor. He prohibited fishing in the waters of Venezuelan waters. He sent 10,000 Cuban doctors to the slums to treat the sick for free. He erased illiteracy and founded new free universities. <br /> <br /> But that was his 30% tax on oil companies profits that got him into trouble with the Bush administration. In 2002, when the Iranian filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnach O'Briain interviewed Chavez inside the presidential palace about his social programs, a CIA-sponsored coup was launched. Closing the Chavez cameras was captured and exported out of the country. The television broadcast was announced to have "resigned". But the poor of Venezuela did not trust the media. They went to the palace in their millions and asked for Chavez to return. In the face of such a huge number of soldiers, they turned to the leader of the coup, and the plotters fled to the United States. Chavez was rescued by a military helicopter and returned to joy.
