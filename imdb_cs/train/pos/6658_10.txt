Mahatma was described as a man who neglected his son in this film. Do not get me wrong I'm not answering a movie; it's such a wonderful movie and he's out of the cinema with a lump in his throat. We need to understand the spiritual status of Mahatma, he is the true spiritual leader. Only fully enlightened man could separate himself from his loved ones. A man with such a caliber leads his family and followers as an example. According to the film, he spoke to his son, trying to understand where he came from, but poor Harilall could not understand his father with such a small intellect. When Harilall did not succeed, Mahatma could stay calm and accept that his son was a big tragedy. <br /> <br /> If they were some other parents, their value would be jeopardized to help the son stand up. Mahatma did not do it, he is the true leader leading an example.
