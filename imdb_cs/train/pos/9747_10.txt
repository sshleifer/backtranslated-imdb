I remember seeing this movie when it came out in 1982 and it loved it. Four years later, I had the privilege of seeing Lucian Pavarotti sing at the Metropolitan Opera in New York (Tosca), so seeing the end of this movie reminds me of a great night. What does not like about this movie? The music is great and Pavarotti (Fini) was at his best and still looked great. The story is really fun in parts, and the scene of "food warfare" is still one of the funniest things I've ever seen. The hot air balloon flight across the Napa Valley was beautiful and so was the song he sang "If we were in love" (one of the few times sang Pavarotti in English). And the hearing of Santa Lucia duet is wonderful. Get real people, it was a film about an opera singer named Georgio Fini who was just playing Pavarotti. Kathryn Harrold and Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting roles. I'm very glad I still have this almost worn VHS tape from this movie, but I'd like it to be released on DVD especially now, Pavarotti is not with us anymore, because I think it includes the best performance of Nessuna Dorma singing him still on film today!
