I never knew about a movie that would stir up such a debate in my life. Believe me when I say that this movie will eventually be remembered as a classic. I was waiting for this movie as I once loved Lock, Stock .... and Snatch, but after some negative reviews I thought I would be very disappointed. I absolutely loved the film and I can not wait to see it again. This film differs completely from both of the above-mentioned Ritchie films and much better. I have my selection of favorite directors, but none of them has made the move that Guy Ritchie has shot with this film. I believe he made the film to a different level (I know most people will laugh at this commentary that will drive the reaction to this movie, but I believe that time will show me the right one). This movie is very confusing and went on for well over 2 hours or so, because I could not stop thinking about it or trying to break things together. I'm pretty good now to take everything that's happening in this movie (some answers from the endless hours of thinking, some answers from other people's readings about the movie) and now I can not wait until Sunday when I see it again. I just hope that people will go to open-minded cinemas and hope they will be rewarded just like me and many others.
