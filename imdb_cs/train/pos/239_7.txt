I saw it on movies with my girlfriend at the time and I can say that I did not have the best time especially because I did not know about Ned Kelly or his story. is biopic, it is important to know at least what to expect from the character. I do not know if the way the events are said, true, or if everything is fictitious. But the way Ned Kelly is portrayed as a hero and a rival for justice, he really wanted to believe that everything was true. I do not think he's portrayed as a criminal or thief, but it's just my opinion. It's a solid Western film for everyone's taste. Heath Ledger is a great as always and sexy Naomi Watts Magic Screen. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a chance if it is broadcast on a cable. Otherwise, I do not think I could recommend it.
