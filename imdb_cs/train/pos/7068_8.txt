I'm surprised by the poster notes that Jane Powell has made the same kind of films by Deanna Durbin. Although they were both young sopranos, whose films were created by Joe Pasternak, if this film was a hint, they were almost polar opposites. While in the Third SMART GAME, Durbin plays the impulsive "Little Miss Fixit", which after several failures succeeds in bringing together her divorced parents, Jane Powell in her semi-remake of THREE DARING DELIVERIES almost destroys marriage between mother Jeanette MacDonald and new stepfather Jose Iturbi, when she refuses to accept her, and the strong arms of her younger siblings to refuse it too. <br /> <br /> From the Durbin and Powell films I've seen, I would say that these unmatched qualities penetrate the early films of both these talented young artists. Durbin in the films THREE SMART GIRLS, I find it totally triumphant and impressive. Although it is clear from its occasional precious and convincing reading in some more energetic scenarios that it is an early film for Deanne, watching the self-confidence, conscious and naturally sparkling way in which she delivers her line and it works totally and in a dim and gentle way of showing more serious scenes, you could never guess that this is the first film role of a 14-year-old girl whose previous professional experience consisted almost exclusively of a two-year vocal lesson. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and the security that Durbin displays on the screen. Although clearly developing his acting style and camera behavior (which equally affected the early performances of much more experienced contemporaries like Garland, Rooney, O'Connor and Jane Powell), Durbin will show an extraordinary presence and warmth to the camera, she is absolutely unique to her and even in her first film she managed to remain extremely sympathetic despite the often rapid impulsiveness of her character, and although she is sometimes excited, she never has a coy and arched feature that affected many child stars, including Jane Powell and some other young sopranos, who followed her as a result. <br /> <br /> In short, like all the great singing stars, Durbin was much more than just a "gorgeous voice." On the other hand, while Durbin's pure lyric soprano is really a remarkable and famous instrument, the most notable thing about me was the way she can project her songs without any little influence or "grandnes" singing singing to adult opera singers such as Lily Pons , Grace Moore and Jeanette MacDonald in the movies of this time <br /> <br /> The film is also beautiful, heavily influenced by the screwball comic, supporting Durbin with creme-de-cream of first class professionals such as Charles Winninger, Binnie Barnes, Alice Brady, Ray Milland and Mischa Auer. The story is light and fun. True, it's barely "realistic," but why would anyone expect it? If you want: "realistic" rents of GRAPES OF WRATH or TRIUMPH OF THE WILL. On the other hand, if you are looking for an original, sweet, fun and entertaining family comedy with gorgeous, charismatic and gifted "leadership" of adolescents and amazing supporters, this film will not disappoint you.
