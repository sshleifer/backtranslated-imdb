No, not really, but it's really a good movie and it's a sadly forgotten gem. Black and white film suits. Straight forward formula, the guy had a plague, and the authorities must trace all those with whom they came in contact before they die. <br /> <br /> Very well directed and acting is great. Richard Widmark as a male leader is good but is completely overshadowed in action bouts by Paul Douglas as police captain and Jack Palance (never better than this one) and Zero Mostel as baddies. Sadly Palance began to play similar characters in some really second gangsters or war films.
