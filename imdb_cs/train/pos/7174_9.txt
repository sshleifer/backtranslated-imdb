I went from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this movie premiere - and I'm really glad to have done it. As a big movie fan and a lifetime of northern California, I was surprised at how many Oscar films got in the bay area. As a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the bay instead of going to LA, George Lucas's comments on perseverance, community and vision really resonated with me. <br /> <br /> Hey, if he and all the other creators can do it in SF, so can other artists. <br /> <br /> He would recommend this movie
