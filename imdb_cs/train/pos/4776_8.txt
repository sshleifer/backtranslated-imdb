I watched this movie in one of my usual times, which is really late at night. Usually, when the film does not interest me, I start to sleep and I have to get into the refrigerator to stay awake. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that was what I had to do because film stimulation began slowly, along with the fact that his shots had been a long-time character. But after a bit, I'm going to get more into the movie because he's talking about his main hero. You finally feel like you know him all your life. The film kept my interest so much that I did not even know the sun was going to rise. It's not much Lynch's bizarre style, but there are plenty of special characters to make the movie fun.
