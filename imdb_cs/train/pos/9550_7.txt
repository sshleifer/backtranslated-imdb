Despite success in comedy or drama, Turkish directors are a failure in horror-thriller. "Okul-D @ bbe" is a good example of horrible horror movies in Turkey. But if you look at "Gen," you'll understand that it's a strike. The atmosphere of the film is impressive and dark. Also special features are colorful and are not cheap. Soundtrack suited the film, but the script is not perfect and the movie theme is common. The result is that "Gen" does not add any difference between horror, but it did not disappoint the fans of the thriller. This is the success of Yesilcam and Turkey. (7/10)
