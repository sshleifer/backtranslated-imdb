These days, Spielberg's "The Color Purple" is mostly reminiscent of being nominated for eleven Oscars and winning a living. Still, alarming is that Spielberg himself has not been nominated as the best director. To be impatient, filmmakers have earned more awards than they have been awarded. The story concerns trials and tribulations by Whoopi Goldberg, an African-American woman controlled first by her innocence by her father and then by her abusive husband. The film stretches for several years and focuses mainly on Celie's relationships with the women around her. This is said from a definitely female perspective, but you do not have to worry about being a "cat". The story is interesting, sometimes humorous, even though the struggle for the central character is the most important thing. Some do not appreciate the change of tone to the end of the film, but I did not mind it, although similar content in a smaller film would probably wipe my eyes. The film won three Academy Award nominations: Whoopi Goldberg (Best Actress), Oprah Winfrey (Best Supporting Actress) and Margaret Avery (Best Supporting Actress). I think Goldberg and Winfrey definitely deserved, and Danny Glover was undoubtedly stiff. As has been said, Spielberg did not get the nomination for best director for his efforts. Such omissions are based on faith because the direction Spielberg is top. I'm not too crazy about Quincy Jones score, but it's not below average. At the end, the story is satisfactory, well known by a great filmmaker working from Pulitzer Winning Material. Try it and you'll probably be as confused as I am about how it could be badly treated at night by the Oscars.
