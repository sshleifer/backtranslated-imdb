This movie is so cheap, it's cute! With Ron Liebmann (Major Vaughn) provides the most entertaining on-screen diatribes in the history movie. I own 2 copies of this movie on the video ... on one, Ralph Macchio is actually caught cracking in the background at Major Vaugn while he is wounded on "Hash." Obviously, they have forgotten this bug to adjust from the movie, but it shows how fun the movie is when actors can not keep a straight face !!!
