The sexoploitation film era of the late 1960s and early 1970s began with free nudity in major films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn. Her highlights were between 1968 and 1972. One of the most popular and talented actresses of this era was Monica Gayle, who had a small but fanatical cult of followers. She was really able to act, unlike many who played the leading roles of these films and her follow-up credits. And her seemingly intentional seizures in her secrets when her career begins, strengthens her mystique. Gary Graver, director, was also a talent; probably too talented for the sexploitation genre, and his skills, combined with Monica Gayle's presence on the screen, makes Sandra, Women's Creation a pleasantly enjoyable experience. The movie never pulls off and you do not have your finger pressed on the fast forward button.
