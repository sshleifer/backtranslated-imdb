Vampires, sexy boys, guns and some blood. Who could ask for more? Moon Child adds everything in a nicely packed movie! Gackt is an innocent sho who, with Vampire Keie (HYDE), their relationship grows over time, but as Sho ages, Kei's immortality breaks his heart. It does not help that they both fall in love with the same woman. Special effects are relatively good due to the small budget. It's a moving story mature with human emotions. You will laugh, cry, laugh, and then you will cry even more. Even if you are not a fan of their music, see this movie. It works great as a separate vampire movie. <br /> <br /> 9 of 10
