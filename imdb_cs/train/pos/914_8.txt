Vivah is by no means a classic. In days of harsh events, top special effects, and complex plots (no Bollywood has ever tried), it's quite refreshing to see a simple movie like Vivah. The story, as we all know, is the journey from the first pair meeting to their eventual wedding after a few short moments and trial time. Nothing more. Music is not entirely in the same league as MPK or HAHK, but it also has no senses. For me, there were two songs - Mujhe Haq Hai & Do Anjaane. While Milan abhi aadha and Hamaari shaadi were humorous. Shahid performs honestly and shows a lot of potential. It's good to see him playing something other than the "cold guy" he usually does. Amrita is very kind and plays the role of the obedient girl of a small town to perfection. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher & Seema Biswas are great support and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job. Suraj's direction is simple but effective. The main drawback of the film is a slow pace that can test the patience of many young audiences. But all good, clean and decent family film.
