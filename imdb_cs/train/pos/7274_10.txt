No Strings Attached is one of the best performances by Carlosa Mencia. Mencia is known for trying and making fun of racist questions. However, in this stand-up performance held in San Francisco it does more than that. In general Mencia material not only laughs but also thinks about what is really bad with the company today. During this long show, Mencia talks about such things as illegal immigration, what women actually think when they ask for equality in the workplace, about terrorism, about their opinion of Christ's suffering Mel Gibson, and the argument that he has come to a woman about it whether Jesus is affected or not, and how society should treat those who are physically or mentally handicapped. Mencia even discusses whether or not to have the right to speak and say a joke. Carlos Mencia is not afraid to offend, which often brings trouble to critics. For example, they go a little way (and admits it) with a joke about Pope John Paul II. And what in the most likely time he does in heaven. The main message of Mencia in all his performances is that we all have a voice and that we should use this voice to talk about what we feel and do not be afraid to offend. It reminds us that we have the right to freedom of speech and that we must use this right as Americans. If you enjoy this performance, I strongly recommend watching the Mind of Mencia, his Comedy Central show.
