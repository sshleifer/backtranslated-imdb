"Ex-Mrs. Bradford" (1936), headed by Thin Man star William Powell (this film was released the same year as the second thin film "After the Thin Man"), comes close to doubling the fun and style of Thin Man movies but it is still missing, yet it is a surprisingly funny and very funny murderous mystery in the same comic vein .. Is Myrna Loy missed? Of course, we do not lie. It would be hard to write a better substitute than Jean Arthur and the chemistry between Arthur and the star of William Powell is real and it's fun, romantic and involved. The Story and Screenplay by Anthony Vieller and John Wyne's production partner, James Edward Grant ("The Angel & The Bad Man") is close to being Thin Man's effort but lacking a bit of the right joke and sneezing. <br /> <br /> Although it is not in the stratosphere of "thin man" films (what else is?), "ex-Mrs. Bradford" is one of the most entertaining tens and dozens of mystery-comedy "co-doing" of 30s and 40s.
