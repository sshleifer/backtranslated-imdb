Cuban blood is one of those sleeping movies that have something to say about life in a very traditional way. Actually, I watched when he sailed for Cuba on a cruise on the West Caribbean. Describes in detail the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. There is not too much time for the revolution until the end of the socialist regime and the taking over of the boy's father. Most of the movie is a teenage boy and relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows others. There are some powerful scenes with which everyone can concentrate. Class A movie with a gentle acting and directing project. It's a movie that tells a story without special effects or big schemas or real twists. It's a film about people and their lives, their mistakes, and their triumph. A good movie that is worth watching several times a year.
