Beautifully shot, exciting and exciting film with tension. I was on the edge of my seat. I liked the actor and I thought the villain was very good. There is not much you would be doing on the way to the topic, but if you just get in your way, shut down your brain, watch fantastic camera work and enjoy the plot, you'll have a great time. The conspiracy is well-worn, and regular movie visitors probably know more or less what can be expected about ten minutes. But it did not bother me because I enjoyed watching how it worked. In the old days, maybe they did not have to concentrate so closely on two characters, and there were some tempting moments when I hoped some other people would leave a few lines. But these people are probably right to focus the film so tightly. The plot made my throat quite early and I never left. It's not a good idea to think too much during or after the movie. because I'm not sure it makes much sense. Just sit back and enjoy yourself.
