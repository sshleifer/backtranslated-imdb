Fate / Stay Night is an animated series inspired by h-game. Some producers turned it to make it a successful series without any h-material. It could not be otherwise, because the evolution of the character is great just as it is shown in this series, and any change could only destroy perfection. (You will understand when you see all the episodes). /> <br /> Despite a relatively slow start (the producer made the time to show the characters), things are fast accelerating, and soon after the mid-range action is so intense that it sticks to your seat. <br /> <br /> The theme of the series focuses on the holy grail war that has taken place in Fukuka in the last 50 years. In fact, the pilot begins with the end of the previous war and is evolving from there. Shiro is the only surviving fire that began during the last battle and surrounded a large part of the city. He is reluctantly witnessing the struggle between the two Servants that have begun his Reiju (holy mark) to summon one of the most powerful servants on the battlefield, Saber. His first contact with Sabr was amazed. "Such an immense beauty ... I was with a lost word." <br /> <br /> You can not compare this series with any other to fully understand that it's a conspiracy. FSN offers much more than some cool swords, good animation, spectacular lights, great soundtrack, excellent character and relationship development. It represents changes that occur in personality characterizing events. The activity reveals the incredible dynamic emotional and behavioral patterns of individuals (not like linear types of other series) that constantly shape their personalities to reveal bad characters from the mask of perfection. <br /> <br /> The Saber character is associated with a medieval legend that has been changed to fit into this series and should be accepted as such. You should not look at the fact that the FSN thinks it is not a historical fact to the viewer, just remember that it's an adventure / fantasy series rather than a document and enjoy it as long as you can. The end is sudden and unexpected, and if there were twice as many episodes as I would watch them in the same breath.
