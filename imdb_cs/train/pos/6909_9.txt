... and if you are very, very good it will be commemorated by Moon Over Parador. <br /> <br /> This movie had a bit of a stupid story but after all it was fantasy and casting and acting were spot-on! Dreyfuss was perfect as an actor / cheater, full of all the little neuroses and vanities you imagine to have actors. You get a glimpse of what actors are behind the scenes. He was one of Dreyfuss's best roles, and his character has the best role to play as a dead dictator! A scary scene: like something from Casablanca, really! <br /> <br /> Raul Julia was excellent as a parade chief of the secret police. He has gotten some really funny lines, some of which are honors for other movies, such as "Start the usual suspects!" <br /> <br /> And Sonia Braga was great as a girlfriend - except that it's a really hot number: "You should get an Oscar tonight!" <br /> <br /> Let's not forget that Johnny Winters is a CIA agent and a few singing stars: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett - all done perfectly. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a memorable trip under the Parador Moon. <br /> <br />
