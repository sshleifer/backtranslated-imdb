Fever Pitch is a fun movie. It has a lot of fun moments (including horribly disruptive shower scene). Like most romantic comedies, the "dead zone" is in the middle, where all the heavy things "divide with me" have happened, but in addition it remains fun to the end. <br /> <br /> Although the plot revolves around Red Sox fanaticism, it is not overloaded sports. You do not have to be a fan of this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's easy for me to say: I was a Red Sox fan because I was also a boy. > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
