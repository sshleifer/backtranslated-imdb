This unforgettable silent gem describes the true story of escaping from prisoners of war during the Second World War. The performances are incredible, especially Anthony Steele. The film works on many levels: cerebral, emotional, visual and literal. The dialogue is subtle and ring very truthfully. In fact, unusual omnipresent authenticity gives this head and shoulders over most of the war epics.
