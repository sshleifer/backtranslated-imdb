Being someone who puts Night of the Living Dead on number three in their five favorite films of all time and at the same time loving student film parody, I feel I have to protect this film from previously published reviews. This short, but sweet opus has always been popular in horror and science fiction movie marathons, where those who are involved have a love of genre but do not know they will not take the zombies too seriously. This film is a tribute to the original, not an insult. It is funny and many others I heard, sing and praise for agreeing to be successful. Especially for those of us who have seen NOTLD 50+ times. Watch out for Jeff Drexel's occasional news director, and if you have the opportunity to capture your parody Alien, Loaf.
