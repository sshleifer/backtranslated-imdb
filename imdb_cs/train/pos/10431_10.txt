I'm not sure what to say about this movie. that's one of the few movies I've ever done that I think would be romantic. trying to talk about plot or performance or technical details about this film would be frank zappa "as a dance about architecture". it absolutely strikes the nail directly on the head as it captures the volatile moments in life that move us and then flee from us so that we never again experience. this seems like a film-like version of Charlie Kaufman in the Adaptation movie he wanted to write. the end is left open and ambiguous, it is not a happy end, just a secret. no deep lessons of life, just a few excited and intelligent children who explore the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic feelings ... romantic love. 10 of 10 hours with your Special Checkers and recommend it to strangers ................
