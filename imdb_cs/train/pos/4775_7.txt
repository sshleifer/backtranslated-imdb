If it's the action and adventure you want in the movie, then you'd better recommend looking elsewhere. On the other hand, if it's a lazy day and you want a good movie to go with this mood, check out the "Direct Story." Richard Farnsworth brings impressive performance as gentleman and gentleman Alvin Straight, in this true story of Alvin's riding on a riding crane in three states to see his deceased brother who had a stroke. Farnsworth is perfect in this role when he travels for a long road shooting, alienating friends of strangers, and exhausting lots of past family tips on the road. The story moves as slowly as a rider, but somehow he keeps an observer, waiting for another lesson of life Alvin offers. <br /> <br /> Spread on the sofa, relax and enjoy yourself. It's the only way to watch this very good film, which I've rated 7/10 in my book.
