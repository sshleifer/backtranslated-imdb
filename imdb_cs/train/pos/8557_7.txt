I have to pass it on to the creative team behind these American Pie films. "Direct on DVD" is usually synonymous with a cheap, incompetent film. Last year, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself on the DVD sequel "The Naked Mile". Directors have taken the opportunity to deliver a weird but fun little movie. This year, they offer the sequel, "Beta House". That's an honest truth, "Beta House" makes the first few American Pie films that look like "Little Mermaid". This is no restrained, delicious, laughing loud entertainment. Sure, the story is a bit thin, but that's the beauty of the whole thing. During the first 10 minutes we were introduced to all the main characters, new supporting characters, we got a handful of fearless gags, met the villains and created a general line. With all those out of the way, the film becomes unlimited. Gaga's a lot and they did not hold on to that. I'm talking about male sperm, urine, dildos, pups with chicks, sheep sex, female orgasmic sprays, and lots of others. Not to mention that no one minute is running without breasts or sex scenes. Returning from "Naked Mile" are John White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley and Eugene Levy (in a similar supporting role as the last few films). All the cast does a great job. Especially Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler) has great energy and presence on the screen. I predict good things to him. The film is also packed with great movie links for those who have eyes open. By far the biggest laugh of the film for me was the "Deerhunter" parody. Classic. <br /> <br /> The most important thing is that if you're a fan of the series, you'll feel at home in the "Beta House" home. It really moves the boundaries of good taste, but in the end it's damn fun.
