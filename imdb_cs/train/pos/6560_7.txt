I think many viewers have completely missed the fact that this is probably a parody of Western films. It's not a bad movie - it's a smart language that faces Westerns. I do not believe that this film took a serious moment. What makes this film even more unique is the fact that it is centered around four strong, beautiful women, two of which are black, one Asian and a Mexican / Hispanic character. <br /> <br /> This is not your usual Western woman - it's hard - it can quickly draw and shoot straight. it's so hard, even if the bartender is shaking when he pours his whiskey. The story that drives this story is typical of the Westerns - in the spirit of "you shot my brother - I can get you!" Only in this Western woman's sister is shot and she is out for revenge on the gang who did it. So she goes and rounds her old friends out of her bank robbing days. <br /> <br /> One of them, Maria, is not really interested in the revenge of Rachel's sister, but she is motivated by the fact that gold and jewelery are hidden in the city where they are. There are a few scenes that make no sense, not that they hit so much that they can be ignored, but I was wondering why they were there. So the movie could be a bit tricky, but it's a well-created film that did not find the audience that recognizes what it is. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment was that the only lesbian in the movie is a villain - "heroes", one is apparently direct, other sexual orientations are never disclosed. <br /> <br /> 7 Stars
