This excellent drama has interrupted me all the time. I could not take my eyes off the screen for a second because every word still connected pieces with this mysterious murder. This movie really touched me because it showed how sad and hard life can be. Indeed I finally cried out (which I do not want to give away!) Also, let me realize how cruel and sick people can be in terms of murder. <br /> <br /> The cast was also very good. The only bad player was the actress who played Anne Marie. The actress did a great job, but the director did not do it. I say that because he found someone who did not look a little like Anne Marie Fahey herself.
