Some people say it's the best movie ever released by the PRC, I'm not too sure because I have a place in my heart for some of their secrets. I think it's probably one of the most unique movies, or any other studio studio, big or small, ever released. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. The spirit of an incorrectly executed ferryman returned to the swamp to kill all those who had been lynching him, just like all their spring. The granddaughter of a ghost victim, an existing carrier, comes into this mix. She takes a ferry shop when the spirit closes the man she loves. <br /> <br /> In a dense fog, set on a single marshmallow, it is more of a musical poem than a regular feature film. The rhythms of dialogue, especially in early scenes, are their poetic cadence. Similarly, there is a similar cadence to work with the camera as it moves back and forth across the swamp as if it were going over and over the door between life and death, innocence and guilt. The film reminds me of a lesson of an opera or oratoria or a musical subject more than a normal horror film. It's an amazing piece of film that is probably unique in the film of history. <br /> <br /> This is not for Lilly Guild. This is a low budget horror / mystery that tells you a neat little story that keeps you entertained. His story of love and vengeance is an important, not a poetic film that favors you in the first place (technical aspects are only window dressing.) If there is a real flaw of his production. The fog creates mood, but also hides the fact that this marsh is completely dry. The constant there and back is fine for some time, but after 58 minutes you want us to see something else. Do not get me wrong I really like the movie. It's a good little movie I've ever wished for was a little less poverty. It's definitely worth seeing if you meet him.
