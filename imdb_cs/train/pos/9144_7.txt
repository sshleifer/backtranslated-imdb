Okay, so it does not have to be a prize-winning movie "Movie of the Year" (apart from the brilliant soundtrack that I think has won several awards) but it's really a great movie about "The Kid" (Prince / O (Select) around him living in Minneapolis, playing music. Music is absolutely superb, in my opinion you MUST own this soundtrack, it's really a classic and sums up the sounds of the eighties and feel amazing fashions and the film itself is playing a nice plot, worth seeing again again, of course, if you like Prince / O (what I'm doing).
