He has no illusions, that's the story of morality. Granger is a hunter of a former buffalo hunter, who once again tried back on the plains by killing Taylor. Granger sees that the end is close and feels profoundly at the cost of hunting - herds, Indians, and the land itself. Taylor, on the other hand, certainly reminds the killing of buffaloes or Indians to "be with a woman". While Granger's role as a tortured man is excellent, it's Taylor who stole the show as a demented, immoral "everybody" for quick win and good times. There's not a lot of bang-bangs, but the story is moving fast and we're fine with the nolan. The theme of this story is today as violent as the 1800-man relationship to the earth and what is on it, and racism. As this happened, the censors had to look at their shame during the "sparkle house", Taylor's relationship with the trifling and much of the dialogue. Even though it's weaker, it's really a great western image.
