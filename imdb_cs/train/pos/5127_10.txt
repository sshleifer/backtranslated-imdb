Okay, so I left Houston a long way, but whenever I see that movie, I'm taken back to the dream of cowgirls to one day go to the bull at Gilley. (It was burned out before I was in the age of drinking.) If you've grown up in East Texas, then you know that this movie is at the time an accurate description of contemporary life. If you did not trust me and watched the movie. Either connect to many who love it (and at the same time weirdly reject) or at least you can enjoy the red necks. (There is plenty of material to poking fun.) This film does not try to be P.C. (what it was in the 1980s) or hide a white garbage element and is honest with time and place. <br /> <br /> I have to be 10 for me!
