Interestingly, how much more realistic is Brosnan's performance than James Bond's original novels compared to bond films. He is neurotic, paranoid, alcoholic, and lion. That's the perfect break for him, even to have fun with the bond icon. "I'm a mess, a parody of myself," he says. Nothing better. I just read Dr. No and it's very similar to how Ian Fleming portrayed James Bond. Personally, I have never loved Brosnan as Bond because it is too good for an icon. There was nothing that would personalize the character compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery. Its great to see Brosnan play the figure as anchored in fact, so the flamboyant wall. Shy nature that seeks to understand deeper emotional and psychological issues with no background. It's an impressive portrait, and Greg Kinear, who founded it, is just poetic. This movie reminds me of a bit of dynamics among the main characters in My Blue Sky, but more real in its equalizing mechanisms.
