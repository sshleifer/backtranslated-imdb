It is very rare that the film refers to viewers of all ages - to children for gentle narration and gorgeous varied productions and for adults for literate scenario, fine production values, good casting / acting, all bound together with fine Rozsa scores. Two rough contemporary films prove it - "Thief of Baghdad" (1940) and "Adventures of Robin Hood" (1938). Some stories about this production are fascinating. This production, which began in England in the summer of 1939, moved to Hollywood and showed coverage of British intelligence efforts! Producer Alexander Korda was awarded the knight in 1942. Here is the unique case of the crossroads of art, business and politics! Ensure a good CD of this movie for your library!
