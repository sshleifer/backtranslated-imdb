Fantastic film. One to upset all 5 senses. It is not a true historical report and not all information is to be considered factual information. The true Hollywood convention is used to play a list and very attractive actors such as "heroes" such as Naomi Watts, Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne), and uninteresting actors Geoffrey Rush play drunk and a corrupt victorian police force, which also instills a very unfair love story into a mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to attract all romance, women are particularly prone to them, even from the first scene where Ned puts a fat youth on drowning his father called him "sunshine" and had a "flash in his eye when he looked at me, a hand on my shoulder", it's very romanticized and convincing the viewers to the side of Nedel Kelly, the underdog. In addition, not all Aussie lovers non-cardinals?
