From what I read, this movie was disappointed by a lot of people, compared to part 1. Originally I understood it, but after a little thinking I think it's wrong. Soderbergh continues his story, which tells of Che's life that he began in part 1. Part 1 narrated the story of the revolution, ranging from unprecedented beginnings to finally successful conclusion. Part 2 tells the story of the revolution, ranging from unthinking beginnings to a totally unsuccessful conclusion. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these two parts of Chee's life have completely different results. Definitely he decided to say both fairly straightforwardly. The viewer can feel much better when he comes out of the cinema on Part 1 than in the second part, but that's the reality of Che's life and not, in my opinion, a director's mistake. The film is far from perfect. It's probably too long. At least in part 1, we saw different aspects of the war because the guerrillas had successes. In part 2 they can not break a break and see that their number is constantly reduced by death and capture. Che capture and death are solved well. The film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue being in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is once again great as a charismatic Argentine. So if you've seen part 1, you'll see a very similar narrative about a very different story in part 2.
