I was bleeding again introduced Battlestar Galactica, a show that always guessed me and brought me tears more than once. Experienced sci-fi fan, I like to think I can pick good stuff from BS, and that was good stuff. So, when I first heard about the prospects of a series of predecessors a few months ago, I got a sick feeling in my gut. I was afraid that the formula that made Battlestar so successful would be used again in Caprice, which would not work at all. The story of the BSG, about the sad group of survivors who were imprisoned on board devastating star ships and led by prophetic vision and a series of pseudo-miracles, was perfectly complemented by extraordinary music and better actors. Caprica feels different. Where BSG takes place after the collapse of a great civilization, Caprica portrays this civilization in its cold and decadent bloom. The overall atmosphere I received from Caprica was similar to that in the Minority Report, minus excessive and counterproductive theatricality. In the real form of BSG, Caprica, in the first few hours of programming, has already solved issues of religious freedom, racism, the morals of God's playing, and the nature of the human soul. Casting for Caprica is also excellent. Each character is unique and deep - from an obsessive and distant scientist - to an up-and-coming entrepreneur to his restless and deliberate daughter - every actress and actress plunges into their roles. The music that was used so heavily in BSG also plays a significant role in Caprica. Powerful rolling drums and sad Battlestar ducats served very well. Caprica uses more orchestral sound that gives the show its own feeling quite different from one of its predecessors. <br /> <br /> New Caprica is definitely a show of its own, pulling out of the Battlestar series just as much as it needs. I look forward to the whole series.
