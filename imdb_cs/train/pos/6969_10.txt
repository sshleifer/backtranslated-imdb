First of all, it's a great series, though we have some James Bond effect. I mean, while the new Casino Royale takes place in 2006, it's the first adventure dating from 007, Dr. No (1962) is the second, while in Golden Eye is the first film with Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench as a new substitute for the men "M", as it could be in place at the beginning before Bond became a double 0, that he is apparently 14 years older? This is more or less a "poetic" license that has excitement. We have to turn a bit if we want to have fun. No, the new Star Trek movie does not contain any primitive electronics of the original series ever since almost a century ago. In the 1960s, communicators were fantasy. (now we call them cell phones) and instead of the buttons they were sliding levers. OMG, do you think that in 400 years could Rogaine perfect for Jean-Luc Picard? So, let's give the producers some freedom. But try to do some things, just think about creating the Cylons just 60 years before the end of the Battlestar Galactica game. If so, where did all the Cylons from where the native country originated? We know that technology exists for spontaneous jumps across the universe. Well, what happened if one of Cyclone's ships was fired in a Caprico fleet war, or there was a sunspot or whatever, and a ship loaded with human Cylons that rose not only through the universe, but in time, back in a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled boat near Earth One. They colonized it, found it to be restored and eventually destroyed, but not before they sent a fleet of ragtag to search for the legendary Capricorn to find the habitable but unpopulated planet they colonized to become humans, who eventually invented the Cylons. Time paradox? Of course. Who came first, chicken or road? Who cares? It is funny!
