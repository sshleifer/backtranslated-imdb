A young woman who is a successful model and is also employed to marry and twice attempted suicide is selected by a secret and remote association of Catholic priests to become another "guard" to the gate of hell apparently undergoing scary old, but well-kept residence in Brooklyn. Its tenants will take the stairs and reincarnate, but they can not escape until the policeman blocks the way there. The previous one (John Carradine) is probably dead, so with fate or anything else, and the convicted must get her to kill her to be free. A lot of interesting details lie under the surface, her relationship to her father, stories about the convict, her fianc√©, so it can be translated as cheap scared horrors, but due to the ensembles, the great cast and the overall level of bizarre, it is definitely worth seeing.
