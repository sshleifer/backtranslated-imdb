This very special setting of Wagner's last opera has certainly grown on me. When I saw it for the first time, many of my surrealist films were somewhat angry, and I felt there was too much about the story. However, if you can cope with a lot of rehearsals of "tricks," I think you will find that the DOES movie can capture the very strange, other secular atmosphere of the opera, and that there are moments that are especially cool. Personally, I never understood the role of Kundry until I saw how Edith Clever described it. Her performance (Yvonne Minton's lip-synchronized mime singing voice) is nothing but glamorous, from end to end, and she justifies the hours it takes to absorb the film. Another reason for the pleasure of this film is that it captures Robert Lloyd's magnificent interpretation of Gurnemand's crucial role played by Lloyd on sharp opera houses around the world. I was privileged to have used him a few times as Gurnemand on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera, and the warmness of his voice and the warm paternality of his interpretation of this noble figure really needed to be preserved, as well as his performance in two main monologue figures, the Karfreitag scene and the narration of the prophecy in the act 1. The version I saw was a videotape for America, so there were subtitles that, unfortunately, could not be removed. This is particularly unfortunate because the translation used is very inaccurate and enforces an extremely Christian interpretation on a film that already forces the layers of interpretation into opera. It seemed to me that it was totally in contradiction with both Wagner's clear REDUCTION of Christianity and his very deliberate attempt to "generalize" the Christian elements of the story. (See the footnote on the side of the spoiler at the end of this report.) It seems almost impossible for me to avoid absorbing the subtitle movie, and I strongly recommend that if you have the option to disable subtitles in DVD versions, that's how you do it , and instead, if the opera is unknown, you read the libretto carefully in advance. As a result, there's a lot I do not like in the movie, and how soon I saw it doing differently ... but my estimates are constantly rising over the years since I saw them for the first time, and I found out enjoyed it again and again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> </ span> </ span> <br /> <span style = "font-style: italic; This is translated into headlines for reasons that escape me like "I saw the Savior's face". It is particularly irritating to me because in the libretto, Wagner very deliberately and carefully refers to this invisible character, which must not be a biblical Jesus like "der Heiland," the German for "The Healer" - a link to the Amfort wound and all the wounds and diseases and healing needs.
