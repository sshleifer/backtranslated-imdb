I just want to say that I'm so glad that somebody finally beans the beans on this movie. Bravo "Spaz", Bravo! This film is a ridiculous movie farce. Especially for student film! I just want to give Spazzo the impression that you have taken an unreasonable amount of time to find such a rare picture and then take care of it! Most people I know do not have the time, especially so few people end up reading. Kudos sir! In any case, the film follows a thin story that is the least incredible and simply stupid. I understand the idea that I created the satire of Charlie's angels, but why hire such horrific actresses! Also, what the director himself acted, wrote, produced and also edited the picture! Choose one job and put all your love in it! It's such a pity, because I heard he shot a good movie about a toothbrush. Again, thanks to Spazz for pulling out the curtain of this movie, people like you are a rare find.
