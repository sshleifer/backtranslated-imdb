This short film inspired by Spatula Madness is a cheerful piece that claims that more cartoon characters are produced by more writers. In a short film, Edward Spatula, who fired from work, joins the fight against evil. This assumption allows some fun content at the beginning, but for the rest is barely present. The 15 minute course of this film is absorbed by some magic sphere and a small musical number. Unfortunately, there is nothing else. A planned plot does not have time to show up. But it certainly watches it happening better than many highly prized Hollywood films. This movie is worth watching at least a few times. Take it for what it is and do not expect a deep story.
