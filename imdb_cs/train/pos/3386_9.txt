Is it the future that awaits us? A crowded, unbearable wasteland with a hell, unwanted existence? This movie brings us a problem that is still frightening for us since the movie was released back in 1973. Let's hope the world does not end there ... <br /> <br /> Soylent Green is a wild movie, which I liked very much. He had sympathetic characters, a semi-apocalyptic environment, a convincing and thoughtful tale and macho est macho man: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the film a very unpleasant, dirty feel. You are almost obstructed by the smell of the city and its dirty inhabitants. The characters are beautiful. Charleton Heston, who has become one of my favorite actors, is Thorn. This guy created this role as a bad, yet sympathetic, tough guy. I could definitely get into Thorn's shoes. He sees something is wrong but everyone around him either does not listen (rather than listen to pay) or wants to die. Edward G. Robinson (in his latest film R.I.P.) plays the dear old Sola, who has enough to do this unpleasant place. Everyone else is great, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a piece of "furniture" that comes with the apartment he lives in. The special effects are fantastic even for the year 1973. Soylent Green Factory, futuristic flats and especially "shovels" (bulldozers that get rid of people) were excellent. The contaminated external air looks disgusting and very ugly. Empty urban streets full of nasty and crippled people are very worrying. One last note is the end that still shocked me. It's scary, but if you think about it, it's a pretty good idea. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
