I saw that this film is dependent on Jane Austen, and she always has doubts about the cinematic rendering of the complexity of her novels: Well, this transposition is just accurate, intelligent, delicate, cautious, tactful, vivid, intense, br /> "Emma" is one of the most appealing and interesting novels of Austen, thanks to all the ironic penetrating situations and characters. The film respected this delicate irony without ignoring comics (especially Miss Bates). What interests me in the novel and the film clearly describes it is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the English writer and the modern look with which women, men and their relationship are treated, and it is stunning to think of a woman, a 18th century writer, who lived almost lonely life, could grasp the depth and truth of life like her: what most of me and still fascinates. We feel this modernity in the whole movie: just replace the costumes and use the actual language, but the situations, feelings, thoughts would be incredibly modern. I think of morbid interest in the lives of other people or what suggests envy, which now governs in any way women's relationships, and still has difficulty in revealing and expressing their feelings, especially love: every situation becomes universal and out-of-school, time value. <br /> <br /> The cast is really talented and offers very good and extremely brilliant performances: the young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suited to this role (today she would be probably mature), Toni Colette is just great. And how I envied them for the beautiful clothes they could wear! And then the breathtaking English landscape, where every situation has such a magical and dreamlike appearance ... a really pleasant and deserving film.
