And, the 1970s. The time when it was to be exchanged. To be honest, today is also a good time to be a writer, but it felt much more daring. <br /> <br /> Joe Sarno offers a pretty good soft-core movie. In fact, just as today, some actors are famous hardcore actors. Unlike today, these people were good actors and these films had plot and character development. It's quite what you'd expect from a swinger movie. Two couples with open relationships are again provoking the MILF wandering of one of the women who came to visit. It's not much more. <br /> <br /> Of course, when MILF is Jennifer Welles, it's another story. Not too many 40s look like a delicious wedding as Mrs. Welles. It's worth the price when I see that Mrs. Welles looks at the mirror as if it were Aphrodite. She is not "Stifler's Mom". It's much sexier. <br /> <br /> I also kicked Annie Chris Jordan. Jordan looks and sounds just like Elaine Joyce that I thought her twins could be "separated at birth" or even Elaine herself. Anna is always eating, but he must have an incredible metabolism. Unlike soft-core pornography from 1990, 70th softie porn has preserved the realism of the hardcore film (something the soft core of 2000 brought back, instead of 90s music and preserved orgasms) and is here in full force. It's not true, but it's true. For those who liked Quebec, produced "Deux Femmes En Or", you will enjoy. Another classic movie on Drive-In Classics, the best $ 2.50 CAN per month you can spend.
