The True Story of the Real Revolution, April 25; Revolution against the repressive regime of 41 years, which imposed a colonial war on his army, to maintain the empire (Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cabo Verde, S. Tom√© e Principe, the first and last of the great colonial empire of Europe) in the conquest of Ceuta in 1415; the Revolution of the Army for the People and for Democratic Portugal; the most surprising fact in this revolution is that there were no people (except those who died in the hands of PIDE, political police of the state during a brutal shooting against an unarmed mob protesting against its headquarters on the day of the revolution, April 25, 1974, is show it on the film). And all the revolutions are heroes, one of them being Captain Salgueiro Maia, a soldier returned from the war, whose conviction, along with the rest of the army, that they have been fighting hopelessly since 1961, and that a soldier must sometimes disobey his country.
