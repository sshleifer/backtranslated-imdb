Well, I hated to comment on this thing first, but I felt I had to face this movie. So many people hurt her and I felt that people who wanted to see should get a second opinion. First, Bend It Like Beckham is not intended as the deepest film of the century. If that's what you're looking for, go somewhere else. Just because it is an independent film does not mean it has to be artistic. You should feel good and you should have fun when you look at it and the two things are well done. Secondly, acting, though "Halle Berry in Monster's Ball" is still good. The film does not have to be so honest, so do not look at it. It's a family movie. If you wanted to, you should not even look into this movie honestly. Eventually it has a really cute story. I think it's well thought out and fun to watch. It's also very true for life for most of this culture, so if you want to sit down and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good when you're done. If you're looking for something with deep reflections on landscapes and big dramatic scenes, it's not for you. <br /> <br /> -Lyndsay
