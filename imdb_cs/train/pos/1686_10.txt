After a long hard week at the table that makes all the breakthroughs, this movie is a great way to relax. Just like Wells and the original radio broadcast, this movie takes you to a land of humor and sci-fi paraday. "Captain Zippo died in a big charge from Buick, he was a brave man." Jack Nicholson's impressions shine through this alien face with dark sunglasses and leather cloak. And always remember the "donut of death!" Keep in mind the Rule One of this film - Breaking Mistrust - Sit down and Relax - and "Prepare to Die Earth!" You have to see it for yourself.
