I very much apologize for the people who go to films with a pad and a pencil to write down mistakes and keep notes about how bad a movie is. I feel just as contemptuous for the people who go to the movies and DO NOT LOOK TO stop the reality and / or leave 90 minutes from my boring or busy life! Get people GRIP. ECGTB is a very fun movie. If I take the movies seriously, it's not for you. If you expect the movie to remind you of ANYWHERE, it's not for you. But if you like the absolute joy of Priscilla the Queen of Desert or "what the hell I'm watching" Moulin Rouge. Or a rough comedy "The Sweetest Thing" Then let yourself run into the Cowgirls. It has some really funny parts. Merrily. It also has really good music, kudos k kd.lang. I also mentioned that he has 90 minutes Uma Thurman ..... do I need to say more?
