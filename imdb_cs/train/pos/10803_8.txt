I do not understand. I'm not a critic, I'm not evaluating the quality of acting that I think is a good thing. My confusion lies in content. There is no other person sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women justified their infidelity to the men who fought and blew to guarantee the lasting freedom of their families and their country. Should the prologue not tell us if the men got home and if so, what influence do they have on their fraudulent "wives"? While these women were leaning on their paramours from the feeling of loneliness, they thought their husbands were looking forward to being shot dead in the face of death or disintegration daily? They did not even mean their husband! Only yourself. Excuse me, except for losing their husbands dead.
