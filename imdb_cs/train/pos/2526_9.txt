It's amazing! In the fashion storyline you switch from punk to pro. You have to finish goals that include skating, riding and walking. You create your own skater and give him a name and you can look stupid or realistic. You are with your boyfriend Eric during the game until he betrays you and you get the start from the skateboard team (you can choose the team to be on) and then set up your own team! There are many levels like New Jersey, Manhattan, and even School II (but not part of the fashion story) from Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2. You can unlock secret skaters like Iron Man, Gene Simmons and another skater. You can create your own goals like SKATE, COMBO, Tricktris, Gap, and much more. You can create a pedestrian target and write down what he is talking about. If you are bored, you can perform pre-targets in premade parks. The only thing I did not like in this game was that it was sometimes difficult to drive cars. 9/10.
