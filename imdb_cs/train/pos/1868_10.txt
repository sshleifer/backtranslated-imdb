This film describes the life of someone who grew up in the worst circumstances, but unlike many people who really grew up to be decent people. What's more, it's a real story. Antwone Fisher is so innocent, and yet he was abused because he was not white. Antwone Fisher has been married to the same women for ten years, and has never been to women, coke, cigars, weeds, alcohol or any of the things that are very popular in the places where he grew up. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say about this movie, it's great. The only rating I can give is 10/10.
