It has some great stains, but the length of the film can not keep a thin fence. They are more sailors on the beach, zippier than Astaire's 'Follow the Fleet' but not as good as 'On The Town'. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Grayson is loud, but Kelly and Sinatra work well. Their number "If you know Susie" is funny when they make a song as they sing. "I've begged her," is also fun with Sinatra, which shows how he is a henchman. The Sinatro solos of the song are boring and seem to be inserted to perform their singing rather than as part of the story. Fortunately, there are supporting actors such as Grady Sutton, Rags Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton, and the unlikely but unthinkable Jos√© Iturbi as he himself to watch one. Kelly is the star of the film, although the third is billed and it's interesting to see how he meets the kids, which Astaire has never done. Dean Stockwell plays a child who wants to be in the navy and is committed to Kelly's character. He also attends a school that allows him to tell children a fictional story about life in the (#) Navy that leads to his wonderful dance with the animated mouse Jerry. In another scene, Dance's charming Mexican hat dances with dirty face Sharon McManus, who is stunning and sweet. <br /> <br /> Very nice, but a little too long. Tasting better musicals.
