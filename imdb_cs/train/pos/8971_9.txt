Generally, I'm not a stop-shop fan and RUKA did not catch my attention first. However, we knew that this film originated in repressive Czechoslovakia during the period of Soviet domination, the more I watched the film, the more I realized how subversive that innocent little movie is. This podtext really made the film a revival and gave it a real stop as a work of art and a political statement. The sad little movie happens without any dialogue, but it is quite clear what is happening. Cute small wooden man makes clay pots and has a beautiful time when a disturbing animated hand suddenly appears and destroys the pot - it instead becomes a statue of a hand. Well, a wooden man is trying and pushing his hand again and again to do his own thing. Over time, however, the hand becomes more and more urgent, and eventually the man's cage. And finally, thanks to the stirring hands, the man is dead and the hand, in the sign of true hypocrisy, gives the hero a funeral! <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is an obvious attempt by the brave Jir√≠ Trnka to criticize his ruling government. It is no surprise that the Czechs loved this film and gave it critical praise, the state (ie the Hand) forbade this small parable. Sadly, Trnka did not live to see his nation liberated more than two decades later during the so-called "Velvet Revolution."
