Kurosawa, fresh in color, loses sight of his usual topics of truth and perception of reality and decides for a depressed takeover Thursday in Tokyo. Kurosawa stretches into a style that I think is the opposite - that is, I feel like Kurosawa wants to make a picture of Oza. Poorly moving, poorly conceived, this film is a rare mud in this author's excellent work. While Ikiru, despite being secular and depressing, was still interesting and well, and while Stray Dog depicted the slums and social poverty of Japan without being too heavy and boring, he despair a day has all the darkness that can be expected of his contents without any of redeeming the qualities of the previous Kurosawa pictures. <br /> <br /> Be warned, it's not a movie that Kurosawa should judge.
