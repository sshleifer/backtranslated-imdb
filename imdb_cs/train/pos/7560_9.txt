Starfucker (who reads Starstruck on my box) was the most amazing movie I've ever seen. I thought it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. So why not 10? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why he is one of my favorite actors in this very interesting view of the darker side of Hollywood. I forced a few more to watch the film and everyone agreed that it was an excellent movie.
