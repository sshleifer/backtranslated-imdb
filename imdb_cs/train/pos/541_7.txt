as a sequel, it's not a bad movie.i actually liked it better than the first one.I found it more fun.it looked as if it was a documentary style shot.at At first it bothered me as I thought it just looked too low budget.but it grew at me and it made the film look more authentic. This film has more dry one inlay than the original, which is a good thing, in my opinion. i think sometimes they went a bit over the top with some scenes and characters . It's almost becoming a parody of itself, which can be a point.This movie at least has some tension that did not first, according to my view.it has some of the same great music from the original, which is great. Again, he was quite decent, even though I said he thought it was over the top. I also felt that the movie is losing a lot of impulse to the end and there are a couple of minutes that seem really slow and just does not seem as much as the rest of the film. Everything, though, I thought it was a nice sequel. for "Return to the cabin by the lake" is 7/10 *
