There are a few films that seem to provide background as well as realism. If you have ever considered the role of Sniper in the modern war, look at this. <br /> <br /> I just loved a scene where hundreds of soldiers shot in the jungle, nobody was quite sure where the shooting took place? And they have grown one scene into Saving Private Ryan, so they have some merit in the scene. <br /> <br />
