This is a pretty blunt movie. A good show with realistic performances, especially very good from the movie Depardieu as cad and bad boy with realistic moods and art-house connotations all over, fails because the director has no opinion, stand or critical comment on the subject he sets. One of France's venerable and regular collaborators on Depardie movies - I believe that together 7 - Pialat does not deal. It seems to be a treatise on why women fall for an evil boy who will hurt when they have a prepared caregiver and a good man. Isabelle Hupert, who plays a distinguished philanthropist, offers answers to contempt as "I do not know"; "I love his arms"; "I like the way she loves" with her curious husband trying to kick her out of the house, but she stiffens and reconsiders because ... I suppose he loves her. So she accepts and hopes, is not she? That she wakes up once and comes to its meaning. Things like this are not answered in the crazy documentary drama Pialat with long speeches and even longer scenes that are not added. I know they do not add answers, but please get out. Jules et Jim, it's not. The ultimate shot, like the movie we just watched, is pain and headache just for the most courageous.
