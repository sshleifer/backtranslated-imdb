I saw Saving Grace right after it came out on the video. Since then she has become one of my favorites! The story is not particularly complicated, but it does not spoil the fun. It's a chuck full of comic moments and a very good quality. Characters are what makes the movie so good. Each of them has its own special features that contribute to humor, the two old ladies who play Linda Kerr Scott and Phyllida Law, jump. Excellent acting has been done by everyone, especially Brenda Blythen. She and Craig Ferguson were great when they pulled away some of the funniest moments. If you are looking for a good comedy, I would definitely recommend this movie!
