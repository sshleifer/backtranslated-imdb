This is an excellent and fast thriller Wes Craven (Nightmare on Elm Street), which rejects the supernatural after 85 minutes and makes us even more terrifying - the evil of human beings. We're much more likely to meet Jackson Rippner's favors than Freddy Kruger, and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) is doing a great job featuring a social, friendly, even charismatic assassin. The performance of Murphy and Rachel McAdams (Claire of The Wedding Crashers) are great. Most of the film takes place at a very intimate level, between two people, their eyes and their faces. This is a small scale action, not a wide screen shot, and that is no less desirable for these limitations. Cinematography is nothing special, although of course you can do just as much with the camera at the passenger's borders, but the dialogue is great, the story taut. There are no distractions, no subplots do not confuse a problem that is in his heart a struggle among the main characters. By keeping his focus and avoiding distractions, Wes Craven can take what is a very minimal conspiracy and turn it into an exciting, fast-paced action thriller.
