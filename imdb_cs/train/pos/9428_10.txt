One of my favorite films begins as an adventure across the wild side of the four men team from Atlanta. The idea of ​​living the Chulawasse River before it became a lake comes from Lewis Burt Reynold, who subconsciously drowns his men in his worst nightmare. But if the first half of the film seems to be more like an action film, the other half transmits the viewer to a totally different story, and our men are forced to make a decision that (they know) will change their lives forever. In very bad ways. At the end of the film, every person will be forced to cope with the scars of what was to be on the river by the end of the week, but fought for subsistence. The film (except some obvious goofs) is very well managed and beautifully shot in the paradise of nature that steals your breath. Photography is also excellent. Voight, Reynolds, Cox, and Beatty are excellent when they show how one event can destroy four different lives in different ways that are only associated with the same error.
