This movie came to me highly recommended by Matt Groening. Actually, I watched both The Simpsons and Futurama, and that's what I mentioned in both, so I thought "what the hell." The film brings home some "what if" that will tell you how happy we are today, when we take it for granted as a simple soap and water. Interestingly, in 2022, men still stick with a single cutting edge! Nice that the responsible people did not load the film with unnecessary special effects, ray, etc. Some nice looking furniture as soon as you find out what it means. Keep in mind that "Tuesday is Soylent Green Day"
