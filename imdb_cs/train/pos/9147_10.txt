As a big fan of Prince for the last three to four years, I really can not believe I just got to watch the "Purple Rain". The brand new 2-disc Anniversary Special Edition brought me to buy. Wow, I'm really looking forward to seeing it, but I was not ready for what it was like. Prince's musical performances throughout the film are nothing surprising - he really has moves in this. I am very familiar with the classic "Purple Rain" album and all of its songs, but seeing them in the context of the movie completely changes your perception of melodies and lyrics - for example, COMPUTER BLUE, THE BEAUTIFUL ONES, WHEN COMPLETE THE CROPS AND THE PURPLE RAIN ONLY. There's something inexpressibly hypnotizing about the scenes where Prince and The Revolution are playing. The final songs of BABY JSEM STAR and I would try to show how much energy and utter talent the prince began in the middle of the 20's (overcrowded!), That threw me away. Even Michael Jackson seems to be inactive even in his top years. The prince will show you how to earn the girl of your dreams - take her to the lake, make her jump, then go away - a totally funny thing in retrosight. Some scenes are very eighties and inadvertently cheerful, but it adds to the whole magic of the movie. Morris Day is the smartest cat on the block (and cheerful) and when his band The Time performs THE BIRD, you get to Morris Day and Jerome Benton lights up on the Minneapolis-style funk - I love their dance in this bit and how Benton provides Morris with mirror medium power. I can not wait to see again, I really can not! Extras are amazing - especially when they see young Eddie Murphy in front of Beverly Hills Cop, admitting he is "Prince of the Groupie".
