Ladislas Starewicz's curiosity about insects and cinema is embedded in a short film about a love triangle between Mr. Beetle, Artist Grasshopper and Mrs. Beetle. The fairly simple story of a couple of adulterous beetles, who both seeks out of their marriage, is similar to Biograph or Vitagraph briefly. Starewicz's story is based on the use of embalmed beetles with wires that straighten legs in animation by frame. The story builds when Mr. Beetle unknowingly captured a dragonfly camera from a local night club with jealous kites. When Mr. Beetle returns home and finds his wife in the arms of her artistic friend, he chases her angrily, but eventually forgives her and takes her out to see the movie. But Mrs. Beetle soon learns of her husband's infidelity as the movie they are watching, and that's the miraculous bridge of Beetle singer and dragonflies together. Mrs. Beetle smashes Mr. Beetle with his umbrella, Mr. Beetle jumps across the screen and both ends up in jail after the projector they destroyed. The insects are placed in a humanized environment, such as a house or a night club, and are given the human qualities of jealousy, anger, lust, and vengeance. Insect characters carry briefcases, drive motorbikes, and even wear boots, shaking their antennas and opening and closing their mandibles like real insects. The novel of the story does not release itself, even after several views, but as fluid as the moves, the film moves slowly. Action is happening with complicated details, but the process is losing speed and faster shooting. Despite its pace, the film is an excellent example of early puppetry in Starewicz and is highly recommended.
