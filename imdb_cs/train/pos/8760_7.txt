It's refreshing to see a movie that you think will end up happily like just about every other American movie, and then it'll surprise you when it does not happen. I like happy ending like any other guy, but sometimes it's better to draw things realistically and I thought Brokedown Palace did it very well. Ending up with one friend basically sacrificing yourself after another, and so to redeem her earlier bad behavior that puts her in the first place was very moving. I would almost have done it without the last line that proved she did not actually do the deeds she admitted because it would be more about the friendship between the two girls and less about the crime. Whether it did or did not, it was not so important. The story itself clung to the clich√©, but the actresses paid attention to their excellent performances. Very realistic, very compelling. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10.
