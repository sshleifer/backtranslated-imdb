It's a wonderful movie ... The first impressions of cynicism and eagerness will soon be scattered with fun loving depiction of how different motives of men and women differ (Vive la difference!) You can love people despite and sometimes for their weaknesses. Human beings are really a bit of garbage, but we have a great heart and try our best, despite the temptation. It is not our fault when one can not resist temptation, it is who we are. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end there is a consistent style. crisp shot and sharpness of composition, very enjoyable tracking when adding provocative content, well-fitting music and laughing loud scripting. Watch out for the very young "lonely wise voice" ... brilliant; the wisdom of innocence balancing comedy from a human condition.
