I rarely see a movie that I am completely interested in; it was one of them. It was a good deal, a dialogue, a conspiracy, and the landscape was beautiful. Several times I laughed loudly, especially the scene about the kitchen raid. A terrible comedy made by a hand that hired a wand gave me one floor, but I admit that I was a thicket hunter. The story dealt with groups of people in their 30s who were returning to the summer camp they attended 20 years ago. It was a good week of camping, because the place was permanently closed at the end of the season. As an adult, the camp looked different and felt differently and with each other. I recommend this fun, moving movie to everyone. <br /> <br />
