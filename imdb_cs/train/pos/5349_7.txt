Running Man is one of those films that, if exaggerated, would be boring and depressing even. My advice is to watch it once or twice a year with a couple of friends and a couple of drinks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In today's media climate, Media dominance and capitalist regime in society really work as a revisionist social commentary after the 1980s boom. Forget it! There are other great and better reasons to watch this movie. Schwarzenegger is in the top form of Ben "The Butcher of Bakersfield" Richards, and the incorporation of the Bond-strips of one liner was totally inspired-these are really legendary gifts (with his Killian booth over the main highlight camera). Stalkers' design is authentic American, and mirrors the characterization seen in the PC's' Gladiators' TV show, as well as the WWE. The terrible end of the Buzz-saws will reassure every viewer in the core (as a remark about why his death turns out to be particularly disturbing in what is a seemingly enthusiastic shareholder with a hot sense of humor?) <br /> Jesse Venturer and Sven Ole The Thorssen are great as supportive muscles (and they're real life reliefs), and even Micka Fleetwood in it! What more can you ask for? I highly recommend a running person if you are looking for a great piece of fun with a fine surface and some great characters. Just do not expect education from it (at least on average). Quality, I really love it. You will be too much until you are pulled. 7/10
