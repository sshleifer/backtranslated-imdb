I hate to read reviews that say something like: "Do not waste time, this movie has thrown on ice." It does that for the reviewer for me, it may have some naive magic. If you like other Whistler movies, this will be observable. If you like 40s of Noir films, this will be observable. This film is not, in my view, as good as any of the earlier series that played Richard Dix as a hero. It's much slower and the plot is pretty. You have seen this same narrative device that was used in many other movies, and usually better. But acting is good as well as lighting and dialogue. It's just a lack of energy and you'll probably find out exactly what's going on and how it all will come out in the end, not more than a quarter of the passage. <br /> <br /> The 'Whistler' series is semi-noir, and there is character, mood, lighting, camera movement and angles are more important than the story itself. But this movie is noir. It's too low weight and Hollywood for it innocent. Neither the character of Richard Dix nor his ladies from previous films has finished. You never knew it until the end. But I still recommend it at least for one view. I looked at myself at least twice and got both rewards.
