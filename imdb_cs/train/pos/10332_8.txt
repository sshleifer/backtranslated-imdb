Wilhelm Grimm (Alexander Knox) ​​is the judge for Nazi crimes. Three witnesses give evidence - Father Warecki (Henry Travers), Wilhelm's brother Karl (Erik Rolf) and Wilhelmina's former Marja Hunt - before Wilhelm speaks in his own defense. The film ends in a summary of the court .... The film is narrated in three memorial segments, each of the witnesses standing on a stand. The story is mostly located in a small Polish village, and unforgettable scenes include the village's reaction to the death of Anne (Shirley Mills), which Wilhelm is accused of being raped; the treatment of Jewish villagers preparing to move to concentration camps; and a church service where Willie Grimm (Richard Crane) condemns his Nazi upbringing while mourning for his girlfriend, Janina (Dorothy Morris), Marj's daughter after being shot on a brothel. Knox is rude and is very convincing like a bitter, nasty and evil man. Martha Hunt has several strong moments and struggles with her, and Henry Travers is also very good in his role as a priest. This movie brings an effective story that will stay with you after it's finished.
