Like Streetcar Named Desire (also directed by Gadga both on stage and on canvas), Panic In The Streets depicts New Orleans in which his main claim to fame - the birthplace of Jazz - does not even mention it. It was Richard Widmarch's seventh film, and he was probably going a long way to becoming a handsome actor who was really just a psychotic killer. Gadg himself appears in an incomparable small role as a morgue, but the film is rich in talent beginning with Jack Palance (still being billed as Walter Jack Palance) while local Mr. Big followed alongside Zero Mostel, Barbara Bel Geddes, Emile Meyer, Tommy Rettig plus rock-solid sometimes reliable Paul Douglas as a policeman who comes to doc doc Widmark's opinion. It's a very enriching film, which is more of a lot to see. Catch it if you can.
