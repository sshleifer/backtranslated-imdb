First of all, nobody can understand why this movie is rated so badly. Not only is this really the first really horrible movie because I was a very long time, which I was quite hardly boasting with a decade of experience in horror as a child in dark rides. Secondly, Cheri Christian's main actor has a face that will allow you to hope that he will be the lead leading actress in the big photos of the future. Thirdly, this woman is so beautiful that I suggest that the directors leave all those Cameron Diaz, Eva Mendezes and how the names of these passing light bulbs are. Miss Christian is not light but the sun. However, "dark remnants" also have a significant metaphysical significance. They believe that the photographs illustrate the creation of a mediator between reality and "imaginations" that are not visible in their own eyes is not new. But I have never seen in the movie that these creatures are visible in the photographs only for certain people and only for certain times. This means that photography is not just an iconic picture of reality (which turns reality into a sign), but it becomes an alternative to a form of reality that can change as a "real" reality. As a sign, changing the image means that it affects the photographed objects, ie the character acts as an object. In our usual world of perception, it is common for objects to change characters. F.ex., If someone is growing a bird, his photographs show him a beard, not without, just like before. Conversely, changing objects according to signs would mean that the bearded photographs are the first, and then the beard grows. That is, in very simple terms, the case that happens with the photographs taken by the main character in prison, in this film. This is new and we have to be grateful for everything new to horror films that usually repeat and regroup the effects and features that are already well known, mostly from silent times.
