hello .. I consider Just Cause one of my favorite films by Sean Connery, it's a tense psychological thriller with excellent acting out of acting, especially Connery .. it also has one of the best lines I've seen in movies so the dialogue is pretty good in this .. She also has one of the best scenes in movies when when Sean interviews with Ed Harris figure in jail is just fantastic .. I really liked it and I can not recommend it enough, really do not miss this! Do not pay attention to the negative reviews that say that the last 30 minutes is dying, it was as intense as the rest of the film, it really seems to me that it's really a fun movie Just Cause ..
