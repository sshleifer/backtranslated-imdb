TRICK or TREAT is a great example of Hollywood jumping on metal music returns that Tipper Gore and her Washington Wives have begun in the mid-eighties (other, less successful recordings in this mini genre include horrible BLACK ROSES and silly grenade). I was in high school for the second time when TRICK or TREAT came out and could not wait to see it. It seemed to disappear from videoconferences by the end of the 1980s, but in the end I picked up a copy of a DVD with a budget and nowadays brought plenty of pleasant metal memories. Any teenage villain might be involved in attempts at Eddie "Ragman" Weinbauer (Marc Price of "Family Ties") in this film because he is being chased by the "beautiful" people at high school for heavy metal fashions and musical tastes. Eddie's favorite rock star is Sammi Curr (who looks a lot like Tommy Lee of Motley Crue) who was previously killed in a hotel fire. Eddie is uncompromising until he gets a Sam's final, unreleased album from a radio DJ (Gene Simmons of Kiss in a Short Story). Eddie soon finds out that this LP, when played back, allows him to communicate with the undead spirit itself by Curr himself! Soon, Sammy gives Eddie advice on how to get his tortured ancestors, but when the news grows in scariness ("Waste'em ALL ... no fake metal!"), Eddie will try to destroy the album, which leads to He returns to life through Eddie's stereo speakers. Sam rises to a great dance at Eddie's gymnasium and takes the stage to break the crowd and break down some unfortunate "fake metals" before Eddie comes to save the day and girl of his dreams. (SIGH) No, it's not terribly frightening in 2006, not even in 1986, but TRICK OR THREAT is a movie that smiles in front of any metalman from the eighties and has a sound track of the cult band Fastway. Well, it's worth checking out if you've ever hit your head or wanted to introduce class B horror movies (or both, like me).
