Absolutely amazing drama and Ros is top ... I highly recommend this movie. Her performance was, in my opinion, an academic material! The only really sad fact is that Universal does not see the movie ever available in any video format, whether it be a cassette or a DVD. Ignore a very good movie. But Universal has little respect for the library on DVD, which is sad. If you can see it somewhere (you do not know why it's rarely even running on the cable), see it! I will not go into the story because I think most people would rather have a view of a movie and too many "reviewers" spend hours writing about a story that is available anywhere. <br /> <br /> 10!
