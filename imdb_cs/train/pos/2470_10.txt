After the initial shock that I realized it was the Branagh movie, I literally shook the excitement that I had this epic in front of me. I was not disappointed. So it is Shakespeare true and yet so accessible. That blown my mind. I've always liked seeing you, or rather listening, Branagh, and that's what I was thinking ... is this movie called in other countries? That would be like painting the mustaches on Mona Lisa.
