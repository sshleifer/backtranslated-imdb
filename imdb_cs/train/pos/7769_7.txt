Lauren Bacall lived through his wife Humphrey Bogart and died when she filmed this film. Rock Hudson was at the top of her star in 1950. Dorothy Malone is in excellent form and wins the Oscar for support. Robert Stack is nominated and falls short for his role. The story is a bit soapy from another time, but just as useful as most dramas. Wonderful how good drunks can be in this movie, and how quickly Stack culminates in several movies of early sequences. You will find out why cast is so good and really productive wise this movie is very good. You can say that Bacall is scattered during this film, while while her acting is fine, she looks emotionally exhausted in some sequences. Sexual links in this movie are so mild that many of today's young viewers would realize what they are. The film does a good job that tells the story and actually leaves the sequel to the end, although no one has ever been created - although Written Beyond The Wind would be a good title.
