I've always been a huge fanatical James Bond! I've seen almost all movies except Die Another Day and the world is not enough. Graphics for Everything or Nothing is breathtaking! Voice Talent ......... WOW! I love PIERCE BROSNAN! He is ultimately Bond in the video game! IS BOND! I enjoyed the past Bond games: Goldeneye, The World Is Not Enough, Agent Under Fire and Nightfire. This is definitely the best! And finally, Mr Brosnane (can I call him Mr Brosnan as a sign of respect? Yes, I can!) It was phenomenally exciting to hear in a video game ....... IN THE LAST TIME! DUH! I saw him with Robin Williams and let me tell you they are doing a great team. Pierce Brosnan is funny, badly nice (I mean in a bad way) and just one of those actor you want to go with and put your hands around and hug, saying, "Pierce Brosnan, thank you for James Bond," "If it were not for I do not know who James Bond is. "He's a great actor! I'm a huge fan of Willem Dafoe, even though I've seen him in several movies. His role as Nikolai Diaval was great. (I said the name of his name is correct?) LOL !!!! It does a great job of accent. Sometimes I do not hear any accent. I saw Willem, I think Mr. Dafoe, in two films: Find Nema and Spider-Man with your favorite actress: KIRSTEN DUNST! SHE IS GREAT! In any case, it never stops astonishing. And Richard Kiel, he certainly got part of Jaw's bones. I saw him in the movie and he is amazing! In fact, my grandfather met Mr. Kiel and I was jealous when they told me. But Kirsten Dunst is at the top of my list of Celebrities I want to meet. John Cleese was breathtaking. I have never seen a better person playing as a puzzle and the gadget is creating Q! Mr. Cleese was cheerful! I saw him working with Pierce Brosnan at Goldeneye and Tommorow Never Dies. He is amazing! John Clees' latest project is Shrek 2, starring Mike Myer, Cameron Diaz, Julie Andrew and Eddie Murphy. (Shrek 2 is now in the theater!) GOOD LUCK 007! Yeah, and as Q says alway: "Grow up 007!"
