There are 21 comments when I add my to this list and it is hardly a criticism. It's because this movie is amazing fun and has a bit of everything in it. <br /> <br /> It may be a little scary for younger children, but my 15 year old son thought it was fantastic in any way of action, humor, and even a beautiful musical score. I buy a DVD only when I know they will be regularly watched and now that it is finally available in the UK, I will certainly add to my collection.
