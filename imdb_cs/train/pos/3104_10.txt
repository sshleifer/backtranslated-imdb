This movie was great. I did not expect all the hype to do, but yes. Like all Bourne movies, action is fast, realistic and intense. If you enjoyed the other two movies in the trilogy, you will also be sorry. The filming of the film is straightforward and there are no conspiracies that are too unrealistic. Okay, Julia Stiles, who appeared in the Italian Vault House, has been so successful, especially after what has become supreme, but it makes sense that he is the only character in the "Treadstone" that Bourne knows he does not want to be dead and he could have the confidence and the only person who leads him in the right direction. The action is driven by signs and their reaction to what's happening all around. The thing I've always loved in Bourne's films is that Bourne can dig her butt, but when people are as good as people, it's a fight and they take a lot of damage. They never like idiots for audiences. <br /> <br /> All the actors were solid in their performances. I believe that Damon could play Bourne in his sleep and gains excellent support from Joan Allen, reflecting her superiority role, David Strathairn and Scott Glenn. I recommend this film and the trilogy. But I miss Frank Potente.
