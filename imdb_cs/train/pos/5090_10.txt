I loved this movie. Big story and actors and a good series of films. He told the story in a way I could easily understand and pay attention without sleeping. I would like to know where I could get the soundtrack. It's not worth it anywhere. Please send me an email if you know where I could get the soundtrack. Besides being unable to find a soundtrack, I thought the movie was fascinating. Swayze did a great job. I think this is one of his best works. His past movies were fine, but he really told the story of change. In history, it will become one of the best television movies ever broadcast. Congratulations to producers and writers for such great work.
