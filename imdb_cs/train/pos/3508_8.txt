Unbelievably interesting and compelling, I found it impossible to turn away as soon as I started to look. I'm usually one of the toughest critics, but for me this movie was just brilliant, weird, because it may sound like I almost feel the air and feel the texture of places. <br /> <br /> I thought cinematography was a great use of light and texture. From the orange glow of the summer light to the plastic curtain sofa, everyone had a clear air of realism for me. From the character's point of view, I thought Victor VARGAS's concept of almost glue that combined the story was quite inspired, each of the other members of the family with more complete backgrounds simply caused more intrigues in the main character itself. Besides, when someone knows like a grandmother and was at the beginning of such a situation I can say that the situation seems to be particularly realistic. This embarrassment, accent, cooking, and even to the remarks I felt were so authentic. I think this movie worked for me because I started looking at it without expectation and found it totally immersive and bringing memories of teen emotions a lot worth watching.
