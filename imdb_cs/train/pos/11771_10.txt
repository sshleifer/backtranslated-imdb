Great fun from start to finish. The amazing performance of Belushi, Beach, Dalton & Railsback. Some twists and many action scenes. The film was made for me! Funny lines in the script, good music. Dalton as a tough sheriff and Railsback as a "villain-villain". I have to recommend this movie to all fans of events and adventures! 10/10
