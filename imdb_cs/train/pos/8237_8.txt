For Life, why did this film get a rating R? While it's a meat zombie, believe it or not, it's a really good family-friendly film - at least if your kids are over 10 years old. Unlike traditional zombie films, this movie has an excellent sense of humor and traditional values ​​- though a little twisted! Language is not a serious problem, it's not nudity and the movie style is definitely aimed at kids (like the old television show "Eerie, Indiana") - but some guys played on R rating one! Believe me, most children see worse violence than this, and it seems stupid that the audience thinks it's an adult movie. The story is set in a world of parallel type. While fashions, cars, and morals appear around 1953, in this bizarre world a fierce recent zombie epidemic has emerged that has led to a "zombie war" and massive changes in everyday life. At school, children are trained in armed struggle, and in the movie, the father has a cute scene in which his father gives his son a gun and tells him to hold him in his backpack "just for the case"! When it comes to life outside school, it's quite strange, because people have learned that zombies are NOT that bad thing! Heck, using shocks and training, can be divided into slaves who can do housework, clean up the streets, deliver milk or, in the case of a really sick guy, be your "special friend". <br /> <br /> This film deals with one particular family who finally buys his first slave zombie (played by Billy Connally). Mom is excited and her son is slowly becoming a friend of a zombie. Dad, on the other hand, is not convinced - because he was forced years before to kill his father of the zombies and still did not get it! Funny, disrespectful and unique - this movie must be seen by a much wider audience.
