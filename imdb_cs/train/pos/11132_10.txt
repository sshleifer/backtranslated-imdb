Jon Voight plays a man named Joe. Joe shakes with a terrifying childhood. He has a great fear and hatred for religion because of his traumatic baptism. He leaves his job as a dishwasher and acts as a helper of wealthy people. He meets a misfortune named Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) and two for a relationship. They go out and work together to help each other. They become thieves. Two of them grow remarkably close, and soon they will not be able to live without themselves. However, it is very important that Ratso did not tell Joe, and could destroy any hope of surviving the city together. It's one of the biggest movies ever shot. It's a heartbreaking and broken portrait of too lonely men who have nothing to lose, but to each other. Their story is devastating to watch, but it's ultimately important for people to see. It's one of those movies where the characters are almost like the seemingly crazy people we sometimes find on the street. The difference is that this movie is from their point of view. Their lives are showing us, and it is devastating to see that pedestrians in this movie treated themselves like dirt, especially if we were one of those people. But the film does not blame. Instead, it shows you the rough aspects of a lifestyle hurry. It's not a pleasant and enjoyable lifestyle, like many Hollywood movies that portray it like milk and PRETTY WOMAN. The lifestyle of being a male impostor is a dirty, harsh and ugly life, and it is sad that people in this film have worsened as Joe's character. What attracted me most was that it came out in 1969 and was a perfect test of time. Today's audience will still make great sense in this movie and will like it and love it just as critics and audiences everywhere in 1969. The film was rated X but what I noticed about this film is that sexuality is displayed in a more sincere, more realistic and more efficient way. Anyone who has previously loved sex will know how humorous, unpleasant and frightening he may be, and this film must not be avoided. Gender in this movie may not be as graphical as it was in the past. Films that have been labeled X as MIDNIGHT COWBOY, CLOCK ORANGE, NEEDS, LAST TANGO in Paris and FRITZ THE CAT seem to be remarkably tame compared to the shocking things people can get today with the rating of R. Sexual scene at MIDNIGHT COWBOY they will seem rather strong, but they are definitely not sexy. They are not graphic but realistic, and that's what people should remember when they watch this movie. The course language used in the film, especially the word "fag", is effectively used and is not unreasonable. Violence is very shocking to be observed today, but again it is necessary for the plot to be portrayed by the world of the sweeper. I'm really glad to see that MIDNIGHT COWBOY is not dated and is still as impressive as in 1969, if not more. I can not recommend such a classic, and I hope it will continue to search for the audience, because it is really a very special and unforgettable experience that we will not soon forget. <br /> <br /> PROS: <br /> <br /> -Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are both buzzing and amazing to watch. He has never played such a role sooner or later and is quite different from the usual. You forget who plays them in minutes! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cons: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
