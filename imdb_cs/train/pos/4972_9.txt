LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first movie I saw in 2000 and I doubt I will see better this year. This beautiful tragicomedy by the Belgian filmmaker Benoît Mariage is located in the industrial wasteland of Wallonia. Benoît Poelvoorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car (Lada!) For him. To do this, the son must break the record door. What father actually wants his son to be, because he himself has never done it anymore as a local news reporter, ironically called L'Espoir (Hope). Naturally nothing works as planned. This film is best compared to Aki Kaurismäki DRIFTING CLOUDS, although it is more dramatic and humor is darker. As in this film, however, this tone is much more melancholic than depressed and eventually optimistic without being unrealistically happy. Humor is absurd, without making an unbelievable plot, and Mariage finds stunning images in an ugly environment that never seems artificial. The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is the acting of Poelvoorde. This actor fired with the famous cult-classic C'EST ARRIVÉ PRES DE CHEZ VOUS, in which the charismatic hitman Ben played. Since then, he has played only two small roles in films that have not been released in the Netherlands because, as he said in the interview, he was not convinced of his own abilities, and all the roles he was offered were reps of Ben. With his return to the lead role in the LCA, there should be no doubt that he would act. He's just as great as a man stupid and bad enough to hurt his family, but he was smart enough to realize what he did and to upset it. You must see.
