I could see an episode or two when the show originally broadcast but when I watched 1 episode on netflix I was also addicted. I watched the whole series in 2 days. :) I really liked Gary Cole character. First, he is credibly condemned, then you like the character ("These things have a thousand uses")! His folk Andy Griffith meets with Charles Manson meets Satan's great. Charming, charismatic, fragile and uh a little dangerous and "kind" I mean "really." I want to be like him when I grow up. Lucas Black is also great. The accents are also great. Anyway, I thought this was one of the best TV shows at all, and you owe it to seeing it.
