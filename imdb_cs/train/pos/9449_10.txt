I saw this movie in the morning when I was supposed to sleep. This in itself was a testimony that Deliverance is a magically binding film. I think Boorman did a great job doing this movie. How professional was the initial scene with mountain people and dueling banjos. It turned out so well and soon on how they are inherently reserved and simple people in the area. The cause at the point - near the end of the "duel", the banjo-playing boy smiled (loved his banjo), but when Drew tried to shake the boy for a "duel", the child was too reserved to answer. A trip along the river has never left you bored. The scene of the rape was brutal, but it has to be shown what the group got in this area of ​​Georgia. I think Beatty is a traumatic shock after he was well done. Some said he did not like it. I do not agree - if you really paid attention, he did not respond during the entire action that immediately followed, when Reynolds gave the attacker an arrow and they threw out a toothless guy. It was confusing when Ed later killed the other guy, on top of the cliff. It almost turned out that the arrow was shot while Ed was curled up and expected to die, but then you realize that the arrow he had shot before finally came into effect. Anyway, a great movie and I was against my votes 8 and 9, but after reading the message from the unhappy voter who gave him "1", I gave him "10". This individual reasoning seemed to be based on personal distortion and not on an objective point of view, and his voice was apparently an uncoordinated attempt to reduce rating.
