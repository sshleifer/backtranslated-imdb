It's such a movie that, if it were done today, it is likely to be played by Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant; Actually, now that I think about it, one day may be quite likely. It's nice, but without depth. He suffers from almost deadly James Stewart's breakdown in a role that is too old for about 20 years, and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful Kim Novak. Ernie Kov√°cs, in a small supporting role as an aspirant writer, is the only actor in a movie whose performance is close to what you might call a "joke." (** 1/2)
