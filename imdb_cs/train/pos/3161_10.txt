Actually, I did not start watching the show until I arrived at the FX. I was bored and had nothing to watch and saw that the show was premiered, so I decided to watch. I was so angry that I watched the show when it first broadcast on t.v. I loved the show so much! Eventually a show for everyone who enjoys. I remember the full house and family affairs and step by step and it was ok but it just was not fun. They will make stupid jokes and laugh at things that were just stupid, but not the 70th show. The seventies were cheerful, smart and so real. I think it was the best show I've ever done, and I'm very sorry it's over. Although I like this show, I think it should end in the seventh season when Eric and Kelso leave. The last season was not right, Eric was the main character and the show was about to end when his character left. I still enjoy this show and I hope the TV starts making more shows like this one.
