It was an excellent piece of a puppet series because this film showed all the series, from one to seven. And it was probably one woman trying to stop a new puppeteer because I would never have caught the puppets in pain. In addition, it turned out that some puppet masterpiece series I did not see and what I see as bad as the second part. It turned out that a Torch appears that can change things and people, which is cool, and showed the return of the puppet from the first part. It also showed some strangers from Part 4, who was also cool, showed other people episodes that could be good for them and did it. Thanks to this puppet master will be a big hit.
