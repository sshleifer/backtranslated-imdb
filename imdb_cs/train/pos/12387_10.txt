Of all the films of the 1970s, nobody was caught up in the brightest essence of a good battle compared to evil, as was the case with Sentinel. I mean, yes, there were films like Exorcist and others; but none of them captured the human element of such a protagonist. If you have time, check this option. You may not be able to get through the dated device as such, but it's a story that's worth getting into. Then there are all stars and early future stars. My absolute favorites were Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles and Burgess Meredith. Then there are the fine traces that lead to what is happening. Take good care. I had to watch her four times to make all the little weird statements like "black and white cat, black and white cake". Besides, books are really good. I'm just sorry they will not make the second book into the movie. It's so frightening to overcome this movie.
