Sidney Franklin "The Good Earth" gained classical status thanks to the timeless story and great acting, especially Luis Ranier, who won the Oscar for her O-Lan performance. Rainers' performance is so complete that it's almost unrecognizable. With very little dialogue throughout the film (and it's a long film), Rainer relies on the facial and body language. It looks and works for the Chinese so that anyone who is not familiar with her work can easily refute her. The film remains relevant today as it examines the story of rags and wealth and the universal themes that come with it. When Lung and O-Lan's wife finally reach financial success after years of famine and poverty, they find life full of property, but they do not make sense. Only after returning to the ground after battling the grasshopper (the special effects that are used to make them are still incredible and beautiful to be supervised) they will find the fulfillment again. The common formula with the unique perspective of the Chinese family (especially for 1937) makes the film a classic. Money is not worth anything without friends and family, which is the point that the movie perfect in the last 10 minutes with an emotionally closing conclusion.
