Although I did not like Stanley & Iris as a movie, I admired acting. Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are great in this movie. I am not always a fan of Fonda, but here it is both soft and strong. De Niro has the ability to make every role he portrays in actor's gold. He gives great performance in this movie and there is a great scene where he has to take his father home for the elderly because he can not care for him that will break your heart. I would not really like this film as great movie fun, but I will say that you will not see anything else than you would play anywhere else.
