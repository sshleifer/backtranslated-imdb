I was a kid ... crazy about Michael Jackson. His music, his dance ... He was and is the greatest of all time. A few days ago my friend gave me a gift .. "Moonwalker" DVD .. I just could not believe it! So I took the time and saw the movie again. After many years, he kicked me back in time. I almost cried. Not for Michael Jackson, but from good old times I remembered back then when I went to my concerts and enjoyed the music and the dance. The film gave me a different look than when I was a child. You can really see the parody that Michael has gone through with his life. Thank Michael Jackson to bring me back to the great times, to your great music and dance. It's a pity that these people have forgotten .. I did not do it because you gave me great moments with music .. All the best for you where you are out there ..
