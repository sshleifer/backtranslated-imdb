A personal note that said Pat Robertson is evil and his program is evil has nothing to compare with what is evil and just. His definition of evil is the opposite of evil. The Bible itself says that in the last days people will call good evil and evil good! He does not even know he has fulfilled the Bible prophecy! If you do not know God and refuse to recognize him, it is all right. He still loves you, but when you finally cling to his knee and you are, he'll be late for you. God is not sending anyone to hell, not you! You will go there with your own decision and your thirst defines it! May God please you and give you experience of Damascus. The service of Club 700 and Pat Robertson is one of the reasons why I am still here. At the edge of alcoholism, adultery, and probably death, God got across the TV screen and used Pat Robertson to do it, and thanks God made it! You have the right to say what you have said, but you have no right to curse with your words. God loves you.
