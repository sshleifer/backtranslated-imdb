On rare occasions comes a film that has the power to expand the mind, warm heart and touch the soul itself. "LOU" is such a movie. I have a "LOU" from my wife who got her from a neighbor who's in the movie. She looked at it a second time with me. We both feared. It's like it was the first time again. <br /> <br /> "LOU" is a magical piece that sent you back to the moment all your dramas began to take place. It does when it is tirelessly fun. Bret Carr acting and directing as a director will not let you turn away from the screen. It creates a character that disarms like a rabbit as a caught innocence, but heartfeltly transmitted with such a subtlety of sincerity that you forget that you are watching the movie. When the epiphany appeared during the brilliant climax, I saw my wife in tears for the second time. <br /> <br /> As a coach of life I facilitate individual growth and transformation and this film is "must see" life coaches and anyone looking for their personal growth and transformation. It's great, creative work with the power to change lives!
