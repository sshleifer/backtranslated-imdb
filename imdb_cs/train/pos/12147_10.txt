Returning to the 3rd Chamber is a comedy sequel to the epic 36th Shaolin Chamber, in which Gordon Liu played Shan Te, a young man who became a monk and a fabulous fighter. In this sequel, Liu plays an unlucky loser who has to learn a kungfu after causing his friends to be defeated.

It is a classic world story of martial arts, with Shaw brothers' aces and Liu Chia Liang's direction. The choreography is fantastic all over the world, whether it be a fighting or slap comedy, and the performance of Gordon Lia, as well as the rest of a particularly sympathetic monk, works perfectly for this material. The film is less epic or deep than some other other work stars and there are definitely larger, more violent and sweeping Shaw Brothers movies. But little has such a magic blend of slapstick, unique training and struggles, with a gentle, yet warming story of unnecessary man. Full light heart, impossible to get the highest score.
