I thought racism and prejudice against Carl Brashear were deeply overvalued for the Hollywood effect. I do not believe the US Navy would ever be so racist. I can not imagine the full captain, commanding officer, sometimes telling his chief to sink intentionally. Surely not at the risk of your life. And the Petty Officer has never been a misunderstood bias against all but WASPs as a character of De Niro. No Chief, as dirty and drunk as he would play, would be the master of the Master for the first time. Cuba Gooding saved another badly made film.
