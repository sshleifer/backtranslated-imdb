Damn, I've seen this movie at least 4 times and I'm still bored watching. <br /> <br /> The visuals are so good and together with the music that is absolutely amazing and perfect this film is blowing for me. <br /> <br /> CGIs are a fairly bad IMHO, but the whole picture with a black and white feeling and completely sterile interiors were just ... Just a perfect genius combination for such a movie. The whole feeling of this feeling is indescribable, the conspiracy is so good. However, even though the film had little defects, like I sometimes thought the movie was a bit too "slow", but I do not mean scenic parts by really loving them. I have also very often been scattered by a very complicated story, as if it is in an underground bunker like a digicor, where all the data is stored and has this conversation with that guy ... but it can also be me: DA end could be somehow displayed more emphasized , they should have a bit longer and "louder", but again without all these flaws, the movie would be so good that it would never stop watching me. .
