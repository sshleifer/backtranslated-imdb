This film is inspiring for anyone who is or was in heavy jam, whether financially or emotionally. You will surely laugh, which is the best cure! :) She left in a bad financial situation when her husband dies, Grace must find a new way to make some money, and that's not exactly legal, which adds to humor. Even my boyfriend liked it, so do not think she's a cat.
