Andy Goldsworthy is a Taoist master of the first order, expressing his way through his noble ephemeral art. In fact, it's time and change what his work is in principle. I bought my first book a few years ago, and my family has been amazed many times. So it was an experience to know the artist personally through this film, he is just as patient and gentle as you would expect, and has some amazing things to be aware of the natural world, the deepest which is expressed in his occasional inability to say it at all. It's like most kids playing in the big outside themselves (if they are doing it), creating things from sticks and sand, mud and snow before they grow up. Mr. Goldsworthy received a gift and mission to expand this type of game to create a deep vision of nature and open his eyes often in the new great ways. And always with the highest respect, gratitude and humor of a wandering and thoughtful monk.
