Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to meet as a secretary with the rich Hughes family to get through her boyfriend. Almost immediately she is drugged and taken to a family estate in Cornwall. When they wake up, they call her Marion Hughes, she was mentally ill and kept her locked ... but why? You'll probably guess why it will not, because that's fun. <br /> <br /> Together with the "narrow edge" and "face behind the mask", it's one of the best B pictures ever made. (B pictures were low-budget images taken quickly with low budgets and no big stars). It's as long as it has to be (just 65 minutes), it's well controlled, fast and exciting. It just stumbles at the end I found a little too unlikely to buy. Foch (good actress) is all right, but Dame May Witty is great and George Macready is great (and terrifying) as villains. Good capture value. A perfect example of how you can make a great movie with a small budget.
