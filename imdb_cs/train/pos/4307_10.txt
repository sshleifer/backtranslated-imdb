Well, maybe not immediately before Rodney King's uprising, but a few months ago it was timely enough. My parents said they saw it and another thing you know the police were being liberated and LA was burned down. Just to show the state of racial relations in America. The plot has a white Mack (Kevin Kline) and African-American Simon (Danny Glover) become friends after Simon puts Mack's life in a black ghetto. Meanwhile, film producer Davis (Steve Martin in a serious role) thinks that gratuitous violence is really cool ... until he is shot. There is also some existentialism in the movie: Mack and his family realize they live the way they really want. "Crash" seems to have a somewhat renewed interest in racial relations, but this has been released much earlier. Perhaps we can never have stable racial relations in this country. But anyway, "Grand Canyon" is a great movie. This is confirmed by Kevin Kline as my favorite actor. Also starring Mary McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker and Alfred Woodard.
