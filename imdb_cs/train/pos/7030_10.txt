We recorded it when they were on television in 1995 and were waiting for all these years to be released because it quickly became one of our favorite favorites. Children are now teens, and they have to see ba-zillion like, but they still follow religiously with their friends. It's timeless addressing in all age groups - just like "Deleting". <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams is magnificent. Jason Alexander is beautiful and light on his feet. I noticed that the other commentators on this site are very harsh for him, but our family gives him a top rating. (We loved his Giant Step number.) Marc Kudisch (like Conrad) gives us comedic relief and wonderful musical numbers. And Brigitta Dau (like Ursula) is just flat stealing the show. Probably our favorite character in the whole movie. One disappointment was Chynna Philip Kim's performance. Part of it has to do with writing. Kim's role is completely one-dimensional. It makes it harder for Philip to be flat, non-imaginative, incredible and just terrible. The director should see and correct it. Or, never get her away. Overall, however, the picture is wonderful and I highly recommend it for families of all ages.
