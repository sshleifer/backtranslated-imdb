I watch this on Star World, which buys an American and Canadian series that lasts one or two seasons like Jane Show. I was thinking about how many female comedies I can really see, Lucy, Bewitched, I dream of Jeanie (the one with Barbare Feldman) and then my mind goes quite empty, I can not think of any other, women are all supportive role not leading. So for me, Jane Show is in a fairly good company. One thing I just thought of. I've been watching a few things in Canada and I never remember filming in regular TV shows that show SNOW! It's all on top of summer, LOL! You have made it a great place to live in the summer, but you think it will show a bit of Canada in the winter because it is also part of a lifestyle. I mean SCTV, Just For Laughs seems like two comedy shows that lasted a long time in Canada and very little or no one was shot by the snow even though they both make a lot of shots from outside. I turn, but Jane laughs for a moment and her apparently liberal ways that are accused of racism by my neighbor, and I like the bald guy and his foolishness, I found it at the same level as the British series called The IT Crowd (I Think) another office comedy woman. It's not the best comedy in any way, but the guy who says he can watch it alone means something to say. If I were with my wife, she might really like her because she's dealing with sex in the office and so on, so it can be a good light comedy that can be watched by couples. 7 out of 10.
