I do not think anyone except Terrence Malick and maybe Tran Anh Hung is doing a cinema cleaner than Claire Denis. This means I do not like this latest movie, like her masterpiece "Trouble Every Day," which is one of my absolute favorite films. It's just because the story here may be somewhat elliptical because it's good. Do not get me wrong, the fact that this movie barely has a conspiracy is really one of the best things, but I think Denis took one step away from having to go, and then the film flirting incomprehension and a few key points of the conspiracy should be some (the main hero is that South Korea is getting to the heart instead of just pointing it out without explaining where it is or why it is there). Also, some of the other characters looked redundant and as though they were just excuses for Denise to use an actor she likes once more (especially the character of Beatrice Dalle is a bit scattered because you still expect it to have some meaning). Still, the movie is incredibly ingenuous and cinematography is out of the way. It is certainly a magnificent work in its own form. At least as good as Denis's most acclaimed "Beau travail", if not better. Claire Denis must be my favorite French director, better than Leos Carax. I also have to admit that the South Korean succession really does "lost in translation" better than this film itself (and I, unlike some, I'm a huge fan of this film as well).
