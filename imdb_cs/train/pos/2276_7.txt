If you read the Mother of the Night and enjoyed so much (like me) that you have to see the movie, understand that you have to understand the basic element of Vonngut's script - that his story is Vonnegut himself and that you can not place the human mind on the screen. His littleness and humor simply can not be overwritten by the script or even the best acting performance. I believe that this film overcomes the question of key questions Vonnegut poses in his book, but the frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not on the screen. Does that mean that the movie lacks a mark? Of course not. In my opinion, the film is successful because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book (this is not a medium for those who are too lazy to come back to the page). It succeeds by taking on the basic elements of the story created by one of America's true artistic treasures and presenting it within a framework without pretense. I have seen other film versions of the Vonnegut books, where the director apparently tries to cope with the genius of Vonnegut and lose adherence to his own craft. I would not make this film one of the best I've ever seen but standing on my feet as one well worth the attention. By taking Vonnegut's "voice" from the narration of the film or trying to insert it, Mother Night can tell her story brilliantly and preserves the basic lesson of the story without confusion, distraction or disappointment.
