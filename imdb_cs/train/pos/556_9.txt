Cowboys James Stewart and Walter Brennan take their cattle from Seattle to Alaska and Canada to make demands. As soon as they get there, they have to deal with the seductive, exaggerated businesswoman Ruth Romano and the cold-hearted happy lucky villain James McIntier. John Wayne may talk about more, but his good friend Stewart some outstanding, stubborn Western people, some with great director Anthony Mann. Frankly, I'll take it with solid action sequences and a fine melodrama, across North To Alaska every day! Far Earth has some fascinating scenery and cinematography, which should definitely be filmed in a wide format. <br /> <br /> There is also a strong support of always reliable Brennan, Romanes (who is great), incredibly adorable Corrine Calvet and James McIntire, who plays one of my favorite types of bad people, does not take too seriously. <br /> <br /> This would be a great double account with another highly recommended Western rival Mann / Stewart, Bend Of The River.
