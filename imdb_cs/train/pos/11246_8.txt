Breaking Glass is a movie that anyone who has been trying to be in the music industry should have seen more than once. It's a very dark story about how a recording company manipulates a singer to do things in a way and earns the most money out of it. I'm going to look at some of today's TV shows "Search for Stars" both in the UK and abroad. Although not an expert on the subject, the winners of these exhibitions tend to have one very large initial hit and then his downhill. This film precedes these exhibitions, although the effect looks the same. After relieving his manager, Phil Daniels played quite nicely, slowly but surely the recording company will change her lyrics to make her the stimulants and she is finally burned. You are the potential stars of tomorrow .... Watch and watch !!!
