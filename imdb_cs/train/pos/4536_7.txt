Written by the writer who wrote the excellent Murder Rooms series, which recorded the ACD adventure with Dr. Joseph Belle, I was looking forward to it and I was not disappointed. It was relatively slow, with a strong emphasis on Doyle's frustration with Sherlock Holmes, which was very accurate and splendidly portrayed. It was an interesting study of the character and very well shot (on digital video, unusual for the period of the work). The acting was great, especially Tim McInnery and Brian Cox, although the actor who portrayed the ACD, whose name I can not remember, did not overcome me. An excellent study of the character that has roughly the same number of twists as every normal Sherlock Holmes case. You see it if you have a chance
