FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!! I was waiting for this movie to come out for almost a year and eventually it was seen at the premiere in the SB. I met some actors who were really nice and who were great in the movie. I've been following a trailer so many times that I did not know what to expect, but I got so full of water. The film was really beautiful when I looked at it and the music was good too. I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of ryan dowow and dominique swain was also good at it. the other actors were great too. I hope it will come out on DVD soon! !! <br /> <br /> First I got into ryan from watching OC and then saw him in a bunch of good Indians like Imaginary Heroes. In this movie he is great and everything he does is indie. I also love Dominique, but I did not see her so much. Hope to see them both sooner!
