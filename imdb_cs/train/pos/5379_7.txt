Much is happening in the murder of a girl. The mad scientist produces almost no detectable poison gas. Before being able to reap the rewards of his discovery, the scientist is killed by a hooded wizard, a welded whip. After the gas is killed in the church, Scotland Yard is called to investigate, but killing continues. Who can stop that crazy assassin who seems to be able to go and go as he likes at college? <br /> <br /> What works: <br /> <br /> - Killer. What he does not like around a killer who is wearing around, wearing a lively red KKK looking outfit, complete with red gloves. The white whip, which carries and uses very efficiently, stands out well against a bright red dress. Though the thought of the murderer in a flamboyant red suit hanging around the girl's school is quite far, it's one of the most ominous costumes I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> - Groovy 60s Music. I really want to watch the original music on The Girl Girl Murders. It's Juzu, hip, 60s, I feel I loved him. <br /> <br /> - A bizarre touch. In addition to the red dress and hooded killer, the film features a sliding fireplace, alligator pit with caged overhead, poisonous banging, strategically placed mannequins, mini-skirts, go-go boots, and mile high hair. I would like to describe it as a cross between the Batman television show in the 1960s and the Italian giallo. The murderous girls in school are a real experience for the eye. <br /> <br /> - Exit. Let's say there is a lot of torsion than the mountain road. Just when you think the killer has been exposed, it's twisted ... and more ... and more ... and more. What does not work: <br /> <br /> - Chief Inspector Sir John. I know the guy should be a comic jingle, but his crazy figure has too much time on the screen. - Why are they alligators? Previously I mentioned aligoes in the hole. And although they are nice touch, they serve very little. Why go through all the problems and do not use them? <br /> <br /> - Plodding Plot. Some murders in a dorm house have no flow or rhythm. There are too many moments in the whole movie when things inexplicably stop. Better stimulation would make it a much more fun movie. I did not see many of those German crimes, but from the few I've seen (Phantom of Soho, Strangler from Blackmoor Castle, Dead Eyes of London) it may be my favorite. This really has a funky feeling that I really came in. If the conspiracy improved a bit, I could easily give The Ville College Girl 7/10.
