I do not know if I'm weird, but I enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br /> The return to Cabin by the Lake is of course the continuation of another of my favorite films Cabin by the Lake. In fact, I think I liked this film even more than the first one. I also thought the cast in this movie was great, Judd Nelson is always the best! I also enjoyed the plot as a whole. I liked that this second film was focused on shooting Stanley's scenario Cabin at the Lake - it was not a completely redundant Stanley movie that grabbed other girls and drowned them. - If you're looking for some deep meaning then this movie is probably not for you. However, if you are looking for a fun way to spend two hours, then go ahead and watch. I've probably killed at least ten hours watching this movie. :)
