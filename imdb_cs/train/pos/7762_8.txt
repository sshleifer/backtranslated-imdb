In her autobiography, Laureen Bacall reveals that Bogie tells her she should not make such crazy movies like this or something like that. At that time Douglas Sirk was labeled as "wailing for women", in fact he was restored, at least in Europe, after he had ceased directing. And when he shot "Wind Written", Sirk had only three films to do: "Deserted Angels", "Time to Love and Time to Die", his masterpiece IMHO, and finally "Imitation of Life" (1960). Then there was silence. In fact, Bacall and Hudson characters are not interested in Sirk. They are too straight, too virtuous. Dorothy Malone - who was a substitute for his former German star Zarah Leander - and her brother Robert Stack provided the main fence interest. built continuously, most of the film is a long flash. The instability of a brother and sister from a family of wealthy Texan oil owners brings to the forefront the clothing and rutile cars that reach the highest speeds in the wrapped landscape. Malone's metamorphosis at the end of the film is amazing: a suit and chignon, playing with a small jug: ready for life, the rebel is tamed. Now that she has lost Hudson (but she has not been in love with her). This end is a bit reactionary, but the melodrama is par excellence reactionary, three years later in "imitation of life" Sarah-Jane (Susan Kohner) will be blamed for does not know her place.
