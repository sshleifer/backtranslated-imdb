The original English version I saw on the video. Disney's choice of voice actors looks very promising. I can not believe I say that. The story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that blends with his own. Both are one of the most interesting and interesting stories of each animated film. The quality of the animation is great! If you've seen Disney's Kiki service, you can see the quality of your production. They almost redeem them for having stolen the story of Kimba's white lion. (but not quite!) Eventually Miyazaki's films are released correctly! I can not wait to see the vague English version of Nausica!
