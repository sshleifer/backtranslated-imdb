How truly friendly, charming and cordial is this unpretentious old series; I was pleased to see old Lugosi. It is disarmingly friendly and alive. It is a proof of a long lost craft. (The best TV series today can barely compete with these old, slightly good series.) CHANDU is deep, profoundly optimistic and hedonistic. Refreshes the mind. It's not stupid; stupid are those who do not get the conditions on which these servers work. CHANDU has an irresistible feeling of simple, casual and friendly fun. <br /> <br /> Without distracting too much, Chanda is a Western witch, who also goes by this eastern name, and who also loves and protects his niece of the killer sects. <br /> <br /> Chandu uses his supernatural gifts quite discreetly and gently. As for a pretty sexy niece, Nadja, she is kidnapped by the priest Ubasti: Sordid Vindhyan. A poor, sexy girl is actually hijacked several times in a sarcophagus after she was blighted with a flower; almost abducted from the ship; a fake policeman; the Temple of Lemuria and its strange, spooky ceremonies remind us of KING KONG and are a barbarous mockery of ceremonies and rituals of the RCC. <br /> <br /> Do you protect the girl as bravely as Chanda does? <br /> <br /> Lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless, bad, and it just contributed to his performance. He is a prototypical average drunk uncle, dirty and cunning and oblique. That might sound like a somewhat curvaged hunch of Lugosi, but Burton's biopic Wood left me with this impression of Lugosi, and she combined with him a strong sympathy for the distraught person. I like Lugosi's fanciful performance. This series is unjustly muddy.
