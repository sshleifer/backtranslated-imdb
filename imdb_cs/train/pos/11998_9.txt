This movie was beautiful. It was full of unforgettable pictures, good acting and the subject. It would be very easy to write it as too sentimental, but these are the feelings that this movie is trying to achieve. I was totally involved in telling and presenting the story. There have been several bumps, but that can be expected in a religious propaganda film. The only complaint I can conjure up is that there was not much detail. This film, however, was not created to explain every element of life, services, triumphs, controversies, mistakes, etc. Joseph Smith; it was designed for a quick glance at several peaks of one of the most amazing American and historical religious figures of all time.
