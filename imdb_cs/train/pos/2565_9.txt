I really liked this film about the relationships that have sometimes developed between American soldiers and Japanese women in post-war Japan, as well as the obstacles that created prejudices for them. Brando goes from the perspective of the Japanese (which is natural to World War II) that she falls in love with a Japanese woman and wants to marry her. His performance is fine (I'm not an important fan of his acting style) and the film is amazing all over the world. Red Buttons won the Oscar for his touch performance by another GI who falls in love with Japan (although the Japanese women who play opposite him also did a remarkable job). I do not want to spoil it, but the movie is good for watching with a tissue box. <br /> <br /> This movie can NEVER say and be fun at the same time. A very underestimated jewel.
