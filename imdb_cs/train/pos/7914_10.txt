I've probably seen this movie first in 1995. Since then, I have come back to him many times. That's great! I particularly like the first and second clips, "Creation" and "The rise of civilization". Wow! It was so great that in the famous days of CG animation. CG is much older than me because I know the movie "Tron" was created 7 years ago. However, this film was a significant milestone in the early 1990s. It was probably the first collaboration of various CG experiments set to music. I like it very much, I think I'm going to watch it now. Goodbye
