I find that there is a mix of confusion and a different degree of personal taste in the reactions to this film. Yes, there are vampire stereotypes. Yes, here are scientific stereotypes. Even stereotypes of martial arts. Everything good and good, and certainly not all perfectly done. But I feel that one crucial point about this film is overlooked ... the cultural significance of its location. The film is located in Pensacola, Florida, and is not trying to avoid it. This is a courageous step in the movie world and a rare experience for fans of Indian movies. And it really does not have to be the last one. Pensacola is world renowned as the city of the navy, air city, timber city, and sometimes even as the focus of political controversy. Rarely seen as a growing film city. But it is changing now. More film companies come filming. And more native Pensacolians discover the power of cinema for themselves. This film is part of the growing trend of Indian films based on Pensacole and others are on the way. Pensacola makes great noise in the global film community, and the world is approaching. Watch and listen, world. The Pensacols are coming. Like a virus.
