I just want to add two cents for the price and forgive me if I repeat something that has already been posted, but I feel worth mentioning the people of the eternal "genius of Damon Runon." Without the incredibly street, merry writing by Damon Runon, this film would never be made - and most of the other great classics who dealt with players and similar before 1960. Damon Runyon worked as a journalist and was from Colorado but he certainly made the street scene of the East Coast.If you are not a devoted fan of old Hollywood comedies I would recommend several other films from Damon Runemon, "Lemondrop Kid" and "Little Miss Marker," both represent Bob Hope, who, besides his politics, was always a funny man. (As a liberal West Coast, his political situation is quite funny!) Damon Runyon lives !!!!
