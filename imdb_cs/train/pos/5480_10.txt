It's a great movie, it shows what our government wants other countries if we do not like their government. It's not as bad as what Reagan and Bush made number one in South America, but the US still has no deals with other countries. These films also prove that the American media is emitting government propaganda. That's exactly what Aristide did in Haiti. The reason why this coup against Chavez failed was that more than 90% of the votes were chaired by Chavez. This film is not just a political documentary, it would be a great movie if it was a drama, it's amazing that it's real. Another reviewer is lying when he says "Chavez has seized air waves", private media running all the time against propaganda against Chavez.
