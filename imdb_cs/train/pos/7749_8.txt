This movie throws you out of your feet. This debut film by Tom Barman (known from the Belgian rock band dEUS) introduces you to 8 interesting people who make building blocks of impressive film mosaics. Each one of them survives one day and one night in the metropolis of Antwerp. The bartender draws his characters with a great liking and professionally blends his individual stories, a tour of power that recalls the best work of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson. The miserable anecdote surprises, moves, entertains; Dialogues are so natural, they seem to be improvised. Some great performances by Matthias Schoenaerts, Natali Broods and the extremely entertaining duo of Gent, Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt. Sam Louwyck is an unforgettable "Windman," a bizarre man dancing throughout the movie. Sam is also responsible for stunning choreography, and of course Tom Barman himself has taken care of the ultra cool Sound Track. We were really stunned: any way wind blow is a movie that throws you out of your feet.
