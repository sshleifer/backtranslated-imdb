A simple film at the beginning, a simple movie eventually. It has infinite and pretentious clich√©s, but most television films have it in some way. Christopher Reeve does a good job as an ex-con / drifter. The marriage between her and the woman she works for, I feel a bit weird, but I believe it is plausible for the time period when it is planted. , I saw the modified 'tv' version, even the movie was made and pointed to 'tv', I find it a bit weird. But I feel if I see the whole piece, I would give him more or less the same rating. J.T. Walsh does a nice job, not his best role, but still ... decent work. <br /> <br /> 7/10
