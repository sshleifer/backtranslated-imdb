The Man on Fire tells the story of a former drinking drinker who accepts work as a personal bodyguard of a girl in Mexico during a wave of kidnappings. First, it is not friendly, but then it connects with one another, decides to stop drinking, etc., Atd. ... one day he will be kidnapped ... and killed ... <br /> <br /> He will not stop in anything to avenge himself. This is basically a story about a man on fire, but expect some big bangs at least several times including an end that is beautiful and probably you cry. It is also due to the great music of Harry-Gregson Williams with Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator) folded. But the strongest part of the movie ... wait ... that's all that's perfect here. <br /> <br /> First - acting. Denzel Washington is the best, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken are always great, great Radha Mitchell and the amazing young Dakota Fanning. And that's not the end of the list ... <br /> <br /> Then comes the cinematography, which is brilliant and along with great edits, should surely win the Oscar. The story is ... not just a film of revenge. The story is intelligent, the story thinks you ... and is purely beautiful. Really. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies you have to see in life, at least once!
