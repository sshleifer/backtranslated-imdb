This movie is one of my favorite films. This is a genre mix with Action- / Horror- / Romantic- / Comedygenre. Some special effects may seem obsolete compared to modern standards. This minor bug is easily ignored. There's a lot in this story. The romantic relationship between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts. Views are also beautiful. The event is great, not surprising, it comes from Honkong, the birthplace of the best action movies in the world. Humor sometimes seems a little stupid, but good. Somehow this film can balance different moods and is still good. Absolutely recommended.
