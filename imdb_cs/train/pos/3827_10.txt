I have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about - it was a wonderful film and created the feeling of a time that feels like traveling in time. The characters are really young, Mary is a strong match for Byron, Claire is juvenile and uncomfortable, Polidori is a convincing beaten sycophant ... they are all beautiful, curious and decadent ... not scary wrecks that are Gothic. <br /> <br /> Gothic acts as a separate piece of shock film and I loved it for various reasons, but it works as a businessman and ivory, and it was my best reading to capture what summer must feel. Romance, yes, but it really raises my interest in the lives of Shelley and Byron every time I think about the movie. One of my favorite favorites.
