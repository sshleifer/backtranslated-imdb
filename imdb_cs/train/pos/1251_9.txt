This document explores the story of Pilger's latest Freedom Next Time, published in 2006. It reveals the shocking exclusion of the natives of Diego Garcia, one of the islands of Chagos in the Indian Ocean. <br /> <br /> The islanders are technically British citizens because Diego Garcia is a British colony, like Mauritius, a nearby island where they were natives. The British government, however, ignored their requests for return to the homeland because the island is now a military base for the United States military that used it as the basis for a bomb attack on Iraq and Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> As usual, Pilger's coverage is shocking, especially when he documents the treatment and the current dilapidated living conditions of surviving islands. His interviews are excellent, and his deputy in Parliament, using the government's information to do so, is one of his best. <br /> <br /> Pilger also uses a dramatic reconstruction to autopsy a series of recently published documents that fully illuminate the British conspiracy to expel natives. Weaving this footage with interviews and island music really add to the impact of the film. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to watch, but "Stealing a Nation" is John Pilger at his best. Recommended.
