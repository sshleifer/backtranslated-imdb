A beautiful surprise from Spanish cinema. I never thought that Jordi Molla could be such a great director, I really do not care much about the movies. However, this movie was absolutely fantastic and unpredictable ... something I've always enjoyed! He did not have a very good press, and I really do not think it was ever released on the US market. We will have to settle for DVD or VHS if this ... I do not want to tell the story much because I do not want to spoil it for you but basically the film about the homeless is drunk who becomes a new messiah just for kicks and gets some money (like many others) before he knows that he is immersed in a life he does not count on.
