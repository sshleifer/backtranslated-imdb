I saw the German version of the film on German TV and I was amazed. Generally I want to see the documents, but I can not remember that I saw one that is better than "Earth". I knew some scenes from YouTube videos I found during random viewing. I also remember seeing parts of the movie in the multimedia stores that run on high-definition televisions. Looking at the movie makes it clear to me why the record is so popular among users and multimedia Youtube retail managers: It's so great and spectacular that you can not help, but staring at the screen, whether you are generally interested in nature Documents or not . <br /> <br /> No hesitation from 10 out of 10. There are definitely other exciting movies, but as far as documentaries are concerned, 'Earth' is definitely one of the best genres.
