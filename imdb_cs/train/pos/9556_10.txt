When our local TV station first started, it filled a lot with its old British programs. "Block your daughters!" was properly broadcast and I - jumping for a few seconds opening the film - jumped to an empty cassette. The best thing I've ever done. The actors adapt themselves nicely to their characters and bring them into a wonderful life, complemented by accents (Foppington Christopher Plummer leaves you in stitches as well as Hoyden and her family). Dual Entenders are growing abundantly, wheels with conspiracy in wheels are being mixed up and adapted to characters, cheerful view gags are hiding in every scene, and regular commentaries are regular. I showed the film to some of my friends a few years ago and called it a "lost treasure" as well as a story. To date, I can only think about dialogue. If this jewel ever found the way to DVD, I'll be on the front of the line.
