it does not have to be War & Peace, but two Academy Noms would not be up to it if it was not for genius James Wong Howe ... this is one of the few movies I "fell in love like a kid and came back without dissatisfaction. what it fictitiously offers or not, BB & C is a visual celebration, I'm not saying it's his best job, I'm not an expert here, but the look of this movie is amazing, I love everything, Elsa Lanchester, cat, crazy hoo-doo, retro but the way it was embedded in the movie is breathtaking, and I even like the discrepancies shown on this page and the "special effects" that now seem to be behind, all creating a truly consistent world.
