Pufnstuf is what it is. I saw it in a cinema at the age of 4, and I love it and live memories of it. Seeing it as an adult allows a person to capture links that are over the target audience - like a bit where Jimmy's gray witch wig is ripped off and Witch Hazel (Cass) seizes "I know she had brown roots!" However, it is heavily influenced by the culture of the flower power of that time and, in some respects, quite progressive. The Other Track, for example, sends a clear message to young viewers that you are alone, do not run with the package, and honor what is, is different in itself. This could be the hymn of the gay community, it should be a great track. Martha Raye, Cass Elliot, and Billie Hayes are all great as witches, and live insider casts all this (including Billy Bart, Felix Silla and other famous names). There's a lot of work in this movie - in fact, there's nothing subtle about it, and when little Jack Wild has to radiate his concern over the kidnapped inhabitants of the Living Island, it's really a little more than screaming. It's a drama and a comedy expanding with a trowel. While I think about it - I could never stand the flute. I like a soundtrack, especially the above-mentioned Miscellaneous, but also Zap The World, Pufnstuf and even Jack Wild's touching If I Could. What's more, it's now on CD from the tasteless people of Elkie in London. For more information, please visit: www.cherryred.co.uk/el/artists/pufnstuf.htm
