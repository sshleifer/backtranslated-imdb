I thought Sentinel would be an average film. When I finally saw it, I was surprised. The film is not a great thing, but it's very fun and the action scenes are very well done. This movie reminded me of the television series as 24 or Alias.It is very similar to this series and it also reminded me that Wolfgang Petersen is a thriller In the Fire. If you expect one of the most original and one of the greatest thrillers in film history, you will be disappointed. But if you go with little expectation, you will be seated. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7
