Return of the Jedi is definitely the most action packed series, and is a good conclusion of the Star Wars Saga. With Han Solo, the imprisoned Jabba Hut and the Empire, set a new star of death, the rebel alliance faces a difficult fight against the dark side and only our favorite heroes can pull it. <br /> <br /> Opening the Tatooine sequence, we see Jabb's palace, the cave and the trigger, and the new Han Solo house, how Luke and the gang are preparing for his rescue, and the Luke Jedi forces have the advantage. <br /> <br /> We also witnessed a tremendous battle at the end. Han, Leia and Chewy fight on Endor, desperately deactivating the shields protecting Death Star. The rebel fleet led by Landa, battling the Imperial Fleet while waiting for the shields to go down, and Luke finishing with Darth Vader. The epic end of the classic saga, and that's just the pace of the first two. <br /> <br />
