This moody film was bad luck to be released at the same time with the very popular "Amelie", both having a wonderful Audrey Tautou playing a central role. Laurent Firode, a talented director, has created one of the most enjoyable films he has recently released from France. The film deals with coincidence, as its English title suggests. The French title refers to how butterfly wings can cause chaos across the Atlantic while flying, as well as Pacific hurricanes, something that is not believed only by looking at these colorful insects. From the beginning, the director intersects all the characters that one sees in the film and how everyone has to connect with another that is hard to imagine, but it seems to work well in the movie. <br /> <br /> A random metric meeting sets the tone for the movie. Irene, who is about to work, is asked to tell a woman who sits across her to tell her what her Sign is and continues to read from her post. Irene, they seem to be going through the paths and finding their soul on that day. When Irene leaves the train, a quiet young man sitting next to a woman tells her that she has the same birthday as Irene. They seem to be predestined from the very beginning, but unfortunately they will not join until the last movie. Audrey Tautou is great as Irene. Faudel, who plays Younes, does not have much work to do but shows that he has his presence and plays well. A talented young actress is a valuable contribution to the success of a movie that is just as light as butterfly wings. We look forward to Laurent Firode's future films because he seems to be a director with a heart in the right place and ear to the way people are connected.
