This is short and to the extent. The story written for Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good. Efficiency is on the whole map, but the main characters over the years seem to have worked to improve their skills. It is hard to believe that this series has been running for nearly 7 years and will end in mid-May 2007. I will not re-evaluate what has already been said about series and graphics. Because it's an all-volunteer, for no profit, it's quite amazing. If it was rated as a professional production, I would have 5 for a good story but a terrible set. However, as a fan-based production, I have to give her an excellent rating, as an exception to a few other efforts, that's in his own league. For full volume, I do not think it was consistent. Congratulations on the cast and crew for the effort that many people admire.
