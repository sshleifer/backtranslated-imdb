Very funny movie. Eddie Murphy's classic 80s classic humorous film. I saw when I was a child and I had a good memory. Murphy's classic irony fails, the movie is fun, well done. In the 1980s, Murphy made many films that were a way of joking about everything that was dangerous. The result can only be appreciated by some, but the 1986 film has changed to the present day. The atmosphere of the film of that time is good and the special effects are good for the movie from the period. A nice film that sees and enjoys the taste of the irony Murphy, an actor who has recently vanished. The final part is an anthology, a loving actor who plays part of a Tibetan monk. And it is done.
