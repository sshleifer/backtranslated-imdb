Probably the best film Producers Releasing Corp ever made, this little horror piece rivet attention from first to last. Frank Wisbar, of course, knows a good story when he writes one, and more importantly, knows how to realize the full potential of shock on the screen. Not only is the plot and characters fascinating cartoon, but the setting is totally out of this world! All events take place either at night or in the middle of a gripping, omnipresent mist. This cool atmosphere is complemented by the imaginative direction of Wisbaru and the most compelling performances he has taken away from all his players. Beautiful Rosemary La Planche is the ideal heroine, beautiful, lively and yet vulnerable. Robert Barrat brings his usual portrait of local bigwig, which is no nonsense, though it is hard to believe that a handsome looking guy who plays his son is no one else than the later writer / director Blake Edwards.
