It's quite a simple, not very active but very lovely movie. There were times when I could see why Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress but there were other moments when I was interested in why Glenn Close did not get Fatal Attraction. Oscar and Golden Globe win and BAFTA Cher nominated Loretta Castorini, the simple low-wage woman just asked by Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) to marry him. She promises to come back in a month because her mother is sick, so she means while she needs to get as many of her family as possible as possible as possible. The only problem is when he finds Johnny's brother Ronny with one lawless one (nominated for the Golden Globe Nicolas Cage), they start to have a relationship and there love continues to the moon scene (where the name comes from). Also playing Oscar nominated Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Olympia Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry. It ends without a wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronny are happy together. He received an Oscar for the Best Song, screenplay directed, nominated for Best Director for Norman Jewison and Best Picture, nominated BAFTA for the best score for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay and was nominated for Golden Globe for Best Film - Comedy / Music and the best scenario. It was 96 for 100 years, 100 quotes ("Lose out of it!"). It was number 17 for 100 years, 100 passes, and it was 41 for 100 years, 100 laughs. Very good!
