I loved this film recognizing the viewer's intelligence and allowing the layers to peel away from the characters by interacting with the unspoken loss that touched each of them. Kinematography is beautiful and inspired by the reflection of someone I think is an extremely talented new filmmaker with maturity and artistic insight to tell a story that others with much more experience have failed to achieve. I see a clear future for this writer / producer / director who has the ability to concentrate on the goal and achieve its integrity. Kudos for this success.
