The film belongs to the genre Inventor - Underdog. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring a story with several standard elements. Well-shot, well-groomed, with lots of well-functioning secondary roles. Some have said this movie is classic American hockey. That's more. I agree with those who say, "The film celebrates the excitement of young inspiration." <br /> <br /> The film is a pleasant reminder that success can be born from roots. <br /> <br />
