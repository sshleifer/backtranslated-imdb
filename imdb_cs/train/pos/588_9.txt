I have seen all the films by director Robert Redford and I appreciated his love for the American people and the country. In Redford Run through it, Redford depicts the lyrical romanticism and visual beauty of the Rocky Mountains in Montana as if it were a 19th century painter of landscape art by Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film attracts the visual and word with the text by Norman Maclean and the amazing work with Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot). Redford cast is perfect. Tom Skerritt is rev. MacLean, a man whose training methods include fly fishing, as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, mother and his sons Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems encountered by growing teenage sons and later complicated young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are utterly believable as brothers, whose love for fly flies and each other joins each other. It is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers and their wives to the outside world that justify that the river passes through it into a vein of narrative that is lacking in so many Hollywood films produced in recent years. <br /> <br /> <br /> What makes these relationships strange is Redford's attention to the language as spoken in the dialogue. This is a literate script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable in conjunction with the stunning Montana rivers and mountains. Words and settings are the same as the cast performances that rise to their material. While the idea of ​​hunting for musketeers may seem like a special device that focuses on the story, it's not so unlikely in Redford's overhead. Since Redford's oasis is easier and more time-consuming, it's over and over again.
