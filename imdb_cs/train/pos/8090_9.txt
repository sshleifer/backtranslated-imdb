When a little hobbit, named Frodo Baggins, inherits a magic ring from his uncle, the sorcerer Gandalf investigates and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of the evil dark master. If the ring reaches its hands, it regained its power and destroyed the Middle Earth. Frodo and his loyal friends set out on a journey to destroy the ring with a band of warriors. This is an undervalued adaptation of classical novels because it only covers the first half of the story. Regardless of this, it's an epic and wonderfully animated movie. Animation is greatly done with a rotoscope that focuses on live action shots. Ralph Bakshi worked well with the low budget he got. The film also boasts a great musical scene by Leonardo Rosenman that suits every scene. There are several stains with the scenario scene, but this has to be justified, given that the original deal was to create a book of trilogy into two films, many had to fill in the first. My biggest problem is some character character, Samwise was a little too hideous, while the other hobbits worked quite normally. Other characters are really well written for the screen and voice actors do a great job, I was pleased that Legolas is actually a bit more useful to plot. Rotoscope orcs are much more comical than frightening, while ringwraiths are scary and scary. Another problem is that the evil sorcerer Saruman, thanks to the authors, is called Aruman. Overall, I think a little more money and better writers would do a lot of justice, but that's something charming. Ralph Bakshi has made a brave effort to customize the screen of these classic stories. The film suffers from a terrible shadow of live action movies, but it's still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages.
