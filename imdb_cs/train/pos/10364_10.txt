Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) just welcomed the little girl Azaria. As Seventh-day Adventists, they live their convictions every day, and Azar√≠a is soon devoted to God in their church, and their two older boys look at each other. Michael gets a holiday and the family chooses Ayer's Rock, one of the most impressive tourist spots in Australia. They are not wealthy, family camps near the place. After a beautiful first day, Linda gives the Azaria child to sleep in one of the tents. Suddenly he will hear Azaria weeping. When Lindy hurries to the tent, the dingo dog is just leaving and shaking his head. The baby is gone and early, so it's a dingo. Although the entire camp is looking for a child, it is not found. When she concludes that she is dead and dingo provokes her beloved daughter, the Chamberlains are trying to make God's decisions and continue in her life. But unfortunately, the story gets a sensational coverage in the news media, and the story is soon told that Lindy has murdered a child. She is subsequently arrested and placed in court. How can it happen? This is a great show of real events that show how "crowd government" is not a figment of imagination. The whole country is turning against the Chamberlains, partly because they are considered strange. Streep gives her best performance at all as a complex Lindy, whose own strong will makes her every step of the way. Neill also does a great job as Michael hesitant and confused. Casting is one of the biggest movies that people from all over the world got into Lindy's case. Costumes, scenery, script, direction and production are at the top of the line. If you have never seen or heard about this movie, immediately correct it. It is not far from saying that this "Screaming" should be seen by everyone who looks at the film and the abusive power of the media.
