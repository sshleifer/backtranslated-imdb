Each scene was perfectly assembled. This movie had a great cast and crew. I mean how he can have a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr. in it, no one has and will never exist. He has the ability to revive every film with his amazing talent. This movie was perfect! I saw the movie, which was sitting alone on the "Blockbuster" shelf, and as if it called, I could not resist him to take it and bring it home with me. You can call me love romantic, but this film just touched my heart, not to mention that I laughed at the same time with pleasure. Although I was crying, I admit, in the end, the whole movie just exaggerated my look at life afterwards. I designed my horror, action and a purely humorous filmmaker of my brother who absolutely adored this film. It's a movie with a good sense of feeling. You could laugh out loud, touch your heart, let yourself fall in love and enjoy your life. Every moment you deliberately walk around this movie, just realize that you are consciously making the decision to live and feel this inspirational film. Who knows? What if you could really do that, and leave your mind open to the mystical miracles of life.
