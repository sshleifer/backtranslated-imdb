This movie starts sharply, has slow moments in the middle, but generally moves well, has some very good moments, then exhausts at the end of Act 3. I was able to see it in LA premieres 2 times (with 2 different ends). Jason Lee is a star, but he is not the leading man tomorrow. He is humorous and keeps his own, but it is better to serve as a supporting actor. Julia Stiles is fine in a comic role that is new to her, but she does not steal this movie just as the star of her caliber should. For an actress who has so much potential (10 things, Save the Last Dance, O), it's hard to watch her play a role that is so "average," then let her take the role and run away with the movie (like Daniel Day-Lewis done in 'Gangs'). Selma Blair is also a good young actress and does the job ok. I did not expect the academy to give it a performance from her, and she did not provide it, but her performance was reasonable. Chris Koch adds another movie that is "above average". Perhaps the problem lies in the scenario more than anything else. I liked this movie! But it's not the movie you're leaving and you say ... "It was great!" ... This story is done so many times before and there was nothing new. The evening scene was probably the best in the movie and Larry Miller gives incredible performances in a supporting role (could be the best surprise of the film). If you want to see a movie that has laughed you several times and you have a nice evening, I can recommend this movie, but if it does not change ... again ... leave during the church scene or you will definitely be disappointed.
