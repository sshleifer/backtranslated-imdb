Do you remember the initial pay-per-view days? I, and I almost remember the number you had to call for your own movie rental on your t.v. As a child, we always wanted to hire playboys, but that meant actually calling someone out of the PPV and asking him to rent. And then you get nerves to do it and watch four hours of soft core without it. No reason why I bring it because this movie was also on ppv. And I remember almost every scene that was added. Over the past few years I've been kicked down to get all the great movies I've seen as a child, and it was one of them. It's such that when it's hard to turn off. All star actors are trying to make a perfect bank bust, but nothing is wrong. There is a lot of spoof banks of capers that are good and they have to fall into this category. She has plenty of action and laughs to keep it. Check out if you dare!
