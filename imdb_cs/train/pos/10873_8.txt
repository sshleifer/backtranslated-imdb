This film really deserves more recognition than getting it. It is a truly stunning and rich picture of bloody ties, kindness and devotion within the criminal world. The film is beautifully shot and penetrates all those that are classic crime topics such as betrayal and power. This film is a filmmaking film that requires attention and understanding and eventually fully rewards. He is a godfather of hongkong and is a welcome change, rather than other fighting framing fighting, epic martial arts that seem to be the main contribution of the cinema world from Hong Kong and China. It contains an arrangement of great characters, actors and development, although it is fair to say that I had to watch it twice, just not wanting what happens to some characters because of their so many interactions in the movie. But in all 8/10 great plot characters, but there are characters that do not look so good that music really did not pick me up, and sometimes I felt that the events did not sync well (there is a way to go) so it loses a few points.
