When I first saw two of my photos, I compared myself with Altman. Before that, however, I have always marked my film style "boring". You must be in the right mind to appreciate his crazy genius. "HealtH" is rather underestimated and very controversial. In fact, I do not think it would ever be a VHS. Why is that so? When all these miserable movies get on DVD daily, this one is left without a good reason? Frankly, I did not have any real problems with this movie. It was largely consistently entertaining and entertaining. Almost all scenes are mysteriously interesting for some reason, whether it's a wonderful dialogue or a fine performance.

It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than most sludge they get there, they release DVDs. Damn, I'll be happy with a nice VHS copy of this thing. <br /> <br /> But it's often on the Fox Movie Channel, so look at it.
