For many, Beat Street has inspired her lifestyle to something creative about hip hop culture. Young Lee lives in NY in the 1980s, when hip hop was at the beginning. His crew member "Beat Street" - crew b-boy. The film follows Lee on his average day, dancing, graffiti, etc. The director managed to shoot a plotting plot while presenting hip hop to the rest of the world. The film has an old school function like Africa Bambaataa & Soul Sonic Force, Grandmaster Melle Mel & Furious Five, Rock Steady Crew, New York City Breakers and many others .... <br /> <br /> Neither the movie Beat Street, nor the spirit of Beat Street will ever die.
