Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, SCARFACE paints an image that is not easily forgotten. Al Pacino is amazed because Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee, is becoming a strong player in the drug world when he ruthlessly directs his own kingdom of crime in Florida. This gangster film is harsh, violent, loud, rude, uncomfortable and must hold a record to make the word "f - k" the most pronounced. Almost three hours, and yes, it can be repulsive. A successful Constitution will keep you in your seat and encourage the disappearance of a ruthless criminal. You also play interesting characters like Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar. Pacino turns out to be one of his biggest generations. He can bring reality to his personality, which leaves a strong impression. It will not be a movie for everyone, because you let go of the disaster. Is that strong enough for you? Crime does not last long!
