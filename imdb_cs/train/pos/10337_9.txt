This movie was incredibly fun, I want to own it for my vintage collection of the 1970s The film has to re-see the list, I know that these cast characters are the people I met over the years and it challenges me to look for this comedy, unfortunately this has never been on DVD or VHS. Redd Foxx always a comedy clown, Pearl Baily a great match as his wife funny and clever, Norman's son with a secret is not sure if he's going to have a future if he's out, Dennis Dugan a crazy humorous man. Miss Dobson with her heart and little conscience. Love, lust, strange family ties This movie qualifies for a return experience, a sitcom with a combination of events that could and should find a way as a remake. I think finding the cast would be extremely difficult, perhaps impossible, with the exception of Jerry Seinfeld, who plays the role of Dennis Dugan, earmarking a few Seinfeld episodes that also brought me back to Norman, is that you keep them in the immediate vicinity, is certainly impossible because it is impossible to reformate the pretending girlfriend and the infidelity of the woman. This movie was a wild ride taxi adviser, reminding me of an episode Kramer takes his caddy's advice through his lawyer. (episode from Seinfeld) Parents there have jaw dropping moment, fun over fun It's screaming to bring me back.
