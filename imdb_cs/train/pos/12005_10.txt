This movie was the best movie I've ever seen. Being LDS I highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel more understanding of the life of Joseph Smith. Although the film was not made with highly acclaimed actors, it is a remarkable and life-changing film that everyone can enjoy and appreciate. I saw this movie with my family and I can testify that we all had a heart change. This film allows people to truly understand how difficult the life of the prophet is, and how much trouble he has been exposed to. After watching this movie, there was not one dry eye in the room. Everyone was touching what they saw, and I was not the same because I saw it. I highly recommend this movie for everyone.
