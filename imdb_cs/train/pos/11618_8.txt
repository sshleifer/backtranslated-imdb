Rachel McAdams. Cillian Murphy. Wes Craven. Dream Team. This is one of the best thrillers of the year 2005. Big plot. Great surgery. Great eye candy. This is one of Wes Craven's greatest movies, besides "Scream" and "Nightmare on Elm Street". That might be the best. The story is one of the best things about the movie and it's very simple. Lisa Reisert (McAdams), who faces a hotel manager, returns to Los Angeles. She does not know that Jackson Ripner AKA Jack Ripper (Murphy) followed suit. They have a couple of drinks and eventually sit on the plane. She later reveals to her that he is the killer who was sent to kill the secretary of internal security at the Lisa Hotel. And what about Lisa? Well, she will have to move her room to the highest suite to bomb him if Ripner did not kill her father (Brian Cox). Twist and storytelling really give it extra zing and side characters and side jokes really add to it. Overall, it's definitely one of the best thrillers in 2005. It's definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 of 4 stars
