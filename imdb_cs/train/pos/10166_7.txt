I was looking at it for an 8-hour flight and (probably because of pressure and altitude) I actually found it slightly fun (emphasis on "mild"). The thought behind the film was brilliant: the woman died, her fianc√©e fell in love with someone else, decided to make sure they would not gather, but eventually let them. Unfortunately, the real movie was not that good. OK, there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well. But from the beginning, the conspiracy was about as predictable as the destination of the flight I was on. I think the whole gay but non-homosexual girlfriend could work much better. A talking parrot was a nice idea, but be honest: it was not really fun. Overall, the film was more interesting than staring into the seat in front of her, but it was close to calling.
