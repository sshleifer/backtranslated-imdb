This film went through the cracks of film history. It's far superior to other New York films, such as "French Connection" or "Taking Pelham 1-2-3". This film is a distinct reality that can also effectively use humor to re-draw. It starts from the beginning to the end without aggravating the age, as is the case with the two examples above. Ron Liebman turns out to be a fraternal performance like "Batman" and it's a shame to not take off as a result of this project. <br /> <br /> Gordon Parks directs and comes as "Shaft," which seems to be a strange choice at first. Still, it is the counterpart of an earlier effort, and it was as close to machismo. Unfortunately, this movie was not available on DVD or VHS in the United States. United Artists really has a gem on their hands and it's a shame they will not do anything about it.
