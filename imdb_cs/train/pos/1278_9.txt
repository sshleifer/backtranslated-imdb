"The Last Big Thing" is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically sings pop culture to the point of humorous self-explanation. The characters are so interesting and fun to laugh / sympathize. Which brings me to the introduction to the things that I liked best ... Simon Geist is a man in his late 30s / early 1940s, who creates a pop-culture managed editorial magazine called "The Next Big Thing." The thing is that this magazine does not really exist and it's just an excuse for Simon to get close to the actors by talking to them just to fool around them and offend their way of buying into pop culture. His live girlfriend Darla also writes a magazine (which is real) about her and Simon, as well as her and her father. Darla is a really nice (or unholy) character, depending on how you see her confused neurotic behavior. Magda is a prostitute, the figure I liked best. Brent is a flat figure who is not too much like Tedra, the queen of music and videos for a bunch of B-rated rock bands. Nevertheless, these characters weave a very interesting web together. And this film challenges all the motivation people have for what they do and why they do it. It's a wonderful movie and I suggest that you see it if you are in a crowd of indie / art house. Mark my word! <br /> <br />
