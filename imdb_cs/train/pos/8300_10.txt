It is no surprise that Busey later developed a tumor in the sinus cavity, this film is also a bad decision, but one that I enjoyed completely. The first 5 minutes are the most pointless 5 minutes in each movie; boring, bad, and then, with the attitude of Spiderman, Busey shouts on the worst line in every movie ever made ... "Your worst nightmare!" I threw away some of my egg that laughed so much. This line resonates so well that even surpasses Clooney's infamous "hi Freeze, I'm Batman". Other classic moments are Busey constantly upset about people who remind him that his former CIA partner killed ... who accidentally shot him in the chest (all possible thanks to super slow motion, dry look exciting). There is an ashtray, punches in the face and "it was not my fault and you know it!" Well, the shots show he's missing the bad guy and hitting his buddy so ... Another screaming loud moment must be his ex-girlfriend who pushes the grenade to the ground to allow him an escape - a plan that rejects all logic, physics, and absurdity . Finally, when McBain jumps out of Thunderblast during an intense guerrilla war and starts running and hinders a small object, I almost get wet. Some of Busey's best girls are far away, they are renting them today or buying them "butthorn!" My voice is perfect 10 (on a meter which is).
