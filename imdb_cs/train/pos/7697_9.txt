This is another great movie that I was lucky to see for the first time on the big screen (thanks to Rick Baker and others). In the late 1980s I was a relative newcomer to this genre and was really new to the big three JC, SH & YB. I was not sure what to expect when I paid my hard earned money to see it in "Triple bill of classics" at Old Scala. I did not have to worry, I was breathless in this movie. If you are a fan of Hong Kong Action / Kung Fu movies and have not seen this movie, do it NOW!
