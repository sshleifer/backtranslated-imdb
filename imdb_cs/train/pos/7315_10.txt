A classic, very influential low budget that caused a horrifying icon and began the career of director Carpenter and star Curtis. A seemingly unstoppable killer escapes from a psychic institution and returns to his hometown where the local Halloween watch starts. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a movie that can never fulfill its reputation as a masterpiece of horror! Carpenter's terrifying story and clever direction gives this film such a cool, good life that it must be seen how to really feel it! Direction is often made up of such simple elements, shadows, dark streets, squeak doors that make even the day-to-day setting of the city's neighborhood really scary. Carpenter is impressing for his tension and shocking shocks to be as surprising as possible, which is in itself a lot of heroic filmmakers who have ever mastered! Moreover, he is wise enough to give us a really nice young figure and a very frightening villain to keep the tension even stronger. The supreme kudos also come to Carpenter's simple but terrifyingly disturbing musical score. In a sense, Halloween is a great example of the perfect horror! <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. Young Jamie Lee Curtis makes a very nice twist as Laurie Strode, a kind watchman, so good he will continue in a number of other horror films before he breaks into bigger movies. Big Donald Pleasants performs perfectly as Doctor Myer, who is desperate to catch him again. Support for Loomis, Soles, Castle and others is also good. <br /> <br /> Just like his own villain, Halloween is an unstoppable force that never gets excited and cold. It's for all fans of the genre! <br /> <br /> **** of ****
