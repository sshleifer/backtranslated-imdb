This movie breathed me at some points, I just loved him! <br /> <br /> I admit that dialogues about nature and storyline might be a bit better, but hey, it's just a simple story of a couple of guys trying to kill a dragon, nothing more! <br /> <br /> The overall design, the atmosphere, the beautiful landscape ... it's just magical! <br /> <br /> They love a lot in this movie. The character figures were great and entertaining. A bit Tim Burton ish if you like. I can recommend this film to anyone who is interested in a great design, displayed in a simple little but beautiful story.
