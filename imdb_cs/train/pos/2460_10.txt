Hamlet is by far my most favorite piece of all Shakespeare's works. Branaugh is one hectic actor. His rendering was just amazing. His soliloquies were breathtaking. As long as it was scarce that the movie was interested, I was interested in this particular piece of work. I recommend it to every fan of Shakespeare and not so much. It has everything a modern world looks for in its films: murder, betrayal and fraud. They did not want to change Mel Gibson's version, but Branaughs touched the whole thing. It does not leave any stones. Once you finish the movie, it will make you feel like you read the game yourself. As you say "two thumbs up".
