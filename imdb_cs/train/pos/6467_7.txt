Two films behind the Indian prisoners; Veer Zaara and Deewaar. Although Veer Zara was the love story of a man who gives everything to someone, Deewaar focuses on the main subject himself. It's not hidden that many Indian prisoners of war have been rotating in Pakistani assassinations for many years - for which neither the Indian Governor. has time or compassion, nor the other side. I'm sure some Pakistani warriors are also in India, but we're focusing on the film. Full actors. Some were actors like Raghubir Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, etc. Amitabh Bachchan, who plays the role of major, acted well. Akshaye Khanna has done his part well. Amrita Rao did nothing but a few giggles and a few songs. I think the role of Sanjay Dutta was the strongest, although it was not too long. Here he worked really well and his dialogue was also impressive. If you compare it to LOC, which is nothing but a full-day movie with a story that will be done in all directions (if there's a story) - Deewaar is a well-controlled film that keeps pace and manages all the actors. 7.5 / 10
