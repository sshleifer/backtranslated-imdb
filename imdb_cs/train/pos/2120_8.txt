James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play co-workers in a Budapest gift shop that they really do not like without knowing they are really nice dear friends who have not met. A very charming romantic comedy that is very interested in two playful stars and very eager support. The story is well written and the film has such a romantic innocence (I do not know how to explain it) that movies just do not have it today. This of course can be compared to the recent You've Got Mail and the original wins in all directions. <br /> <br /> This is a mandatory review of every Christmas, I can not think of a better way to jumpstartart a Christmas feel than this little jewel.
