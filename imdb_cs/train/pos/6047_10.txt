The amazing thing about Andoule & Illa is that it captures that a lean college and life could go either for a moment along with all the other decorations. Freebird is something for those who probably never considered higher education and just went straight to work at age 15/16. I knew some of the various sheets were stuck in the film when it came out in cinemas, but I saw it in a silk house in Hailsham, and it seemed that everyone was really enjoying it. I grew up in the Dean Forest, and it took me right in my mushroom and juice days (they had some great friends - hatred to think about what's all right now - local councils are probably going on). I watched the DVD several times and I see the movie as an old friend who will remain forever part of my collection (as I may like this film and Dambustery - I do not think so right) edge to the second half of this film and I think socially Performing scenes with locals are greatly done. I like a mixture of three main characters and there really is some beautiful writing here along with some very sensitive lines and I dare say good integrity punch. I tried to get a soundtrack, but it was not allowed (shame, because it's a cork). Someone told me it was a scenic game, not quite as sure as it worked, but I'm sure it was fun. I like Shakespeare's little touch / links that appear throughout the movie (just like Dylan Thomas ref) and just like all the little gems, it's always gonna be a small thing to discover as the final scene that gives shouting on Easyrider they're going to be another way . Everyone in fact is really an unpretentious piece of film (I love it!)
