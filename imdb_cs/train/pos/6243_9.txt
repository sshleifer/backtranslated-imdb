a film about the cruelty of this world. I find it liberating because it can only be true. It also contains some quite funny bits. Some actors are extraordinary, see, for example, Maria Hofstätter. The director tried to describe life as realistically as possible and succeed. Cohesively, sex scenes are clear and not fake than those that are filmed in a hard-core movie. Although I barely understood the sentence, I found the film's vision in the original language with subtitles much more rewarding, because with the dubbing half of the great work of the actors is lost. The voice of the character played by Maria Hofstätter is difficult to duplicate with the dubber. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie
