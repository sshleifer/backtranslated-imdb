This movie has Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer together. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford plays a bad guy who sells weapons to the Indians and is hard to know. It was the first time that Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together and the other film that was produced was basically the same but at another time. This film begins with Lincoln's murder and also deals with the Indian War. Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill is married and now wants to stay home. This film also deals with Custer's last stand and is far from accurate. Gary Cooper is as good as usual and I usually do not like Jean Arthur, but I liked it here.
