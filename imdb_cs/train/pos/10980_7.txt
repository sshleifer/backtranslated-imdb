I've seen this movie a few weeks ago and since then I've been left behind. He plays two magical characters in crazy documentary film. In order to get a real story about Beales, I had to go through all DVD bonus materials and commentaries and search the web. Although Maysles and their fans (not to mention Edith and Edii) brush on the suggestion that this film is exploitative, it's an explosion in the true sense of the word. Very little effort has been spent to explain the Beales or how they get to the state they are in - Maysles' approach seems to be just turning the camera on and waiting for Edith and Edie to say something outrageous. The sound, even when you re-release the Criterion, is bad and difficult. Although I appreciate that this film was filmed in the history of documentary film, it is ironic to compare it to Geraldo Rivera (!) A far superior series of sexual abuse of mentally retarded patients at Willowbrook State School in Staten Island since 1972, four years before shot Gray Gardens. For paraphrase reviews in New Yorker, there were many things Edith and Edie needed in life, and the document was not one of them. <br /> <Edith and Edie, the thing I was thinking about watching the movie was "where the hell is their family"? They lived in dangerous, unhealthy and dangerous conditions. How did Jackie O, who married one of the richest men on Earth (or the wealthy Bouvier family), could not afford Edith and Edie a decent home? Or do you at least hire partners or carers to come and watch them both? It is a disgraceful and permanent shame for the entire Bouvier family. Although this review may sound negative, I recommend Gray Gardens to anyone who has a documentary film. Maybe somebody ever comes and makes a documentary about this document - it brings the rich story of Beales and the entire Hamptons sub-chapter in the seventies.
