Oh, where are you going, my little, little ... <br /> <br /> Turn around and you two, turn around and you are four ... <br /> <br /> I remember these shows when were first broadcast on Disneyland. I remember sitting there, electrifying the explanation of rocket science by Werner Van Braune. I was looking at how history, science and humor were intertwined in the eye-catching tale of possibilities. It was fifty years ago. And the shows are back in the Disney Treasures series and what treasure they are. I watched them last night and tonight with my eight-year-old daughter who did not even enter the room first, but later changed her mind when she saw they were partially revived. As she watched as I watched her, she was almost as interested as I was. <br /> <br /> Turn around and you are a young woman with small children ... <br /> <br /> Certainly, some predictions about reaching the month were bad. However, there is a lot of information that is still accurate and the overall presentation is still impressive. I have found that my daughter teacher may want to show her class not only as a 50-year artifact, but also as a fun and easy-to-understand lesson in history. Turn around, turn around, turn around and again ... think about how much has changed in fifty years.
