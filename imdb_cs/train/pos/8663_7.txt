The movie "Rich in Love" is a movie that brings the audience into the journey of a rather strange family of Charleston, SC. Highly romanticized, beautifully shot, well-written and performing, "RIL" will wash you like a summer wind because his paperless meandering breathes life into a figure so that at the end of the movie you will feel like an old friend of the family. > <br /> An amazingly crafted movie from director "Driving Miss Daisy", "RIL" is somewhat unclear little "sleep" that most appeals to a mature audience.
