Finnish version of Robert Altman's "Short Cuts", located in the small rural town of Äänekoski. Episodes represent the kaleidoscope of the eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, deceit and disillusionment, hopelessness and death. I was particularly impressed by two episodes. The first is the story of a young waitress who is trying to encourage the romance of her co-workers: it radiates a great joy of love and life. The second episode presents and the old man dies in the hospital and his wife tries to help him die dignified. Particularly prominent is the way the old couple has to fight against the humiliating practices of the hospital, and their loneliness is in contrast to the "routine" of the hospital crew (despite signs of occasional empathy). Compared to the classic Altman, this film may be less professional, but it's certainly great art.
