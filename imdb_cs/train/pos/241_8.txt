I'm tired of people judging movies about their "historical precision." THIS IS A FILM PEOPLE !! Writers and directors should be involved in the story! There are a number of films that are not exactly accurate with the history ... Braveheart, Wyatt Earp, New York gangs, Geronimo: American legend, the last of the Mohicans .... all the fantastic movies that are slightly inaccurate historically. If you want to see some great actors doing their best, I suggest you watch this movie and do not worry about the facts. Just enjoy the quality of the film, the story and one of the greatest actors of our time.
