<br /> <br /> I really liked the movie. One of those rare movies that Hollywood Really is no longer doing. William H Macy It's just great as a hit man with a soul and Neve Campbell is just fantastic as a woman who puts her life on the way of redemption. If you have a chance, check out this movie. It gains praise
