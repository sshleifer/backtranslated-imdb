in a less conventional sense. This movie was one of my favorites as a little kid, and I just remembered it recently, and I thought it looked. While many details are no longer clear, the overall feeling that the film brought to me has been getting stuck over the years. If parents feel that their children can handle mature and sometimes violent themes, then I highly recommend this movie. It taught me a lot about life and death, and it made me feel a lot of emotions. To this day he remains one of my favorite films.
