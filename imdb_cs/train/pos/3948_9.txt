So finally I know it exists. Together with other UK contributors, I saw this on WHAT MUST be, it's just British screening in the 1970s. I remembered that title, but nowhere I told people about it. That's what makes me nervous (it's 2 years), but when you go to sleep, you're freezing your brain and listening to everyone around for impending terror, is not that about the horror movie TRULY CLASSIC? I hardly remember the complexity of the film, but what I remember is my shaking body and raised senses. Can anyone confirm my suspicions that it is black and white? Again, if anyone has any information on how to get a copy of this information, please contact us ...
