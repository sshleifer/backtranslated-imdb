My brother and I have Pokemon 4Ever on DVD. We watched it a couple of times and it was the best. That's bad It's a new Pok√©mon, who did not like this time. I'll get to it. <br /> <br /> The iron-masked marauder was quite significant when he captured Celebi with his dark balls. Good age Ash and Sam drove him out of his control. <br /> <br /> There was only one song in the final credits called Cele-BRATE by Russell Velazquez. <br /> <br /> Pokemon 4Ever It's been a success because the three previous movies and people will always love the movie.
