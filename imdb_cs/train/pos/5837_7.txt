With Olive Hardy, the sound of horns, bells, telephones and trombones, Finlayson recommends the calmness and diet of goat's milk. Partner Stan Laurel comes with a big docking solution, so sea air can help Ollie get all he needs. It's a great prerequisite for all the crazy hats to follow because the ship is starved by a starving goat and the prisoner escaped (Richard Cramer) is on the way. <br /> <br /> I got a kick out of all the gag in the movie, starting with that sign in the Silence While Men Working Corner. The first story in a boys' apartment presents a number of mixed troubles with plumbing machines and equipment, and Stan makes banana in a banana piece. Laurel has some great lines in the picture, like, "We had to be unconnected," but the one who broke me was his response to the criminals aboard the ship - "Self-preservation is the last law of the diameters" more precisely! <br /> <br /> I am not a student of Laurel and Hardy so much on this record, all I know is that I enjoyed them as a child and I find them fun nowadays as they back in my youth. On this count, "Sap at Sea" provides a good hour of horno-fun entertainment, even on the way to hornomanii.
