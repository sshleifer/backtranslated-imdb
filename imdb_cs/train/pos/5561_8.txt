Ok, no need to say that this film will just appeal to a particular audience; and stoners and like-minded people. <br /> <br /> This is said if you are one of these people, this film is MUST. In fact, I think that for major stores it should be obligatory to sell a copy of who buys the first bong. What Monty Python is a holy grail is geeks and fools, so this movie is on potheads. For the first time, I've seen this movie ten years ago and I still try it every time. Jokes perfectly testify to lifestyle, much more than in recent days as a knock-out like a Half-Baked attempt. <br /> <br /> There is no conspiracy, so I'm talking; The film is rather a collection of different skeets; as the filmmakers walk past Los Angeles in their legendary haze. In spite of this, the film has a great feeling of pace and does not concern itself at all. Many people quote Up In Smoke as the best work of C & C, but I have to say that the next movie is better. So if you're in the mood for an hour and a half of laughing laugh, light up, tune and let your mind swim away =) <br /> <br /> Oh, and FREE TOMMY CHONG!
