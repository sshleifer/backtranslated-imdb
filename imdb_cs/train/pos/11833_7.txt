White Man + Progress + industrialization = BAD. First peoples + nature + animals = good. Simple formula. Actually, in the past days, the same propaganda was used to defend the status quo; now used to attack. However, this has been said, I think the film succeeds in overcoming hackneyed politicization because it plays on the themes of freedom and the original nature in a way that appeals to everyone. Maybe you're not in the revisionism of the movie about how the West was won, it's lost. But everyone can feel a sense of desire after the days when the horses could go on the western plains. (The film also skips the fact that there were no horses in America before the evil white man brought them there). Anyway, I liked it. The quality of animation - especially the opening shot - is incredible.
