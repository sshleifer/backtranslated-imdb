I really do not like both Shrek movies. (As they are their "PG" and have words in them, I would never have said that, so I did not like it.) But as for the "Spirit: Stallion Cimarron", which I barely followed for the first time last month, became a fan of animated films other than Pixar. *** Spoilers ahead *** In "Spirit: Stallion Cimarron" a horse's foal is born and eventually becomes the leader of his hearing. One night he sees a strange light in the distance and he approaches him. This event eventually leads to its capture and a few other things. Throughout the movie we hear stories. It's over the thoughts of the spirit, even though the horses never speak. That's what makes the movie so goo. They (movie makers) discovered real horses to make the sounds of horses; none of these sounds were created by humans. <br /> <br /> The spirit meets Rain, a beautiful mare and Little Creek, the original American who owns the Rain. Little Creek later releases the Spirit and Rain, walks home. I have never been a big fan of Brian Adams but in the near future I want to buy the soundtrack of this movie. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you will not regret it. My score: 10/10
