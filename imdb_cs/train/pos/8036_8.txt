Some guys think the sniper is not good because his part was not good enough. If you consider it an action movie, this view might be quite true because the action part of this movage is not really exciting. But I think it's more a psychological drama than action. The film mainly told us about the interior of two snipers who had definitely different personalities and different experiences. Tomas Beccket, who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed killings, looked as if he was cold. However, after Beccket showed his dream of Montana, we can see his softness inside. It was a cruel war and a victim of his partners that caused Beccket to become a so-called cold heart. Millar, on the other hand, was a new corner, a green hand and was not even qualified as a sniper. Billy Zane did quite well to show Millar hesitation and fear when he first tried to "put a bullet in his heart" (as Beccket said). What he thought about the current suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished, and then he could safely return and get the price. These two guys were completely different in their personality and I think the film has successfully shown the difference and impact they had on each other due to the difference in their personality. These two snipers were arguing, suspicious, and finally they came to understand the communications and what they did to help save the other. <br /> <br /> Sniper is not a good action movie but a good psychological.
