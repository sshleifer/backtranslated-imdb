Tommy JOnes and Matt Dillon make the gambling world proud. Various wrist movements had to be taught, because crapsing craps is a skill in itself. <br /> <br /> There are some surprises. As cynical as we are today, I fully expected that a "good girl" would cry over her grave instead of his buddies. Especially with her notes of "going to the funeral of her best friend" when she meets Matt for the first time. And then, of course, you expect Matt to kill a man who threw the acidic acid in Mr Allen's face and blind him (Bruce Dern's interesting role). WRRROOONNNNGGG !!! some of the other Hollywood endings have happened, but writing is so excellent, acting so carefully processed that you are unknowingly well. And the music is FROM THE WORLD. It takes us back to the 1950s when our "native passions" were first unleashed by Ray Charles and Bo Diddley. Even the tiny racism that had struck in Chicago with his ugly head, but in a club called "Biloxi," with a confederate flag that supported racist remarks. I'll watch it again just to hear the music. Good thing I have a FACTOTUM sound track so I can listen to it in the car. Watch both of them together and see Matt ripe ... playing barcode characters in both. Well, having a bar at Paramount HOtel in NYC, he probably has a great opportunity to study. A great actor, he just got into his own. It shows gently graduated performances ... good and bad in his characters. His "young farm boy" is a great study that is particularly scary due to his bassett-hound eyes. She loves, convincingly too. Since she was in teenage Diana Lane movies, I wonder how you ... you love the actress you grew up with. Adds conviction, I'll say it.
