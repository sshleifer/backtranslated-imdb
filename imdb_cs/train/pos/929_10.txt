Father of Pride was the best new show that hit television from a family husband. It was another masterpiece of talented people in Dreamworks Animation. Like The Simpsons, the show focuses on a nuclear family (in this case, on white lions). It also contains many unforgettable supporting characters such as Roger dirty orangutan, vincent italian-American flamingo, eccentric white tigers Blake and Victoria, faux patriotic brothers Snout and Chutney elephant. Other stars of the show are Sigfreid and Roy. They are incredibly eccentric and they do everything magnificently, making the most difficult activities fun. Combining cute animal characters and dialogue with adults and controversial themes (drugs, prejudices, etc.) is a source of brilliance for the program. <br /> <br /> NBC is blamed for the failure of this show. They decided that the episodes would not be broadcast in a certain order (perhaps they would be influenced by what guest stars could promote) rather than a more logical production order. Several times the show was ruled out for another half hour of such an attack as the Biggest Loss (as if it were not enough for 60 minutes)! It's really a bad sign for the future of television as an art if such an original and courageous show fails, while Fear Factor and American Idol dominate. Fortunately, the complete series was released on DVD and the show now has the opportunity to get more results. 10/10
