For those of us Baby Boomers who have come too late to celebrate James Dean et. Martin Sheen showed us the way in this great function. The premise is pretty easy: a cool hood meets with a small city sheriff and All-Hell, but the nuts and bolts of this movie will enchant the walnut car in us all. <br /> <br /> No, it's not Casablanca, it's not great literature, but it's a serious movie about cars, rebellion and genius that's Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this and appreciate it for what it is and for what will happen to Martin. I loved a movie that grew up as a teenager in the 70s, and you too.
