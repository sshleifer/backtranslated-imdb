Eddie Murphy Delirious is by far the most fun thing you ever see in your life. You can compare it to any movie, and I will assemble that you decide that Delirious is the most funny movie ever! This movie is about 1 hour. 45 minutes, and for all this time there was not even a moment when I was not interfering. You'll laugh an hour after it's over, over and over again in your head. Eddie Murphy has performed so many fun shows about his career (48 hours, business places, Beverly Hills Cop, Raw, Coming To America, The Nutty Professor, Shrek, etc.) But it's by far his BEST VOTE. I've seen this movie so many times, and it's always fun. Never lose edge. From this day forward, any great stand up performance will be emulated from Delirious. ***** and two inches up!
