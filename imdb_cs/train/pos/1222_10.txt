I spied on a short DVD on the best shorts of New Zealand, all great, but the French doors were amazing. It starts slowly and you are wondering if something happens. Just as you release yourself into a drum drum home refurbishment, the most spookiest thing happens. <br /> <br /> EEEEkkk, I wanted to stop watching but I was stuck. <br /> <br /> The film is immersed in the primary fear of darkness and little, if not some, special effects. It bumps you straight into the bone. A simple but brilliant concept opened up all those memories when I was young and did not try to deal with the most likely but scary situations. <br /> <br /> Film-makers of visual style shudder and the lead character convinces you with the story. It's a good short shot I have not seen before. <br /> <br /> French doors have all the features of great features, unfortunately they end in ten minutes or so. However, it is a great end that asks you to want to know more. <br /> <br /> He loved it and did well and thanks for the ride. These New Zealanders really bring out talent. New fan.
