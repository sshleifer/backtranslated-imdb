This film was shot on the spot at Gerard Gardens in Liverpool and was the UK's response to films such as 'Blackboard Jungle'. The film is a fairly good test of time, with all the moral stories still (or even more) relevant today. The film has some outstanding performances from some notable British actors such as David McCallum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood. Baker plays a Liverpool cop for teenage detention, with the assumption that if you catch kids at an early age, they will ultimately be responsible for the adults. Notable accidents in the film include Freddie Starr Fred Fowell) and Melvyn Hayes (Gloria). Tsai Chin and Michael Chow play brother and sister (they are real brother and sister) who are captured in the arson site. Tsai Chin is still acting and is seen in the last film by Nicole Kidman Interpreter. <br /> <br /> The violent playground has a siege weapon at school so it is unlikely that it would appear on TV after similar events in Scotland / Russia. I lived in Gerard Gardens, where the film was shot (although not born at that time), and have beautiful memories of this area. I recently completed a Gerard Gardens documentary featuring excerpts from "Violent Playground" and a small British film "Coast to Coast" starring Lenny Henry and Pete Postlewaite. The halls were destroyed in 1987 and the movies somehow kept memory. <br /> <br /> When the movie was launched, some complaints from the residents appeared because the film displayed the area with poor light. Time helped heal the injuries. <br /> <br /> A small jewel of the film, I would recommend that you look for this
