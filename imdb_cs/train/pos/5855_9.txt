If you played "Spider-Man" in the PS version, you've seen it all. To actually experience, you should get a DC version. Simply put, it's a much better graphics; textures are sharp, levels are easy to navigate and have a much better sound, then it's PS cousin. I bought this game back in the late '00s and still hold until this day. Well, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is a much better and more strategic game, but if you're a fan of 'ol Web Head, then I owe you to pick it up for your game library. Swinging around town, because Spidey never looked so good and dead in the video game. If you have Dreamcast, pack it cheaply. The DC version is simply unbelievable.
