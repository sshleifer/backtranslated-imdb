Are you a giraffe? ... ask John for Nadia, and she certainly answers well, she answers: yes. In this way, communication begins between a man and a woman who does not know each other, and questions and doubts in the "Birthday Girl". The movie I've heard many times, but I dare not realize it ... until it's two hours to write. "Birthday Girl" is a passionate film that caused me, at the same time that Nicole Kidman is one of the best actresses (apart from being pretty and intelligent) I've ever seen. "Birthday Girl" is the story of a lonely and routine person looking for a woman on the Internet. The woman he finds comes from Russia. She seems to be a delicate woman, normal, no more. One day her birthday comes suddenly, his cousin and his girlfriend. The person begins to discover certain things. Because he will not be the only lonely and routine man he has ever been. Most of us think that this movie is just an ordinary movie with an exploited conspiracy. Many of us think that action and excitement are certain and do not have a novel. But "birthday girl" is just the opposite. This film is full of good surprises, good performances and imaginative plot that I have never seen or imagined. This romantic thriller with some funny touch is an excellent natural film with a number of designs for films of this kind. "Birthday Girl" has a certain beauty and indifference in her scenes, but also a touching nature and makes it deeper. "Birthday Girl" is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes violent, but at the end is totally satisfying. And I'm not sorry to say it's a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> * I apologize for the errors ... well, if they exist.
