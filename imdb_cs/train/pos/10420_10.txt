Big Caruso displays unique talents of Mario Lanza. It shows a great acting capacity and is in the top form as a lyrical singer, paired with Dorothy Kirsten, the soprano of the Metropolitan Opera. I really can say that he performs some songs better than Caruso (check A'Vuchello from Tosti and La Danz from Rossini). The arts and music department of MGM also worked well. This movie could be perfect, it was not for the unpleasant presence of Ann Blyth; we see that he is the best, dressed in the style of the fifties in the scenes just before 1920 - unforgivable. Lanza deserves a better front lady, and Blyth should hold less demanding productions. Also note that Ms. Kirsten sings most of the opera duets from the movie with Lanz and gives the wrong idea that Caruso has a kind of permanent front soprano.
