Some people could call a childhood movie "Paulie", but I would say it's more than that. Probably more than anything else, this film has been successful to a large extent to show the situation of immigrants in the United States - current due to recent debates. He was telling a parrot who told the Russian immigrant guardian (Tony Shalhoub) about how he was looking for America for his original owners, the film tells a few stories. There is an elderly woman (Gena Rowlands) with whom she became friends, then a Mexican immigrant (Cheech Marin) and others. Overall, it's a very well-done film. Usually, I do not expect much from these kinds of movies, but this is a cure. I certainly recommend it. Also played by Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado.
