Seven young people go to the woods to look for a bear. They are all scared and frantically murdered by a crazy Vietnamese veteran. "Trampa Infernal" is a very entertaining Mexican slasher that reminds me of a lot of "The Nude Boys". fast pace and there are some good death scenes such as throat whip or ax in throat.But not many gore, so grand-guignol fans will be disappointed.However, if you are a fan of slasher movies give this rarity look. Mexican horror moves are quite obscure (I only saw "Alucarda" and "Do not Panic"), so this should be another reason to see this nice slasher. My rating: 7 out of 10.Highly recommended.
