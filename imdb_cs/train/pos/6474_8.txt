I strained into it and could not wait for every episode. Activity has brought to life how emotionally missing a person in the family has to be along with the effects it should have on the closest ones. The only problem we had as a family was how quickly it was "explained" at the end. Have we not heard clearly what has been said, and have no idea what Gary is involved with? Why did Kyle call him and why did he go with him? After investing in a five-hour series, we felt a scam that only five minutes were held for the conclusion. I asked, and none of my friends would watch it wiser. Very weird, but maybe we missed something vital ????
