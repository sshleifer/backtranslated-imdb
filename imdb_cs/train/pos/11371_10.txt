This is truly a remarkable cinematographic success. From the very beginning, I was totally involved in the (true) story when Colonel Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) is crying when performing autopsies on the remains of children's bodies. That's the convincing story of Andrei Chikatilo, starring Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, it plays so well and so sympathetically that the viewer almost begins to fly him until we remember what he is. Dr. Psychiatrist Alexandr Bukhanovsky, famously played by Max Von Sydow, was utterly believable in every detail, and the point he makes when he speaks of paranoia in the Soviet Union is too obvious by the behavior of local Commissar Bondarchuk, played by Joss Ackland. For me, it was a great performance from Donald Sutherland, who again proved what a really great actor in the movie. I was almost in tears when he told Burakov that the FBI was watching so closely and admiring his work. This film gives the silence of the lambs in the shade, from atmospheric and bleak Soviet landscapes to the superlative performances of all those involved. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 10/10
