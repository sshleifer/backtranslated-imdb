Fido is a very special film. And in many ways, very good. <br /> <br /> My first thought after browsing was how the hell is going on the market? If Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy about zombies, Fido is a boy, and his story about dogs blends with comedy nostalgia with fifty zombies. It's not exactly a language trip. <br /> <br /> Fido has little Shaun's bloodshed, gore and his belly laughs. It's a completely different animal (forgive the game). <br /> <br /> Fido starts with a black-and-white information film that explains the story back - people won the war against the zombies by developing a control collar that makes the carnivores difficult for silly servants. At first I thought we were at the fifteenth cold war of paranoia parody and la Matin√©e, but they soon put us into the world of bright primaries and fifty years in the middle - as nostalgia. <br /> <br /> Young Timmy Robinon is a lonely guy who does not fit in school. His mother is a bureaucratic social climber and his father is nervous and disconnected. When she tries to keep up with Joneses, Mom (Carry-Anne Moss) gets a zombie. Jimmy is initially uninterested, but "Fido" (Billy Conelley) soon proved to be Jimmy's great friend. Until his collar flashes ... <br /> <br /> Fido is NOT a horror film, but my problem with the movie is to find out what exactly is. <br /> <br /> A great deal of humor is a light family variety, and sometimes dependence on land is too dependent on the boy and his family / family moments. However, the film is filmed with gorgeously dark, really funny moments, which, despite being welcomed, will provide R for what is a family comedy for a long time. The movie looks beautiful and is greatly performed by all the people involved. <br /> <br /> His heavy tone problems, I hope this movie will find a niche because it's quite a jewel in this year's flood of movie crap.
