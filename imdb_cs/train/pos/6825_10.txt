I was just blowing John Cassavetes's Opening Night. It's his first film I've seen and seems to be on a larger scale, so he feels more of a main stream, but he still does not feel as if he's crunching more than his previous films. That may be what is so intense. There is also something undoubtedly cathartic about watching this movie. It's about what Cassavetes actually made the basis of his career, the ideal he has been making behind the camera throughout his career as a director, and he is speaking here in front. Rowland's character, middle-aged actress Myrtle Gordon, can not play a role in upcoming production as she writes, so she has an impulse unexpectedly after the impulse, leading to what looks like chaos on the stage until she finds the right one. It is a courageously abstract assumption. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that does not stop capturing the innate driving that goes through emotional cleansing. No one understands why Myrtle does many of the things he does, and it is seen and even shown as something destructive, yet it could be best for her. It can be more purification than decay. Departure, cocoon, rebellion, all of this will culminate in a rupture. Cassavetes gives her character a brutal real touch, which is, at first she says hard to say she has nothing to do with her character, yet she is in a quiet but emotionally corrupting fear of being the opposite. <br /> <br /> The last scene, the top performance Myrtle shares with a painfully stolen figure who is dealing with her, is one of the most exciting, fun, heavy, enlightening and pleasant moments I've ever seen.
