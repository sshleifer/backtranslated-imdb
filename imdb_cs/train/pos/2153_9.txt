This movie was charming. The accountant wants more than approved conventional success from life. What makes it work so well and makes it so different from a standard dance film is that it's not really about becoming "great", it's simply looking for a way to express yourself. The big triumph at the end is not a win in the contest, not a new lifestyle, but the simple pleasure of doing what you want to accomplish in other parts of your life. No one knows their passion, they find their peaceful soul. The Japanese background makes delicate oppression and "secret life" of the ballroom, both understandable and personal. We can all be seen in every person.
