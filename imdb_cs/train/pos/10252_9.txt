After watching "Guinea Pig", there are two questions (except, "Am I really a psychopath to watch it?"): "Is it snuff?" The answer is no; although this is the closest thing I've ever seen in the movie Snape Board. And then: "Where the hell did they find the girl?" Because she is tortured in 45 minutes for no reason (in fact, there is nothing else in this movie!): Nails tear apart, with their hands, feet, instruments, worms wounded, ... and much more the last scene (I'm still not sure how they did). Because it belongs to the "Japanese underground scene", it is obvious that it did not get a lot of money. So what was her (their) motivation? I saw it in Japanese without captions, but that's not a problem (no real dialogues, boys just insulted her in several scenes). I have not seen the whole series yet, but the first "Guinea Pig" is not known to be the best. I still rated 8 because if it was the reason people believed that it was snuff, it's a pretty good problem (ask Charlie Sheen actor). But I think they could go on, which they did in the following. <br /> <br /> Another movie I hide from my parents. <br /> <br /> 8/10
