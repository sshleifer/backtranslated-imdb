I have just seen this wonderful Japanese feature film on the 5th Roger Ebert's overlooked film festival at the historic Virginia Theater in Champaign, Illinois. Though this English-headed film has a dance in its hall, the film actually shows the world outside of Japan, as rigid family structures, salaryman and recreation still exist in today's Japan. Writer / director Suo Masauki [I'm following the Japanese habit of presenting the last name and the last name] uses the not so popular theme of the dance hall to show the social fabric of Japan. <br /> <br /> [I also do not use the names of movie characters when world readers may not be familiar with Japanese formal names that may be fooled. We will refer to the actors according to their professional acting name, as stated in the Internet data database. <br /> <br /> Promotes the help of her real wife, professional ballet dancer Kusakari Tamiyo in her first and still just film. She is a dance teacher in her father's dance studio. Yet her real ambition is to compete again in the International Dance Competition, which has been disqualified in the past. No, I do not say "why." Watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Salaryman Yakusyo Koji is the main star of the movie. It's a veteran of about 25 movies since 1979, which gives a sterling idea of ​​the 1940s to a company that has a beautiful woman, a teenage daughter, and has just bought her house. <br /> <br /> </ strong> Yet something of his inner happiness is missing. Check out this movie to learn how to "join" in the ballroom and secretly go to lessons. Most dance figures are freed from the traditional Japanese hierarchy of social structure. They are pleasant and pleasant and pleasant. Of course, this is in sharp contrast to how the structure of Japanese society with philosophy is "a place for everyone and for everyone". The movie has so many funny moments. During many comic moments, almost 1500 spectators came to spontaneous laughter. This proves that the comedy has no foreign language. <br /> <br /> Veteran actor Takenaka Naoto is funny and great as well as Watanabe Eriko. There are two actors with a funny character. <br /> <br /> One could buy and read a text book about the structure of life in Japan, or you can watch this beautiful movie and start to understand how Japanese people grow up in a rather rigid social structure. Watch the movie "Are We Dancing?" is a quick dive into further study and viewing other Japanese films. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. It's funny, it's charming, it'll make you a little crying and it'll warm you. <br /> <br />
