It is no surprise that the writer / director Michael Powell considered his "Emeric Pressburger Wizarding Imagination of 1946" a favorite of his life and death, which is his favorite joint film. Released during World War II, this colorful romantic adventure would only provide tonics for a traumatized, recovering nation who needs good encouragement. After a number of other patriotic war films, "The Archers of this made their most important, cruel and most patriotic of the lot. Very British to preserve the British heritage (Shakespeare, beer, fair play, good manners) is also visibly americanized in its Baroque compositions, technical inventiveness <br /> <br /> A special echo of the classic 1946 "It's a wonderful life," AMOLAD opens in a spectacular sky with one of those joyful voices that teach the earth and the heavens and how great and amazing the world is alive <br /> <br /> Then it goes into the interior of the British cockpit, it hits the flames, the second fighter is dead, it sounds bad, but the connection is soon evident in the events that follow. discovered a rapid fire exchange between British pilot Peter (David Niven) and US radio contact in June (K im Hunter) is stunning in his intimacy Peter, who resigned from dying, nevertheless exhausts a lot of energy, charm and culminates in confessions, and his warm association with June ends with the mutual exchange of "I love you". <br /> <br /> Keeping the charm of the moment, Peter, under the supervision of his Conductor, whose task is to bring him to another world, escapes death and finds himself on the beach. Later, she meets June on a bicycle and immediately matches her body with her voice. <br /> <br /> But when he realizes his mistake, the Supreme Court wants Peter to send him back and instruct the French conductor (Maurice Goring) to take him. But Peter is unstoppable to live for June, and the conductor's fault is, and he is willing to guard his horn. Peter's destiny is finally based on a celestial tribunal and an American prosecutor (Raymond Massey), whose jury consists of several dead war heroes and British delegates. Surrealist examination, which after the recognition of the verdict is dissolved from b / w back to the rich Technicolor, may be a dream, but the final shot at the hospital will confirm the predictable outcome. The abstract (American film title) is used twice: for the first time in black and white, highlighting Peter and his mysterious French guard upwards and crossing the giant statues of Peter's potential lawyers for the court, including Abraham Lincoln and Plato. The second, soft, colorful staircase illumination provides settings for iconic images in the cinema - Peter and Jun frozen side by side, their stunned eyes trapped in the frame and their fate sealed. <br /> <br /> The unlikely affection shared between Peter and June will never change with pride or verbosity; it is treated with nobility and the perception that a couple is already fit enough to be married and simply needs to persuade people of their love to keep them together. <br /> <br /> The French conductor, who can freeze time and human body, harasses many of their key moments together, lectures Peter on history and among his dirty tricks, attracts Peter's book "Best 100 Tricks" and his coffee cup. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> which has a cheerful quality when it is used for heaven scenes, and both are equally compelling. <br /> <br /> The excellent scenario is more than just an imaginative set of designs, with a dialogue that sounds so immediate that it does not feel like it's written or done for the screen. Fun and funny, Powell / Pressburger deserves the same aclamas with their power for color and composition. Made in 1946, the "life and death affair" is one of the films, fresh and inventive, even at this age when CGI would induce its artificial effects, it would probably rid them of their emotional miracles. Other spring changes would include the need to reduce the average seconds for cutting and the inevitable requirement to shorten the dialogue to keep a small margin of attention for most viewers. Powell stretches the spell that subconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first slide and gives him the freedom to experiment with images without betraying the logical development of Peter's situation.
