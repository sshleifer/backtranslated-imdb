I have to agree with Cal-37 it's a great movie, especially for family, Kelly Linch is beautiful, the little girl is really talented and cute, of course Jim Belushi got his stripes! But I really would like to be a piano song if you are a musician or not to watch this movie just for it, you will know what it is.
