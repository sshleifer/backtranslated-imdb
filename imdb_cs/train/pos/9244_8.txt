If you only read a summary description of the plot, this movie will sound like one of the thirties of the last century. The story seems utterly sad, the subject of Maudlin. The power and beauty of this film is cast in direct, earthy performances. I rarely see Jean Harlow showing such a palette of feelings, finishing her rich and subtle nuances. If you look at their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel, there is such an obvious depth of feeling among the main characters. Cruel emotions are so honestly displayed, so true. The final sequence is almost unbearably tangible: when Clark Gable looks with such joy and surprise on his son, he picks it up and proudly says, "My boy!" I could not help remembering that his son, Gable, was born after death. This is one of the best examples of cinema-era depression.
