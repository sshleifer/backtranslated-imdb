I promised I had seen a "Speed ​​Racer" but I never really saw him, and I also saw other shows that featured these characters dressed as birds flying on a Phoenix ship and the other was spinning around a spaceship , which looked like a giant ocean vessel, and for some reason flew back and it was really dark and hard to understand for someone maybe five. This time I watched almost every episode and at that time I was amazed that this show had some distinction. In fact, it's over, the criminals who have done, unlike most American caricatures, where nothing really ends, like the last episode of one generation of Transformers that ended up with Galvatron and this new evil guy who promised that Autobots, Dungeons and Dragons with the kids never do it at home, with GI Joe and Cobra still ready to try out again and so on, and so on. This end was over and he had a lot of great robots that got new weapons at the show, it was somewhat insignificant because he could not fly and had only a few cool weapons. As it happened, he had a great shooter like the Android 16 that used Cell in Dragonball Z, and the weapons developed to include the shavers they fired. Then the big robot even got his wings to fly and even more weapons were incorporated into the wings. He would also get a few allies in a feminine robot, rather humorous, named Bobo in America. The villains did not consist only of Dr. Hell, but a really strange man who was half a man of half the women and a guy with a flying head. Interesting performance and it was quite nice to see the conclusion.
