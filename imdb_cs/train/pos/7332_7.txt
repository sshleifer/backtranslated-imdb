I watched the excerpts from it as a child, but even though I bought the Blue Underground set immediately because of its Limited Edition, I'm only now fitting into my viewing schedule - mainly because Bakshi is an American Pop (1981) just discovered on late nights on Italian TV (see my reviews of this movie below)! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I found the film as a very good animated epic with a sword and a sorcerer who had a particularly impressive backdrop (rather unpleasant rotoscopic characters were less) scores. The plot was not original again, but it was undoubtedly able to get involved in a youthful level, and the figures were well developed - the ingenious Ice-Lord Nekron and the mysterious warrior Darkwolf; the hero and the heroine are rather insignificant stereotypes - but you can hardly complain when Bakshi and Frazetta portray the girl just as well (her bra can be torn off) and puts on the boots (her tiny panties are forever disappearing)! Still, it is definitely an action-oriented work that certainly brings to this front (that Darkwolf is especially wild); the final final show, although short, is also carefully crafted and sees our heroes surrounding the pterodactyls that attack the crowds of villains inside the cave. In the long run, besides the aforementioned backdrops of Frazett, the main challenge of this film is now his nostalgia for me to bring me back to children's days when I watched not only films such as CONAN THE BARBARIAN (1982) and THE BEASTMASTER (1982) animated TV series like BLACKSTAR (1981-82) and HE-MAN and MASTERS UNIVERSITY (1983-85). As for the accompanying "FIRE AND ICE" (TV) (Mark Bakshi, 1982) ** 1/2: <br /> <br /> Vintage featurette on an animated sword and witch movie that is only available through squeezed VHS print owned by Ralph Bakshi himself! These are details of rotoscopic technique and also show some examples of live events (in the studio) of the scenario segments - which would then be monitored, mixed with the background and shot. However, watching several so-behind-the-scenes featurettes on the art of animation (on Disney Tins and Looney Tunes sets, for example), it's not to do for a very convincing piece ...
