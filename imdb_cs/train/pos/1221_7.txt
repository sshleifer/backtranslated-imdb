The longest time I enjoyed this film was better than the original Care Bears movie. In the summer I saw them together and decided I was wrong. The first is a better bear care film (as you may have guessed when you read my review of it). This is not a BAD movie, it's just ... VERY STRANGE. Well, first, as a few people mentioned, she totally rejects any knowledge of the first film. I can not think of another continuation that is inconsistent with the original so unenviable (especially with the genders of some characters and how they all met). When I was young and looking at it, I was quite confused and upset. I felt it just like an adult! <br /> <br /> For reasons why the movie is really good (if you separate it from the first movie). I can not think of another movie for young children with DEMON because it's villan! Now I'm not a minute to suggest that the evil demons who want to steal the soul of the campers and Care Bears are good, but I'm sorry it's in SUPREMEY EVIL BEING! It's like the bizarre movie "Santa Claus vs. Satan" from Mexico that you sometimes hear. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the name of the demon is Darkheart, and he wants this chick to help him get the bears of care for giving him special abilities. Very dark for children's film? And I mentioned that Darkheart most often appears as a girl who was born WHINEY VOICED 10 YEAR OLD BOY ??? Oddly! Meanwhile, some other children are in Care-a-Lot, who take care of BABY CARE BEARS! Oh, man! Demons and bears in the care of children in the same movie !!!! <br /> <br /> Needless to say, everything will eventually clear up (but not before we see that Darkheart traps the Care Bears souls in this scary chandler thing in one [surprisingly] deeply worrying scene). But I stayed with the question of when this film found the cult audience they deserve. I could just look at it once.
