Deliverance is the fascinating, scary and sometimes disturbing story of James Dickey, who has become a great film by John Boorman. It's about four businessmen, driven by the men and macho-behavior who spend the weekend on a canoe high up in the mountains. Up there stands in front of every darkest face of man and every worst form of human misery ... poverty, buggery and even physical harassment! These four men intended to travel on the river for adventure and excitement, but their trip soon turns into a odyssey over a violent and lurking mountain landscape, totally alienated from all forms of civilization. All these elements actually make Deliverance one of the most movie films I've ever seen. Despite everything that happens to these men, you pray that you are never in a similar situation. Clean cinemas, Deliverance is also a very important film. John Boorman best (just followed by Zardoz and Excalibur) was - and is still - a very influential film and includes several unforgettable scenes that have already appeared in countless other films. Just think about the amazing music score "Dueling banjos" and, of course, an unforgettable homosexual "hatch like a pig". All actors deliver (haha) the perfect acting. Especially Jon Voight. And he must see the movie!
