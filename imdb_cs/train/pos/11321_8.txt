When I started watching the show, I said, "Oh, no, it's like anger like Elfen Lied and it's not bloody!" And the setting is almost identical when the only young boy lives in a big house alone and then suddenly engages in a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls live with him. is where the similarity stops. The love story is almost as gentle and intense as in Inuiyasha, while children's notes and behavior are scarce. The magical arrangement is a bit frantic because it's about seven people with seven servants fighting for the holy grail, all servants are famous, half of all masters come from the same school, rules of engagement, etc. However, it will soon darken and fade away from the beauty of the drawing and script. Actually, I watched all 24 episodes in one day, and without comparison to animas that I liked more but were from other genres, I have to say I was very pleased.
