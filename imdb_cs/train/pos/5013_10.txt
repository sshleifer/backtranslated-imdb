If people did not know who Barbra Streisand was before, ... (is it POSSIBLE?) ... they surely knew who she was after! This show went to win 5 Emmys, & it looks like one of the best things Streisand ever did. <br /> <br /> It contains 3 acts .... ACT I ... Barbra sings standards from room to room, full of musicians, including segment where she is a small girl again, all finished with a beautiful version of her signature song at that time) ... "People". <br /> <br /> ACT II .... The Bergdoff-Goodman Music Tour, while Barbra sings the slim songs ... it's better than it sounds ... ACT III ..... The Best Part, Just Barbra, musicians, and some great songs like ..... "Happy Days Are Here Again", and "Funny Girl" Medley .... <br /> <br /> In all, much of the television history made of one of the greatest artists in the world!
