I for one I have ruthlessly enjoyed every episode of Pushing Daisies this season and I hope that the strike of writers will not end the brutal end of the beginning of a very good show. Ned is a baker who owns a restaurant in the middle of the city and has a secret talent. Emmerson is a private detective with his own peculiarities, like his love for knitting. Charlotte (Chuck) is once dead, but not a child friend, and the sunny place of Ned's life. Olive is jealous but good heart. Oh, and add a dog. Jim Dale brings all the characters together with his wonderful narration about the show. Chuck, Ned and Emmerson together with Olive and sometimes the dog resolves multiple murder mysteries with the help of Ned's special gift to bring the dead back to life. The show is funny, clean and romantic in a very cute and good way and I would recommend it to everyone.
