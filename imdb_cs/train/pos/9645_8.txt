"Presque rien" is the story of two young boys who have fallen in love during a summer stay by the sea. I do not want to tell it because it's not about what's most important about this movie (but you can be sure it's interesting and original). The best part of this film is cinematography. The visual page "Presque rien" is so amazing that it deserves the highest score. It leaves you enchanted by your beauty. As for the plot, it is shown unevenly, relatively complicated. There is no simple chronology or answers to all the questions the film brings. But that's what makes Presque rien even more interesting. I recommend this film to all people for whom the artistic aspect of movies is very important and will not be disappointed.
