They did it. And, boy, do this fantastically or what? The BBC finally brought the doctor back to our screens on Saturday night where he belongs! And they did it in style! One of the strengths of the new series is Russel T Davies as a writer and executive producer. He is a fan of the show and knows what other fans want, but he is also an experienced writer on his own, so he knows what other people want. Another force, as perfectly shown in this first episode, is Billie Piper and her character, Rose Tyler. Eventually the doctor's partner gets a credible story and a strong nature. It is also nice to see the return of the Autons - a nice nod to the classic series there. <br /> <br /> EPISODA TWO: "The End of the World" - At the beginning of this double law, to show TARDIS "strengths, we end up in the story where the special effects are all! Now they have the technology to create real, monsters - no more rubber suits! Also hints at the end of this episode regarding the new medical past - it is very interesting to kill all Time Lords and make it the only one. <br /> <br /> THREE EPISODE: Unquiet Dead had my future, The first written episode outside of Davies is somewhat flat in some places, but it is complemented by Charles Dickens of Simon Callow and the sudden twist of the plot when it is revealed that the pitiful Gelf is still not so pitiful ... < FOURTH EPISODE: "Foreigners of London" - The consequences of medical events are fully explored in this series, not least with the implications that Rose has run with him. our first cliffhanger, not the best of them, Slitheen are an intriguing villain, although they can look too CGI for their own. <br /> <br /> EPISODE FIVE: "World War Three" - The second part of this story about Slitheen suffers mainly from the same problems from the first. Also, clips from other episodes that come at the end of the current episode are unpleasant and spoil them for people. EPISODE SIX: "Dalek" - Yes! We have the future, the past and the present (ish), but now we get to good things - the return of the doctor's arch-nemesis. I think we can supplement Christopher Ecclestone - he was perfect as a doctor and not in this episode, where we see face pain when he recalls time war and his extraterrestrial nature when the Dalek is almost over. <br /> <br /> EPISODE SEVEN: "A Long Game" - really just a story that acted as a prologue for the final series. Savage Simon Pegg as Smart Editor and Tamsin Grieg in a fun portrait. The media is controlling us - it's never been before, it's got it ... EPISODE EIGHT: "Father's Day" - it's a great episode. Full of human emotions and sorrows for Rose and the real consequences of what happens when you really reverse history. Full marks for Billie Piper here. <br /> <br /> EPISODE NINE: "Empty Child" - I did not find this child very scary. Sorry but no. It's a good episode, though, but the cliffhanger could still be better - these are the "other time" bits that spoil them. John Barrowman is introduced here as Captain Jack, who is a very good player - he is a good actor who is for a while but apparently visible. EPISODE TEN: "Doctor's Dances" - second part Story WW2 - very well worked out in historical contexts. A nice end to the end, though a little confused perhaps for younger audiences when the "mummy" is revealed? <br /> <br /> EPISODE ELEVEN: "Boom Town" - probably the weakest of the series, but that does not mean it's bad. A nice return to Slitheen, as well as an interesting doctor and rose study. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TWELVE: "Bad Wolf" - it starts quite stupid, with some good heart and humorous entertainment on the popular TV shows above her in Blighty. Things quickly become deadly serious and revelation at the end is the best striker in the series! <br /> <br /> EPISODE THRITEEN: "Breaking Paths" - Goodbye Christopher Ecclestone. A fantastic doctor in many ways, David Tennant must really work socks away to be as good as he. The regeneration scene at the end is beautifully played. Oh, and Dalek are back - in the extreme! God will bless CGI, because they could never take it out normally! <br /> <br /> Overall - brilliant! 9/10
