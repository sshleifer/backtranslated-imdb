Babyface - Notorious Barbara Stanwyck, where her local top teacher tells her she has the power - trying to get her to read Nietzche - says her books will never do well. We found out that her father is basically drank to get local politics and more. Eventually he has enough to move to a big city. We follow her men's path to the success of the international banker. The dialogue is quite noisy, it's time, and it was one of the last films that came out before the Hollywood production code itself. Look at young John Wayne as one of Stanwyck's willing victims. Part of the forbidden Hollywood collection - I watched an extended version - DVD has both versions and Red-Headed Woman and Waterloo Bridge. An interesting movie and a precursor for the future femme fatale role that Stanwyck would play at the time of the movie noir. B +
