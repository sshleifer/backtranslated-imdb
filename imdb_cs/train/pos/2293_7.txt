This is very, very early cartoon Bugs Bunny. As a result, the character is still in the transition period - not drawn as elongated as he later and his voice is not quite right. Moreover, the chemistry between Elmer and the Bugs is a bit unusual. Elmer is some poor juice that buys Bugs from a pet shop - there is no weapon or desire that could explode the rabbit for laughter! However, despite this, it is still a very nice film. Soon the Bugs were definitely louder and harsher than his later incarnations. In later films Elmer, Yosimit Sam and others dealt with it because they started - they killed a rabbit. But in this movie she is much more like Daffy Duck from the late 30s and early 40s - a fool who just loves the excitement of others! The true "anarchist" instead of the hero of later cartoons. While this is not one of Bug Bunny's best cartoons, it's fun to watch and it's interesting to see how much it has changed over the years.
