I'm a big fan of the Beatles. My favorite Beatle is Paul, and my favorite is John. I already knew about Beatles' music and the truth about decay, as well as the family of John Lennon and Paul's band Wings. I was curious how this film will handle the relationship between John and Paul for so many decades. <br /> <br /> This movie was not disappointed. Although the story itself is a fiction, many references used by two musicians were very accurate. Among them is how Yoko Ono would always be with John, wherever he went, Wings song "Silly Love Songs", which became a hitletem of that year, and a concert on the roof of Apple Studios, which played music from the album "Let It Be." <br /> <br /> And the actors did a very good job playing John and Paul. The accents could have used a little more work, but it seemed to work a lot like I read two former Beatles who behaved like. I also enjoyed the dialogue between them, which was essentially the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I finally disappointed at first, but the more you think about it, the more you appreciate it, especially because it was how it really went into real life. They also show fantastic sketches from "Saturday Night Live," in which the Beatles are offered $ 3,000 per show. (compared to others that offered $ 220 million) Overall, I was not disappointed with this movie. It really gives you a sense of why the Beatles have broken up and why they never came back together.
