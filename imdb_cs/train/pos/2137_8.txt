It's much more than a glamorous middle-aged story that finds pleasure in the dance floor (even if it is). It is the story of a single person who learns to love life again, pushing for all the pressures of labor and money to regain pleasure. The bonus in this movie is a fascinating glance at the slowly changing attitudes of modern Japan toward the dance floor, up to physical contact. There are scenes that will pick you up aloud ... a couple you want to get up and tango ... and many more where you will feel good. <br /> <br /> This is a great introduction to contemporary Japanese filmmaking for those who may have the impression that all Japanese films are "hard" and inaccessible. <br /> <br />
