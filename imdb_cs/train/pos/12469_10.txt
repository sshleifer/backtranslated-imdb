It's a great movie. I think some people think it may not be based on a true story. No matter what, the movie is great and everything can think that's no reason why a balloon with a sea-level balloon will end up flying on a sailboat, and so on, instead of thinking that the "little girl's wish" it means that all our peaceful dreams will become a reality if we trust in us and do everything in this world to make them true. The little girl (Desi - in the movie) and her mother were the best actors I've seen for a long time. Good for all, for all actors, all for the director. If anyone can tell them, tell them: "A 25 year old Romanian boy thank you for filming this movie."
