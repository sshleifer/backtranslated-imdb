When I heard fairly positive reviews and saw a trailer, I had to see this movie. With William Macy, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter, and Sam Rockwell it must have been good. And he delivered it. Overall, the movie is not funny, but there is one scene that really stands out and is in my eyes a classic. SPOILER At the end where they break through the wall to get to safety, we see that Rockwell and Washington are staring at Jeter, it's just fantastic. This is as good as the scene in The Big Lebowski, where The Dude uses a chair to block his door but forgets that the door turns out! END SPOILER Just look at this movie, you will not be disappointed.
