Small SPOILERS alert !!! <br /> <br /> Good movie ... Very good movie. And I'm surprised that it's me, because I'm not a big fan of vampires and the sound of director Deran Seraphin usually means bad news. Most of his films are under average action films such as Death Warrant and Gunmen. It was one of his first films, and perhaps he should continue shooting horror films instead of action. This movie really fascinated me. Good luck when we did not see any famous actors or big budget, we were involved. It's really the story that constantly focuses on you. Especially fans of the original Dracula myth will be pleased. Sarafian illuminates another aspect of the famous story of Bram Stoker, and remains a more faithful and true truth. It explains the life of the Count of Dracula and how he fears the Turkish army by throwing dead bodies in front of his castle. Of course, there will be a reality and "based on a true story". Drinking blood and everything Bram Stoker invented. In this film, Count (Vlad Teppish) emigres to the US and seduces many women. And they're all pretty girls, I'll give it to him. Generally, unfamiliar faces, blood and gore satisfies more morbid horror fans and an interesting story. This movie is really unknown and was hidden in the darkest field in my local video reporter. But it is certainly worth cleaning the dust on the lid and put it in the VCR. Hell, it's a lot better than the famous movie Nicole Kidman with the same name. These two films have nothing in common, but I blame the film for casting my attention away from this beautiful little picture. Look at this ... my humble opinion on Die For = 8.5 / 10
