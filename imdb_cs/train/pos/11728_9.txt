There are two things I like about Elvira, and they're both bigger than she and she's holding them up: her joke and her talent. The film is the best thing to show how funny it can be or how attention attaches to it. When it looks like a combined clone of Morticia Adams and Anne Nicole Smith, she inherited the estate of a distant relative only to find she was actually a heiress of the occult. The comedy in this movie is the best thing, but it could have been much more creepy and cooler. It's mostly a campfire with so many bad horror links, like an exciting crowd, or a hero who escapes on the paths and hits the heels. My most favorite part is when she uses her amazing talent to break the chains and keep it in the cemetery. The end is sappingly sweet, as if it were written by Bradys, but Las Vegas acting at the end looks too grandiose for this type of movie.
