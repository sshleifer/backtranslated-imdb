Super Mario 64 is undoubtedly the greatest game ever created. It's so addictive that you can play hours after hours without stopping for a break. I beat the game four times, but I never got all 120 stars ... (I got 111) ... but I hope I will eventually reach it. Although I did not officially play this game until I was seven, I enjoyed watching my sister play. Now I'm 13 years old and I'm still playing, erasing games and starting again. The graphics are incredible for the early N64 game. The game is addictive. The controls are great. Levels are hard but impossible. Bowser struggles are demanding. I would like to tell you more, but why do not you just get it? Put the X-BOX 360, PS3 and Wii away and find Nintendo 64 and play this amazing, awesome game.
