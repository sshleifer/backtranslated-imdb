Prince plays as a "Kid" in this semibiobiographic film of a talented, but narcissistic young musician who has less than a starry home. True, acting leaves a desire to be desirable (with the exception of Morris Day and especially Clarence Williams who are both pitch perfect), but the film is still great and among the best it comes out of the 1980s. He has the best soundtrack to any film of the last fifty years, the highly sensitive lines and the folding scene is HILARIOUS !! Plus Apollonia is simply crazy. It's unconnected when I saw Prince at the concert in 2004, threw out the stadium. He is a professional showman and it was one of the best concerts I've ever had. <br /> <br /> My rating: A Extra DVD: Disk 1) Comments with director Albert Magnoli, Producer Robert Cavallo and director of photography Donald Thorin; Theater trailer; Trailers for "Under the Cherry Moon" and "Grafitti Bridge" Disc 2) 12-minute performance on First Avenue; "Purple Rain: Bachstage Pass," Riffs, Raffs and Revolution: The Influence and Effect of Purple Rain "10 minutes, 30 minutes of MTV premieres Step by Step (when MTV did not drown the donkey sphere ), 5 Prince Music Videos (Let's Fool, Take Me With You, When Doves Cry, I Die 4 U / Baby I'm Star and Purple Rain), 2 Jungle Love and The Bird and a music video for "Sex Shooter" from Apollonia 6 Eye Candy: Apollonia shows her soft ass
