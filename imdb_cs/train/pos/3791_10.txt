Our song is an amazing example of passionate, film-making in an aesthetic sense. In fact, it's a real miracle of the film; a perfect and inspirational artwork that chronicles the lives of three young inner cities (Crown Heights, Brooklyn) of girls during a certain summer in their lives when the distress of their approaching adulthood makes each of them make a number of difficult lives changing the possibilities they are likely to re- who is each of them, as well as how they will concentrate in the years to come. <br /> <br /> Jim McKay wrote / drove elegantly and clearly. There is no sentimental sentiment, nor are there cliches in this movie. What we see here seems that sometimes the heart is infallible. There is naturalism - credibility if you can - in our song that crosses the boundaries of other giants in this genre, including American Graffiti and Cooley High. The bulk of credits for the spirit of film are its main actors. The combined presence of Melisa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Lanisha) and Anna Simpson (Joycelyn) is brilliantly strong. It would be easy - and, of course, fearlessly blunt - to reject as some apparently have, the performance of these three as apathetic or non-emotional. In fact, their silent spell, their instinctive feeling of dignity, and their raw, sometimes unconventional intelligence, in the film are totally boring. One would have to be totally "untouchable" or completely indifferent to the behavior of adolescents who would miss an authentic reputation in what these three young ladies bring to the screen. Equally, supporting cast, especially Marlene Forte as Lanish's mother, perfectly complements the work of three girls as well as the overall tone of the film. Our song is a movie you can not miss - at any age.
