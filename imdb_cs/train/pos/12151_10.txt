This is just an example of what should be for a television movie. It was a lazy Sunday afternoon when we and my wife at school met with us. Cheerful acting. Badly written script. Good guys. Sensory, yet obvious, clich√© and banal assumption. Riding a pickup with your repaired woman-corpse. It's all. <br /> <br /> You meet the famous characters: the gold digging goose, the silly rich boy who wants it himself, the friends - who-you-know-better, the dad who knows better, but he is driving his son away. And wife-corpse. Built. When picking up. <br /> <br /> Wow: And the title. Several things in our life were "Texas Tragedies" because they watched this beauty. Everyone involved in it deserves a medal.
