This is the best movie version of Dicken's classic story. I saw it again and again on VHS and recently I got a DVD version that is formatted for television (not widescreen). What I like in this teleplay is the cast of English actors, which are now recognizable because they have appeared in other North American movies since 1984. My greatest surprise is Edward Woodward, the Equalizer, as the Gift of the Christmas Gift.
