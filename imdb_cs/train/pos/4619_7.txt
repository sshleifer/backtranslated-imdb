At first I was a huge fan of the 1980s and also Jennifer Conelly. So, yesterday, I was hanging around in a local used book and film store and found a copy of VHS. I read back and it sounded good, and for $ 3.99 it was great. So I took her home and put it in the VCR. What a sweet movie! At my age, I'm more focused on movies like Last Night or Fire by St. Elma, but I still remember what it was like to be 15/16 and in love with an older boy, etc., we're younger. And if it does not, we're broken and we think we'll never get. But of course we have it. Many times. It's such a sweet quality I really got from this movie. Feeling "Oooh, I remember when something like that happened to me ..." is all. Characters are interesting and well developed. I recommend it to anyone who likes the 80's, especially teenage movies, or anyone who wants to come back and remember the easier time in life.
