Cinderella was one of the first films I've ever seen, and it's timeless for me. It's a beautiful-looking movie with great animation. My favorite animation scene was the dress scene - I love those mice. Pisces are also beautiful, not as good as snow white, but they are happy to sing and remind Tchaikovsky. Dream is a wish and so is love? are standouts. Characters are also a pleasure. Cinderella is ideal and powerful, and mice provide comic relief. Just like Lucifer, the servants also developed well. I loved my stepmother, it was really bad, compared to the big figure in the name of fairy tale fairy. It is true that the movie is slightly stretched, with the thoughts of the mouse, but it was really funny, so I do not care. I do not think it's overstated, underestimated? It is rarely played on television, but Cinemagic is really a bad one. if you want a great adaptation of Cinderella, try the wonderful Ever After or the rich Slipper and Rose that is not that good. But whatever you do, avoid the sequel that I have a mistake to own because you will thank me. 9/10. Bethany Cox
