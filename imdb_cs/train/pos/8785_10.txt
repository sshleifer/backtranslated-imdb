Some say "The game is the most important thing," or something like that, is attributed to old Bard Avon by William Shakewspeare himself. if it were not an old will, maybe it would be our own super-veteran film director, Mr. Raoul Walsh. There is a large number of his films that would support this hypothesis. None of them is more suitable than GENTLEMAN JIM (Warner Brothers, 1942). The film also gets another prize, which is named by Errol Flynn's own favorite character. This clearly shows on screen the evidence that would easily lead audiences who sat in a dark theater, or view them on their home television or DVD, and close it. <br /> <br /> The story is a very serious Biopic that takes some of the material material and links it with the liberal dose of old fantasy to bring us very satisfying, though somewhat fictitious (what Biopic is not) occurrences. Casting is great because it is a good use of the natural athletics of our leadership, Mr. Errol Flynn. Although it was not Swashbuckler, Western or War Image, this GENTLEMAN JIM is probably the main task that was best suited for a robust Australian. <br /> <br /> Errol was a member of the Australian Olympic Box in both 1928 and 1932. His training and skills in "Sweet Science" are clear evidence throughout the film and especially the "Big Fight" for world heavyweight boxing championship with big John L. Sullivan, Ward Bond) Casting reads as a list of cast Warner Brothers players. She performs as Alan Hale as father Jim Corbet, Livery Wagon * operator. His two brothers are Harry and George (Pat Flaherty and James Flavin), two men in the "blue collar" family, and their calling is called Longshormen. Big Jack Carson makes his usual master serio-comic performance to support as a friend Jim Corbett and colleague of the bank. The rest of those we can recognize and remember are: John Loder, William Frawley, Madeleine LeBeau, Minor Watson, Rhys Williams, Arthur Shields and Dorothy Vaughn. </ P> <br /> <br /> Director Walsh has also used a number of professional wrestlers in the roles of various boxers. That's why we have Ed "Strangler" Lewis and the unknown Grappler *, who appear as 2 naval sailors in the opening scenes. Others were Sammy Stein, Mike Mazurki (did they ever hear about it?) And "Wee Willie" Davis. These boys had a strong but grim look at them that would have older older players at Pier 9. We did not forget the head of Mrs. Alexis Smith. She is strong in her characterization of "independent" women, but in many scenarios she keeps her real abilities like a comic. It is quite a variety in her part as a poor little girl, Victoria Lodge. All these ingredients are a trick in mixing the elements in the right ratio to get the "right" blend. Well, director Walsh does this with ruthless abandonment. Because he is looking for a great movie. His treatment shows all the skills he has improved to fine tuning, beginning with his days as a D.W. Griffith. Mr Walsh seems to have a special interest in this period in the 1990s. *** Mr. Walsh moves through script in a fairly quick clip, smashing exposure scenes with a humorous punch, "Corbetts are up to it again!" Therefore, he is able to keep a light, even humorous, touch on a story that could be too rough and serious. In addition, in an almost unrecognized feature, Brother Walsh gives us an authentic look of San Francisco from the eighties. And as another example of his love for this period, he creates broad, dynamic images of historical threats. There is a vibrant mood in those boxing scenes. As the coronation glory of this great, possibly underestimated film, director Walsh made the picture as if it were an illustration from the Police Journal that covered these events in these "Old Days." <br /> <br /> But one thing to note is one thing. If it's the first time or if you'll see it once again: <br /> <br /> "KORBETS ARE REALLY NEW!" <br /> <br /> * In my humble opinion as a filmmaker and a professional matchmaker, it looks like Tor Johnson, who was later a popular director, Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> ** "Livery" is a somewhat archaic term for a vehicle to rent for local urban transport. <br /> <br /> It's true. Mr. Raoul Walsh was a veteran Griffith. He was an actor portraying John Wilkes Booth in the Nation of Nations (1915). **** Born in 1887, Raoul Walsh was old enough to have his own memories of the 1890s and the Sullivan-Corbett Championship Bout and what it meant for the American sports life of those days.
