Red Eye, a movie that's been looking to see for some time ... Cillian Murphy plays Jack the Ripner's management shot for Assassins, and his literally killer plans to discard a highly profiled man and his family. /> <br /> Everyday woman "Lisa" (I think) is a normal woman, goes to work, at home ... worries ... hates flying. The death of her grandmother sends her to a flight that has been delayed several times. The flight where he meets Jack ... a common, seeming guy until they hear their profession and the plans that accidentally include it is the key to Keefe's death. Successfully rescues ... but almost the cost of her life is taken, Jack is defeated ... Keefs are rescued ... what the story * laughs * just makes fun, the film is really good, really the best last year ... are the little things you need to pay attention to earlier in the movie that play MORE meaning for the movie later. .. (pens Frankenstein) I w several times she did it before she caught all the little jokes and sadness ... She must see for sex fans no thriller, but there is a slight hint (bathroom scene) (Jack) "Thanks for quicky" and (female operator) "Ohhh ... it'll be ONE of those flights" (second female operator) "Hey! this is not a motel" you get an idea ...
