Blob is a classic science-fiction B-movie from the 1950s. You probably know the story: two teenagers (Steve McQueen & Aneta Corsaut) see the meteorite fall to the ground, and when they go looking, they hit the old man with some strange ... a blob attached to his arm. They take him to the doctor's office and then find out what's happened. From there, the duck expands and eats all on their way. The special effects are fun as well as the story. There are lots of great shots, like a policeman who plays chess over a radio with a policeman in another neighborhood. It is no masterpiece, but it has a special place in its genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 8/10.
