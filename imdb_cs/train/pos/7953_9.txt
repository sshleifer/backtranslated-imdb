This is the story of two dogs and cats looking for a way back home. An old and wise Golden Retriever Shadow, a young American Bulldog Chance, and a Himalayan Sassy Cat fleeing from the ranch and going into the wilderness to rejoin their family. : The Incredible Journey (1993) is a family adventure by director Duwayne Dunham. It's a remake of the film from 1963. This film was won three years later. Michael J. Fox is the perfect man to make a voice for Chance. Fox has some young energy that brings him to the role.Sally Field does a great voice job as Sassy.Don Ameche is fantastic like Shadow.This was the second veteran actor's second last film.Also visible actors are great.Kim Greist plays Laura Burnford-Seaver .Robert Hays is Bob Seaver.Benji Thall starring Peter Burnford.Veronica Lauren is hopeful Burnford.Kevin Chevalia is Jamie Seaver.Jean Smart shows Kate.It is quite amazing to watch these pets trying to survive in the wild. We see Sassy the accepted river and she looks like ag oner. The bear scene is out and funny. Chance does not have a chance with that big, hungry bear. And his encounter with porcupine looks painful. This is some great fun for the whole family.
