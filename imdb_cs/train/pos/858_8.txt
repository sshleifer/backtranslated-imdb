This movie has a rotten core of elastic morale and a marvelous sense of justice. So many regular Joes among us would like to "hold it MAN". "MAN" in this case is represented by several different characters. Mr. Keller, whom Carla reports in her office. Later, Paul owes 70 owners to Mr. Marchand and the club's owner. And then Paul's Pass is here. There seems to be much question about the later story of the last person. Reviewers point to the weakness of the otherwise well-developed underground ping-pong game between our two protagonists, escalating tit-for-tat until their lives dramatically change. They are all agents of "MAN". One or both of them could be released, killed or imprisoned if they did not do as they were told. The film has a feeling of relief at the end. Carla finally puts it. Her boss is driven out of smell. Mr. Club Owner is a messy mess in his bathroom. They will get $. And ... they do not have to worry about reporting to Parol because his moral weakness has led him to hide him in the basement (or what the police found to be arrested). This is a critical subconscious trigger lock that stretched us so tightly. It does not matter that someone else can get Paul's folder later to oversee his release; for the moment they are free! They could even get away with it! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
