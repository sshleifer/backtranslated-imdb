Both visually and musically stunning. Eye and ear treatment. The quintessential Victorian element of the introductory sequences was absolutely enchanting and helped create a Christmas scene that Dickens would be rightly proud of. Technically, the production is visually stimulating and the special effects are both imaginatively invented and creatively achieved in traditional settings. The dance of many lead artists is amazingly good. Photography and lighting are first class and sound recording admirably matches the overall high level of technical skills. A great movie for the whole family at Christmas time and the most beautiful discovery that can withstand multiple watching.
