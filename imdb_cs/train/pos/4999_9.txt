I got late for this show - believe it was the third and last episode when you first watched it - and blew out a social commentary that was not seen on American television from "everything in the family". <br /> <br /> <br /> It was very surprising that CBS would even launch it first. The goal is only to say that CBS last time had a set - if you know what I mean - Day "All in the Family". The most controversial decisions that today are willing to address is how much eye makeup for Katie Couric. <br /> <br /> If you want to make a lot of people really crazy-let them discover the truth about yourself. And if you want them to be willing to pull strings, call and get the work Art removed - let them discover the truth by hearing their own words spoken from their own mouth. The Aardman have always been ahead of us. And this show is no different. Somehow it happened under CBS's "corporate / social / political / censor radar" to get into the timetable (perhaps "big brass" never saw it until it finally broadcast it?), But once a good middle-class audience heard it, that they are alone - well, they can bet on the farm that the message or the messenger will not last long. Now if only "missing episodes" can find a way to Usenet or bittorrent ;-) <br /> <br /> Thank you BC Kelly Tallahassee Fla
