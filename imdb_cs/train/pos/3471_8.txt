Recently, cable TV opens a film with a disclaimer that forbids any real-life collaboration; which in itself is an eye. Still, scriptwriting and acting from the main characters is excellent and I found myself fascinated around the world. In no way is it a sharp, thoughtful and interesting dialogue. The film is about meeting one day between two real musical "legends" that were previously composed and separate. The film captures the essence of their lives and philosophies in a story that explains their initial "division." What is so impressive is that actors give such seemingly realistic depictions of characters they play, mistakes, and all that at least this viewer believed I was witnessing a real event in almost every detail. The great skill of this game is that with prominent writing and gentle film playing, essentially "two of us" can speak a perfect picture. Rate at least 8 out of 10.
