The three remarks about W. Somerset Maughan's novel are the best and not especially because what John Cromwell brought to the film. The film is worth seeing for breaking through the performance of Betty Davis, who, as Mildred Rogers, showed the film industry that she was a star. Finally, her matches with Jack Warner and his studio paid off mainly. The film dominates Mildred from the beginning. We realize that Mildred cared for Philip and will never be. She does not hide her contempt for this soul who has fallen in love with a bad woman. Mildred will be humiliated again and again because he can not bend about what he really is. Poor Philip Carey, besides being a handicap, is a weak person. When he tries to adhere to Mildred, he rejects him. When Mildred returns to him when he is fragile and defeated, he rises to the occasion, overcomes his own dependence on this terrible woman who has stolen his will and his masculinity. Bette Davis gives a fantastic view of Mildred. It was one of her best roles and she escaped with it. Her disgust toward the sweet Philip is clear from the beginning of their relationship. When she tells her that her mouth is washed when she kisses her, it's one of the most powerful moments in the movie. Leslie Howard cheated Philip and showed he was even weaker than he. Frances Dee, Reginald Denny, Alan Hale and Reginald Owen are in small roles. <br /> <br /> This is the Bette Davis show and do not forget it!
