David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play a young couple of journalists who want to go to California, but they can not really afford it, and together with another young couple (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis) they can save on spending. to stop at various murder sites, in places where serial killers did their thing, because Brian (Duchovny) is a writer and Carrie (Forbes) is his photographer. What he does not know is that Pitt (Earley) Lewis is a serial killer and girlfriend who goes with what he says: Pitt is not usually interested, but he manages psychological roles, scary is that he does so well, actually he knew people as before, no, not killers, but with almost the same attitude. Anyway, when she travels the road, Carrie thinks the others are out of money, but Earley looks like .. I use to leave someone dead here and there to make it stand out, she's not too clear she has a good heart, but she does not understand the fact that she does not have to struggle to beat Earley when he does something he does not like. When things start to become more unacceptable, Carrie insists that the other couple is at the gas station and unfortunately it's where she's inside to see a newsletter telling her exactly who they were driving with, they get down. It's not the best in the world, but it's not bad ... I looked at what was to be the "unrated" version, but I wonder how much was dropped from the nominated version because it seemed to me, really ... not that it would mean family fares or anything else if it were not Manson's family. 7 out of 10.
