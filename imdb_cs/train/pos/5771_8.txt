This is one of the movies you meet when you were surfing a channel on Saturday afternoon, and you were tugging on it and eventually watching the whole thing. I thought it was well done, and I really felt the characters. Although it is a bit slow movement, it focuses on the relationship between Bonnie and Clyde and their family members, it has never been boring. In fact, we do not see too many robberies for which they were so legendary, and instead most of the shootings take place when the cops are attacked. I thought Tracey Needham, who played Bonnie, really worked with her character. Walking from a beautiful country girl to a cold-blooded killer is a challenging thing that portrays and I enjoy the finesse that she has brought to the role. Overall, the effort was above average, especially since it was for television.
