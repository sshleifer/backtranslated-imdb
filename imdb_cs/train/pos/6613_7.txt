Unique Sci-Fi animated movie and sincerely I like uniqueness no matter how it is, better or worse. This French film is quite interesting, the technical part is innovative, such as "Waking Life", which I recently watched. It took me a long time to get used to the black and white style, but eventually I like it, a sketch-like picture is really fantastic! The contracted future world is the symbol of the ultimate destination of the human race, which I love it very much. The whole conspiracy is fine for sci-fi, not so interesting, but it's okay, just like some Hollywood products, a huge plot about human eternity, a little clich√© and a twisted end is not so convincing that some development is simply plain and awkward the movie is too long. So I think I love the style that this film shows, the others are not that good. For the eternity of life I think most people have come to unanimity that we do not want eternity because it destroys the meaning of life, we lay down our lives because they are limited and meaningful if everyone can live forever, the world world becomes disaster and chaos. Keeping someone you love is hard and heartbreaking, but that's also a way to show that our lives are real and that all emotions fill their lives and make the world colorful and alive.
