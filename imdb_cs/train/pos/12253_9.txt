This has long been one of my favorite Austen novels. Though it certainly is not in the same category as the magnificent "Pride and Prejudice", "Emma" is a fresh and relatively faithful television version of Austen's novel - especially due to its short length. The biggest change between the novel and the film is good because the unnecessary snobbishness that Austen puts at the end of the story is removed and replaced by something much more similar to Emma in the rest of the book. I thought the characters that were chosen to render the roles were well-chosen. Kate Beckinsale walks through the fine line between the girl and the soccer snobby with a grace completely lost in Gwyneth Paltrow '96. Samantha Morton's blond blonde adjusts to her attitude, and the character as a simper that accompanies her role in the previous features replaces Harriet, who we know from the book. Mrs. Knightly's role is, in my view, very successful; how serious and gentle compassion with which the hero is filmed in the novel are here in this neglected, luxurious movie.
