I enjoyed watching this movie very much. This is a great direction, known as Bigas Luna, born in Spain. And in Spain, the films are held in Catalonia to be more accurate. Luna again explores the theme of bankruptcy, in this case the retreat of a young boy for women milk. There are some psychological concepts in this story, such as the refusal complex that the older son feels with the birth of his brother. In the movie, this leads to the retreat of a young boy who suddenly sees that all breast milk goes to a recently born son. So she starts trying to find a breast that is able to feed it. She finds her in a recently arriving woman and there's a movie around. <br /> <br /> This movie lives a lot in the pictures, more than the story itself, the observer captures certain moments (unforgettable moments) and some symbols (the film deserves to analyze almost everything that happens because it usually means something. .). Surroundings, landscapes typical of the area, as well as surreal character behavior, also symbolic, and the excellent ambiguous soundtrack by Nicola Piovani bring us to a different dimension that is not parallel to the real world but which is mingling from time to time ... It is worth , that we live in this world, it is worth watching this movie, even if we get tired and a little ill for a while with excessive relief that may be overcome ... <br /> <br /> <i> I also enjoyed the performance heroes ... 8/10
