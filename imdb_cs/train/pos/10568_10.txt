I loved this movie, seen tonight on the big screen of cinema! The audience laughed loudly about some interesting things, and the fast pace was most enjoyable. As a singer and music director, I questioned one section of Roby Keeler's vocal in "U vodop√°du". "The key was modulated and suddenly sang in a very downward, very subtle voice that did not differ in a slightly sensitive, higher twitter voice she had used in all her vocals, does anyone know if this was exaggerated by another singer? <br /> <br /> Thank you very much.
