It was just this to be seen at the Vancouver International Film Festival in 2003 and it was fun, like hell and a little unreal. It is held in Toronto, where these two defeats live in this haven in the middle of the highway. David Hewlett (PIN, CUBE, CYPHER) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) are just great because of both the defeats who want the world to leave. Play, dialogue and writing are very good and the whole movie looks great for such a low budget. Director / writer Vincenzo Natali took part in this screening and seemed to be so intelligent on the ground. This man is so inventive with these great stories that work so well in small budgets, giving Hollywood a great budget to shame!
