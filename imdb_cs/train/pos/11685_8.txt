I found this movie really funny because you have a young black comedian (Chris Rock) who dies and is sent back to the country in the mid-1950s. He does not realize that his behavior should change and continue to act the same way he did before. He listens to rap music, sings and plays the stereotyped part of an urban black man. True humor in this film has been following the problems that this behavior has brought to the black community.
