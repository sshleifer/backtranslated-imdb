Five Deadly Venoms are not as bloody and violent as Story Of Ricky or Super Ninjas, but include some of the best hand-to-hand combat sequences in the history of Hong Kong film. Director Chang Cheh creates what many consider to be his masterpiece. This film began the career of five men playing poisons. Meng Lo is playing another bad ass. He will continue on Super Ninjas. Kuo Chui, who is Philip Kwok, will go to the Ricky and Hard Boiled Story. Any fan of the cones can appear. But I still think it's not as good as Super Ninjas (also made by Chang Cheh). But all the chops are good and that's one of the best.
