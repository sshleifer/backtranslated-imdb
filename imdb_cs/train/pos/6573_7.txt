The film has a sense of play right from the start - I think it will be a better game than a movie because the ensemble and dramatization make the film version somewhat artificial. But it still does quite well, and the story and especially the dialogue are interesting. The dialogue was quite accurate, as it is from the real game. Maybe it's a good introduction to Shaw's games. The main figure of Raina's head in the clouds and the taste for the dramatic acting performance of Helena Bonham Carter here does a good job here. Her fianc√©, Serges, is a little cartoon when he really has to be a very nice and attractive figure. Her parents are quite entertaining.
