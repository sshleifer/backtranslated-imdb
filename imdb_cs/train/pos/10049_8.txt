I'm not a parent, not a man. But I was able to identify with every attitude of muscle and pain. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that teenagers should watch. Perhaps they will once again appreciate the value of the family. I apologize for those who do not understand the value of love, family and friendship. It was very interesting to watch Patrick Duffy in a role other than Bobby Ewing. And it's great to see that 19 year-old Ben Affleck is doing his best in moving and sincere performances. He showed at an early age that he was capable of true drama. A more important role should be offered. Note Hollywoodland ... his first serious role in years and he went out and won the Best Actor at the Venice Festival in 2006. <br /> <br /> This film can be rewarded by people of all ages. Maybe they should not be watched by children younger than 10, because they might worry that it could happen to their families, but I recommend it to the whole family. I bought this movie on DVD and watched it with friends many times. Because it displays values ​​that are important in life.
