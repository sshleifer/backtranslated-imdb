Personally, this movie goes to my best four times. No exceptions. James Cameron proved himself again and again to be a master narrator. Through films such as Aliens, Abyss and both Terminators, it is clear he was a brilliant and confident director in action and science fiction. He sees the story and gives the film a special curiosity. But the Titanic is so different from the other shots of shine. The film moves exceptionally, allowing space for surprise, plotting, and interesting developments in the story everyone knows. The story of the famous voyager who sank on his first voyage is a legend, so Cameron was tasked with making a real, interesting and fun movie about it. The acting is awesome because Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Jack and Kate Winslet, plays Rose, has become superstars overnight with the release of this film, and in most movies I get upset when the supporting characters are not much to do but in this movie it's more expedient , as she tells her story like old Rose (Gloria Stuart), it's obvious that it's Rose and Jack's story alone, no one else. Emotionally, it's totally satisfactory and we can not keep a dry eye in the theater or home. Music has become cult and legendary. It's the best track of James Horner ever to appear, from film and audience. The song has become annoying for so long, but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon that is and this movie is. The only problem, James Cameron's common problem, is a dialogue that is unforgettable, but in a bad way, as in the way it's kissing in points, but all in the way. James Cameron has added a masterpiece and a romantic epic that will take you all day long. My heart will not continue from this.
