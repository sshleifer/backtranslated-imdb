Dirty Sanchez is the most extreme, British version of Jackass, in which four boys (Pritchard, Dainton, Joycey and Pancho) go to a great extent to wound and humiliate each other. The reason why this show is better than Jackass is that most pieces are not planned, making the reaction much more fun. There are 3 series of shows, the first is followed and after a long look at their lives, for example there is an episode on their love life, work, etc. The second series sends boys to try different jobs. The third one continues on their European tour. It seems that boys are getting more and more dared to make the series. In my opinion, the third series is the best, but believe me when I say if you do NOT use the weekly stomach because you can see a lot of blood and flood in each episode.
