Now I know that French prisoners probably did not read Lovecraft (and this proves my opinion that his writings should be taught at school, perhaps as a separate subject) but how they thought something that sounds "ftagn yog sototh" to lead to some good? The film takes place in a prison where four very unlikely cellular comrades hit a magical book that can, if read correctly, get out. When the prison went, the cell was totally unrealistic, so it was hard to get into the atmosphere of things. It also moves slowly, which can bore people. But besides, it's a terrifying feeling of top-notch music, mixing Sartre's "hell are other people" with the type of Lovecraft / Barker, and rather successful. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Pay attention to this. This means you do not do it when you are going to work, sleep or do something else. This is the movie that works best if you're immersed in it. Lesson: Yog is bad, almost as bad as French women.
