I like Malle's papers. They are so easy and simple, but still fascinating. I have no idea why this document works. This is Glencoe, Minnesota. 5000 people live there and nothing will happen. But Malle has made it fascinating and interesting. His love for humanity, even racist or homophobic people, is so enormous that you simply can not help but also fall in love with them. <br /> <br /> Malle shot most of them in 1979. Six years later, he returned to see what had changed. That would be a good film without material 6 years later, but this little increment makes it great. It may sound like Malle is doing what's going on in the Up series, but it's not really. The Up series is about people. Malle is not an emphasis on what happened to every person, but what happened to this community. And the change is great. 1985 is the Reagan period and the farmers suffer. Once a proud community is now, no one sees any future at all, and parents hope their children will be educating themselves and doing something other than farming. <br /> <br /> This document is very relevant today. Our financial crisis began today because of what happened. Just look at these final words in a movie by a senior lawyer from the city (1985): "Well, I have great hopes for this country because what is happening right now can only characterize my mind as an obsession with greed and the nation with the obsession for a long time, and especially a democracy that ... It's good here - it's good - very good in this country and a lot of good people and they will not - they will not subscribe to this philosophy of greed that is happening now. terrible. "<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it took more than 20 years and the hell of a headache before it happened.
