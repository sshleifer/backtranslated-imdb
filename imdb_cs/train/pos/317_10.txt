Telemundo should definitely consider making the Xica DVD collection! I know a lot of people, including me, who would like to buy the Xic novel! It is a very entertaining novel that is located in Brazil. The costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the city where the novel is being made is beautiful. Xica contains a lot of history of this period. I wish Telemundo was broadcast again, even if it was 2 in the morning. I would recommend watching Xik if he reappears on Telemund. I gave Telemund an e-mail for millions of times to show the amendment again, but my reason dropped to deaf ears. The only warning statement about Xice is that occasionally it contains some harsh scenes, so I recommend that children under the age of 14 do not see Xiku. Overall, Xica deserves 10 out of 10!
