Time for Hollywood to sit down and take note! If the actors behave snotically, just get the animators working on this little miracle. The Renaissance is probably the first animation movie that lets you forget that you do not see human beings. Although the cast cast from the cast (Craig, McCormack, Pryce, etc.) are some of the best I've ever heard, but even emotions displayed by "cartoons" are disturbing. animation is not very new, but the use of light and shadow makes the film a vivid image. The irony is that such technical magic will forget you that it's really a very nice movie. The stimulation and development of the plot are amazing and the dialogues are sharp. Plot: The disappearance of a senior mega-corporation employee reveals the story of fraud and corruption with the heroine of the heart of a cold heart. You can not say much without giving it all ... except that while the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, the climax leaves you. <br /> <br /> It must also look at 'adults' who smile at 'cartoons'
