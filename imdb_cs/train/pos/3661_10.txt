Snob and pseudo-experts think it's "far from De Sica the best". Those who suffer from a serious lack of innocence find a problem linking this masterpiece. De Sica spoke in a very direct way. Its authenticity does not have the difficult self-confidence of modern Italian directors or the hot parody of Pietro Germi, the bitterness of Mario Monicelli, the Visconti feast or Antonioni's cold observation. De Sica told us stories as a father sitting at the edge of a baby bed before bedtime. There is no attempt to intellectualize. Miracolo Milano and, to a lesser extent, Il Giudizio Universale are realistic fairy tales or what we call magical realism today. The film is a gem from beginning to end and This is the kind of character you take with an open heart, but of course it requires you to have a heart. Cinema in the purest form. Magnificent.
