"Still Crazy" is undoubtedly the greatest rock comedy of all time. It was wrong compared to "it's a spinal tap" that has no relation to. "Spinal Tap" is a satire (and absolutely sincere, not very good, although it's a "trip" of many rock clich√©s). Unlike "Tap", "Still Crazy" is populated by great actors, great songs and great human situations. You care about people in "Still Mad". That's all that matters. Oh, yeah, the music is pretty damn good, wrote Mick Jones from a stranger and Chris Difford of Squeeze. The American audience already knows Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but later he meets Bill Nighy (Underworld, Love, Pirates of the Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (Harry Potter Movies).
