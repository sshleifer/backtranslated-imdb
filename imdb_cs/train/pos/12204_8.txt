One can imagine the movie Mr. Welles could finish without a hit on the studio! This movie is flawed Welles, but it's worth every minute because one sees the spectacle of the best American film directors of all time! We can see what Orson Welles needed to shoot this movie. The story has a lot of holes in it, perhaps because of the directors' demands that the director did not trust. <br /> <br /> It is curious to read some of the opinions presented by IMDB, which compares Orson Welles with the brothers Cohen, Roman Polanski, even Woody Allen, when all those directors who should be considered followers of the great master. No one was more original and creative in the history of American cinematography than Mr. Welles. We are lucky to have our legacy either retrospectively, such as the New York Film Forum just ended, or its films either on a tape or DVD. Rita Hayworth was never more loved than here. If she was a beauty with red hair, like a blonde, she is too surprising for words. Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders played a great part in the film. The only thing that could make this film another piece to add to Orson Welles' work was his own appearance. If he focused on directing and another actor was interpreting Michael O'Hara, it could be a completely different film. Orson Welles must be credited for being a pioneer when he took the camera out of the studio to the street. The visuals in this movie are so amazing that we leave the theater after seeing this movie really amazed for the work, vision and talent that has given us.
