Garam Masala is one of the most fun movies I've ever seen. Akshay Kumar is an excellent woman who has issues with three girls and she is dealing with. John Abraham is occasionally entertaining and this is one of his best works. Paresh Rawail is great in most movies as usual. Director Priyadarshan has performed great movies in the past. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul are some of the best. Garam Masala is his most funny movie he did. Three new actresses are average. Rimi's Dream does not have much room in this movie. I was amazed to see Priyadarshan film a story with a simple story of a man who had a relationship with the three girls at once. All three girls have a free day the same day and end up in the same house. The pack with lots of laughter is a non-stop entertainer.
