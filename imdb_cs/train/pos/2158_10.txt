I do not like "gradual inflation", but I had to give it 10. I can not think of anything I did not like. I saw it last night and woke up today. I'm sure the Hollywood remake I was told with J Lo and Richard Gear will be great, but this original 1996 version of the Japanese was so emotional and thoughtful to me that I hardly ever thought of any way it could be improved or its environment changed into another culture. The story that I deserved for watching me, and when a scene or a weapon or something comes up! Imagine it! <br /> <br /> All the characters looked well-developed, ... even the non-primary characters had good character-development and enjoyable gaming, and casting seemed very appropriate. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, it's hard to find a good movie musical instrument and maybe it's not good enough (there are lots of teachings to dance but no vocals) but I really think that Gene Kelly and others who lives to promote a place for dancing, this film would be very well thought out and the role of dancing helped to tell the story of a middle-aged man who was successful with his family in Japan and was looking for something ... he did not know exactly what. <br /> <br /> The team of people in Japan who contributed to this movie thank you for creating and doing this.
