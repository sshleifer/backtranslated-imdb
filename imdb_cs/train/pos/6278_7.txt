I saw it on a flight to the US and was initially somewhat skeptical because several people said there were so many characters in it that you did not know them. However, I did not find it at all. The movie is fast, but it's due to the nature of the director and star. Chase scenes are excellent and yes, it can be predictable, but it's not true of most movies. The main thief is a bit disappointed, Christopher Eccelston is not as convincing as he could be, but he said it was still a good movie.
