Any child who is old enough to sit in front of the screen will be beautifully shot with beautiful pictures and gorgeous music in this hearty and humorous rewriting of Grimm's tale. They will sing "Bibbity-Bobbity-Boo" before they can even make a full sentence and continue singing until their dying days. It is a classic for all children, especially for adults who are young at heart.
