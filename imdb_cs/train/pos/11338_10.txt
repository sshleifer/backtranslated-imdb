I saw it on "Dances with Films" and it was amazing. I really felt it. Talk about adding insult to injury! Not only did your parents divorce but you are a monster. <br /> <br /> It was so sincere, so scary - there were several moments when the audience was screaming in real fear. It reminded me a bit of a Japanese horror film, except that the story was really good. And that's what separated Jake's Closet from the usual india movie pabulum - an excellent script with convincing characters. Also, by mixing elements of horror film with family drama, the film gets from both genres of the best and avoids the clich√©s of both. <br /> <br /> If there are no theaters, you will definitely get to the DVD.
