This film is like the 1950-version of Ettore Scola's Brutti sporchi e cattivi. Smaller sex and less realism, but a story of great humanism and warmth. I would not say a neo-realistic picture. It's very sentimental and more like a fairy tale and probably should be considered a comedy, even though it deals with serious affairs (a bit like Chaplin or 1930 comedy). Typical Italian, very emotional and heavily resistant, except for a stone cold person. Sentimentalism is disappointing, though this image was not meant to be a realistic drama. It's not a masterpiece like Umberto D or The Bicycle Thief. But it's a nice and cheerful comedy, with good music. <br /> <br /> 7/10
