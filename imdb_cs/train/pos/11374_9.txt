There are some excellent comments and remarks on this movie. I was pleased to see a comparison with Fritz Lang's "M" (forget about the 50's failed remake of David Wayne). The real villain is not a tortured killer (exceptionally subtle performance by Jeffery DeMunn), while his sexually frustrated anger on his victims - mostly children. The goal is. The real villain is a rigid bureaucratic Soviet system that drowned in its own incompetentness. Disappointment from an uncompromisingly determined man (Rea in his best role from "The Crying Game"), who is willing to use the system to his advantage (Sutherland always succeeded in this role), a hesitant, frightened but determined psychiatrist (incomparable Max Sydow), crazy the bizarre bureaucrat of the Prosecutor (brilliant British actor John Wood), and a silent, supportive wife of the investigated investigator (delightful followers, Imelda Staunton). That's one damn fine film. Its darkness and vertigo are supported by the depiction of a corrupt, incompetent system that works against success. There is no need to dive into the sensational process that characterizes so many recent films. Gore is present-it's a terrible story-but adds to the display of a pathologically twisted human being. The success of the story is precisely that it was about acts committed by man, man, like you or me. Where you and I have chosen to avert our frustration by reasonable means, Chikatilo took his anger at our most innocent and vulnerable, our children. The great presumption of this story is reflected by an equally excellent actor of outstanding actors. - I find that our Australian friend did not like this performance and would no doubt have heard it if they spoke in the Aussie dialect. Well, too bad. This gentle film certainly worked for me and everyone else I talked to, who saw it.
