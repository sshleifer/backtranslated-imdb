This dock-drama is what you would expect from Richard Attenborough, the man who gave us "Gandhi": a beautifully photographed, convincingly cast, well written, literate and literate way that Hollywood discarded in the 1930s, and thoroughly accurate. It excels as a genre film, stands out for its native American (or more appropriately for its Canadian environment, "the first peoples") and stands with a "black robot" as a beautifully photographed piece of canoe and its culture (here, ca. 1934). This idyllic portrait derives drama from his subject: Archie "Gray Owl" Belaney, cattle raised in Hastings (England) by famous aunts who are so obsessed with the "red Indian" stories of her childhood that she left for Canada, disappeared the forest and became a trapper and the adopted son of the Ojibway band. He was a futile man with a habit of getting married and leaving Indian brides, none of whom seemed to think less about him, for he was also exceptionally charming and spicy. One of his spouses (one wiser than he, according to most accounts) encouraged him to glory as a writer and an early advocate for the protection of the wild country of the North, and this is centered on the story of Attenborough's story. Chroma between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau (as wife of Pony Gray Owl) deals with, and if not fiery, is quite moving. A good movie if you need some time from a crazy crowd.
