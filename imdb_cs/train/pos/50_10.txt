My children have just stopped at this movie at night, and as things started to play, it really provoked my interest. I had to go to the bowling league, so I let them record on the DVR so I can watch the rest later. Well, I just did it when I looked at it and in front of my shirt I was wet to cry buckets. It was an excellent film, though I almost felt the pain and anxiety these girls experienced. And never for a million years I would have no doubt why Alissia left this beautiful girl on the antisocial goth. That was probably why my shirt was soaked because I experienced the same pain that Alissia felt. I would not want to find this movie, but I'm sure I liked it. Very moving, very touching. Great for those who love good drama or dwarfs.
