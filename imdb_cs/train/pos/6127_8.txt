Jack Frost is a serial killer who is sentenced to death. On his way to his death, a prisoner riding a truck collides with a chemical-filled chemical tanker that changes its molecules with snow on the ground, turning it into a snowman. To be a killer himself who would make him a murderer of a snowman. Jack now wants to avenge the sheriff who caught him. Jack is now starting to wrath again and killing people in a small town. I do not think Jack Frost has a chance to become a classic of horror, but it's a fun movie. Just keep your brain up and have fun with it, but just do not take it too seriously.
