There are people claiming to be another "bad language" ultra violent Mexican film. They are right, but more than that this film is a challenge to create a consciousness of what we have become. This terrible truth hurts or when you have already adopted the paradigm of third world life as the only possible goal. One of the most important things "Cero y van cuatro" is an open invitation to a deep reflection of our present identity. Is that what we all are? Is that all we want to be? I'm abroad and I realized how a miserable Mexican society was when the Tlahuac incident occurred. I still can not understand the audience who witnessed mass murder. When I saw some of the pictures, I almost looked. It was not Iraq or Rwanda, a small village near Mexico City, when they were scared by the horror of the media and government. The recovery of a similar situation in this movie made me deeply shocked. Other stories were a good example of other cases of corruption, dishonesty, betrayal and violence, but I think Tamales de Chivo is the best. The film is deeper than some "cabr√≥n" and "pendejo" cries. These are insignificant compared to the actions of the people. With a few exceptions, they are perfect examples of human waste. Just as in real life, honesty becomes an exception rather than a rule in our country. Moreover, honesty is rewarded miraculously.
