This episode should be better seen from the beginning, because if you look at it later, you'll be confused about what's going on with Clark's life. <br /> <br /> But that's an abbreviation; Clark was stuck in an alternate reality. Lana is dedicated. Lex has lost most of his legs and is in a wheelchair because of a bridge accident when he avoided missing Clark in a pilot series. Martha married Lionel. The only constant is his closest friend, Chloe, who still believes in who he is. Yeah, yeah, he has no super gear. He is in the mental institution to get into the fantasy of the world where he has power and is mocked to believe it. In addition to Chloe, there is one mysterious character who believes in Clark: a black man who is also an alternate resident of an institution that believes he is from Mars. Clark must remain faithful to what he sees as a real reality, and he will not get brainwashed by the institution's psychiatrist, who is actually the fourth leak of the Phantom Zone. <br /> <br /> This episode is totally sad and shocking. In addition, it provides a new twist from the usual "Smallville" episode.
