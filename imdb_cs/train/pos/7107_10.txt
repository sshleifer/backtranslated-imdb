You can call it a secret, maybe a little thriller or an intelligent film. The story brings you to the life of one person who has lost her life and is looking for it again. <Br /> <br /> I have to say that I was quite surprised to have really enjoyed this movie. It's not usually the genre I'm interested in, but the characters quickly became people and I wanted to know what is happening and what happens to them. Like many French films across English, we are able to learn more about the character and impact of their surroundings on their person. This film is distinctive and does not disappoint!
