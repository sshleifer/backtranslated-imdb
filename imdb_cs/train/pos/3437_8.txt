Some genre films must be dressed. This was an exception. Based on his own merits, he's a modified version of horror genre. With minimal special effects, you can be a psychological study, with a simple and yet existential theme - who is hit by a bus and why is it? It's not a great movie, though it's a little, the story works. Subtle and all about character interactions. In fact, there is one thing in the introductory scenarios, but it can be placed there just to set a tone for what's coming. I very much appreciate the balance of male and female energy and I do not recommend this story to anyone who is interested in more than responding to the physical and psychological challenge. You enjoy the movie, if you have some empathy, you appreciate the need for some adventure in your life and you are interested in "What would I do in this situation?"
