Nick Nolte gives excellent performance in Kurt Vonnegut's dark story. Notle plays Howard W. Campbell, who was a double propaganda agent during the Second World War. After the war, he lives anonymously until the competing factions want to dig out his past. As with most of Vonnegut's work, it is about meditation on the absurdity of war and about those who use propaganda for their own purposes. Nolte is fantastic - confident and confident as young Campbell, and then broken and creepy as an older man who is forced to make up for the sins of his past. (7 of 10)
