Originally I bought this DVD because SRK and Aishwarya Rai were on the cover and I thought hey! another film with Aishu and Shah Rukh, I knew a little that Aishwarya would appear only in the item number in the last quarter of the movie in the song she shared with SRK and helped to portray his figure in the movie about 15 minutes. Shakti is a film about mother's love and perseverance. It is a film about transformations, ignorance, coming of age, entering into consciousness and accepting the harsh reality of life. The item number in which SRK and Aishu appear does not have anything to do with the movie. In fact, it is a dream sequence that occurs while the drunk character of SRK is unconsciously knocked with booze. Dreams that Aishwarya Rai is this sexy girl's street that one day will appear in her favorite place, dressed modestly and start to lift it. The song name is Ishq Kamina (freely translated as "Love is a bitch!") And it's just smoking hot! Do not miss it.
