In this little movie we have some great characters but a very shallow fence. It's really nice to watch because Singleton does a great job of presenting esoteric conflicts and interpersonal relationships. This prevents the viewer from being a realistic picture for which this film is supposed to be. In fact, we have all the possible clich√©s and stereotypes placed on celluloid to a greater extent than soap. It's definitely not a deep film (though it wants to be), but better than an average film.
