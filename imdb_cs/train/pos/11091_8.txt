Life is not bad for Harry Mitchell, he is a former ex-aviation military officer (plus the clever little pension I imagine) who piles up cash for a patent he developed (melting titanium and steel through an explosive process) and his wife of twenty years has been preserved in a very good nick. LA has a nice little pad. I like to see the vision of the 80th Consumer Dream and you get a good piece of what the restored Jag (Series 1 E-type roadster) for him and the wonderful antique doll house for her (just like me "Make sure other toys and toy boys ) It must always be more, but not so, so Harry is captured in some romantic shenanigans (you are just as old as the woman you feel) As in many noir films, one mistake, in life without any blots, leads to <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < incredible psychopathic acts to avoid jail and punish double crossers, recalling Pluton, the sinister black former psychopath from Carl Franklin's well-known neo-noir "One False Move" (1992). Motivational motivation Both men have enough of the man and all in extremeism. Robert Trebor plays Leo Franks, a nudi salon, where men can photograph naked models for $ 25 in half an hour and $ 50 for an hour (someone else is crazy for a lack of discount?). It's over his head and it's great to watch Trebor behave when Leo starts to feel warm, a credible breakdown. John Glover wins as Alan Raimy, who is the conspiracy brain, a really great man who becomes a pornographer and turns to life a crime of pure sociopathic ennui. He is a sexual sadist and makes some particularly unpleasant things during the film, including what I think is pretty well-indicated rape (pay attention to his RAP sheet print, it's easily missed and read between the rows for the motel scene with "Slim "). <br /> <br /> Together with One False Move, though not entirely, I think the real impact of the film is in the unusually communicative scenes of violence. <br /> <br /> So good, but I think the film is a real problem. Harry Mitchell is at one point said to have his "violin dagger". My problem is that Harry Mitchell plays Roy Scheider. Roy Scheider protagonists never lose, they are self-confident and smooth, but not annoying. I feel I have been asked to believe that his character is at risk, the film relies on it because of the dramatic tension; but I did not believe it. For me, it's like I think Sandra Bullock's character will end up asleep alone until the end of a romantic drama, or that the character of Stephen Seagal will be taken away by baddies (actually it happened in one movie, but it was deliberately done to the value of shock). Roy Scheider does not convince you as an adulteress, you feel nothing at all, his character is coated with teflon. It also seemed like a movie that made some cuts. In 110 minutes, he still feels poorly developed: Harry's wife Ann Margaret is almost a boxing cutout, Harry's prolongation, her singing as a politician who goes into office gets insufficient attention. The effect this matter has on Harry's marriage is not properly communicated. It could be Frankenheimer's problem, not known for character development. I have never had the feeling that Harry is a little more than a seemingly annoying and erroneous tax claim from the IRS. <br /> <br /> In this movie there is a good striking violent noir, but I feel in the excellent position that Harry casting could have been better (without harm to the great Roy Scheider). The film felt short, even with a long duration, and I think it could still be a little exhausted. But you really do not have to forget about the tangle, like the deliciously perverse scene of Harry's shooting Doreen in the nudy salon.
