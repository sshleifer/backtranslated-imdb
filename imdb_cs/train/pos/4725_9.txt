Despite the lack of logic present in the story, Kill Shot is a very nice film. Despite the moving performance, Kasper Van Dien superficially portrays the emotional contradiction between the hard-working rich father and his misguided son. Each member of the accompanying cast is filled with steady performance and emphasizes the lively action of a young Asian man whose name I can not remember. A shocking tragic end can destroy some younger audiences, but as a whole, Kill Shot actually delivers a deadly blow.
