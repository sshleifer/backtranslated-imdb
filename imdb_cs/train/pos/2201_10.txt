I just finished viewing the first disc in a 4-disc collection (26 episodes) created in collaboration with the UCLA film and television archive (S'More Entertainment, Inc.). Meanwhile (except for the 1st episode) the image quality is pretty good. The DVD box is shown on the cover page here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers" is as charming as when I first saw him (5 years) and Wally Cox is really in this role. If you are in the mood for a quiet comedy that will teach you, unlike holding your head, you will have this chance to experience all the wonderful characters you remember from childhood. Although some of the gags are a bit hunchback, most of them are sophisticated and well done ... and even the humpbacks are fun. This is a TV series that lives up to my early childhood memories.
