This movie is one of those "WOW!" movies. Not because it is the biggest film of all time, but because it surprised me. It was not only TV movie, but it was Elvis. I can safely say as many impersonators as there is only one Elvis, but I can safely say that Kurt Russel was so close to being real. It was one of the greatest pretensions I've ever seen. I had to believe it was really him. I've learned a lot about Elvis's life watching this movie. And do not run the TV section that lets you wander - it's really a fantastic movie! And Kurt Russel could be Elvis twins :)
