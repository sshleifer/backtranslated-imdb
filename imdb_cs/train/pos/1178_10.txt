It can be WWE 2nd best PPV year after Wrestlemania it was a good surprise! John Price had an excellent match in which to disturb Chris Jericho. Jeff Hardy retained his IC title in a brief, negligent battle with Willa Regal. Bubba & Spike Dudley won Benoit & Guerrero. Jamie Noble had a really good match with Kidman, which surprised me. Booker T defeated The Big Show in a match without a dc, in one place Booker T put the scissors in the Big Show and sent him straight across the table. In the silly decision of WWE Christian and Lance Storm, jealous anti-Americans defeated Hogan and Edge with much help from Test and Jericho. RVD and Brock had a match at night when they were filled with great points and the RVD had to keep their title over the DQ, so I was happy to keep the title. Triple H also signed with Eric Bischoff and Raw, which means little. And in the main event, Rock became the world's first WWE seven-time champion to beat Kurt Angle & Undertaker in a triple game. Overall it's probably WWE 2nd Best PPV 2002! 7/10
