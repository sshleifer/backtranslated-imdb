This show is wonderful. He has some of the best writing I've ever seen. He is a great director of Dvid Trainer, who also directed another smart TV series called BOY MEETS WORLD. <br /> <br /> This show is without any of the biggest. Like the THIRD COMPANY, ROSEANNE and the famous COSBY SHOW will be on TV for a long time. From perfectly crafted jokes to great performances, you would just dream of being a great show for people who lived in the 1970s and for people who did not. This show attracts young and young hearts. Perfect show.
