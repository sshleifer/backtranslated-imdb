If you want your ideas about Chaplin to be limited to a lovable tramp and get your belly laughing from the pathos, watch something else. But if you love the slapstick comedy played by one of the best, watch this. <br /> <br /> The picture is a tramp who really can not get a girl. He will see another couple kissing on the park bench and have a blast that will destroy their fun. It's one of Chaplin's "park comedies," shot in Mack Sennett Park, with pockets and police and pairs. These shorts work because the format allows Chaplin to shine when he runs through quarrels. I checked the box because it could be considered a spoiler, though it is not when you saw these movies. They all end up in the pond besides Chaplin. She gets a girl, played in this case by Minta Durfee, and K.a. Mrs. Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle.
