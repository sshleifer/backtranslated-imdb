What jewel from the movie, so good that they do the sequel. The movie starts really well with the ugly monster that takes her a few people and a party where the 2 main characters first look each other. <br /> <br /> Bendan Hughes plays the eccentric Vlad, a little where he is, who moved to the city and used the services of a real estate agent to find his house. <br /> <br /> Damn, we all saw vampire movies, we know the format. The film is observable, but the performances of the actors are very wooden and they seem to be unwilling to be in this movie, but it can only be the part of the decadent atmosphere. He did not like the end, but he continues, he has to watch. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie, I thought Brendan Hughes really did not fit this part. Later I could not stop thinking about him, somehow radiating terrible sensuality, so maybe he was right about this part. BRENDAN HUGHES Last seen in "Hitler's Resurrection of Evil" as Lieutenant Guffman. Where is he now?
