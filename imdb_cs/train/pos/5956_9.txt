Yes, this is a very low budget. So acting is not an award-winning material, and sometimes action is slow because the filmmakers shoot longer sequences and not a million moments, which then adjust to the movie. This film is for this with an excellent script that seriously interprets vampirism, explains it and develops a complete drawing. In addition to the vampire story, we get detailed information on genetics, law and law enforcement, martial arts, philosophical thoughts and some good metal music. Kudos go to Dylan O'Leary, director / writer / lead actor. It's beyond me how this man could accomplish all these roles and make them so good. I think to appreciate this film, you have to be ubiquitous in all sorts of themes to see that the writer has studied a lot and knows about all these things. There is also some great camera work, interesting camera angles and one underwater vampire attack - something I have not seen yet, but who gives up the honor of an underwater zombie assault in Fulci Zombie. Casting is good if a sexy sexy woman is really sexy. The vampire also looks perfect for this role. The female victim looks vulnerable. My only complaint is that a low budget for horror should be more nudity. If you want to see an original movie of a vampire with a big story, it's for you. I look forward to future projects from Mr. O'Leary.
