Once you see Vertigo, then watch Bell, a book and a candle, made within a few months of each other. <br /> <br /> My second favorite Kim Novak movie, with Picnic, comes third. <br /> <br /> All three performances are great, Vertigo is the best of all. They came to my absent city of Kansas Prairie near Salina, in Kansas in the 1950s, to make Picnic. <br /> <br /> Bell, Book and Candle is a musical score I believe is one of Alex North's. Excellent for this comedy. After Vertigo, Stewart and Novak, this comedy has become as fun to note dramatic contrast. <br /> <br /> Get time if you like Kim Novak. Greta Garbo of my youth.
