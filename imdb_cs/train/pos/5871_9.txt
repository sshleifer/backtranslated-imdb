I love every film of this beautiful movie. These are regular people we all know who suffer a little in their lives and have some luggage to wear them. Like us all. Robert DeNiro, Ed Harris and Kathy Baker breathe life into their imagination and are excellent, but Harris is particularly heartbreaking and therefore very real. You would swear that he is a trucker who drinks, so he will not have to feel anything. Baker, like his nurse, also has several sensitive moments - when DeNiro puts his flowers in one scene, it looks like flowers have never been delivered and probably not. Very useful.
