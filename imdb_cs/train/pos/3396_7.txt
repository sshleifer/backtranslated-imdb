Very interesting. The big twist was not as big a shock as they might have hoped, and it was very dated but it helped me work. He really was thinking about a world without vegetation and farm animals and made me appreciate the world I live in, much more. Charlton Heston does a good job, like all supporting characters, and it was a very realistic film that was surprising. He lacked the direction for a while, and many settings and backgrounds needed more explanation, but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent film. The main mistake I found was that I did not want the movie to end if it did, I'd like to see what happened. <br /> <br /> 7/10
