Another episode of childhood that as an adult I look back with a different perspective. It was one of my favorite childhood episodes that really cemented my adoration of this show. However, watching this episode after 20 years, I would say that it is definitely one of the lightest, played for laughter and fun, instead of dramatic and well-built stories in previous episodes in this, their first and best times. Perhaps this episode was written for the little R & R fan too! As Mr Spock says, the story is simply not logical, but there are some fun lines, such as Mr. Spock's final final at the end - when asked by Captain McCoy et al whether they enjoy their R & R and respond positively, raising their eyebrows and saying " Fascinating ... "just as Mr. Spock could do. An interesting story line, of course, that the amusement park is really fun (instead of the fake and often poisonous "entertainment" of Disneyland, for example) to really fulfill his wishes. Really great idea, but not so well done. And they come from Theodore Sturgeon, one of the great writers of the SF stories that they used in the first season, and one is interested in how much the script Sturgeon has set. On this page I learned: In 1987, James Gunn founded Theodore Sturgeon Award for Best Science Fiction Story. And the rest quote from this page: In 1968, {Sturgeon} wrote "The Joy Machine," the third script for the television series Star Trek (Amok Time the other), which was never shot. The main reason why it was not used in the series is that it contains expensive sequences of special effects that are too large for their budget. But the script was modified into James Gunn's book by Sci-Fi writer (Star Trek # 80, The Original Series) and published by Pocket Books in 1996. <br /> <br /> This episode is still very nice, especially if you think about it you do not think too much. Just laugh and enjoy it and another episode can go back to serious space protection issues.
