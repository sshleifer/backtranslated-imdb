Great concept, great cast and what a pity that it was not time to dedicate the story. I loved it and wanted more. Dench, Dukakis and Laine are now real women! Only Dench and her character had enough backgrounds to take the script for some of its smaller moments. I have it on the tape and it will continue to watch, I hope that at the end is a trace that indicates that it will continue. <br /> <br /> Upper socket! - No question! - No arguments! <br /> <br />
