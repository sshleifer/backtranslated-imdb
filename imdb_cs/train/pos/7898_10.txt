This movie got terrible reviews, but because it was insignificant, and because critics usually do not "get" endless films, I thought I'd try. Unfortunately, they were pretty much fine in this case. The film has just the unpleasant feeling that it's the most out of the show. The kind of feeling that can not be described but not good. To further confuse things, the script is a dull, purposeless thing that is of little interest. Extremely talented Thurman is just going through this mess that makes little impact. Hurt and Bracco are trying in vain to add something to the movie with enthusiastic performance, but there is nothing in the script. Perhaps it was less embarrassing for them if they only decided to act like Thurman. One thing the "critic" film critic did not mention, however, is that the film is actually quite funny. Whether it's moments of precise satire or some terribly strange moments, like the cow beasts chasing ranch wounds with the scent of their frozen ... and ... the front. the chortles reached all over while I would not recommend this movie, there is the fun that was supposed to be and watch Even Cowgirls get Blues worth something else.
