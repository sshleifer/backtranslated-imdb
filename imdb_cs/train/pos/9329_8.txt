I've seen the Perfect Son about three times. I do not see the film as homosexual, I'm not gay, but I do not see it as a gay movie. It's a homosexual movie, I do not know why every homosexual movie should be strictly a movie about being gay. I find the film sympathetic to the study of death, the death of someone who is your native. I think Theo will change his life quite quickly after rehabilitation because he wants and watches his brother die before him and causes him to rethink his life again. I found a dialogue in the scene when Theo tells Ryan that he will be the father to move very much, Ryan says he does not want to know about things he can never see or share with. Is not it terrible and sad? I recommend a movie.
