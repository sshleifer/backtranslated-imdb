The message of the world on the brink of war is ignored by the masses; the mythical town of Everytown in 1940 represents England in general, but it could equally well stand for any nation of the world. When the end of the war arrives, it's furious to continue for another five years, but until 1966 when Everytown is completely destroyed. Adding to the wasteland and toll for humanity is a "traveling sickness," a plague that continues for another four years. "Things That Come" balances both the fatalistic and the futuristic view of the world, where science of hope leads to a revived civilization. The "Wings Over the World" concept plays a bit of a bit of warmth, though Cabal's spokesman (Raymond Massey) is unwavering in his mission and is devoted to his affairs. If it fails, others will follow. This message is constantly reinforced throughout the film, bringing it convincingly home to Massey's end of the film. The incredible need of man to test the boundaries of knowledge and success requires the idea of ​​"all universe or nothing". The film images of automation and machinery in the second half resemble a large silent film "Metropolis". Given that Everytown is rebuilt and transformed by 2036, the theater rebirth of the city will hit the resonance chord, because the architecture of today's modern cities suggests that the philosophical prophetic vision will take place. Where movies are badly sixty-seven years old, even though this is the first mission of man to the moon, but in 1936, the one hundredth flight schedule probably seemed legitimate than 1969. The "Things to Come" is one of those rarities in film, painting , who thinks about you. Which side do you get down, the forces to progress in the face of uncertainty, or do you keep the status quo? This is not a comfortable question, as both options offer their own dangers and unknown results. Those who choose to be present are at risk of excluding forces beyond their control.
