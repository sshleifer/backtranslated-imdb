This movie is really good. The story, which acts as a puzzle, forces the viewer to think and guess what will happen next. Such a trick brings a lot of surprises and the spectator is really looking forward to solving the riddle. Combat scenes are very good. There are a lot of different fighting styles (although one of the styles was a bit unreal to me, but it's just my opinion) that is watching and it's a fascinating show. The only thing that can be irritating is the actors. A little too effeminate (at least for me). Hong Kong has always been good in kung fu movies, especially in the 1970s and 1980s, so "Five Venoms" (or other version) is a great choice.
