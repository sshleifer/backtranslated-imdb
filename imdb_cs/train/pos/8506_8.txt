. . . but it was on the UHF channel and the reception was very fuzzy. I really want to own a movie, because the reason I followed it is mainly because I was a bus driver, and while I was watching this movie, I was driving this model bus. Only during his murder 15 years later I unknowingly remembered that OJ is one of the stars. I just remember that he was a driver and a bus that was shot and wild-powered. I was looking for the whole movie without success because I watched it in the mid-1980s. I liked the movie, I mostly do not watch the thrillers, but after reading the summary in the TV Guide and looking at its start (although unclear), I stayed for the whole thing.
