I am at the opposite end of the previous comment. <br /> <br /> First I do not think this should be the direct sequel to "The Jerk." I think it's not called "The Jerk 2" ... it's "The Jerk, Too", which leads me to believe that while many character names are the same, it really is about a totally different person. /> <br /> Think about it: virtually no connection to the previous movie, other than character names; a completely different story; different occupations; and the fact that it is a partial musical style. <br /> <br /> I'm going to tell this movie some credit. It has a lot of laughs in it .. Mark Blankfield in his main.
