I bought this game on impulse purchase from Walmart. I'm glad I did. It was very fun to listen to Sean Connery and play the game. I thought graphics are the best I've ever seen in a movie / game remake. Bonus levels were very tough! The sniper I think was too hard, I was so frustrated I did not play the game for a week and a half. There were too many people who fired at you without hiding their lives in order to treat them. <br /> <br /> The only thing I could change was an upgrade system. I did not notice any difference from untrained equipment to upgraded, such as the purchase of upgrades to the armor, it did not appear that the armor would be stronger or more full of my life. I really liked the Q copier. I think developers have done a good job.
