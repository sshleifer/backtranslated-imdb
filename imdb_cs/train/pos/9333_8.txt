When I lived in Ontario all my life, in the same town where Marlene Moore grew up, I heard stories from her parents, grandparents and family members. So when I found out that they were going to shoot a movie about her and that the start would shoot on my street and her house, which is quite close to mine, I was excited. If you read the book "Rock A Bye Baby," about Marlene Moore, you get a totally different picture of her as a person, she was considered to be clumsily beautiful people who really had a chance to meet her, except for her own family who often abused her as a child except for one of her brothers. Also, if you live in my area and you are smart enough to listen to those around you who knew her from school, you found out she was really injured before she even got to the institution, she was always defensive, and what seemed like a reluctance to learn in the school environment, she was really embarrassed at the fact that she was unable. Marlene did not deserve the life she had received, lacking the necessary help she desperately needed. It was the government and the people around her who helped her in her death by not trying to understand her needs and why she did what she had done. I'm still angry that she was murdered for self-defense by the man who tried to rape her. As her brother once said, "They did not know what to do with her, so they locked her and killed her." I believe in it with all my heart. <br /> <br /> Stay calm Marlene, you deserve it so much.
