It will be a bit short. First of all, do not listen to criticism because it's not as bad as most say it is! Sniper uses a classic film formula that many instantly dismiss as a faulty movie. While the sniper does not answer 100% of the truth about how military snipers work in our country, it gives those who do not know about Sniper Professional a glimpse into the Sniper world. And yes, the film has many flaws, but what is not the movie? There are many good scenes and good acting by Tom Berenger. I have to say that the two worst scenes are at the beginning of the Billy Zane movie on a helicopter, followed by Zane at the Marine bar scene. The best scene in Sniper is swept with Berenger in the middle of a field with the opposite force! There are also plenty of good jungle shots and some classic shots using the camera as if you were looking through the rifle. And yes, Sniper Motto is "one hit, one killing". Judge Sniper for yourself !! <br /> <br />
