I desperately need it on tape, not on DVD, and soon! I have one nephew who is in the infantry but has not yet been deployed, although he is going to Iraq shortly after December 2008. I lost my beloved stepper son in Ramadi Iraq on 09-15-05 from an unmanned missile in the green zone. I have another nephew who joins the army as soon as she graduates from high school in spring, because as his older brother he has some idealized and romantic idea of ​​what is in the army. My stepmother died in just ten days in the country and never went on missions, so my nephews have no way of referring to any experience that this honest document proves from any personal experience that could have been sent by my dead son . <br /> <br /> I can not do anything with those who are in or away now but I'm either left who did not raise his hand and swore in YET. I desperately want to do it so that none of the others did it. <br /> <br /> It will help me with that. <br /> <br /> The documentary The Ground Truth is the best visual link ever seen. I need my youngest nephew to find out what he's got before it's too late. BUT: (do not laugh) I need my mother to see it first. He really has to see and hear these men and women, not just the idea of ​​them, but the truth about what will be submerged, perhaps forever. Then she will have the emotional determination to get my brother to watch this movie, and then, as soon as she has it, then she can watch her son, my youngest nephew. Then my nephew could start seriously taking it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> uses video (is it right? with tapes?) so i have to find a way to have her the opportunity to watch this movie can i buy it from anyone in this form? if not there is another way for me to get it in the form of a tape Is there a legitimate link from which I can pay to download it to my computer and then transfer it to a cassette If so, who should I contact I would like to pay for the privilege it is a legitimate reference. > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> the same when he returns and I can also lose him i and emotional toll on all those who back it is too high a price for it, to pay for every male child in my family that generation. Please help me. I'll give you a call, write me a number if it's the best way to get the information you need. Thank you for the help you can offer. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Lori Swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
