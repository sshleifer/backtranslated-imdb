This is my Bush, it's a fun show, Parker and Stone, I thought. His often very very funny, and his completely subversive and insane. The South Park fans would definitely get something. <br /> <br /> Another surprise is production here. There must be a lot of money put in, and that shows. Many expensive small details. It's not a small show. And the comedy Central is not an extremely rich channel, but a lot of this show. In this way, I understood that it was the death of the show, even though it was too expensive. Certainly it could be cheaper and there would be a will. Critics liked it and had a small fan, but failed to get a big audience. As we know, the show stopped after 8 episodes, which is about 1 season. <br /> <br /> As I really liked the show, it has its mistakes. The problem with the show is that it does not know what it really wants to be. Their endeavor is to be a sitcom and parody of a sitcom at the same time. Actors do a good job and some of them are well cast, but in my opinion it seems that they have not always got the 100% bizarre humor to present. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think the show needed some characters that were more on the ground to make the show work. In South Park, you have Kyle and Stan, who are a bit of a realistic touch in a universe that is rather looney. I think that's what makes South Park work. You need some sensible characters that you can realistically relate to, and it makes crazy things even more interesting because they make you take them seriously at some level. If it's all archetypes and stereotypes, it's difficult to get emotionally into the show, which is really the biggest problem Thats My Bush. Kyle and Stan are characters in South Park that make sense in the show. We have nothing like this here, and this show suffers. <br /> <br /> Another anchor point is Parker and Stones flirting with the Republicans. Their only thing is that I do not really have what they are trying to do. Bush does not show anything but stupid Homer The Simpsons kind of character is somewhat subversive in a world where there are a lot of people who can not stand it and think he's the worst president of Nixon and the parallel comic world of Letterman and so it satirizes every one of his pulling ... but it's hard to see if Parker and Stone really mean anything. It's like a joke on us, but it does not interfere. It seems embarrassing because he does not even remember the real Bush. <br /> <br /> Besides, I actually thought the show was very nice. Some of the jokes are merry here. A supporter for life that was a surviving suppressed fetus is probably one of my favorite jokes in each show. And the show is full of great material, and sometimes it's madly funny if you watch her a little when you watch her.
