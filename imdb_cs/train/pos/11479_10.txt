This movie was excellent, a bit frightening, but it was excellent. For those of you who have heard about columbine and know the story, it gives you an idea of ​​what and why these kids are doing what they do. You know in the back of your mind that people think about these things, but you never realize how bad it is and this film is aware of you. It's so good. He also thinks twice to make fun of someone who is sure. I've read a book about the collusion massacre, and that's what I was thinking about, this movie disturbs me and scares me to death. The disadvantage is how to kill a guy for serial killers. I recently got a threat, and I threw it out that she was not thinking about it, but after this movie, I think you should take everything seriously. Some people are crazy and you never really know what they are, so take it seriously and do not suppose someone.
