It was a very sophisticated film, especially for 1973. At that time it was really a huge boxing success. After the seventies he seemed to be forgotten, but his central news was too important to disappear completely. It was at least fifteen years ago ... no one ever heard about the "greenhouse effect" before 1985 and the controversial subject of euthanasia was rarely raised. Sets and special effects may look a little obsolete, but the big money for scifi movies was gambling at this time. If you look closely, you will see that everything makes sense. This is a film link, not for star wars fans who do not have one minute of mental stimulation unless they contain millions of dollars. It was also Hestons the last good film, the end of his famous dystopian sci-fi trilogy. Then, all of the exaggerated disasters and large crowd budgets were pleasant garbage. This may not be the most amazing two-hour film ever shot, and the end may be scary and depressing, but it's hard to find a filmmaker with the courage to deal with such an object.
