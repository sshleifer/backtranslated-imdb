Eventually! A decent British comedy that is not centered around some robbers from mockney banks, or is based on television series. John Ivaya's film is a psychoactive story of the discovery, dressed in biker gear. These three protagonists are gentle fools who are interested in failure and each of them has his turn in life and gives a sensitive, emotional trio of parts to co-distribute a comedy comedy. The chemistry between these three amigos is tangible and creates a touch-up comedy with a fun conversation and a few classic comedic moments. He feels a part of Bynail and myself, part of a US werewolf in London, and part of Quadraphenia (but only due to cycling gangs and Phil Daniels). In fact, the remembrance of a nice villain, Phil Daniels, reminds Danny's salesman with Withnail and me, his scientific approach and his scientific commitment to medicines. It's a great movie, especially for those who have previously been dealing with psychoactive substances that will be in the film for many moments. Personal favorite is a great scene in a Welsh corner shop that buys munchies while shaving on shrooms. This fine comedy will warm the heart of your heart and you will laugh loudly. And you do not have to ride a bicycle or even like to enjoy it. But if you do, it will add. Brilliant.
