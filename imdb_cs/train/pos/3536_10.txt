EA has shown us that they can create a classic agent 007 and feel you in the 1960s. Game graphics are excellent and voice recording is very professional. I have this game in April 2007 (two years after release) and still have the impression of playing. It's a pity that EA will no longer play 007. <br /> <br /> I give this game 10/10 for the levels it contains, especially the level of the "consulate". I recommend this game to anyone from 13 years of age. The only thing I did not like in the game is the Russian ship, it was too much pressure. Overall, I like the game!
