This movie is on my wish for ten years and I recently found it on DVD when my grandson's grandson was added. He looked at it and was thrilled to learn that it was my generation - he was born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939 and he wanted to learn more about it - and me. Luckily I borrowed it from him and I watched it myself, and I cried all of it. Not only did it capture emotion, class difference, fear and warmth of human relationships of those years (as well as cruelty (spoken and unspoken), but that was accurate! I'm also a little crazy when it comes to ARP uniforms, LCCs in the right color white), and all the impediments to managing the bomb and the work of heavy rescue brigades, Anderson's cavalry and WVS racing halls have all brought this up, and the difference between the relatively innocuous life in the village and the war market in London was also sharply introduced to have lived again in 1939/40 and his own evacuation from London with this production! "Gold's work, of course, and no one would have expected more than careful details, but surpassing the real rendering of facts and touching deep chords about human responses and only half the judgment of the values ​​of those years. one of the best places in John Thaw's acting career and in the direction of Gold and deserves to be better It's a wonderful movie, and I've already ordered some copies to send to my friends.
