49. PAPERHOUSE (thriller / horror, 1988) Sick in bed with fever Eleven-year-old Anna (Charlotte Burke) has only her drawings to keep her company. Her health is gradually getting worse when she encounters a number of mysterious "black outpours". In each of these episodes, she dreamed of a house in a desert field, just a sick invalid boy named Marc (Elliot Spiers) who lives there. When a dark, unknown danger threatens her idyllic "paper house", Mark's life is at risk. Her life is also threatened because these dreams reflect her own health. Criticism: The story of the first debut by British director Bernard Rose. Based on Catherine Storrow's "Marianne Dreams", she leaves many other "original" fantasy works. Whenever the story deals with dreams and nightmares, it is difficult to give him a mix of fables and reality to make it work in the movie. Director Rose successfully portrays the child's fantasy of the world aspect along with the darkness that tries to usurp them. Feverishly scored by Phillip Glass, Rose knows how to use music wisely with professionally timed "jump from your seat" moments. Most thrillers are very unimportant in this all important aspect of how to haunt viewers that they do not know what the next scene will bring. I also like the way she captures the tension and never lets him go or slowly catch himself in the next sequence of events. Also, managing his placement of objects in the frame (as in his films P.O.V.) gives the cinematography another dimension that would otherwise seem to be lacking. Only in Europe you will find such ominous looking places that are presented here: lonely house, fields, coastal cities, watchtower, etc. Rose would follow this movie with "Candyman" (1992) a true "thinker" horror gem and bona fide cultivated horror favorite.
