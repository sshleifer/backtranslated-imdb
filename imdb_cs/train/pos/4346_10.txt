Paul Reiser is one of my favorite people in the show business. I read both of his books and I thought he was great. Peter Faulk can bring punch with the best of them. The combination of these two is magical. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a family that really gets to know. On the way down the road, the father and son for the first time join in a family crisis. They do all the things that fathers and sons do in life ... they do it much later in life. The situation is very fun, but they feel like they really could become real people (not too furious over the top or cartoonists). This is the first time I watched Paul Reiser and fully believed all the emotions that were portrayed. Sometimes his eyes look so sad. Gret movie and great story and plot. My comedy and emotion, but noble message ... Olympia Dukakas also does a great job :)
