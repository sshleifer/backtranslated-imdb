This movie is very cool. If you are a fan of Tsui Hark and Chinese fantasy movies, you should love it. This film is the Asian Lord of the Rings: a high fantasy story based on true Chinese mythology. (I realize that many critics have called this film a conspiracy - I think they probably have zero knowledge of Chinese mythology.) If you liked Stormriders or Warriors of Heaven & Earth, it should be your alley. This movie is still very difficult to find in the US even though it has been purchased for distribution in the US along with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Iron Monkey. It is worthwhile to look for! This DVD is also worthy of ownership.
