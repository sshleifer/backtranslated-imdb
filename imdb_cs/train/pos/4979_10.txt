This is the second Baby Burlesk short, to be released and probably the most popular, is a spoof of the silent 1926 What Price Glory. I looked at it and I do not understand what it is claimed. It's just a cute little movie. I have seen the family shows I grew up in the 1980s and 1990s, when girls dressed more provocatively in a "mature way". It was much more provocative because she DOES NOT BE CAREFUL dressed. There is nothing provocative about the diaper unless you have one of those fetishes. (just a joke) I read this film description and where it is said that only a pedophile would like to watch it. It is bad. For me, if you look at it and worry about it, you may have to look into your own psychology and try to find out why it botheys you. It's an innocent movie that was created as a parody of another movie. All B.B. were parodies, nothing more. Parody / spoofs of today are graphic in nature and they have really pornographic scenes and a rather nasty language. Should not you be terrible? I can watch those without problems, but sometimes they make childhood stories and turn them into dirt in those parodies. It should get under the skin. Not that they talked in 1926 (not just a word, I know) because we know how the silent films PORNOGRAPHIC are? Not to mention those movie films "Forbidden Hollywood Pre-Codex", so nasty and dirty. Would they ever do such dirt? (note sarcasm)
