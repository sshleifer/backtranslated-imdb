Pressburger and Powell's biggest film. David Niven plays a RAF bomber pilot who misses his own death but is given a second chance to live as he notices that he is AWOL and sends an angel to investigate. The scene where young soldiers, men and women, black and white, all killed in action, come to heaven to be processed for eternal life, are unbearably tangible. Watch out for Roger Livesey, the award-winning actor and Kim Hunter as a love affair (later, of course, Zira on the Planet of Monkeys). By the way, Steven Spielberg made an actress who played the main angel (Kathleen Byron) as an elderly wife of a private-owner of the same name in the film Saving Private Ryan half a century later, an act that tells the volume of his cinematographic literacy.
