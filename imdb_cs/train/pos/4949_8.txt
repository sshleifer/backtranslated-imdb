10 ITEMS OR LESS is one of those "radar" images that are conceived in the simplicity that most independent films have: the frank, ad hoc performances of his two leaders - Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega - who make quite a complementary, unlikely duo. The great thing is that this whole movie seems unlikely despite its "road movie roots". How the unusual character of Morgan Freeman arrives mentally (not physically) to meet this exhausted girl who has an unhealthy relationship with her current superior (who also happens to be getting her with her crazy husband playing Bobby Cannavale in a small role) is somewhat left to be witnesses more than to infer, and their witty scam - the two people on the opposite sides of the company's coin - is deceptively simple. So in short, without any bang! moments of earthquake revelations, this movie is a special mood that is probably lost otherwise in the shuffle indies that came out in 2006 but deserves to be seen, even for honesty.
