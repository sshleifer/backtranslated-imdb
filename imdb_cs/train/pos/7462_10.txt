Note: These comments are for people who have seen the movie. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a great, exciting and exciting movie that exudes exactly what the tagline says: LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends. Perhaps the film plot may get into the focus of confused filmmakers if you look at them from another angle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Take the following into account: <br /> <br /> Now I'm a little crazy over the movie scene according to the scene so I will have to further explore my claims (and I welcome your thoughts) try to try and see if the movie falls into place: Where exactly is the debatable "splice"? <br /> <br /> Now I'm talking about the connection, as explained by the LE's technician, because the sequence itself can actually be interpreted as rationalization within David Aames's mind / dream / coma, but the true link between reality and dream. It seems to me that the reality of a car crash, the way it is shot (for example, without explosion), is a likely "connecting" point, and that any particular sequence containing an existential / dream / coma / unreality - as shown on the screen before or after the crash - is actually part of Aames's personal path to self-realization within his own mind. In this regard, we are left with two questions in this context (if you know more, let me know): is Aames really disfigured and waking up? Unless you are completely wrapped in the exact sequence of details in the plot or at what specific point your dreams are scattered, this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a person on the way to finding oneself that means in today's pop-culture society. <br /> <br />
