How can you rate this movie with 10/10? I admit that this movie is not too fun, but the goal is not to tell you the story but the history! This is the first "real" cinema history film ("The Prince of Galles was the first, but not technically perfect enough?") And undoubtedly, he has a tremendous international value: Those who saw the end of their working day in the movie had the opportunity to participate in the historical and when you think about the first people you've seen, it's very nasty! How long! Historically, for science first (since the Lumiere brothers first invented the cinematographer for scientific reasons) and for art later.
