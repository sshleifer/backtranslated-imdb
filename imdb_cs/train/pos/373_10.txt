this movie is such a moving, awesome piece of work. I saw it in the theater when it came out, but I was only 13 and I do not really "get it" ... I saw it again when I was 20 years old (on the video of course I own now) and it was just blown away. Steven Spielberg has created a gorgeous film to keep you from beginning to end. I've read a book, but there's something about the movie that really brings it to life. casting, acting, music, costumes, scenery, everything, it's just amazing. mixing, crying, cheering ... brings out all the emotions you can imagine. this is one of his best pieces of work and you should not miss it!
