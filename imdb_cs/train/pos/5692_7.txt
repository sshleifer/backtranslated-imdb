This is the second film based on the life and times of the ultraviolet porn star John Curtis Estes, better known as John Holmes. Boogie Nights is also roughly based on his life. Maybe sometimes someone is making a movie about Tommy Byron's life instead. The problem is that the story is not very well said. There are many Law & Order episodes that have more twists than Wonderland, and the director never gets a criminal thing with any taste. Val Kilmer has two problems - not as close as Holmes (and this time no prosthesis, unlike Boogie Nights) and is much better than Mope Holmes. <br /> <br /> The director does not interpret any single singer among the cast. The racial, immature lower boundaries with which he hangs or his wife, and the police are not much trying to characterize. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is Eric Bogosian, who tells Paris Hilton that he has "lost". <br /> <br /> When all this has been said, anyone who is interested in the strongest porno shop site in the 1980s, or a real crime, should not miss it.
