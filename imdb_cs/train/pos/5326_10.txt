The Beatles' Birth, as the American television film released in the autumn of 1979, was the best film ever to tell the story of four Liverpool boys who revolved around the music industry and the world. As has been said from the point of view of the former Beatle Pete Best. The performance of the entire cast is excellent, but especially the performance of Stephen Mackenny as John Lennon and Rod Culbertson as Paul McCartney. The film was produced by the legend of Rock and Roll, Mr. Dick Clark. Who had produced another television movie in 1978, which was a test of time, where Kurt Rusell plays the lead role for another musical legend; "ELVIS". The film was directed by an unknown director named John Carpenter, who continued to direct other successful films such as Halloween, New York Escape, and The Case. The same can be said of the Director of the "Birth of the Beatles", Mr. Marquande. He continued to direct other theater stars, such as Star Wars Return of the Jedi, Eye of the Needle and Jagged Edge among many. The only other film that tells the story of Fab Four, which I know, is Back Beat, which won theatrical performances in 1994. Critics did not care about it, not even the public, because she did not live in the theater for a long time. Beatles' birth is a very charming and simplistic film that gives you the essence of the legend and the struggles and difficulties that have lived and ends at this moment the peak of success when it arrives in NYC and appears in the Ed Sullivan show in 1964 I recommend this movie.
