This film is neither morbid nor depressing. It is unlikely because AIDS in the early 1990s. But his real message is love and perseverance. Mark and Tom were in a long, loving relationship. Their mutual commitment is immediately evident, and when AIDS devastation escalates and becomes the focal point of their lives, you see strength and determination that are truly heartfelt. When Silverlake Life was originally released, I was deeply involved in education and HIV / AIDS care, volunteering as an HIV / AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me as if no other film of his day could be, because Mark and Tom were real people who lived in the experiences I saw daily in real life. From my own experience, I knew what it was like when you were looking at AIDS to get rid of the former, healthy, healthy young people; seeing it happen to Mark and Tom in the movie was very similar to watching my real friends get worse. It touched me so that after all these years I still touched.
