Thirty years ago, Numa Sadoul gave interviews with Belgian comic artist Georges Remius (known as Herge, the creator of Tintin). This film is saddened by Saddam today when he recalls the interview while listening to the cassettes (Herge died in 1983) and saw some old photos and shots of the man himself. Some parts of the interview were not published in the book at the request of Herge, and now we know that it is his separation from his wife after having a relationship with one of his associates (who later became his second wife). An interesting thing the film does not care about is the shift in Tintin books from early right and imperialist books (Tintin in Congo, Tintin in the Soviets) into relatively anti-imperialist books just a few years later Blue Lotus. Overall, I came out of this film when I knew a little more about Herge, and I saw him a little more irreconcilable than when I came to the theater.
