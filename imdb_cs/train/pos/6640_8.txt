This one-minute movie is probably the first film ever to be shot. Other inventors have previously shot action - such as Edison's sneeze motion photo - but the Lumiere brothers have developed devices that have made tremendous advances. At that time, of course, their "cinematographer" had to confuse his peers, including their subjects. In this first case, the brothers record that employees are leaving the factory, some of them, of course, fighting to hide their awareness of the camera. Lumieres is trying to make the movie more entertaining by introducing animals and a bicycle, but La Sortie Des Usines Lumiere almost does not match the inventiveness of their later films. The most interesting aspect of this short film is the choice of brothers of the well-known ritual of the working class as their subject. Their choice is the initial proof of their curiosity about all the people in the world, a quality that makes their experiments immensely enriching and fascinating. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
