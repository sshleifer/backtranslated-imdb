It seems that Hal Hartley's films are mostly viewers. This movie will not be an exception to this rule. Fay Grim has been acting as a continuation of Hartley's "Henry Foole" since 1998. He is now concentrating on Henry's former wife (playing with Perfect Parker Posey), who the CIA talks about Henry's unsupported book about all his shady acts. In the meantime, Fay ends up in the odyssey, dealing with international spies, etc. The film gets a bit rooted in the second half. If you are a fan of Hal Hartley in the past, you do not have to miss it. For the beginner of Hartley's first timer, who only heard about his movie technology, you might want to look at his previous movies before trying it out (especially if you have not seen Henry yet). I admired the work with a camera that sometimes reminded me of a certain shot of Man Ray.
