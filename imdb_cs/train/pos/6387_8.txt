I thought this movie was very well compiled. The sound voices were great too. I liked how everyone overcame their conflicts and achieved their goals. I would recommend this movie to someone. It was definitely worth the time and money to look at it. Atlantis has some comic scenes that make me laugh. The other scenes made me sad. And others like me. It's a movie that can be of any age. From the moment Milo is a crazy "professor" or until he gathers the crew for a fantastic cruise under the sea. After watching the movie, I read a book. It was also good, but the film brings you better pictures. It's like a book. But go on and watch this movie!
