The Farretly brothers, Bobby and Peter, are on it again. With Fever Pitch, the creators of other films that dealt with a bunch of rough themes left this tactic when they decided to bring Nick Hornby's film to the screen, which would be hard to do. The novel of the same title has dealt with the human obsession with football because it is located in England where this sport consumes most of British sports fans. It is the benefit of the writing team Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandell to turn the book into a language that would benefit most Americans when they became the heroine of the Boston Red Sox fans. "Fever Pitch" is a film featuring an obsessive fan of Ben Wrightly, whose life spins into the Red Sox season, and is an eighty-tale teacher with extraordinary ways of involving his students into the subject they are trying to teach. When Ben takes four of his best pupils to visit the local business, he meets and falls hopelessly in love with the wise Lindsey Meeks, a young woman who is going to, but she does not have her own life at the age of thirty. br /> <br /> The story follows two lovers in attending the Red Sox ritual, at home games in Fenway Park. Fans of this team are probably the most faithful people in the world who are holding a team that does great things but until 2004 they never won the World Series. In fact, the end of what we heard was changed because it was the year that eventually won an event that had avoided them in the eighties. Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are perfect as a couple in the middle of the movie. Mrs. Barrymore is a natural person who always surprises her in front of the camera. Jimmy Fallon, a favorite TV comedian, has become an acting actor, has a better chance than his last show in "Taxi," in our humble opinion. Brothers Farrelly's film will also satisfy fans as baseball fans with this baseball story.
