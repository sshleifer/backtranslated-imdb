Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) will leave the reform school and return to the slums. His sister (Ann Sheridan) is doing the best to keep him out of trouble, but she seems to have followed him. Besides his association with the Termite gang, Gabe is followed by real gangsters who have the scheme to light up random buildings to collect insurance. They need someone to accuse of arson, and Gabe is. It is up to the termites to work for their benefit and to give the gangsters only their desserts. The scene that introduces Dead End Kids is pretty good. The boys move to the street to the furniture of a new resident and move on as they do. They speak with false accents and talk about drinking together tea; Bernard Punsley rests on the back. The boys then continue to fight with the new boy, but after appearing as a good fighter, they ask him to join his club. The initiation scene is rather good, full mess seems to be dangerous at first, but it's really rather clever and innocent. Later, when Billy Halop is studying to be a mayor, he has a dream about school work. It is superbly introduced, with small holograms of children that walk around his face and burn questions to him. Angels Wash Their Faces is a great title because it plays the success of Angels With Dirty Faces, and really says what kids do. Known for bad behavior on and outside the set, these guys make this movie pretty. But rather than seemingly irresponsible, they make some big laughs. This is a preview of what many boys would become in The Bowery Boys. We even got a few misinterpreted words from Leo Gorcey.
