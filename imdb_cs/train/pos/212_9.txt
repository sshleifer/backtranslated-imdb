Just like the comedy duo of her title "The Sunshine Boys", it has become a forgotten classic 30-year year. He barely talks about him next to other great comedies of the 1970s. It does not make sense because of the unique peculiarity of this film, perhaps the best Neil Simon ever written. Walter Matthau plays Willy Clark, one half of the legendary vaudeville comedy known as Lewis and Clark, now a bitter 73-year-old solo act that can not get a job in a potato chips business. His nephew and agent Ben (Richard Benjamin) is convinced that he will work if Willy agrees to reunite with alienated partner Al Lewis (George Burns) on ABC-TV to celebrate the showbusiness nostalgia. <br /> <br /> Nostalgia is what the Sunshine Boys is going through in the rhythm from the very beginning, when a series of films from the 1920s showcased various animators from the old flashes ahead of us to accompany "Be A Clown" from Cole Portera. Then there is the current state of play in Manhattan, where trousers and wide polyester ties were melting. The period collides in Willy's famous disguise in a Manhattan apartment where framed photographs and cartoons of long-standing celebrities are viewed from the walls on dark tabloid headlines and empty Zabar bags. If you were in the 1970s like me, you could even feel like that apartment. Willy apparently lives too long. He sleeps in front of the TV when he brews the kettle in the other room. Willy wakes up and picks up the phone. <br /> <br /> "Hello, who is it?" Pause. "It's tea." <br /> <br /> Elderly men who live alone can be a sad material in almost every other way, but Shimon's agile joke and vague sense of character alters this adaptation of his 1972 golden comedy script. The awesome thing about "The Sunshine Boys" is how much your noses in Willy's almost existential state are distracting you without turning them off at all. "89 years old and he's dying for nothing," Willy says of an old writer's story before deciding that a man probably died when he wrote a song that rhymed "lady" and "child." <br /> <br /> Burns won the Oscar for his subtle performance as a gentle but steel Lewis, but Matthau is the one who brings him home, his makeup and the proud but busy bearing really sells you for it was 73 when he did. Willy is unpleasant in extreme mode, and he deserves Ben's description of the "crazy Freakin old man," but you are all rooted in him and are looking forward to his little victories, even if he is worth the patience of others. His lines also kill you, especially when he tries to kill Lewis, for whom the reunion of the television show will turn out to be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> "You are out of contact!" Willy tells Lewis at one point. "I'm still wanted, I'm still hot!" <br /> <br /> "If this room was in the fire, it would not be hot," Lewis replied. Herbert Ross shoots everything very casually and inconspicuously, with low illumination and medium shots, even in emotional moments, leaving room for comedy and the whole Zen message of grace through silent admission. You never feel like watching a movie, some of the "The Sunshine Boys" have many spells, and Ross's direction, as well as the three principles, leads a long way to achieving that goal. <br /> <br /> The comedy is tough, especially when it comes to life-watching people, but "The Sunshine Boys" all show pleasure because it's for us watching.
