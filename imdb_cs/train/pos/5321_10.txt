This movie really surprised me. At first I had doubts about it, but the film improved and improved for every minute. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's not for action that tries to audience, but for those who like the explicit portrait of a very strange criminals, man, lover and husband. If you are not a fan of bad language or sexual content, this is not really for you. <br /> <br /> The story is sometimes hard to watch, but in the end I think everything was better. The end was unexpected because you were almost disgusted and thought it would end up otherwise. <br /> <br /> As for acting, I think it was good. She will not be worth the Oscar for a long time, but at least I was surprised. Gil Bellows portrait of a prisoner is not always perfect, but it is very funny. Shaun Parkes portrait of Bellows prison mate Clinique is great and extremely powerful. On the downside, I think I will put Markie on Esai Morales. <br /> <br /> Take your advice and watch this movie, whether you love it or dislike it!
