I came across this movie on TV and could not turn it off. Peter Sellers plays an unforgettable person who falls into the extremely warm and cute Goldie Hawna (who would not?). The way Goldie's character keeps from the beginning of the film to the end is also unconventional today. This movie gave me a different angle to human relationships, and it also seemed very fun to me. Peter Sellers's roles were difficult to sell, but I think it's going well.
