It's an excellent movie. As a Canadian man who grew up with rural life, most of them are known, winter, canoeing, hunting, hunting, and so on. It's easy to take known for self-evident, but after watching this movie it has grown several times on me. The Gray Owl Story is well known for many Canadian credit director Attenborough and script writer Nicholson for the story extension. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Annie Galipeau is beautiful in her first big role. The rest of the cast is solid.
