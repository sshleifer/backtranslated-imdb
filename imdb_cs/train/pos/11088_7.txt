Villian in this movie is a curious sob and seems to be enjoying what he does, that's what I think he thinks so. I think most men will like this movie, especially if they ever cheated on their wife. This is one of those films that remain largely up to the end. But then you have it, the end of the candy that leads me back and I say, "HOKIE AS HELL". Pretty good movie to the end. The end is the end we want to see, but not the end of such a beginning. And then they are the consequences of what happened. You guess you can make your own opinion about the real end. I had the feeling that only one character had to survive at the end.
