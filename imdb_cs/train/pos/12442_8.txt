While recording the impossible schedule and budget we are not talking about, the film has proven much better than you would expect, certainly much more true for books and comics than Peter O'Donnell than the previous two films. You can read the band that is currently in reprinted books from Titan Books or the Revue comics monthly. It's one of the greatest adventure comics of all time. The film is not great, but unlike most low-budget movies, it makes the most of what it did and is your interest. The DVD extras an interview with Quentin Tarentin, who is obviously stoned, is gas. Some people, Tarentino, have questioned that he has been associated with the film with his name, but without it it would never have been. He is a fan of Modesta Blaise and chose a good writer and director. It all considered it worth 8 stars.
