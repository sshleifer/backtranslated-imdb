FATTY DRIVES BUS is simply the most entertaining, original and fun thing I've ever met. <br /> <br /> This film is by no means in line with Hollywood standards, and even with the straight-a-movie film fuzzy comedy playing terry "hulk" hogan when it comes to camera work, editing, acting, budget, or whatever. What this movie has, however, is a very original pleasant story, and of course it's from people who love to do it, and the enthusiasm of all the cast and crew actually break through all of their budgets and acting downfalls. This movie proves that you do not need a huge budget or decent actors to make a great movie, all you need are some original ideas and a passion for your doing. <br /> <br /> Simply the best movie ever. I do not care how you get it, borrows it, order it, steal it, download it, you just see this movie. Now I just hope they make a DVD version.
