This movie is probably my favorite film of all time. Miriam Flynn is as good as Bunny Packard. Zane Buzby as Delores is a comic genius. The rest of the cast is amazing and the movie is really really funny. A certain satire of horror films, with a negligible twist. If you enjoy entertainment, a comedy evening, then go and rent this classic. You'll laugh all the way!
