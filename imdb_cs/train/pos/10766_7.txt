Thin story with many fine shots. Vaccinations are here three ladies from D.R.E.A.M. team. And to a lesser extent the guy who accompanies them. The Traci lords are convincingly stepping out of the female half of a bad business couple who wants to poison the world with an anthrax. The origin of this film is a bosom bomb, which was deployed on a captured member of the D.R.E.A.M. Of course, he's rescued by the co-member, three seconds before the explosion. Although he clearly borrowed from James Bond "Goldfinger" and "You live only twice", such a top always works well. Every beautiful watch, James Bond has replaced Charlie's Angels here.
