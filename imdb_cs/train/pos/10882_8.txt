It's not a bad movie. Based on the new conventions of modern horror, a movie in the film, a well-known actress running for life in the first scene. This film takes the old psycho-killer's convention when it's released and can do something new and interesting. It's always nice to see Molly Ringwald back for the attack. So it can be an example of what has become a genre. The cut strikes all the marks and in some parts is really scary. I enjoyed giving her eight.
