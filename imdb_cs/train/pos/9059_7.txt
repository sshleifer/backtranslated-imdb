It's a good movie, a good family movie that watches if you have nothing else to do. If you expect this movie to be a word from a book, you will be very disappointed. I was somewhat disappointed because I read a book several times when I was in elementary school. This is a new baby in a town named Billy. He bets the school bullying and the bet is not like most bets. Billy must eat ten worms in one day or win. "Acting is okay, probably the worst part of the movie, the guys are exaggerating a lot of things, they think it's an apocalypse if Billy does not eat worms, Hallie Eisenberg has done a great job." The plot line is good as a movie , but it's pissed off as a book of customization. I was able to watch this movie without looking at it ... sometimes. <br /> <br /> Overall it was a good family film with some weak points. 7/10.
