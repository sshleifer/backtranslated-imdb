This show is horrifying! Jokes are original, God and I love Eric and Kels! Yeah, I know what they say after the 8th season is no stranger, because Eric and Kelso are no longer in the show and Randy is a real dumbass. Randy is compared to Eric and Kels. <br /> <br /> You can not take the funniest characters and switch them to "Boy" like the boy (Randy). it's not his fault anyway, but the writers are trying to keep the 8th season funny, it's still, not as much as in previous times, but it's okay. 360s are amazing, the circle, Red is a real kind of mentally abusive father :) and the cat is always a half soup. Hyde will always be cool, he has his moments. The least favorable characters are Jackie and Donna. they are fine, but not without Kelso and Eric. <br /> <br /> Great show. Dumbass!
