Goebbels's motivation behind was not investigated. After the end of Stalingrad, the empire decided to go into the "complete war". This is referenced in the film. Part of this was that women used military efforts, which Germany did not do much in the past. SS women's massacre would face Goebbels with a public-style disaster. His preference was for the problem to expire as quietly as possible, on the grounds that the Jewish men could later be rounded. I understand that most survived the war. His next problem was that the "red" Berlin had never been very enthusiastic about the Nazi thing and had to be treated with caution. Again, women's massacre could make the Nazis see how much support they have been given in their capital. Interestingly, most SS uniforms showed patches indicating that the men who wore them were not of German nationality but came from German origins in other countries such as Lithuania or Latvia
