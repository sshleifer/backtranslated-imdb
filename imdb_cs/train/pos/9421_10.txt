Contains * spoilers * - Also my quotes may not be accurate. Anyone who always sees satire in social commentaries and economic parallels - as is true. But for me, I see this movie much more than that. I love the symbol of this guy in a shining white suit. There is so much confusion and dirt in the world around him, but it will not hold. Alec Guiness was the right guy to play this - his boyish doubts and eternal curiosity are so good: "That's brilliant - can you tell me what is the ratio of ink to gas?" <Br /> <br /> The only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention has not worked at all - he was almost naked. Still, more than shame is simply a disappointment that "it did not work." Humans have never suffered him. Do not forget, but Sidney, we also want to stop it. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> tired of money and power, she thinks she finally found love outside of her father's father, initially she does not care about Sidney as someone else but the moment she drops out of the car gets back and finds out if she might have killed her - and she still thinks only about the beauty of her invention, and finally she finds something she thinks worthwhile, funny it's not even a romance, it's a friendship, but with such a passing temper that the title almost does not fit. admiration and perhaps inspiration When he found that Michael had no real love for her and that her father was totally incapable of taking care of her, she was cynically trying to find Sidney and fortunately she finds that people in this world are living more than a lot, money and lust What refreshments: <br /> <br /> "Thank you Sidney. If you said "yes" when it seems that all these crazy trades did not make any difference. But then a bubbling, unpredictable rhythm begins, and Sidney goes out, his pace is balanced. Where is Daphne? We really do not know - but they were not really in love and it was not a scientist. He helped escape and got a shot in the arms of hope. (Pollyanna) The post would be nice, but as Billy Joel says "it's more than I hoped ..." <br /> <br />
