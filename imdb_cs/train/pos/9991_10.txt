I thought this movie was hysterical. I have followed it many times and I highly recommend it. Mel Brooks, he was great. The cast was fantastic .. I do not understand how this movie gets 2 out of 5 ratings. I loved it .. I saw other movies and it was also funny, but this guy really pulled out in my mind because of humor .. I just can not say enough about this movie. I'm looking for it to be regular, but it's never been enough. People who played homeless were also compared to the most stunning standards. Please provide this movie more often. I can not see enough. Love Ann Warren was also my favorite since the beginning of Cinderella. I always thought she was not really funny but loved her. She was very funny in this movie ... and she and Mel worked great together. He should give more movies to television.
