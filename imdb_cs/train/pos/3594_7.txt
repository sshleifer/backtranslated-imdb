Michelle Rodrigez was created for this movie when I first saw her in Fast and Furious. One could say she is a heavy woman. With this film, she has not only demonstrated her acting, but she has no fear and it's as hard as it should be in this movie. She's a bad girl and I like it. This film is a troubled girl, lives like a boy, and is still struggling with school and family. When she is interested in her brothers training that they are boxers, she decides she will go for love to fight and asks her brother trainer to practice. Even though I do not think she has the potential, they will prove to prove wrong. I think this movie was a little slow at the end, but it was well done. It shows that people can do anything, even though I do not think you have the potential. I recommend that it be seen.
