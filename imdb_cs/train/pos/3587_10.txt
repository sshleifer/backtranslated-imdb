I really like this movie ... when I started to watch it, I thought I was soon bored, but I was surprised ... I thought it was a great movie and I've seen it several times. The characters are credible and I have to say that I fell in love with Brian Austin Green again (Beverly Hills 90210 for the first time). I would recommend this movie if you are a fan of it, but I agree with the other comment mentioned earlier that the end is a little disappointing. I'd like it to be a little different! But it does not matter, a good story.
