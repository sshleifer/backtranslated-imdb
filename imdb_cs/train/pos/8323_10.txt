"A little nonsense is kept here and there by the wisest men." <br /> <br /> If you are too smart to watch this movie, then you are too smart to be alive. <br /> <br /> Magic romp, a wonderful assumption, the season is happening with an acute look at detail. Walter Matthau, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins and others - just great! <br /> <br /> Rent, sit down, relax, take it, smile a little. Enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Then thank you.
