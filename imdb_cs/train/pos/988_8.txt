I like this movie. When the guy, who was in a $ 40 million dollar gold bank robbery dies, his cellular buddy is used as a "bait" to lead them to the top crazy killer technologies (by having monitoring devices implanted in the jaw without monitoring) . It's an action-spy movie with comic scenes to make it light. It reminded me of the Enemy of the State. Well said and good plot.
