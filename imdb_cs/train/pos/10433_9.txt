American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna to take the plane to the US. On the train he met the French girl Celine. Although they met for the first time, they talked like good friends. When the train stopped in Vienna, Jesse begged Celine to accompany him to go on a Vienna trip. Then the romantic story unfolded. <br /> <br /> At first they were careful. The funniest scene was listening to a CD in a music store. They looked at each other, even though their eyes did not touch. After a thorough conversation, the relationship is approaching. Then I saw the most romantic scene he pretended to call his friend. Their deep love for each other was fully expressed in words. Love is a weird thing. If you really want, she will not come as she wished. Love needs mutual understanding. Without it, love will not last long. Spiritual harmony is most important to love. The excellent screenplay and performance have led to the film's tremendous success. One of the best romantic movies. 9/10
