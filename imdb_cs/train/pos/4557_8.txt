I thought Hugh O'Conor was as stunning as the young Christy Brown and really deserved greater recognition for his role. I could not believe how well he played the role. Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis was great too. My favorite scene is where the boys play soccer and Christy uses his head to stop the goal and then kicks the punishment! An amazing performance of two Christs (and others).
