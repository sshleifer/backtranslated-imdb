I really love this movie, I've seen it again last week after 3 years or so. This movie is perfect, great acting, great story, great directing / camera / music. It's a gift that will show you to someone you love. too bad jaco van dormael did not make more movies after this. Top 5 work. Really! <br /> <br /> Today it's 3 years and 3 days later than the above comment. has never been published because it was no more than 10 rows. Anyway, I saw yesterday "le huitieme jour". This is undoubtedly in my movie 3. together with "Cinema Paradiso", which is also a masterpiece. The soundtrack is also really good. I'm really curious about the new movie "jaco von dormael". I hope it will finish my film top 3. If you see this movie, hires it. Or even better. buy. Because you will want to see again.
