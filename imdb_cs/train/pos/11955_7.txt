Let yourself be transported to another old school narrative. Scoop is a classic by Woody Allen. Allena's latest muse, Scarlett Johansson (who also starred in Match Point last year, also Allen), surprisingly calms her noble sexual kitten and transforms her normal-looking student type with the help of his nerd goggles and clothing but still fails to believe the audience, how can Hugh Jackman's lord's character strike with respect to the royal background (do not worry, nor spoilers here). In Johansson's character, there are no large predominations, because they play the same role across the letter they say differently. Even forgive her apparent lack of logic and continue the relationship with the suspect serial killer, simply because it's Jackman's royal hotness that refreshes to see Wolverine slam. is what is 70-year-old Allen. He continues to tell his stories about celluloid in the same way he always has; as if he had never been exposed to a modern movie, which is probably what makes his silent, simple movies appealing. They never seem to focus on a particular market; as if Allen had made movies according to his own taste, whether he liked the public or not.
