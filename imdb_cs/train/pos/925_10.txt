One word: suPURRRRb! I do not think I've seen anything like that for a long time in the network or in cable TV. Watching this show was like breathing fresh air in the middle of a television schedule full of reality shows and boring re-runs. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I had my reservations. After all, critics were almost unanimous in crying foul and downgrading parades. But when it's half an hour (by the way, thank you, NBC for running a show without commercial ads), I left a feeling of instant love, love at first glance, the true love she feels in his gut. Everything about EXCELLENCE was screaming about this show. The graphics in this show were at least as good as Finding Nemo and Shrek. No little fate that considers these films lasted for years. <br /> <br /> The game was awesome. I'm John Goodman's partial voice, but the rest of the team is definitely on the same level as John. Special mention: Lisa Kudrow's guest appearance. She was at the top of the game, creating a nervous, crazy and nice pandemonium with a Jewish stripe. (Panda from Brooklyn? Just in this show.) The script was funny, with lots of jokes inside and adults that were sharp, yet not sticky. Note for all parents: this is not for children. This show has never been advertised as such, and here's why it's set at 9:00, not at 8pm. If you want to complain about the "unpleasant context", you will save your breath. Adults deserve a comedy that has been made of them, and it is a father of pride. <br /> <br /> Everything was not perfect. I was a little confused by Siegfried and Roy's characters. Do I feel "stereotype" when it comes to them? Yes, they are gay. Yes, they are stunning. Yes, he speaks with German accents. But that's yesterday's news. Give us something new, something fresh, funny. Putting old jokes into a new show is definitely a bad attitude. I understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the "star power" these guys have. It's alright. But do not hesitate, please, for something that everyone knows by heart. Hopefully the rest of the show will not play the same old record again and again. <br /> <br /> Overall, the show is definitely Must-See-TV. Funny, funny, with some unexpected twists back and forth - it was not a comedy from Seinfeld. I'm certainly looking forward to another episode.
