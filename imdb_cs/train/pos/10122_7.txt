I found it to be a bit difficult to follow to the point that it seemed to dive in the middle while I was trying to make the head or tail of the one who fought who and why. One problem is a cultural / language problem. Here we have a Chinese / Taiwanese / Japanese problem that we know little about, and because we simply read English subtitles, we inevitably lose some of the fines. Another problem is that there seem to be too many just half explanations of distortion and compliance. However, it seems unlikely that there is a very bad film Miiki, and it certainly is not. Lots of stylish and bone crunchy violence, a window of less than orthodox sexual activity and a family aspect. Overall, it's a decent ride, but maybe we'll look at the story, it may be useful to look at this.
