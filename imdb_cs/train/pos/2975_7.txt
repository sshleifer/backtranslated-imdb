Trey Parker and Matt Stone, creators of the South Park show, are coming back with something else. It creates a new sport that combines baseball and basketball. This sport is known as baseball. It's like basketball, except baseball rules involved and there's another letter in the headline. Here's how you play: just shoot the ball while these two guys are trying to distract you from taking a shot. Sounds simply. In fact, I could try it one day. Playing hits on the streets will soon become a huge success. Who would know that 2 mature friends could invent a sport that has become so successful? My opinion <br /> <br /> "Baseketball" is a very crude and stupid spoof full of lots of violent horrors, but it actually brings some laughter and a lot of fun. Certain recommendations for those of you who like ghost and rude humor.
