I've seen this movie many years ago on nightclub. At that time it was the title "Stairway to Heaven". Even as a young boy, I remember that I was deeply moved and disturbed by the visual effects of the lawsuit (those who saw it know what I was talking about). Such imagination! Perfect blend of romance, drama, humor and fantasy, this movie is home to the greatest classics: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind. This film is rated by the extremely high IMDB voters and correctly - over 51% of voters rated it 10 out of 10; more than 84% rated him 8 or more out of 10. I was surprised that he was not featured in the 250 best films before I realized that such a film had little / has this film compared to those on the list. What a shame. I hope this movie will be released on DVD for Region 1 (North America), so 1), I can buy it and 2) others discover this hidden treasure.
