This is Eddie Murphy's final show of one person, in which Eddie Murphy is the best. Just forget Nutty Professor and Distinguished Gentlemen, this is real Eddie Murphy. His imitations of Mr. T. (pretending to be gay), Michael Jackson and other artists are killers. I think it's also pretty bold to make fun to the artists who were really popular at the time. My favorite act is one where he is at the annual BBQ with his family and plays his drunken father and Aunt Bunny, who falls off the stairs. This show is the best cure when you feel down! If you are looking at 'Raw', you do not have to be disappointed. It's pretty good, but it does not answer "Delirious".
