As incredible as it may seem, Gojoe is an anime and Hong Kong-inspired samurai action movie with a pacifist message. This ankle of the film is effectively portrayed through the protagonist (a great work by Daisuk Ryu), the killer-turned-bodkist-monk Benke. Benkei swore he would never kill again, but he still takes his sword to fight what he thinks to be a demonic invasion ... Gojoe is a movie that is difficult to judge. Visual images are awesome and beautiful, but they use too many tricks (orbiting cameras and high-speed discs, expressionist images, smooth colors, digital effects, etc.). So the end result is somewhat tiring. This means that the beginning and end of the movie are still elegant and powerful. If only director Sogo Ishii was wise enough not to use too many of his tricks. Another problem with Gojoe is the amount of violence. For a movie with such an anti-violent message, Gojoe loses too much energy and screens to display endless combat scenes. The way in which violence is exposed is always on the edge of self-esteem; in fact it seems that a blood shower against the night sky is one of the film signatures. Fortunately, Ishii is wise enough to show the ugly, tragic side of violence. Yet it seems that Ishii is not sure whether he is doing a traditional action movie or deeply moral allegory. Viewers can not even be sure of it until the very end of the movie. A strong (though cynical) end is what Gojoe will save; clearly emphasizes that this film is more than just a gore-fest.
