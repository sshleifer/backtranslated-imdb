If you loved Deep Cover, you may also like this movie. Many poetic interludes, which Fishburne recites in a deep cover, come from the lyrical "Once In The Life" screen, Fishburne's adaptation of the game. If you love Larry like me, you will love this movie, which is everything Larry, all hot and everything is exhausted. There is, of course, a game of weapons and illegal use of addictive substances, it's a gangster film, but the script is beautiful and the story touches, even a little on the cat's side. <br /> <br /> Amazing movie ... dark, scary, sexy and exciting. If you have slipped or hung in the clubhouse at night, you will get the right impact of the rigid sets (meteoforically sounding when trapped in life). Full of clever prejudices and complicated relationships, this film is tense. Every sentimental mirror appears in the mirror in the scene and in the cameras. GOOD WORK!
