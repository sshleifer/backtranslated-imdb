"In the first episode, Jared Diamond mentioned that other nations in the world did not have animals to domesticate, but Europeans did it and that is why we are able to produce steel and invent complex machines." --- It is obvious that the person who wrote this comment did not understand the arguments behind this document or the original book. Please do not destroy this great piece with your simple idea. Reasons are far more complex than the one you mentioned. Please read the book as well as a great source of information. I really liked it. This book is even taught as textbooks at some universities.
