Long before Tim LaHay and Jerry B. Jenkins shook the world of Christian subculture (and millions in the process) with LEFT BEHIND, MARK IV Pictures, the Christian film distribution company of evangelistic company Billy Graham, gave us a masterpiece. What I love most about this genre is its incredible attention to detail sitting in the living room. Instead of bringing us to the dramatic scenes of this "wailing" tribulation, we sit in the living room and hear about the news because the filmmakers can not afford to show it. The premise of the film is embedded in pre-Millenial pre-Tribulation eschatalogues, believing that Christ will come once for the secret reception of the true church, and then come again at the end of seven years of hell on earth. What frightened me at the junior age now makes me laugh. Patty's adventurous adventure and her journey through tribulation (and two of the three sequels) tell her a remarkable story of unbelief and ultimately a denial. I hate to admit it, but I still like it. He even has the same score of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I think I'm the only person in history to watch.
