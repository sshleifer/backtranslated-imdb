I really liked the first 2 seasons. because many good characters disappeared later. like most of the shows are initially slowed down, then improves in later seasons, but it's an absolute reversal. Jenny from the first season and Valarie from 2nd season were Sabrina's friends, I really did not care about the others, Jenny and Valarie were her best friends. I think that for some reason, the producers wanted us for some reason not to like their colleagues from school, they were so cruel to Sabrina. but my favorite Season 1 episode is a cat showdown and my favorite episode of season 2 is sorcery waste, that's the most fun episode. I also thought it was funny how Libby was popular, but she was always jealous of Sabrina, and she never seemed to have a real friend, but she always wanted to be with Harvey. I just wanted them to get better. I also liked how the first two seasons during the opening credits Sabrina said a few words while wearing the costume, as in the pilot episode where she is in the costume of the witch, I liked her saying, "It's not me," and later she was trying to change something else is what I think, but it really is a great show. it's a bit like the andy griffith show so, because it was good at the beginning, but once the color changed and the barney fife left, it was better. but I still like it, but the only reason I look at later seasons is because of the sabrina. what I thought of the introductory sequence is: Seasons 1-3 opening titles show that Sabrina poses with several different costumes and clothing in front of the mirror, as cast cast members quickly blink on the bottom of the screen. At the end, Sabrina said a pun on the clothes he was wearing and then disappeared. the introductory sequence of the four season contains the characters in the bubbles. Seventh-seventh-season introductory credits feature Sabrina at various locations around Boston
