"Mouse in the House" is a very classic cartoon Tom & Jerry, true to their tradition but with their own jokes. It's hysterical, cheerful, very entertaining and quite entertaining. The artwork is also good. <br /> <br /> This short is not just about Tom trying to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house and tries to catch a mouse because "there will be only one cat in the morning - and that's a cat that catches the mouse." <br /> <br /> If you ask me, there is a lot of funny gag in this cartoon character. The most amusing thing is for me, for example, when Mammy Two Shoes sees two lazy cats sleeping and sarcastically saying, "I'm glad you look forward to siesta," and they hope they're happy because it's not. two cats exhaled. Another funny gag is when Tom disguises as Mammy Two Shoes and strikes Butch with a pan and then Butch does the same trick with Tom. Of course, it's even more fun than it is when real Mammy Two Shoes appears and both (dumb!) Cats think they see each other mask like Mammy and then they both attack the "back" - lol. Of course he's upset, and once he's gone crazy, he's not someone with whom it could happen. But even this time Jerry is not winning because he is excluded.
