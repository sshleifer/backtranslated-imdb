Buoyant buoyancy !!! This film is based on the What If? Of course Mr. Destiny will be able to answer this question. The main character goes through a bad day, like many of us, and asks the question. Chaos theory states that a butterfly in China could affect someone here from a chain reaction. The focus of this film is based on one event during the baseball game. This event occurs in Destiny's motion; Just like Ashton in "The Butterfly Effect," in addition to Mr. Destiny, he uses a comedy over drama. The result is a new, somewhat original film. If a philosophical person is in line with "Butterfly Effect", he will probably like Mr. Destiny. I give her 7 out of 10. Amazing because I saw the first half of this movie three times and finally I watched it end with TBS.
