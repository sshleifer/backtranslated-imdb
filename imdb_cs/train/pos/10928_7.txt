Dying Master Kung Fu sends his last student to find out what happened to the previous five students who were members of the forbidden Clan Poison. He has to find out if it is good and if he does not stop it. the master also wants the student to find another clan member who has escaped with the clan the money the owner wants to use for the good. Earlier students were all taught in a different style of snake, centipede, scorpion, lizard, oil, while the last student was taught a bit in every style. All the students end up in one city looking for an old man with all the money and soon they all fight to get the money. The classic martial arts film has the title that even many non-fans know. I've talked to some occasional fans, and it seems to me that it's the movie that sticks in my head. It's a very good film, though I'm not sure why this movie stays with people when there are more films for my money that are better from Shaw Studios (One Armed Swordmen or Brave Archer series, for example). It's not a short film sale, no, because the film is structured as a secret, our hero has no idea who it is, and the Venoms themselves know that they are two of the others. We get the identity of four, but we still have to work who is really the fifth. The film is also strange in that for a martial arts film, in addition to training at the beginning and killing of an old man and his family for money, there really is no action for about 40 or 45 minutes. It's a courageous step to do that, but it pays off because the plot and the show hold your attention. (The film is also strange in that it is the first film about martial arts I've ever seen where there are no women I do not think she has a speaking role and I'm sure no background is shown. a small movie that does not have to meet the reputation it has in some circles in some circles, but it's still a really great movie to climb on your couch. <br /> <br /> About 7 of 10.
