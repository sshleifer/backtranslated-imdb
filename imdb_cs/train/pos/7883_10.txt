I saw this movie with my friend and could not stop laughing! I think this movie is not scary! It was funny that all the lines Freddy said were merry! I do not think they should even make a new nightmare and just go to Freddy Vs. jason. Although some parts were coarse (like blow head). and any ulm street movie from 1-5 sucked. this was the best except number 1. I wouldnt recommend this movie if you want a lot of horror. But if you do not have anything else to rent it and you will laugh a lot. I want to see a massacre on Texas chain saws, I think it would be scary. Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare Overall: B-
