This James bond game is the best bond game I've ever played in my life, it's my favorite James bond game because: <br /> <br /> Missions in this game are really fun, they can be really hard, more fun when playing missions they have a lot of action, the weapons you use are really good. The vehicles in this game are amazing that the mission car has a lot of action and they are really fun to play. The voice over the actors is really good and it's great that Sean Connery makes a voice for James's bond, and the way the bond looks is really great because it looks like Sean Connery when he played James in the movies and the other character looks almost the same as the look in film. Graphics are pretty good in this James bond game. Also the game follows the movie quite, but not all, but most of the time does, which is great. <br /> <br /> Total score ********** of ***** *****
