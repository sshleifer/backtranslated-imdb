Viggo Mortensen plays as a new prisoner a scary prison where a guard guard (Lane Smith played well) has a terrible secret that could be the reason why prison guards and prisoners are defeated by a supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick is a rescue worker who knows the secrets and is afraid of his life. When I think prison movies, I always think action movies are played in Stallone or Van Damme movies or a high-caliber drama such as Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile. However, I did not expect the story of spirits more in the form of Exorcist III. But prison is an atmospheric effort and definitely remains Renna Harlin's best film. The movie is scary and has some good acting from the cast (at that time) unknown. Lane Smith is coming out of the best because his manager is not the usual clich√© of bad personified but rather nervous and harrowing, which adds a certain credibility to the movie that far exceeds expectations. <br /> <br /> *** of 4- (Good)
