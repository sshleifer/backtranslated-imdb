Wow, I forgot how great the movie was until I was expecting him to look at the garage. It's a kind of strange combination of Michael Jackson's bio, collections of musical vignettes, and the story of a super hero struggling to save some young children. Vignettes are good (especially Speed ​​Demon), but the best part of this movie is the superhero segment in which Michael Jackson turns into a car, a robot, and finally a spacecraft (and it's as strange as it sounds). Joe Pesci is cheerful and has lots of great shots and great music to have fun all over the world. The real jewel is the unbelievable video "Smooth Criminal", which makes a movie that is worth to own only that part!
