We all create our own reality, or do we? This is the main question behind this very original and masterfully designed study of the illusory nature of reality. Blending Eastern and Buddhist Philosophy with Visual Chicanery M.C. Escher, this fascinating treatise is more likely to take up the brain question "Who are we and what is our place in the universe?" And turn it into a 100-minute full of fun and entertainment. The film focuses on Barta, a writer who fights his "The Sea they Think" scenario. When he sits at his computer, work begins to develop as nothing more than the description of his sitting at a computer writing script. Soon he is stuck in a swirling argument in which everything he writes becomes a reality. Director Gert de Graaff approached his theme with a nasty sense of humor and dazzled the viewer with a number of surprising visual tricks that confront the nature and validity of our perception. Eventually, de Graaf's film challenges viewers at several levels to ask if something we see, touch, or taste is really what seems to be, or whether our entire understanding of the universe and our place in it is just a trick that our senses are playing on us.
