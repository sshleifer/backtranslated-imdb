Abu, the secret of Baghdad, helps King Ahmed to regain his kingdom from the evil sorcerer. When Europe was preparing for the war, and significant parts of the world were rising in flames, London's Sir Alexander Korda films in London revealed this rich escape route from the legends of Aravish nights. Fulfilled by a sword and a wizard, the audience in 1940 gave a short exodus from the subtitles. It's also a great piece of film that features great acting and intelligent scenario. Conrad Veidt gets a top-grade invoice and deserves it, playing the evil Jaffar magician. His tense face with pierced eyes recalls the heavy role he played with such joy during the Silent Days. Here is the villain that is worth the attention. As a boy thief, Sabu is perfectly occupied in this third film. While he is not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is certainly heroic in deeds and actions. The rest of the cast does a good job. John Justin is energetic and sensitive as an unlit king, who must learn about the realities of living hard; Sabu gets a significant part of the action (when he does not convert to a dog), but Justin is suitably athletic when he needs it. Beautiful July Duprez plays a threatened princess from Basra, longing for two very different men. Appearing late in the movie, the massive Rex Ingram shakes things like a genie with an attitude. Allan Jeayes uses his gentle voice in favor as a story. Miles Malleson gains an extra eccentric role as a child sultan Basry, forever trembling about his mechanical toys (Malleson was also responsible for the movie screen). Elder Morton Selten displays the benevolent king of the legend. Mary Morris, later exceptional actress, plays the double role of Jaffar's accomplice and a six-arm Silver dancer. The film was begun in Britain, but war troubles caused Korda to move him to southern California, which probably explains the presence of American Ingram in the cast. Artistic direction, in vivid Technicolor, is the most attractive, especially in fabulous architecture in blues, whites & pinks. <br /> <br /> ****************** ******* Born Sabu Dastagir in 1924. Sabu was employed in Maharaja in Mysorech Stables, when Korda discovered it and set it in front of the cameras. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, DRUM-1938, EVERY BAGDAD-1940, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were his best and he found himself working from Hollywood after finishing. After a significant military service in World War II he continued his film career, but he became unlimitedly limited for years playing an ethnic role in unachievable tiny films, BLACK NARCISSUS (1947) is one big exception. His latest film, Walt Disney's Tiger Wals (1964), was an improvement, but it was late. Sabu died of a heart attack at the end of 1963, only 39 years.
