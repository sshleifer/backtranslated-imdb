I'm looking for Quo Vadise in my local video store, I found this version of 1985 that looked interesting. Wow! It was amazing! Very good film Ken Russell - very handy, styled, very artistic and of course "different". Nero was introduced not as bad as incarnate, but as a mad, unfulfilled emperor who preferred a career in a circus. Probably he wondered why he was "led" in the realm - it was not fun and fun, it was what he wanted. Klaus Maria Bandaur played a huge part in this role and played it for what it is worth. Yes, Nero pursued the Christians with vengeance; one of many who have done so. At one point, one of his followers muttered: "Nobody ever understands that we just protected." He got it that way.
