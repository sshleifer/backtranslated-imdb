The bartender drove any way the wind blows when he sings the song dEUS. Anarchy rules over a logical and common trunk of thought. The story behind this movie is simply how the wind blows. And it can be really refreshing when you look when you are ready and willing. Viewers who say there is nothing to keep the story line are right. Who the hell is Windman? I still enjoyed this movie. Antwerp is a beautiful, busy place to meet. It also captures foolishness, racism, bureaucracy, habits and violence that will survive unidentified in a seemingly friendly city. The movie is fun, fun and a bit shallow. Bartender's screen debut will not be as bad as his debut. In this light, one might be disappointed. But again, the "Worst Case Scenario" would be subtle headlines for any way the wind welcomes.
