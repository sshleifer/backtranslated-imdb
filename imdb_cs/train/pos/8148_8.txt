I have zero interest in rap and in the ghetto, I'm white and like classical rock music, it did not stop me in appreciating this fantastic comedy. It's largely a sequel to this game's spinal tap in the sense that it's the same movie, just about rap or rock. Still, it's funny. There are many funny jokes, but not without a few jokes that just fall. The characters are very fun and incredible. I watched it just because I laughed at 3 o'clock, and every film she can do requires at least a test projection. One of the reasons why these movies were so fun was that they enjoyed rapping from another. Rap is dealing with bad things today and is getting the sound of the studio and little talent. This film comes from the time when rappers deserved more credits. Overall, it's a funny movie with many jokes about racism, sex and musical culture among more obvious humor topics. This is highly recommended for all fans This is Spinal Tap. They are basically the same film, just about different worlds, and yes, the same jokes work in both films.
