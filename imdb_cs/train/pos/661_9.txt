Ho ho, a murderous maniac! This lively adaptation of the great story of EC Comics Horror is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of a range of cable TVs ever made. Director Robert ("The Return To The Future") Zemeckis will make the most of the freak scenario of Fred ("The Monster Squad"), Dekker, who focuses on the merciless two-member housewife Ellen Trainor, who married Zemeckis in this episode) , who kills her wandering husband on Christmas Eve (nice portraits by Marshall Bells) by throwing him on his head with a fireball. Complications arise when a kidnapped murderous madman dressed as a merry Kris Kringle escapes from a nearby asylum home and decides that Coach Payor will definitely have a hostile visit. Alan Silvestri is a scary, mixing score, and Dean Cundey's typically polished cinematography further strengthens macabre fun. And Larry Drake (sweet sweet gentleman Benny on "Law L.A!"), With his spooky swing, with a rainy green eye and a sad, really sinister smile, makes the sensational sanguine Saint Nick.
