I watch most of the films, Nick Mancuso, because I honestly like this guy, although he is typically busy as a baddie (fans for a long time should notice that he is blonde for some reason). It is a relatively well-known film in terms of conspiracy (but most of these films are not quite original) but Rick Roberts is attractive as an imperfect husband, Martha MacIsaac is just as attractive as a daughter and Mitzi Kapture does a good job if it was her goal , to be angry and sometimes quite heavy he likes. Nick is still able to show both magic and psychos. However, too many conspiracies take place off-screen - like motivation, past behavior, good times, and bad times - and things that seem to be obvious to the characters, they can never do the audience (ie I). The final scene leaves everything to be done in the category "but what ..." and overall, I can not say that I cared a lot about some of the characters. That was said, it was - a sensibly fun way to spend the afternoon - and I still like Nick.
