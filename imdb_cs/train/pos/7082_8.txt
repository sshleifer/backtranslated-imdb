First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor, but if you take most of his films, you will see that characters have those moments when they are the same. His character in this movie is far behind every individual ... and counts. The story begins in (not so far) the future when one is sent to the past to find a source of virus that swept the majority of mankind from the surface of the earth. It seems the story goes towards SF, but I think its closer to drama due to the slow rhythm of the story. About. Films tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more at the end than at the beginning, but as you can see this movie, you will be aware of this constant rhythm of the story and the discovery of facts that do not accelerate or slow down. Its only and the same speed that flows gently and quite well. But that does not mean that the tip gets used to pulling nerves, it makes them pretty good. As for the direction, there is a prefect. Movies as such are easily destroyed by poor direction, but this is much better. So if you're going to see a science fiction movie or some action, you'll miss it. B There should be other movies like this one.
