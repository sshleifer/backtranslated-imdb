This is the best movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because I live a few miles from the village where the story takes place, and I know how they work in Sweden. Movie tells the truth, believe me! Both criticize and honor Dalarna's lifestyle, and the producer wants people watching the movie to be more open and more careful about your closest friends and relatives. But if you live in another small village anywhere in Sweden (or any other country), you probably will know that movie too. <br /> <br /> Thank you Maria Blom!
