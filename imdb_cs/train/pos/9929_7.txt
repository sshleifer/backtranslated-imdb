I really doubt that this film is based on a true story. At the beginning, it is said to be based on a true story. I bet the only truth is that there is a former model that has become a favorite hunter, possibly named Domino. Anyway, starting with Domino talking to Lucy Liu, who works for the FBI. Domino is questioned about what he knows about the theft of $ 10 million. Through flashbacks we see Domino as a child, then as a model, and how she began to care about being a reward hunter. She basically tells 2 other reward hunters, Ed and Choco. They let her join the group. It's tough, she can use any weapon and use her good looks if needed. It is associated with the scam that Clarmont, bailsman, is going. On the way, the band opens a real estate TV show, and it's where Ian Zering and Brian Austin Green are joining. They are some hosts, and they must have been really desperate to come up with it. I thought the story was fun and some laughs. Editing did not bother me. There is also a lot of violence, especially with weapons and blood. It could have been a bit shorter. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Look a lot to watch.
