Nina Foch brings a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun little Gothic nail. She received the position of Secretary of the London Society of the Widow (played by Imperial Dame May Witty) and her creepy son (acting and annoying George Macready). Before he knows, he wakes up to find himself in a seaside estate he has never seen before. Witty and Macready call it Marian and try to convince servants and close people that Macady is a mad wife. Of course, this couple can only plan scandalous deeds, and although we know that Julia must eventually escape her trap, director Joseph Lewis is building real tension in answering the question of how he can handle it. <br /> <br /> "My name is Julia Ross" has nothing to stylist to distinguish it from any number of films that came out at the same time, but I was surprised at how well it kept me in spite of the boot budget and B-movie pedigree. There are quite a few moments that you could have on the edge of your seat and I found myself really rooted for Julia as she grabbed the stairs under her feet and began to overcome her hijackers. In any other Gothic thriller, the heroine would seize, scream and thunder, waiting for her hero to come and rescue her. So I can not say how refreshing it was for the heroine to use her brain in this film and find out how to save herself. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> Stage: B +
