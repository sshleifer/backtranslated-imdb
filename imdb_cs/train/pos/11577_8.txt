It was a great movie. It simply proves that you do not need silly things like continuity and script to make a movie. He goes through the continents in seconds, people are shot and nothing happens, swords with fire, samuars fight for sinking galeons, David Essex is the embodiment of promising irritation, and John Rhys Davies is just a friend. I liked this movie, but I like to ** t movies, it's a perfect example with a very ** ** movie that only KICKS ASS. If you like Battlefield Earth you will love this movie, his swashbuckling, his fast, his stupid, his samuaraitastic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It also looks like it was done in 1972
