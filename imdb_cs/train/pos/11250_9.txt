Once you've just seen the miniature A Perfect Spy series, you can do nothing but a hat - a pure masterpiece that, compared to other Le Carre minis about Smiley, has completely different qualities. <br /> <br /> In the Smiley minis it's Alex Guiness, like Smiley who stole the show - the rest of the actors just support him, we can say. Here is a set and story that is important, as the main actor, played perfectly by Peter Egan in the final episodes, is not at all charismatic. <br /> <br /> Egan is just playing a guy called Magnus Pym, who is lying, disrespectful, and aware of the people he hears to hear, is very popular with everyone, small and big. The only one who seems to understand his inner self is Alex, his Czech handler. <br /> <br /> The machine was never a spy and / or a traitor, it was said better! After watching his life from a very young age, we fully understand what makes it possible for him to become a traitor. His ability to lie and falsify everything is what makes him "the perfect spy", as his Czech dog handler says. <br /> <br /> And as we follow his life, we will fully understand how difficult it is to return to the straight and narrow path once you turn it away. He suffers further, although he never gets anything from him, except for the promotion of his MI5 espionage masters. Everyone is happy, as long as false information flows! <br /> <br /> Magnus' father, superbly played by Ray McAnally, is a not-good con-man who always dreams of plans to keep people out of their money. In later years he is his son, who must recover him again and again. But an example set by his father and uncle, who takes over the guardian when his father goes to jail and his mother is sent to the asylum room, Magnus soon learns early that lying is a way to survive, not to tell the truth. At first he exaggerated a bit, but quickly learned to say the right lies and to be constant without changing the stories from time to time, telling them those who wanted to listen to themselves and his father. <br /> <br /> His Czech dog handler, Alex, expertly playable RÃ¼diger Weigang, creates with Magnus a network of non-existent informants who has been supplying the British MI5 with fake information for years and years, as did the British with the German spies who were active before the war and during the war in the United Kingdom - continued to send false information to Das Vaterland long after the agents themselves were reversed, liquidated or simply replaced by MI5 men. <br /> <br /> The young guys who play Magnus in the younger years make it beautiful and most of them are much more charismatic than the older, a little cynical and tired Pym playing Egan. But you can easily get the difference because it is often the way we change from life, from enthusiasm to grief or indifference. <br /> <br /> Really worth the money!
