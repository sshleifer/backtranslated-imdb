I watched on-theired episodes online and I was so sad that the show would not be back. She had the best cast of mature, talented actors and amazing chemistry. It seemed that all actors were real friends in real life. At the end, the show became eye-catching, sexy and highly observable. Of course, some stories are not realistic, so what ... The characters are all nice and you rooted for them. The show reminded me of the cross between two other favorite groups: "Sex and the City" and "Felicity". Great for all casts. Comment on ABC commands: Nielsen rating reports show real results. The show audience usually notes this. I was a big disappointment with the main networks that flooded us with real estate televisions or teenage shows. Why should we get a mature, thoughtful and well-processed material to go to HBO or FX? I can only thank the network for putting other episodes online. New streaming media is getting more and more popular with viewers.
