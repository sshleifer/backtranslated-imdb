It is funny. It's not Arthur Miller or T.S. Elliot, but man is funny. Kline and Fields are great. (Her argument, "God, you're so scattered" when she climbs into her window - great! Kline runs over the door after Teri Hatcher's definition - great too!) Robert Downey Jr. and Kathy Moriarty work flawlessly - until he finds out who he really is ... turn the factory down if everyone was there! <br /> <br /> There was my children's ending scene in the Chinese dining room, and I rolled on the floor - the scene is worth renting. <br /> <br /> It does not solve any world problems or show the obvious underworld of the daily TV (I hope). Just a lot of fun.
