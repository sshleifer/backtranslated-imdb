During the weekend I saw two movies, One was "kaal" and the other "Waqt". Both films are made in "Bollywood," but they are far from each other. The basic difference is the story and the director. Vipul Shaw made his indelible mark with "Ankhen", one of the best Hindu comedy films. His Casting Charecteres is perfect. The story apparently taken from the Gujerati game is amazing, the treatment is excellent except for some. In Bollywood, when the film is being filmed, the first thing the Bollywood director is willing to do to register with the music director and this guy (in this case the average Malik) is forced to fulfill his six-song contract. So even a good director like Vipul Shah has to use them to soothe Finacier and grandmother who just do not have enough of these numbers. No music director can pull the good songs tirelessly, as is evident from this film. None of the songs have any melody and are clearly disturbing storytelling in addition to background music and the western version of Bharat-Natyam. The duel and role of playing the Father and the Son are good actresses Bachachan and Akshaya Kumara. Its stunning scenes are clearly outstanding. A good director is surrounded by good actors and is willing to wait for a good story to be as in this super movie. Then we have a cheap and carefree maker like Sharukh Khan who will pamper and immortal set and promote garbage like "Kaal" to enrich for the price of art improvement and surround the border talent of investment before the word gets around. They are Bollywood grasshoppers who feed on the unconscious audience to win the "Film Farce" award given by Bollywood Chamcha and most of them in the media.
