Flavia (Florinda Bolkan from glory "Do not Tort A Duckling") is enclosed in a monastery of her father's body wishes. Exhausted from all the sadism she sees around her (rape of a young woman in pigs, sexual desire, castration of horses), Flavia decides to go through the monastery with her Jewish friend outside, Abraham. The two do not get too far to capture and then be brought back to be tortured and forced to repent. After the punishment, he joins a band of Muslims called the Tarantula who, before the monastery, invaded the monastery and headed a crusade that would turn behind the monastery walls in a bloody battle. The "Flavia heretic" is a well-managed and relatively notorious part of the Italian invasion. The film is a bit scary and timeless. It plays great and the characters are well developed. Overall, "Flavia heretic" is a truly moving and intelligent film with lots of nudity and gore. You can not go wrong with this.
