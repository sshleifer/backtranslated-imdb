Who does not have unresolved problems with their parents? And which parents do not have unresolved issues between themselves? I know it sounds tough. But this is played in laughter in the movie, making comedy better and drama better. I always like Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and although I was a little afraid that their starry qualities might be too big for a small movie, I was enchanted by the first scene. Especially entertaining were the discoveries the son made about his father as a person. And the monologist Petra Falka, being a difficult working father and husband, was a perfect balancing point. Without this scene being so effective, the film would seem far less nuance and the figure is much less interesting. Pretty done, Paul and Peter!
