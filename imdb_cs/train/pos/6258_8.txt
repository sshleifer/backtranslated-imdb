They could probably skip from the beginning - I'm not sure why it starts in the Asian part of Turkey. If it were because they were starting in the Mediterranean, they could get closer to Lebanon today. One camera and crew will get to the Bakhtyari tribe, this is the start of a wonderful 48-day trip. 50,000 people with about 250,000 goats, camels, cattle and horses do this amazing trek over what seems to be a very fast moving Karun River. They use fences that are maintained on the surface by inflating the goat skin - you can see where the head and legs have been removed. The second "bank" of the river was very steep - I think about a 60-degree increase. I just watched it was unbelievable, but it was even more. To get pastures, they also had to cross the main mountain, which had about 4 feet of snow, if not more. The ability to climb on this mountain was quite amazing and in itself, but they (and all animals) climbed to this bare bush! Yes, barefoot. <br /> <br /> One drawback of this document was some intermediate classes with bad humorous attempts. If you want to see the documentary from a silent era or incredible challenges that this tribe not only faces but also conquers. It's just an incredible proof of a little known group of people who face all kinds of challenges.
