Oh, it's so great to watch Silent Classic once in a while! Director Vidor is simply gorgeous and even makes a lengthy (at least 1928) friend like himself. The story is about success in life and how it changes you. Marion Davies plays a girl who leaves her friends in a small comedy studio to be part of a larger drama. It becomes a big star, and the consequences are actually alienated from the real world. For a moment even denies her (bad) past! Portraits are just funny, surely a scene where the main character (Marion Davies) sees ... Marion Davies in the studies and concludes that does not seem to be so strange ... It must be one of the first movies, movies and the real excitement is amazing to see cameras and materials ever since. You have to see if you ask me!
