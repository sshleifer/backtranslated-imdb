It's a shame that this movie is so heavy that you can get into the hands of the US. I found it through a rare video vendor, and that is definitely worth it. This is undoubtedly the best film ever made before the code and the best movie of the 1930s. Master's director Frank Borzage has created wonderful films about the crisis, and MAN'S CASTLE has created a fairy tale in the midst of difficult times. Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy have great chemistry and help make this movie a wonderful romance. Young Trina is sweet and promising, while Tracy Bill is unhappy and closed. The dynamics between the figure creates one of the most difficult, but ultimately rewarding, relationships on film. <br /> <br /> MAN'S HRAD is the most soft focus film I've ever seen. Borzage uses a sad and dreamy technique to turn to the village where they live, where Bill and Trina live in the palace. Horror depressions are never ignored, they are actually part of the film. But as Borzage treats the film as a fairly focused fairy tale, love between characters makes the situation less hard. It makes the film warm and loving. <br /> <br /> MAN'S HRAD is the crowning success of the time before the code. If it could only see more people.
