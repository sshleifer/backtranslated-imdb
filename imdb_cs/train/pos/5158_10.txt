There is something convincing and strangely believable about this episode. From the very beginning, there is an atmosphere of tension that causes the awareness that a planet explodes within a few hours. Kirk, Spock, and McCoy went down to evacuate the inhabitants, all of whom seemed to have left the unknown, except for the older librarian. The courteous but mysterious librarian's library of where all the citizens are coming is interrupted by a crisis in which all three crew members of the Enterprise unexpectedly plunged into different periods of the planet's history. Kirk finds himself in a period that reminds England of the 17th century, while Spock and McCoy are stuck in desolate, frozen waste. <br /> <br /> The crossover between the two stories and the various dangerous situations that men find themselves are excellently equipped with returns to the presence of an unknown chance, while minutes count as far as the planet's explosion. <br /> <br /> This episode characterizes imaginative writing and fine acting with the touch of Mariette Hartley as a woman expelled to the ice age and Ian Wolfe as a city librarian. Rather resembling the classic episode City On The Edge of Forever, this time story is a rich and convincing final of the series that eventually closed one episode. It must be one of the best in the series, especially remarkable given the generally lower quality of the third season overall.
