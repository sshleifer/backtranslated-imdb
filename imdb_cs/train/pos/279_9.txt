I love the way you can literally jump out of your seat when you play it. The way the screen jumps and blinks when you get a hit is very realistic and at the same time you have to remember it's just a game and your really there. The sound and the sound are amazing. There are plenty of weapons and different spells that you can distinguish, and you can even choose which spells you want stronger or not. You get this stone that can move enemies while you recover mana to throw your enemies even more spell. Best of all, when you're playing it, you're really nervous, and you're afraid of what might be around the next corner or what might leap for you. To get a full experience, try playing it through the main phones.
