British comedies tend to fall into one of two main types: silent, introspective, usually romantic, and fake social satire. Settings, characters, and concepts are different, but some features place a large majority of shows in one of two categories. Butterflies are perhaps the epitome of the first type. The scenarios are very verbal, including the long interior monologues of the main character of Rio, basically happy, but the unsatisfied housewife is curious about what she could escape when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life. When he meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman (who is most interested in her), the toys have the idea of ​​finding out what a second way might offer. The acting and script scenes are always on the money, which makes the person's reaction almost entirely personal: I was neither averted nor turned off. My mother, on the other hand, loved this show. I think the degree to which one identifies with the dilemma of the Rie is the most important factor in determining the response to the Butterflies.
