I think this movie was one of Kurt Russels' good films. Kurt Russel is my favorite actor, so I think he's a good actor in any role he's playing. But this movie had a lot of action and I know it should have more than 5.6 out of 10 per meter, but many people did not like this movie. Okay, I thought it was good, so I think everyone should see this movie. If you see this movie and you love it, I think you should see Back Draft also with Kurt Russel. I give a soldier *** 1/2 of *****
