I really enjoyed this movie because I watched him twice and that's something he says about the document. Music scores, cinema and sound are absolutely amazing as you can expect from Imax production. Although it is shot for the big Imax theaters, it looks and sounds amazing in my home system. In fact, it would be a perfect DVD for the demo system. <br /> <br /> The subject is so fascinating. This is Mario Andretti and his son Michael. I was already a fan of Mario because he is the best racing car in history because he is the only person to win the CART Championship, the F1 Championship, the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500. The scenario follows the path of two cars that are a very important father and son. The first car is in a chicken basket, and it turns out to be the first roadster ever to drive Mario, and we're looking for restoration to brilliant perfection. The second car is Michael's new racing car and we are watching him from cutting the mold through the race season. Imax lends only the right spell to make the car construction confiscated and fascinated. Paul Newman, who was the owner of the Michael Amoretti team at the time the film was shot, tells the story. His anecdotes and jokes, which have been the owner and driver for many years, are a great opportunity for production. <br /> <br /> The main features are races. Increase volume here! There's something on horseback for more than 200 mph and a musical score that's totally attracted to the screen for an experience you'll never forget. Wow! <br /> <br /> The ultimate magical element is the humanity of the Andretti family. This god of racing world, Mario Andretti, is a loving father who looks proudly at the career of his son. They work so well that every father and son should see it. You can say they are close family. May we have all the experience.
