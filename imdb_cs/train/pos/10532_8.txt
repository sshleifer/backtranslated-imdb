Get the world to disappear. Put me off my shoulders. Tell what you said and get the world to disappear. Well, Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) were in the turbine, one for embezzlement and the other for a kissing baby. He was not guilty, but in the face of the accusations and their house to be torn, they ended, nothing, nothing. The whole world, except for his house, has left. This is a bit weird, but also funny. What would you do if you were alone in the world? These two friends enjoy each other together and do what they want. But it becomes old, it seems. <br /> <br /> Then they begin to improve their lives by hating memories. The sound effects during that were great. In fact, it was really weird at the end. This film was a product of fantastic fantasy and written and directed by Vincenzo Natali with the help of two stars. It just needs to be seen.
