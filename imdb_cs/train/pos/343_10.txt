Katherine Heigl, Marley Shelton, Denise Richards, David Boreanaz. Even before I knew what this film was about, these names were enough to draw me. Beautiful, talented and popular, these are the artists to look for. Ok, where do I get started? We already know what the film is about. Five beautiful girls focused on the "romantic" serial slasher, a guy who refused three years ago in front of school dance. His trademarks include fine deathhreats masked like valentine cards, chocolates infested with black and bleeding nose. His weapon is a matter of course: Well, take a gun, knives, electric drive, bow and arrow, hot iron, etc. Ok, so it's basically a horror movie with a pretty twisted sense of sexuality. <br /> <br /> Horror films are not Shakespeare, but I do not go there. I love horror movies, but not all. This one, I adore. There are some of my other favorites. It's funny, sexy and frightening. The murderous mask is a childish spook and sees that Amidka, who shoots the bow and arrow to the victim, is really weird. The acting is top: Denise Richards, Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz are a lot of fun. I really wished to see much more of Katherine Heigl. I am one of her biggest fans and I would love to see her soon. Jessica Capshaw is a very capable actress, and Jessica Cauffielle makes the blonde ditzy role she has perfected in Urban Legend 2. The smaller parts were also good; Hedy Buress was a flock ("bleedmedry.com"), and the younger version of Denise Richards looked awful like her. <br /> <br /> Most important: every scene of death has a distinctive distinction. The cleverest is the opening scene in the morgue. The Hottub scene, though ridiculous, was well done. And the audiovisual maze was ominous. The soundtrack is great, with spooky music and subtle alternative melodies. <br /> <br /> Lowpoint: I felt as if the murderer had not been rendered enough, we barely saw a mask and it was not at all during the peak. I also thought the climax was really neat, but fun. The reversal in the end was not so surprising, but I'm really glad that the filmmakers decided they would save us all. "I would not like to tell people what movies they should see, but if someone asked me to pick a horror film about which I <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10 (Bullseye!)
