It is often only after years when we can look back and see those stars that are really stars. As a French film critic, whose name I am missing, he said, "There is no Garbo, there is no Dietrich, only Louise Brooks;" and there it is, thanks to the heavens! Louise Brooks! This is the third of her European masterpieces. But it's also an extraordinary film for being one, if not the first, French dancer, to watch the script written by famous Ren√© Claire for allegedly completed (direction) Georg Pabst and to incorporate Edith Piaf's voice before she was well known! So many talents working on film and in the movie, how could it not be a masterpiece? And that's the movie. It's a pity Louise Brooks was exhausted by Hollywood when she returned to the States - so many talents so arrogantly beside her! In the movie, besides looking at Louise Brooks in action, it's great to see pictures of Paris ca. 1930 and hear Piaf's young voice. I'm never tired of this movie!
