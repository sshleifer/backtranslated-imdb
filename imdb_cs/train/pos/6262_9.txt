It was unbelievable, which meant it was hard to believe that the "forgotten tribe" would do this amazing migration twice a year, and that Cooper and Schoedsack did not make some scenes and shots. But what are the shots! Cinematography is great in extreme conditions, and Iranian music scores added to the video clip give this unforgettable document extra wealth. I had the pleasure of seeing "Kon Tiki" the same weekend, which was excitement, and it surely made me see how hard and persistent and courageous people can be, whether for primitive survival, the need for adventure, or in the name of science.
