I remember Parker Posey on "How the World Turns" before she becomes queen of independent films. In this film, Posey shows her potential as a top actress. In this cast-up film, which includes Omar Townsend as Moustafa, a Lebanese immigrant who works as a falafel street vendor who strives to become a teacher. Supportive cast is a wonderful actress who plays her godfather and only a family relative like Judy, a librarian who is old fashioned, devoted and menopausal. Posey, as Mary learns she must grow up and mature. Loss of her position in a library clerk makes her aware of her lack of a place in her life. Mary's life is surrounded by friends in the lower east of the village of New York before being gifted with yuppies. This movie is quite good for an independent and I came to enjoy Parker Posey as Mary as well as other characters in other movies.
