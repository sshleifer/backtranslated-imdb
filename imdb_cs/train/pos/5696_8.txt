What do you do with a 14-inch cock using a porn star who has been involved in drugs and murders and then died of AIDS? Of course you make a movie. The probable reason why it was not earlier is that Eddie Nash would be in the process of producing it. So it's no coincidence that the film was made just after Nash was sent to jail. The best thing about the film is its fast pace. The waste of time is not lost. And why would it be? There is too much good material here to require a matte filling scenes.The cast is good. Kilmer was average in movies, so there was finally a role that's really good for him. Bosworth is cute, so he is insignificant as he behaves (it's solid), and McDermott, who is otherwise quite uncomfortable, is rather good, largely because he's wearing so many facial hair that I did not know before. (I wish I had to do Cruise in every movie so I would not have to look at his silly face.) I certainly did not recognize Christine Applegate and would not know she was in her when I did not see her name in the final credits. Kudrow is as charming as ever, a little unusual to see her in a dramatic role. (Btw, "Friends" is the worst TV series of all time.) The only casting choices that were debatable were Carrie Fischer's premature close-up girlfriend and the totally absurd inclusion of Janean Garofal's maraon from the 90's. You thought I was going to play Paris Hilton, right? No, I think Hilton is the perfect choice in its 10-second form as a stupid bitch. Because the film is about decadence, among others ?? and porn actors? is perfectly suited.
