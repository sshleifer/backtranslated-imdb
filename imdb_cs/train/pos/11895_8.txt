Tea Leoni plays Nora Wilde, a serious photographer who goes through a bad divorce. He wants freedom but comes at a price. He wants legitimate photography, but he's hired to work for boulevards like paparazzi. Her boss plays beautiful and divine Holland Taylor. The show was mostly well written. Teora Nora has begun to develop into a rather unforgettable character, but the network simply did not support comedy, and still not. Even when they brought George Wendt from Cheers, they made unnecessary changes in casting and characters. The show was good at the beginning and the audience got used to it, but the network is shattering it like a bad plastic surgery.
