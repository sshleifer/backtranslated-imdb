Although the story is fictional, it draws on the reality not only of the history of the Latin American countries but of the entire third world. This is the true, pure and crude recent history of these countries summed up in this novel / film. Unpredictable supernatural things illuminate the intensity of the historical events presented in this film. After all supernatural things are part of a culture in the Third World. Although not critically acclaimed (probably because of a supernatural thing), it is an excellent movie with a great story and a great actor.
