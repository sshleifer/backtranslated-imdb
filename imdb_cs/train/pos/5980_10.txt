First of all, it's my favorite movie at all. I do not have to give anyone a description because every hole is doing so. I am literally obsessed with these practically bloodless, cheesy, lametic effects, which have a "peak", poorly modified, the 80th work of horror. The director (who I heard) hoped to hit the box office so he could continue and have something like FREDDY / JASON for himself. Damn it, I wish it was like that! Soundtrack bangs. The game is good ... CHECK THIS MOFO. and any nice fans there, do not hesitate to email and chat sometimes. Midgetorgy .... I'll find YAHOO.
