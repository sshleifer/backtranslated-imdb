girlfight uses a well-known formula as someone pointed out, but I've seen a lot of movies that do not do it well, or that it's not credible. I believe it is easier for a woman to empathize with the figure so the film felt much more touched. The film supports both mentally and physically, although your life and the environment are completely different and I think the viewer can still get a lot by seeing it. although it took me 5 years before I started boxing and sports in general, this is the movie that gave me a spark. <br /> <br /> So it's known / usual. actors are good. but the ideas it can bring are, in my opinion, above average. I was impressed, and I know I'm not the only one.
