The pilot is very well executed. It sets out how they will connect in future episodes. I do not think anyone could create a better pilot for this show. The writer has remarkable creativity. Although it was not all right, since it was the first episode, many pilot events appeared in future seasons. An example would be Ross and Rachels's future relationship. Even when the nervousness of the first episode appeared, it was overcome by a terrific plot and an excellent actor. <br /> <br /> Bravo. <br /> <br /> Great start to unparalleled comedy!
