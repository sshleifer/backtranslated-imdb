I do not know why so many IMDb fans get such a bad rap (some say it's his "worst film ever".) What? None of you saw Cradle 2 The Grave?) My favorite criticism is that the conspiracy is utterly stupid and it's just an excuse to hang all the action sequences. Du≈°! What crap did you expect from Jet Li? You honestly believed that someone was thinking about the story, and then just loaded it with the action? Of course not! The black mask is a wonderful action from the wall to the wall during almost the whole run. It's also deliciously scary and we get lots of cut limbs, decapitations and creative ways to watch how fallen people (and quite a few innocent people!) Is killed. Most Li's martial arts are in kindergarten compared to Black Mask; there is no retention of gratuitous violence, bloodshed or action sequences! And that made me a happy camper. Again: if you go to the Jet Li movie that awaits a grand dialogue and an interesting plot, you'll be wrong. Black mask is probably my favorite of his films (though watch out for terrible dubbing).
