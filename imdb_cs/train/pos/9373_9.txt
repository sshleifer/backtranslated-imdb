Like many of you, I'm a great fan of the real thing - the New York movies of the 1940s - but Red Rock West was a real experience for all who long for the past. The term "neo-noir" has been used so inadequately over the last decade that it has lost its sense and impact. John Dahl's film, on the other hand, really deserved to be described as such. Casting is perfect all around and felt at home with Tay Garnett or Jacques Tourneur. The task is so tight that you are addicted in the first fifteen minutes. James M. Cain would appreciate it. Many contemporary movies leave me to realize why she does not, like them, and I'm not that old. Movies like Red Rock West give us hope for the future and pay tribute to the past.
