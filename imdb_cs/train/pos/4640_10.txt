It's one of the best movies I've seen in the last two years (I saw the prime minister in Tel Aviv in Israel in the summer of 2006, exactly when the last war started ...) This problem in communication between war-causing people has long been to me she's interested and it does not matter who guys and girls, straight and homosexuals, Jews and Arabs ... I've seen Bublu already three times, and still surprising and exciting - every character reminds me of one of the many people I know and the difference between them , as I was between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... Last time I saw - he was with my friend, who is Christian Arab, and that was Israel's day of independence (most symbolic, how he could, ironically) and ... he eventually called! !! - if he touched him and was not embarrassed - everyone would touch Bubble!
