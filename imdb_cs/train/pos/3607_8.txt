So, a few years ago, I was overturning digital subscription channels, and I thought I watched "Girlfight" after half an hour while waiting for "Hart's War". With such a name, I thought it was some exploitation of the "B" that concerned gangs of girls' towns. <br /> <br /> My surprise was not at all. Instead, it's a well-functioning, well-written story about a young woman who almost accidentally got into a woman's boxing. She is responsible for taking her younger brother to her workouts and being interested in her bouts. Because he really does not want to be a boxer (only on the basis of his father's wishes), he will persuade his coach to take it for him. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in an intelligent and credible way as it goes through various tests to search for it. Beginning, her brother's coach does not want to take a female boxer. After disrespect, there is a problem with how it fits the match. Then confront the father when he finds out what's going on. Yes, there is an interest in love, but it serves to improve the conspiracy, and there is more interesting inter-human reaction with its own related implications. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a big, little sleeping movie that someone seems to hear about. A bit later, when I saw a lot of advertised and acclaimed "Million Dollar Baby," I thought "Wait a minute, it seems a bit familiar." No need to say that I did not see "Hart's War" in that night.
