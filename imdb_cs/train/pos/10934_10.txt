After examining this enormous film about martial arts for the first time in almost 18 years, I must say that he has not lost any of his mysticism or any of his eyes that emerged from my youth. The story of a dying martial arts instructor who sent his "unfinished" pupil to find the 5 past members of his poison a poison, so they do not look for the fortunes that the lord's friend holds hidden. He fears that his last disciple has not enough training, and he urges him to be friends with one of the five "poisons" to beat four more. I can not say enough about choreography or about working with the camera. A nice movie in itself and quite possibly one of the best martial arts films ever made. A CLASSIC!
