Probably I was one of the few Australians who did not see tennis playing this series. I have to say that when I first appeared William McInnes, it's a dirty actor! But as the series continued, his performance grew stronger and I loved him completely. He was such a fool, but he made me laugh. I watched the show where he saw Hugo Speers (Heart and Bones, The Full Monty) and Tom Long (SeaChange, Two Hands). It was interesting to see that Speers are playing nice and quiet men, and even more interesting to watch the waves of Tom Longs muscle! With a sigh ... Seriously, the long performance was a complete shock and really brilliant. He stole it. Martin Sacks was also good in a small role and the lead actress made fun. I recommend this program if you like stories with a turn and if you look at Tom Long walk without a shirt on ...
