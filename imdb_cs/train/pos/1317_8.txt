This anime was underestimated and still is. The childhood Dorky, as I noticed, is still returning to this ten-year-old year when I first saw him. One of the better movies was released. Animation, though not perfect, is good, camera tricks give her a 3D feel and the story is still so good even today, after I grew up and saw ditches like Neon Genesis Evangelion and RahXefon. It does not have obvious depth, but try to see it from a neat view. It's a story that's fun, I have no doubt. <br /> <br /> One more of my favorites is also coming back when I feel like giggling on more cheerful animations. Do not say that there are children's movies, there are surprisingly sad moments and you need a sense of humor to see it all.
