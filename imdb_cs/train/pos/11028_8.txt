To be honest, I did not like this movie when I saw it for the first time. But I think the problem is, I did not see him in the theater. Big mistake ! Because the # 1 thing you see in Cliffhanger is set up and # 2 is cinematography. Try to see this movie on the largest possible TV and great sound system. Music is good and places the film at a higher level (and commercial potential). The more I see it, the more I like it. It's definitely one of Renna Harlin's best films. The guy knows about the action. Die Hard 2, long kiss, goodbye, etc. And that's especially good in this movie. The special effect is great and spectacular. Stallone really needed the movie to come back with success. See him well!
