The Zenith of Two Precious Careers. David Lynch, better known with less accessible material, creates a gentle and wonderful story about the most unlikely assumption. The man travels and sees his stolen brother. If he has no other means of transport, his journey takes more than six weeks on the mower. Richard Farnsworth, in his latest film, delivers stunning layered and nuanced performance in the lead role. Beautifully beautiful in its enthusiasm for small things, Straight Story is a classic movie experience that can not be missed. Sissy Spacek is remarkable as Farnsworth's daughter, a distressed middle-aged woman living with the loss of her children.
