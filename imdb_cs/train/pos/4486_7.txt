SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry is a classic cartoon with a flawless idea and almost every short jewel. While I have to say that this is definitely a bad place compared to other classic shorts, Tom and Jerry, it's not like you would hate this cartoon. Sure, it's understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first episodes, Tom and Jerry, and I can say I agree, but the fact is that all the episodes of Tom and Jerry are great, but some are just better than the others. Well, this would fit into the "others". <br /> <br /> Here's the plot of Fraidy Cat. Tom listens to the old scary radio broadcast and is easily scared. Jerry realizes how terrified he is and tries to scare him even more than he is. It creates frightening dilemmas for Tom and Tom is scared of his reason and his life. Jerry then puts the sheet over the vacuum cleaner and controls it, and so the vacuum seems to be a ghost. Tom finds out that Jerry has done it all and chasing him. Tom then accidentally bites his home girl. However, at the end of Jerry will end up the one who is afraid of seeing his reflection in flour. Overall it's far from the best Tom and Jerry, a fun and fun time period. It wished me there were more cartoons. Pear and gags in the fact that Tom and Jerry are famous are as good at this short time as ever, but I felt that something was missing. He felt slower than most of Tom and Jerry's shorts. Anyway, this is a good short film that is not quite alive with other Tom and Jerry cartoons, but it's still pretty. <br /> <br /> 7/10
