A beautiful film that deeply touches the simple but divine aspects of humanity. <br /> <br /> This movie was almost perfect and to see that nothing in this world can really be perfect, that's pretty good. The only small thing I'm subjectively discovering is stepping on some points in the middle of the story. Also acting is very good and all actors are slightly top actors in highly profile films. Real overhead seems to be well thought out and the script has to be awesome. There are some really fascinating moments of precursors and a pretty gorgeous ongoing circular piece of the story. The moment in the movie, when the main character reaches the feeling of being in the sky, is the perfect end of a really brilliant yarn.
