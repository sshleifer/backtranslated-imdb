Soapdish can go down as one of the most underestimated films ever made. A stellar, unselfish cast that understands exactly where the film moves and the roles it played in it. While they all improved it, it was not a twist. Kline showed a joke and a great physical comedy, Goldberg and Downey knew how to continue the fun conversation while someone was talking, I could just go on.
