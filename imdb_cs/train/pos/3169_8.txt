A few years ago I leased it, the video rental company had only VHS at that time. Steps to the video were the steps (you know where the cabinet covers use the same font and color schemes of successful movies). I did not know what to expect from what was printed. The first thing I thought about watching was "what the hell is wrong with the sound?" - Of course, there was no dubbing in the dialogue. The words sounded so I stopped working on what I had to pay more attention - you think there is no Shakespeare! The story is pretty simple, the boy meets the girl, and so on. What I thought was humorous and sincere, people in the movie did not look like cartoons written in the story, but rather non-actors temporarily pulled out of their actual work (uniforms included). Throughout the time you begin to feel what the filmmaker is after, then you will see that there are no attempts at cheap humor (people hurt their private, using vulgarities that could not hurt marketing.) There was something honest about it, if they had a bigger budget, it would be better , I'm sure they think everyday, but they went ahead and they did it. I felt what the film was about. "Indy," is worthy of it, as if it were a genre. it's funny!
