The original with Barbara Stanwik is preserved only by the performance of Stanwyka. The story and the other performances are too unsatisfying and the film itself is too dated to really enjoy it today. Bette Midler's version is much more interesting. She is Stella Claire, an independent, single woman who gets pregnant and refuses to help her friend (Stephen Collins) or her boyfriend (John Goodman in an underestimated performance). She picks up her daughter, played by Jenny Sweet Trini Alvarado, and eventually concludes that Jenny's father can make better for her and ultimately decides to change her life. Through the film there are lots of laughter, tears and unforgettable moments, mostly between Midler and Alvarad. Marsha Mason plays as Jenny's half-step mother, whose rich impact has a very good impact on her. If you like Midler, Goodman or just good movies with lots of emotions, you'll enjoy the version of Bette Midler STELLA.
