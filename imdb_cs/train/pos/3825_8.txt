The young woman comes to her husband's hometown after he died in an accident. He will barely settle down in this small town, but shortly thereafter he will lose his little son in abduction and all his hopes ... This could lead to all the species that follow the drawings in the normal movie: find a new partner and be finally happy; or so depressing that he fights and eventually kills ... He tries to kill himself, but not after a series of serious battles with God. He believes in God only to find that God seems to have forgiven everyone, even the killer. Well, I should be cautious about God, the film does not mean anything against God. The way the film deals with this problem is quite interesting: not from a woman's point of view, nor from God's perspective (this would be a lot of grass growing, clouds flying views, I suppose). Rather it's from the eyes of a third party, the film allows us to perceive and not explain anything. It would not be so interesting if the woman were there. There is the man who is around the woman and apparently loved her, but in her own way. It's a funny guy, like a clown that I should say, who clumsily hangs around our heroine. A combination of these two, a woman full of tension, crying and throwing always, and a man with a smile and silly speaking ends up in a good balance of emotions: nothing absurdly bad or too boring. <br /> <br /> We highly recommend.
