My Super Ex Girlfriend was pleasantly surprised for me, I was really expecting a terrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable and you know what? It was! But this movie had so many beautiful laughs and fun that anyone could get a kick. I know this was a very noisy movie, but Uma and Anna were so great and Steve was such a great addition along with a big cast that seemed to have so much fun and that's what made the movie really work. > <br /> <br /> <br /> Jenny Johnson (terrifying, that's my best friend's name) is not your typical average librarian looking for a woman when Matt, your average man, asks her, is more than expected, G-Girl asked for a date, super the hero of the world! But when she finds out what is really a jealous and crazy girl, she decides it may be a good idea to spend some time apart, but Jenny will not have it since she falls for another girl, Hannah, and she's going to make his life is a living hell, I think, let's say, he could not choose a better girl to break up with him. The effect was cruel, but you quickly get closer to him, the story and made the story really work and I loved Uma in this movie, it was such a step from Prime. My Super Ex Girlfriend is a funny movie you really should not take seriously, it's just a cute romantic comedy that I think if I could laugh at it, someone could do it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
