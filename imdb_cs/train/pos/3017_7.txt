Philo Vance had a lot of kinship with Bulldog Drummond? He was a gentleman with the type of gloss and elegance just commonly associated with the British upper classes and he was also independently wealthy? But were there major differences? Drummond was an adventurer, charming, gallant, alive? Would Vance be pompous, slightly boring and self-conscious? There was a hint of basic cruelty in his way? The "Kennel Murder Case" is the most impressive of 14 films Vance created between 1929 and 1947? The story of a murdered collector of Chinoiserie, has all the ingredients of a classic private eye mystery? exotic setting in the Long Island Kennel Blue nose, three killing for Vance to resolve including the disturbing 'locked murder room', the key to the whole matter, and a lot of suspects? Usually, the detective story turned out to be too static and to make convincing movies, even though they are working well on the press, but here Michael Curtiz and fine edits give the film a pace and urgency that is completely different from similar films of its kind? <br /> <br /> William Powell's elegance and fidelity made him the perfect Vance, and although a year later he went to study, he remained in the same genre with the incredibly successful and popular The Thin Man in MGM?
