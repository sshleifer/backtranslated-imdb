Soprano is probably the biggest show in the history of dramatic television. It's hard to think about another series that boasts so many intelligences, exquisite writing, or first class performances. <br /> <br /> The epic range creates fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality. Centrating around the life of one Tony Soprano, a man who lives in two families. One of them is a conventional wife and two children's nuclear family, the second huge group of New Jersey Mafia, who is the chief of both. Played by James Gandolfini, True Romance and Mexican Glory, Tony is a fascinating, haunting, but also a pleasant guy. Gandolfini must be fully honored to make a feminine and threateningly aggressive brutal, truly identifiable and perfect leader. Present American drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as Tony. Theater of the hundreds will never meet a flat performance, and such prominent characters as Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will stick to your memory forever. <br /> <br /> The real genius of this story is, however, the creator and writer of bravery and revolutionary who are on a conventional drama series. Twelve-minute dream dreams, strong and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery, and truly shocking scenes of violence. Still, this style is fulfilled by the actual themes of love, honesty, and respect for the family. The series never becomes a cold heart or integrity. With TV now competitive and often bad Sopranos standing high above others as the most original and attractive track of America. Forget the family. This is Redifined TV.
