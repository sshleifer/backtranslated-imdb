When Grinch came out, I was excited even though I thought it would be a happy go happy movie and it was. Though it had some nightmare before Christmas. You know somewhat dark and scary. I loved this film because it helped people fill the Christmas spirit. So Grinch saved most of Christmas. And what happened in Whoville then they say that Grinch's little heart was growing in three sizes that day. MERRY GRINCHMAS!
