Henry Fool is a better movie. But it's the perfect way to watch the movie like "Henry Fool". Taking Henry very seriously, his "lies" and his mysterious aura. Even the initial shot of Henry Foola when Simon attaches his ear to the ground when Henry comes across the hills is more obvious through Fay Grim. Vocals that are more or less meta-jokes (about writing a movie and jokes themselves) are good, but the opening of the film is a little bit saturated with them. Also, Hartley's use of Dutch angles throughout the film is ugly, yes, that's the intention, but it feels compelled and overused, going beyond what I would like to call, unpleasant. It's a faulty movie, but it must be seen for every fan of Hartley or Henry Foola. <br /> <br /> And do not listen to silly reviews, do not watch it if you did not see the first movie. The intrigue, the satire and the joke of this movie are totally lost unless you've seen Henry Foola. It's a sequel. It's just stupid.
