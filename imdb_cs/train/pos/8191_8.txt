Unbearable planet and Satan's hole together make up two best episodes of "new" doctor Who is the second season. When we say this, it should be clear that much of the story essentially transforms Quatermass and Pit's plot (1967) into a space universe with a history of space linked to Beast 666. These episodes cemented the emotional relationships between Rose and the Doctor, and at the same time drew attention to growing self-confidence Rose, who established her as a partner who did not manage to equal, but nevertheless came to our beloved Lord of Time. Also worth mentioning is the sleek Matt Jones scenario, which reduces the occasional excessive reliance on a doctor with disposable fillings and the introduction of the entire cast, especially the outstanding Shaun Parkes as the actor Captain Zachary Cross Flane.
