Last night, I was delighted to see BUG at the Florida Film Festival and let me say it was a real treat. The directors were there, followed by Q & A. The film starts with a young boy who breaks the clothes under his feet, a man near his car, sees the young boy break and run him to ask the baby "why? had to kill the living creature? "In an attempt to advise the youth in the wrong way, one does not pay to pay for his parking meter, which begins with a chain of events involving people who are not related to it, some funny, some sad and some ridiculous. This movie has lots of laughter, lots! and there are many actors you know. The main filmmakers who emerged in the film were: Jamie Kennedy (from his comedy show, Jamie Kennedy Experiment, starring John Carroll Lynch, who plays Drew Carey's Drew brother), a loving guy who just does not, Brian Cox Germafobic owner Chef Donut and Chinese Food Take Out, there is one line where Cox tells chefs to wash some of the pig's blood that's on the sidewalk by "clearing the death", which is pretty funny mostly due to Cox's "obsession with bacteria" The funniest moment in the movie comes when a young boy imitates his father whom he has heard before: "The extraordinarily funny and surreal scene is when Trudie Still (Mrs. Sting) and another actor play a scene on a cable show from a boy in a plastic bubble movie. who is hosting a cable show is just amazing that he is so serious and dead, and his performance he and the boy in a plastic bubble are fascinating, and there are many other fine and humorous actors and actresses who have grown him in less than a month with a budget of just $ 1 million, directors Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi (screenwriters in shop, they have written crazy / beautiful and upcoming Tuxedo with Jackie Chan) have achieved a great, fun and dear movie.
