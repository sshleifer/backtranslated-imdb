It's not such a bad movie as I thought it would be. He has a good cast.Nice to see Roger Moore back on the screen, like the use of other British actors. <br /> <br /> Would you like to see more of Olivie D'Abo in future projects. We can play against our cousin Maryam D'Abo. <br /> <br /> Also make good use of invisible places such as Luxembourg. > <br /> We hope to see more co-productions in the UK.
