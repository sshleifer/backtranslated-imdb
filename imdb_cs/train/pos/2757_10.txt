If you would like to see some other film, if you feel that Love in your heart, even if you miss the Lord, this movie is thinking about you. Although Georges is mentally handicapped, you can see the ultimate intelligence at the end when love does not give the brain a direction. I'm not emotional, but this movie makes you feel a human being. The film is as good as Forrest Gump in my belief. Foreign movies are sometimes more interesting, yet there is not enough advertising to be popular. Majid Majidi's "Rang-e khoda" is another example of such foreign films, almost like a taste.
