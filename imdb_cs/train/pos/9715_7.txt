Here she is skinny, it seems to be much older than I thought. But it's still great. Motorcycles are cool and the story works for the most part. There are some character issues that I hope will solve part 2 and my biggest complaint about what seems to be MACROSS. Not just the animated style, but also several character designs. For example, all the girls in this movie look like LYN MINMAY from MACROSS. Mechs look similar to MACROSS, just like other characters. It really is not done for young children, it has graphic violence, nudity and graphic sexual content. So, to make a long story short, I give it to the great MACROSS that repelled the 7 stars.
