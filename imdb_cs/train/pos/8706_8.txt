What happens when average Joe finds out that she has supernatural powers? The assumption may sound good. Watchmen? Unbreakable? However, the Russian sci-fi action movie, The Sword Bearer, is far from standard stock. The story revolves around a man named Sasha, who, as a boy, has shunned his companions, his peers and his family for the supernatural power he has. If he wishes or if his anger allows him, the sword comes out of his hand, piercing his own skin. Very dull? Maybe ... but that's not an interesting part of this movie. All his life has avoided and driven him by the anger (and the temperament he has), our "hero" returns to his hometown to turn around or find reason. The only thing he meets is a problem when he meets a new boyfriend of an old flame leaving blood on the ground. Here is revenge and anger. This is a man you do not want to cross and from this moment the mafia and the police are on the tail. She meets a girl and immediately falls in love with her, and she's really what the movie is about. The film is highly impressive with courageous colors and anarchic stimuli with short but extreme action sequences. It's an art house on its core, beautifully shot with such attention to detail in every scene in connection with scary sci-fi action. It's the odd drop that interests me so much in this movie. The approach of directors for this genre is a refreshing focus on Sasha's emotional journey, not a direct action movie. Do not worry, but the action is there and plenty. However, much of these sequences show only implicit violence with images of terrible consequences. This does not mean that the action is not displayed. These scenes are here and they are fantastic (especially the end where we see the full powers of Sasha unleashed in despair). The director decides to indicate the violence of many scenes to focus on emotional character struggle. It's a tragic love story and a refreshing entry into the genre.
