If you can, it's great. <br /> <br /> If it is not, it is decent. <br /> <br /> Understand that "getting it" does not necessarily mean you have gone through school shooting. There is much more to this movie that sometimes school shooting takes place. <br /> <br /> First of all, it is a film about the reception of both superficial - traumatic events and people who are for any reason different. It's also a movie about unbearable pain and about how other people have endured it. In this case, the contrast between Alice's fury and Dean's obsession creates an atmosphere of such tangible anxiety that in the middle of the movie we wonder how the director could pull the happy end of the hat. Fortunately, the audience is considered to be human beings; our intelligence is not offended by sappy, an unlikely moralistic end. <br /> <br /> Above all, I try to keep a clear head on film fiction and all that. Still, I must admit that I was crying like a lost child during this movie. There were certain things that hit * very * close to home and opened some old wounds that never healed. But that is not necessarily the wrong thing.
