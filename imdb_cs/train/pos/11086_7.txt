I saw this movie when I was little - called it "Glacier Fox". I was totally traumatized! This is a cute little fox in the neighborhood. The beginning was great and I remember being very close to little foxes. I also remember that my mother brought me out of the theater when I was in hysteria. I will not tell you what happened, but let's say it does not apply to all foxes. I was used to natural Disney movies, where the animals do not really die. Oh man. This movie cried me for a moment. It was a good movie ... I mean - I was really small and the truth was told - I remember everyone that I was happy for foxes and then I saw one of them die. Rent them if you can, but do not show your children!
