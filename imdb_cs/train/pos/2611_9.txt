This is considered in Australia to be one of the best dramas produced here ... and for my money, anywhere. It's raw, redheaded, the characters are real, the situations are credible, and they do not avoid the dark side of life that policemen and criminals, victims, lawyers and other people face on different orbits every day. > <br /> This show took place after 2 seasons and was interrupted because the show was not sold well overseas. We are sorry for the loss: as Fawlty Towers we will be able to consider it as serially limited series of evenly high quality.
