It's not as violent as I expected, causing violent scenes to look even more brutal and more effective. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of twists and turns and back stings and a double crossing across the entire movie journey making it hard to know who the strange character's side is at. The story is nice with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting look at the functioning of the Triad gang to follow. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Violence when it comes is brutal, no weapons or martial arts scenes with special effects, it's credible in your face of violence and for the entire dialogue we never let you forget, Triad is a violent criminal organization. <br /> <br /> The end is surprising, but consistent and credible.
