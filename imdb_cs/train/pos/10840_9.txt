Hughie (Billy Connolly), a 70-year-old Strange Fruit band, said the reason why lightning struck at a rock festival to stop a set of Strange Fruit was that God was sick for over 70 years. It's really popular that he refuses this musical era and sees punk as a welcome antibody. While I agree, the surplus was tedious (as well as the misogynistic desires that came out of it) and like punk I'm still a fan of what is considered classic rock or glam rock and this movie about the long, strange encounter Strange Fruit is a loving treat of those days . <br /> <br /> One of the reasons why the film works is caring for people behind the scenes. Brian Gibson directed WHAT TO WORK WITH Tina Turner (while I had problems with the dramatic parts of the film, the music was worked out very well), writers Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais jointly wrote THE COMMITMENTS and were behind British TV show OVER THE RAINBOW focused on music and Strange Fruit songs were written together with Mick Jones from foreigners (they should not be confused with Mick Jones The Clash), so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were talking about.Also two cast members are musicians in their own right (Bill Nye does not know about, although the film credits him with his own singing, and he certainly looks like the lead singer of that time, while Jimmy Nail was in another British TV show that focused on music, although I forgot his name and was in EVITA) and others are convinced. While, as I have already said, a lot of 70 bands like Strange Fruit behave badly against women, the film does not make the same mistake (except for a woman who follows Timothy Spall); as head of the assembly, Julie Aubrey is pretty good and plays a totally rounded character. Other actors are also good, with special praise by Stephen Rea, who manages a more dramatic role without sentimentality. There are a few points that do not work, but overall it's nice. Yeah, and the music is good too.
