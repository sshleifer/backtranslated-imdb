This movie scared me out of it! I have to admit I spent most of my movie watching my fingers, but what I saw was really scary. During the show, I cried out loud or three times loudly. <br /> <br /> Film making of my most popular aspects was sound and photography. The sound was especially great and the setting was really scary. Somewhere I read that it was some weird female and female team that did it. For some reason this makes this even stranger to me. <br /> <br /> If you like the jumps and nervousness of scary movies than it is for you! A very exciting and great movie to rent with a friend who loves to watch movies spinning on a couch screaming like little girls!
