I am amazed that such films can still be created. I watch all the movies all the time with my friends and I can say that this is one of the best I've ever seen. I never thought the 146-minute film could think of me further and further. Washington, charismatic and intense like ever before, plays Creasy, a rampant former anti-terrorist agent, a bottle. Once it's designed to protect young Pity (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City, its emotional and ransom arch is a jump started in the way just a lovely little girl can provide. Inevitably, Pita is kidnapped by criminals, and Creasy decides that most of Mexico's city has to pay the price for dare to take off its teddy bear's catalyser. Yes, it became ... fire. <br /> <br /> You have to see this movie.
