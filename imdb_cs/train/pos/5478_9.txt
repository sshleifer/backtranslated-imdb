There is no point in going to the story because so many reviewers did. Here are some different slopes of one of the "religious nuts" as one fanfare fan thinks it is so tolerant. <br /> <br /> 1) "Baby Face" (1933) offers perhaps a classic example that has ever made a film about how women can manipulate men with sex. It's a lot of truth for what Barbara Stanwyck demonstrates in this movie: she looks cute, enchants the lashes, offers her body free ... and the men fall over to help you with whatever you want. <Br /> <br /> <br /> In this case, it was improving work with the ultimate goal of money ..... much of it. At least four men in this movie will deliver it, even if they destroy their lives in the process. <br /> <br /> 2) The end - which seemed to hate many of the reviewers - gives another great message: all the money and material goods in the world do not make you feel fulfilled. A sad remark that here so many "critics" here will have a rather immoral message, it prefers daunting content. No surprise, I think. As you look at it, the movie is a fun start-to-finish and Stanwyck has some great lines, especially at the beginning, when she tells her rough father and his customers who are not right. In just over 70 minutes, this film moves at a fast pace and ends before you know it.
