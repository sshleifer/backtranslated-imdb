** WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILS! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First, I would like to say that I really liked this game. I got it for Christmas two months ago when I dropped my parents. I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> First of all I would like to say that the only player was very good. The first level is probably one of the best in the game when you are at a party in London and some of the bad ones have destroyed him by kidnapping the daughter of the Prime Minister. Of course you have to save her, and it's quite a high level, but it should probably take you at least five minutes. The best part and I think even the most fun part is when you're in a jet-pack, and people are rapping Big Ben. Just equip the most reliable rocket launcher and explode your face clocks and enemies down. Pure fun! <br /> <br /> The rest of the level is very good, but quite short. There are four mini-levels that you can unlock and this is one of those who are disappointed because only the first two of them are really fun and the last two unlock are just targets 'to kill 25 enemies', I mean mon! We have a lot of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad! Multiplayer, me and some of my friends agree, is very good and demanding even though there are no bots. Halo did not have any boots, but it is still some quality multiplayer games! You can be the load of bad people and you can go against each other, and you can also set traps, which is the best way to kill people without getting their character. <br /> <br /> Game - 8.5 / 10 (levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved). Graphics - 9/10 (there is a special graphic error, but it is not extremely often). Multiplayer - 10/10 (requires no comment, is great, you get to ride in jet-packs and vehicles). Sound - 8/10 Replay Value - 7/10 (the only level that I will return to Loondon and Istanbul Part 1). <br /> <br /> I give this game: 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> It could be a bit better, but it's still good.
