This movie is just fun.I have nothing to do with the original America Pie, but it's fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Another try, but better than the Band Band and The Naked Mile, at least funnier. <br /> <br /> After the first five minutes I laughed so I decided to call my friend and we would look together. We had a couple of beers and we were having fun. <br /> <br /> You will not find a deep message in this movie, but it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> So, sit down and enjoy yourself.
