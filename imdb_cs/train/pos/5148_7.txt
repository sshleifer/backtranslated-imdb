I do not know what's wrong with these movies. But movies about history or religion are always criticized for their accuracy. Of course he is not 100% accurate. Nowadays, it is difficult to create 100% accurate films where even "experts" do not agree. Therefore, I prefer to judge the film according to what it is trying to say, rather than selecting all inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> So start by saying that I liked this mini series. But I agree with the criticism that his childhood has passed too fast. The series should be a three-part history, her childhood first. But if they did not have more money to make another story, who would I criticize? <br /> <br /> There is only one real problem I have with this movie, and that is the fact that it was said in the history book way. Especially the second part, which is just the sum of the events that have happened. I'd rather see Hitler become more humane (more scenes where he himself doubts, etc.). Noah Taylor did it more in Max, which seems to work better. However, I'm glad it was made and own on DVD. Just remember what happened and see Carlyle do the best. 7.5 / 10
