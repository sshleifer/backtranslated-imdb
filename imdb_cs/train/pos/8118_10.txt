I first saw it in 1975 on a German TV channel and was instantly on, then I saw this movie about 12 times in cinemas, and today I have a videotape I look at at least once a year - this film is excellent in all aspects (direction, playing, slice, music score ...). The series is excellent and very impressive; the idea of ​​a devastating world war in the early 1930s seems to be a prophecy for the 1936 film, the dictator "Everytown" is pure Mussolini, and Raymond Massey is just charming, credible and ideally occupied as a "hero". The positive tone towards technology and progress is quite refreshing in today's times of pessimistic standards - especially the finishing scene that always brings tears or two to my eyes even after watching the movie so many times. <br /> <br /> It's good on TV, but it was made for a big screen so if you can see it at any cinema. please, it's overwhelming.
