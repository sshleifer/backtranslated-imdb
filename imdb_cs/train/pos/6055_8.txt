I did not expect much from this movie but was very pleasantly surprised because it is light and fun and very well observed. The central trio of motorcyclists was surprisingly sympathetic when they stretched and craved the way of their trip to Wales for drugs. Humor was gentle and gentle, as well as three characteristics (testifying to their sympathetic handling of a small old trader). The atmosphere of rural Wales was perfectly captured and the soundtrack was very well chosen. Cleverly and carefully sketched, with great attention to detail - I have never seen such a realistic view of alternative culture - I felt I was there with them. Very light contact and fun - not what you can expect from a movie about bikers and drugs. Delight on all fronts and difficult to criticize, even though I thought the last two scenes were a little chrome - the film was about to end when they left Wales. But the unexpected treasure of the film.
