It's nice to see a movie with real people with honest feelings. Sissy Spacek is as convincing as the simple, yet pretty daughter of Robert Farnsworth, who will eventually show off in his last role what a great actor he was. It's hard to believe it's David Lynch's film. It is slow and balanced, sweet and moving. One of the best if you do not like hunting, sexual scenes and violence.
