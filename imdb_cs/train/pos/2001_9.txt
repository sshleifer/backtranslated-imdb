I was lucky to see "Oliver!" in 1968 on a big screen in Boston when I was a young teenager. Later in the summer of 1969, I was glad that this film still played on an important cinema at Leicester Square in London after winning the Oscar for the best picture of the previous year. <br /> <br /> Th–µ success "Oliver!" both on the scene and on the screen reminded me that not all talent begins on Broadway and ends in Hollywood. This legendary story by Charles Dickens, which is part of the literary heritage of all English-speaking people, was admirably brought to the London scene by Lionel Bart from the UK. His charming musical has become a hit in New York and around the world. The film adaptation was made in England in the summer of 1967 and then released in 1968. The sets and musical numbers are funny. The song "Who will buy?" the hundreds of actors demanded, and the British film director really deserved his Oscar to make it all together without any problems. Some Canadian and American talents are also part of this wonderful production, but it is mostly a tribute to the fine craft work of British film studios such as Shepperton. Good show! Other film studios in Elstree, Boreham Wood, Bray, Denham and Ealing also gave the world many films that have continued over the years.
