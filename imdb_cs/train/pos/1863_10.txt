ANTWONE FISHER is the story of a young navy seaman. His troubles lead him to Jerome Davenport, a psychiatrist who helps him realize that his problems stem from his childhood education. <br /> <br /> Get ready to break tears or two. The film could thaw the coldest heart. I loved a story that will change from something so horrible that it will happen that someone gets to the positive end. ANTWONE FISHER is a powerful film, the most important is forgiveness. Other important issues that you are thinking about are child abuse, adoptions and foster care. Denzel Washington is doing an impressive work in directorial debut. There were many scenes that I enjoy watching. They embraced the beginning (the dreams of a little boy, look at the gigantic plaques!) And the end (dreams became a reality) that beautifully tied the story together. Another wonderful scene occurred when the doctor encouraged Antwone to look for his family to find answers to his questions about his family who had left him. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene happened when a young man finally met her mother and responded to him. Precious. <br /> <br /> All players presented their pieces well. <br /> <br /> In addition to the directors' duties, Washington continues on why he has won the Academy Award and has been successful in all of his acting roles. He had a strong presence in this film. Actor, Derek Luke showed why he was so right for Antwon Fisher. He portrayed a very real job that gave him the heart. Joy Bryant, who played part of Cheryl, Antwone's love interest, resembled a sunbeam on the screen. Chromie flowed between romantic figures. <br /> <br /> Novella Nelson, who played the role of Mrs. Tate, a despicable figure, deserves a special mention. Although we only see her for a few minutes, the actress who played Fisher's mother gave her excellent performance. Everyone should see ANTWONE FISHER.
