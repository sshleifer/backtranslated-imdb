Finally, we will get a TV series where we meet the actor talent! Episode One was great! The script gave us a bit more than usual, yeah, it was still there, "I'm not your father - I'm your father and the omigod that you cheated on me!" but the script allowed the actors really to feel and live the real moments rather than show us how it would be if it looked like so many television soaps. <br /> <br /> The camera also gave us a bit more than usual, there were no boring shots of repetitive angles for a few hours, yet there were no unnecessary "shots inside the shots or hand held camera" that would add an "artistic" edge , which gave us what we needed to see and beautiful scenery! <br /> <br /> Nothing was too dramatized or melodramatic that they were real people in a real place that dealt with real situations, the show had nothing in the drama and was completely relevant. It was such a relief to be exposed to real negotiations and so pleasant to let our country see how talented our actors can be, when we give them a real script, a real opportunity! Thank you Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, channel ten and all the cast and crew - great work! please continue what you are doing, your efforts are highly appreciated and will not go unnoticed!
