There is little comedy like this one, where almost every line and every character is approaching flawless. That's so fun! And there's plenty of satire. Sally Field is heading to a field of truly outstanding actors and doing a good, if not perfect, job with her daily TV-diva. Sometimes her acting is just a little wide and over the top, but 90% of the time is a revolt! In the same league are Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr and Whoopy Goldberg (who, unfortunately, have too little to do). Downey Jr does not have to convince himself as a comic and does not have the right timing, but he fights with his part, which is to be honest, most ungrateful. But the glowing star is Cathy Moriarty as Celeste, a real female, if it's ever been one with more than one unpleasant mystery (you'll see in a totally overwhelming final!). Unfortunately, Elisabeth Shue never seems to be quite decent. I usually like Mrs. Shue, but here she behaves like a fish from the water and sometimes it seems to be in another movie. But it is not harmful, and for the most part it is at least reasonable. Otherwise, it's a comedy you can watch whenever it's on TV or anywhere.
