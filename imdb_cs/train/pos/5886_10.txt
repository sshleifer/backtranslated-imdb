Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper can still turn the world with their smiles. The combined talent of these two gorgeous stars makes this combination of reunion / newstart film work. Watch it and enjoy the sixties! Marie resists youth-oriented societies with joke and spell. The touch of drama adds 2000 realism. Watching television serials would spread new characters and give us the opportunity to meet Lou Grant, Phyllis, Sue Ann, Murray and Georgette!
