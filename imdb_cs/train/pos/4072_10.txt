Hayao Miyazaki's name has become prominent with Spitied Away, however, what is often overlooked are the director's first film effort. Who remembers Spielberg driving Duel or George Lucas driving the THX 1138? I remember seeing the fragments of this movie - almost certainly the last 45 minutes in the 1980s, and what I saw was the visual freshness of design and animation. So when I found a copy in a well-known 9 pound store, I could not resist it but bought it. The strange thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie does not match my memory (memory is fun in this way). Viewing this film now with all the knowledge gained in the artist portfolio is as very similar to Jean 'Moebius' Giraud as some of the work is. I can only subdue some influence. When Pazu grabbed a fallen girl (Sheeta), his adventure really begins - a search for Laputa - a link to the overlooked part of Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift. From healthy references to Jules Verne, it's a good good vs. a bad chase with the last part that has the heroes on Laputa. This is the part that is most powerful in my memory - the "pastoral" ecological aspect of Laputa has returned to nature - a number of robots covered with moss under a giant tree. This is, in my opinion, the top of the film - views of the surface of Laputa, unlike the mechanized underground. While it is the dichotomy of this film - to show that even technology can not overcome nature - the irony of the last robot that takes care of the garden and the animals. The end of Silent Running is almost exactly the same. <br /> <br /> It is incredibly stylish, I would not say "smooth" - very beautiful and organic and a huge amount of detail in buildings, airships and design and appearance almost everything. <br /> <br /> Myazaki is the true master of this kind of Japanese anime. Buy this movie and treasure it.
