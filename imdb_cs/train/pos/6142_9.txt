Pleasant Disney movie with Angela Lansbury in a subtle form of the middle age spinster, whose interest turns into witchcraft in the 11th World War. <br /> <br /> Lansbury had about 51 years at the time of the film, and she is just the ideal part. She is again Jessica Fletcher, but this time it is beneficial or children and mother of England at a time of great danger. The film follows the adventures of Miss Price (Lansbury) and David Tomlinson as a professor of sorcery in an effort to get some information about witchcraft. The three dear friends who were sent to life with the Honor to escape the London bombings are simply great in this glamorous film for all of us, regardless of age. It's a shame that Tessie O'Shea, Roddy McDowall and Sam Jaffe are so little in the movie so cute. I really thought Ben Stiller's film "Night in the Museum," at the end of the film, when the relics came to life to fight the Nazi invasion of a small British coastal city.
