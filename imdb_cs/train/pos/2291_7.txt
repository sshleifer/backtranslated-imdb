The likely two main meanings of "Elmer's Rabbit of Beasts" are that the mad leporid, featured in the "Wild Hare" now has a name and that he tells his famous "Of course you realize that it means war!" first. Mostly Termite Terrace has always tried to find out what to do with this long-lasting rascale. Certainly it must be for fans of this genre, but others will probably have little reason to be interested. But do not make mistakes, it's pretty funny what Bugs Bunny does to Elmer Fudd's ever-faithful guy. Clear shades of things that come all over the cartoon. I recommend it.
