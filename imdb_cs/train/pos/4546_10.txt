This film will go down in history as one of the great, right alongside the Citizen Kane, Casablanca, and the waterfront. Someone please persuade Lena to continue! Leno and Morita are a comedy duo that has not been seen since Abbott and Costello saw each other. The evil that comes from Chris Sarandon, Tom Noonan and Randall "Tex" Cobb gives you a fever. Dingman's character as a crazy oaf listens to the days of Shakespeare's comedies. And climax. My goodness, the climax. I will not destroy you, but it will make the fatal explosion of the pale star as compared. If you can watch this hard-to-do gem, make yourself and your family a favor and buy it instantly. I still hope for a special DVD release one day.
