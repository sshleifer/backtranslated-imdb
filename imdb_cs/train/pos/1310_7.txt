** SPOILERS ** Highly charged serial killer police drama freely around Riverside Wisconsin. Who is being watched by the local police by police police Gina Pulasky, Helen Hunt, as a secret killer to catch him. <br /> <br /> Nothing new in this movie for a television movie you have not seen before, but the depth of acting and script is unusually good and brings not only a killer but also a policeman like her mistress of police colleague, state of mind. After an armed and unstable striker shot and attacked a partner with a rifle. Officer Palusky has a secret mission to get close to murder suspect Kayle Timler Steven Webber. After being positively identified by a young Sahsy girl Kim Kluznick, who saw him near the spot where little Timmy Curtis was found, was killed the next day for the next day. <br /> <br /> Getting a job at Mr. C's Diner, where Tim is working, Gina becomes very friendly with him later and tells Tim to open up that maybe he's a serial killer who once killed in an accident 79 year old woman. Tim, who is said to have a brilliant IQ, does not seem to pick up Ginin's attempt to imprison him, though he will see her later on a bowling alley with his fellow villagers who spent the night. Playing with some weird cat and mouse toy with Tim at one point gets Gina, at the point of the knife, to admit she's wired. But Gina tells her that she was forced to do it to the police to take a break and premature release from prison. In addition to Tim's instability and crime, we find that Gina is not there anywhere. She seems to suffer from the rejection of her father who has left her, with a drunken and abusive mother as a young girl who acts on her job as a secret police officer. <br /> <br /> There is also the fact that Gina is a lover of police officer Will McCaid (Jeff Fahey), who is alienated from his wife and two children who are also in the case of serial murder, is too alert to her. This will cause Gina to blow up her package, and it will throw it away later. <br /> <br /> Return to the secret duty of her boss Capt Cheney (Dan Conway), over the objections of Officer McCaid when another young boy was found, 12 year old Davy Marish, murdered together, and Tim receives that he is the person who is responsible for the chain of murders in this area. Gina does this by having a hidden tape recorder replacing the one she gave him to show her true, hidden on her. The film "In the Society of Darkness" was not really exceptional, but playing Helen Hunt Jeff Fahey and especially Steven Webber was. It was these high-caliber performances that lifted the film well above the average for a television movie and were used to seeing it.
