They never understood why the song of the MacDonald-Eddy Swan was always so reckless - not just their criminals, but virtually everyone. For me, I'm "married to an angel" and is more vivid and fantastic than any other famous duo trip. Sets and costumes are just as rich as all the MGM musicals, the screenplay is Reliable Anita Loos ("San Francisco", "The Women", "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes", etc.), Rodgers and Hart Melody (Even Changed a bit of MacDonald-Eddy's regular Bob Wright and Chet Forrest) gets heavenly treatment by Herbert Stothart (Oscar winner for the script "The Wizard of Oz") and best, "singing love" looks great in their current outfits and seems to be having fun bizarre management. Try today's unnamed "Rose Marie" or "Sweethearts" and they can have a very hard time sitting around, but this extraordinary, fast-paced fantasy will have fun.
