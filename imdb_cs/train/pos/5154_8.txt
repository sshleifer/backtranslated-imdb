As an amateur historian of WW2 / Nazi Germany, I could not wait for it to appear on DVD. I missed it when it was the first time in 2003. I do not want to repeat what has already been mentioned on the previous 8 pages of commentary on historical inaccuracies. It might be a better job to portray the "charming" Hitler. I also had a small problem with some of the casting possibilities, not for their acting but for their performance. Peter Stormare does not look like Rohm, why did Babson like Hess carry a wig? And my biggest complaint ... so much has always been made of Hitler's remarkable blue eyes, why did Carlyle not make blue contacts? On the plus side, I thought the actors who played Goring and Drexler looked pretty good. As long as people are watching this, they will understand that this is the first fun, the second history, I do not think there is much damage.
