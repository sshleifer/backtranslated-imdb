Russian emigrant director in Hollywood in 1928 (William Powell) casts his epic on the Russian Revolution and hires an old former Tsarist general (Emil Jannings) who plays the film's general. the memory of the woman they shared (Evelyn Brent) 11 years ago. <br /> <br /> Try it as much as possible, I feel hard to warm on "The Last Command" for all its virtues. "The Docks of New York" was undoubtedly a great movie and "The Underworld" is a movie I always wanted to see, but the "Last Command" is rather difficult. The premise is fascinating, but the treatment really makes the script alive, with the exception of the sequences set up in Hollywood that illustrate the boys' line of employable add-ons and machinings of great film production with state-of-the-art technology. <Emil Jannings is, predictably, an amazing Russian general who makes a great difference between the traumatized and dilapidated old ex-generation, overwhelmed by his sufferings, and the energetic, prolific officer of the past. <br /> <br /> The end is great and it's worth waiting, but to get there, you have to be ready sometimes.
