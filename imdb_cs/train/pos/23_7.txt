OK, so the songs were badly written and usually sang badly (though Walken and Marner, especially Walken, sounded pretty good). And so she split the fourth wall in the end by the king and his nobles singing about the "battle" with the ugly and praising the Pussy in their shoes, when they should not even know about it. /> <br /> Who cares about it? It's Christopher Freakin 'Walken, he makes a film based on a fairy tale and sings and dances. His acting style fits very well, like a frantic, dirty Puss who seems to have gotten his master into a deeper and deeper trouble, but in fact he has a plan that he thinks has seven or eight steps ahead of him . And if you ever saw Walken in some of his filthy roles, you know that he has to see for anyone who has the unique style of Christopher Walken.
