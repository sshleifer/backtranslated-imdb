There are good ways to make the movie and the bad ways, and this is it. This short caper does not come out of what gives the audience. It's a simple story that tells you very clearly enough enough to do you, and then improves. Clooney's cameo is funny and very welcome, but potential customers, including Sam Rockwell and Luiz Guzman, can easily do it themselves. Pleasant and funny, cheerful to the end, Welcome to Collinwood is a welcome addition to the heist genre.
