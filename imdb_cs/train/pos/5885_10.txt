This movie made me very surprised. I did not have too much expectations for it, but I was wrong. Mary and Rhoda were very fun and well written. They did not have too much time to regain the past, so they did not rely on the success of an old television show to shoot a movie. Overall it was very funny. My girlfriend remarked that it could be a weekly sit-com and I think I can agree with her.
