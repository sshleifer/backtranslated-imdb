I think this movie got a low rating because it was judged by the worst moments. There is a joke about diarrhea and an embarrassing scene, but there are quite a few moments that laughed out loud. Jason Lee makes a great comedy in this movie, and Julia Stiles can be herself funny. In addition, this movie acts like most romantic comedies, after about 40 minutes you will learn how it will end. (Which is better than most of them, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). Anyway, better movies that will look, but certainly not the worst to choose ... Healthy
