This NBC-TV film was broadcast in 1991 six months before John Goodman appeared in the big screen about Babe Ruth's life. For my money there is no comparison between the two. TV production is not perfect, but it represents Babe's story with greater depth and complexity than Goodman's one-dimensional narrative. I especially enjoyed the film showing the complex relationship between love and hatred that Ruth had with Yankee manager Miller Huggins, who always understood his stellar character while trying to show why Ruth's characteristic flaw would never allow him to become a manager or leader of a player . The TV film correctly records how Ruth never fulfilled his dream of driving the Yankees because of his flaws, while the terrible version of Goodman is attempting to push a fake that Ruth was denied what should be his for adoption. /> This movie is a great accompaniment to "Eight Men Out" because the story begins with Ruth's arrival in New York in 1920, a year after the Black Sox Scandal, and when his home run uses literally saved baseball from destruction. The continuity between these two films is even emphasized when John Anderson declined his role as "Eight Men" as Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.
