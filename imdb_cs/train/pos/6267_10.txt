I thought the original of this movie was quaint and charming as well as sitting on the edge of my seat and trying to figure it out. Because I've already seen the original when I saw Sci Fi Channel - I do not know if this remake was deliberately created for Sci Fi - I knew what it was in the first few minutes. Since I like Richard Burgi as an actor in the movie, I wanted to see him pull him out. Writers / producers, etc. The film was slightly upgraded by trying to explain the situation of "extraterrestrials" "(They could not reproduce their kind and the necessary help) using the same scientific pseudo-science that was blocked in our ears in the 90s. <br /> <br /> This film has a much more sinister border than the original - the original ended with a confrontation between a young woman and a stranger and understanding of the species, although the problem of the alien was not solved. br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I remember a bit that the woman became more hostile to the Burgi / Alien in this remake - I think it might be better, but the end is only the end, and the yarn is the swollen yarn that is the foundation of 1958 Science Fiction Pulp Stock Many great sci-fi stories were written in the 1950s, and some of them even made a movie, a swamp that can be seen as a rainy day I think it's really like all 50s. Sci Fi, this is what I've done. Actually, I enjoyed it a little. But if anyone really wants to see this story, WELL said, I suggest the original version of 1958 with Tom Tyron and Gloria Talbotte, directed by Gene Fowler Jr.
