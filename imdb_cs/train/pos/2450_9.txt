I have watched this show since my 14th birthday and since then I have loved it. I love this show because it's just fun! You will enjoy this show a lot because it's a daily everyday introduction of a new and more funny and my favorite part is when Benny always has the last comment on George after every angle of looking at his fat big head * laughing * with his friends at home it's like we're watching fun movie, but short. Love George Lopez. Funny, talented, entertaining, spectacular. It's a cool-funny-family comedy series that's great for everyone, and you'll definitely enjoy it - I've done it! And if you have not seen it before, I suggest you start watching because you do not want to stop watching it. Although we are not entirely new episodes, I still enjoy re-runs. Still funny. She never looks. <br /> <br /> 9/10
