If the movies are to be believed, Chinese ghosts are much nicer and detrimental than their Western counterparts. The history of the three films of the "Chinese spirit" is largely identical, but the direction is excellent and the detail and color is such that it is not a huge problem. As always, humor is an integral part of the film, accompanied, of course, by many obstacles. For those who have not yet recorded the 'Chinese GhostStory' trilogy, this movie offers an exciting departure from the genre of Western horror / ghosts; for those who have another nice story in the Chinese ghost world.
