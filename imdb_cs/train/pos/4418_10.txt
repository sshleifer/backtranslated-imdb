I saw it at the Hawaiian Film Festival, where the director and his wife (who produced it) took Q & A afterwards. <br /> <br /> I found it hard to believe that this was the director for the first time, and everyone else Harvey Keitel took the risk again and went to the limb for the script he liked. It certainly resembles the film Cinema Paradiso, tells the young director's story about how the revolution turned into Cuba. However, do not expect it to be a film about the revolution, it is a very ambiguous political stance. Many references to directors of obvious love for film history (great "Bicycle Thief" tribute) and some moody scenes that work to be picky. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
