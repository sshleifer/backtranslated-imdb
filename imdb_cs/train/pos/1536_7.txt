The stronger the drama, the better the film of sister rivalry! This little jewel was mostly promoted as a comedy after its release in Sweden, so I'm glad it was not the case. Funny bits for throwing small towns are there to enjoy, but drama becomes the center of interest as the story progresses. And not just family run, it also raises horrifying questions about respecting differences in people's lifestyle choices. <br /> <br /> A big character set with many wonderful and moving dramatic scenes that reach credibility points; and they are not just scattershot, but keep everything in place. I just suppose if Ingmar Bergman did it (the drama would suit him!), International attention would be immediate. 7 out of 10 in Ozjeppe.
