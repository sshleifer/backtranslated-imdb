<br /> <br /> "Burning Paradise" is a combination of the action of neo-Shaw brothers and city cynicism Ringo Lam. When one looks at the film, they can feel that the combat scenes are only average in nature, but it does not matter, it's the attitude and atmosphere that counts. This great movie has both! Always trying to be different from his contemporaries, Lam gives us traditional heroes (Fong Sai-Yuk and Hung Shi-Kwan) and puts them in the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" setting. However, these are not conscientious comic incarnations that you could see in Jet Li. Instead, these guys fight death with brutal results. What makes the movie even better is that someone can die at any time, there are no detentions. It's a shame they do not make such films more often.
