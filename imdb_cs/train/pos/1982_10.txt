It was my favorite movie as a kid and I was on the stage several times, so it will always be my favorite musical, and I doubt anyone else might be able to tell Oliver Twist again on the screen, no better than this one. My favorite '' bad guy '' must be Oliver Reed like Bill Sikes. Not only did he scare me out of my life as I watched him as a 6-year-old, but now as a woman who can more be attuned to the nature of Nancys, a lady / prostitute who helps Oliver get the life he deserves. > <br /> Jack Wilde as a great Dodger was fantastic and I do not think anyone could ever do it like street pockets and best friend Fagin. The music is fantastic, especially Fagin's numbers, I'm also quite grateful that they did not give a musical number to Bill Sikes, it would not work with such a sinister nature. I think Carol Reed did Nancy's slick work and let him nominate her for the film G by masking her beating but giving her enough room to show her violence. <br /> <br /> This movie is charming and charismatic as a musical vocal as well as the moving drama that follows the young boy when he tries to find the place he belongs to.
