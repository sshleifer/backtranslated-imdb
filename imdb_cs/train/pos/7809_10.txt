This movie convinced me that he is and will remain my favorite film of all time, mainly because he has almost all the emotions that he got in 157 minutes. The hardest thing to do to me is that whenever I want to hear amazing music and song from the movie, I have to put it on my DVD player, so I was wondering if anyone knows where to sing the songs in the movie and where they can be found I have been watching everywhere, I can think sporadically for the past 5 years. My favorite quote from the movie is when a lawyer says, "But your own words require a direct confrontation, is not it a direct challenge to violence?" Biko replies: "You and I are in confrontation, but I do not see any violence!" CRAIG ROBERTSON Fife, Scotland
