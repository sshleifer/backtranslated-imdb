How could I get the opportunity to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? Well, I could not, and so I rented this movie mess. I have never heard of Ned Kelly, and I was surprised at what I found out about the young man's legend. I was also surprised at how this film was average. Perhaps it was very, very late, and at the end of a four-hour film marathon, or maybe because it's really a bit slow, I was hard to watch this story. Not because the story is complicated, but because it is slow. Even with a slow story, Ledger and Bloom managed to create interesting, dimensional figures. <br /> <br /> Although I mud to recommend it as seen, it's a great story of Australian history (considering how a young country is, it is very rare and that it should be appreciated) and the movie has some good action sequences. (see the rule ... and that's the only reason you see it ...))
