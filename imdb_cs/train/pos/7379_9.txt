Here in Brazil it is very rare to see a good Brazilian film and Brant's new film is just one of these gems. There are, of course, some mistakes in the movie, but they are very minimal. Direction and acting in this movie are very good! <br /> <br /> You can not wait until you see another new Brant movie!
