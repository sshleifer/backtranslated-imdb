This animation has a very simple and straightforward good vs. against a bad plot and it's all about action. What distinguishes it from other animation is how well animated the human movement. It was really beautiful to see the fugitive woman running on the screen from left to right and looking around her movements were done so well. Why do not these rotoscopic techniques still apply today? It is quite effective. Fire and ice, in their prehistory and scarcely dressed women, were clearly devoted to showing the beautiful girl in need in different sexy ways, her sensual body serving as a clean eye. Some may hate this situation and treat it as another crazy sexual fantasy, others (including many women) will boast aesthetic quality. It certainly did not matter! Bakshi just loves the animation of crazy, sensual babes, as seen in Cool World, and I do not think she has to apoligise because it's quite an animation for adults. But I also enjoyed this animation as a child and never forgot it. This was strange, so different from the standard Disney or Anime tariff, and that's why it's worth a lot. maybe Bakshi is the best. For those who like animation with brown women: try Space Adventure Cobra. <br /> <br /> I give fire and ice 8 out of 10.
