Very good movie. A classic science fiction film with humor, action and everything. This movie offers more aliens. We see the leader of the rebel alliance and many imperial forces. The Emperor is a rather original figure. I liked Ewoka, who represented native savages and Vietnamese. (Excellent references) I loved a duel between Vader and Luke, who is the best of the saga. In the return of the Jedi, the epilogue of the first trilogy is over, and the empire finally falls. I also appreciated the victory celebrations, where she meets Vader's redemption and returns to Anakin Skywalker's spirit along with Yoda and Obi-Wan. It gives sadness and tears. The biggest scenes in star wars include these films: When Vader turns to Emperor. Luke watches and finds comfort by looking at Obi-Wan, Yoda, and ... his father (1997, not Hayden Christenssen). Another best scene is when Luke hurried to hit Darth Vader to protect Leia. There is the deep dark side of this movie, though it's a good end. I felt that the eye was more than more. And as always, John William's music brings classicism into the Star Wars universe.
