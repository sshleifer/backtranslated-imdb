No doubt the best of John Le Carre's novels, beautifully transformed into a classic movie. The performance of Peter Egan (Rudolf Weigang), Ruden Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus's Czech reporter), Ray McAnally (Magnus's Convent father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus's mentor, believer and British administrator) so perfect and natural that the person responsible for casting should receive awards. Even small parts like Major Membury are perfect. It tells a lot about the power of power and the character's character in the novel that despite the duplicity of Magnus, one can not feel closer to Magnus and Axel than to Jack Brotherhood and the slimy Grant Lederer of the American news. I have read the book for at least a dozen times and watched the film almost as many times as I am still enchanted by both. If I had one book on a desert island, Perfect Spy would be a choice over all the others.
