For several years I waited for this film to finally be released in England, but in many ways it was very pleased to see it finally. There are a lot of great things on the film, the beginning of acting. It's something I've got so much you need in a horror film, but the people in this movie are all working. This and a constantly breathtaking and interesting scenario, with Lovecraftian's nice sortiment to make the film really a solid backbone. Add batch of surreal pictures of nightmares and occasional horrible gore and winner movies. It also has its favorite kind of gore, supernatural and splattery. Also, characters Marcus, an angry transsexual bodybuilder and Daisy, his mentally retarded lover / toy are really weird and disturbing at times, and they get far out there, whatever has a sense of morbid adult foolishness that works well with frequent Freudian subtexts. This is one of the most remarkable horror movies that is much more shocking or there is more than the Hollywood you can make. My only fight was that I wanted the end to be darker in tone, but it still works, and so I would really recommend it to serious horror enthusiasts as a whole.
