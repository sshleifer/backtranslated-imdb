so I was a teenager when I saw the movie .. the song was a huge hit, but the elite class omitted govinda movies then the watching govinda and karishma (aka karizma) movies were not in the stuff for this "class" but as many people liked it, because the series of these films increased in the 1990s and most of them were successful ... I watched her after a long time, and I remembered it was a lot of people and the rebellion they created when a naive song appeared on the screen ... govinda and karishma dresses complement each other (the worst dressing duo of that time), and karism in the late nineties turned, but govinda was still very loyal to his designer as his cloaked sense remains the same ... but at that time it all merged it was all good .. everything worked and slowly the elite class realized how much fun it was missing and then ..... there was no feedback for this iodine as it went continue to give the Indians a series of ... hated but couples who love the masses. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good time with no undisturbed rental or watching TV, I do not think you would regret it ... but do not forget its worst in the best .. <br /> <br /> I'm still watching on those movies when I get time coz and cant stop laughing ... so I say go ahead and have a good time as the times when we all love stupidity and especially when the kings of their time is certainly observable ... I recommend to all film lovers ...
