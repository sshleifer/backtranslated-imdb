My main problem with the film is that it's going too long. It's pretty good. Paul Muni plays a poor Chinese farmer who is about to marry an agreed marriage. Luise Rainer is a servant who married Muni. They live with Muni's father on the farm and they do it wrong. When he finally gets some money to buy some other land, he gets drought and nothing goes. All the stars heading north of Muni remain behind. When they leave and come to the city, they find that their jobs are not work and worse than before. They even think about selling their youngest daughter as a slave for some money, but they oppose it. When a lot of people start looting the city, the army will appear and start performing people. Paul Muni is doing a good job and Luis Rainer won the second film for this film.
