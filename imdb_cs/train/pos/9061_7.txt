I really liked the film. I remember reading as a kid several times, and I was glad to see a movie about this book. <br /> <br /> I sat for a boy and a girl aged 11 and 8 and I had to talk to the girl to see the movie. But happy, at the end, she was glad to see it and even say she wanted to buy her on DVD as soon as it came out. There were some great laughs - the loud moments and the movie was not as "rough" as I expected it would be ... it's going high up there on the gross-o-meter ... The only thing I can not figure out is the reason , why they had to have a "bold" line that Woody did in relation to his private part ... that it was the only shocking moment for me (and you heard adults groaning audibly at the moment in the movie) ... I have no idea, why it was in the movie; it did not add anything to the real movie except the shock / flare ... other than the good movie. I like to see that the adult girl "Pepsi" grew up.
