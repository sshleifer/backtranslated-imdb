It will be another kind of review. I saw this movie twice on TV and I would like to have a copy because it talks about Panama City and the beach in the winter, which is my favorite time to be there. It was the first movie I saw at Ashley Judd and it was great and I enjoyed everything I saw. Sundance's reaction to me has worked as well as director Victor Nunez, who has directed and wrote several movies about Florida. This movie is talking to me and I have not seen anything that could be compared. The story tells me less than the neighborhood. Well, I told you it would be another kind of review.
