And Give this movie 10/10 because it deserves 10/10. Two of the best actors of their time - Walter Matthau and George Burns collaborate with Neil Simon and all the other actors in this movie + director Herbert Ross, and this makes this adaptation of the stage accomplished. Sunshine Boys is one of the best films of the 1970s. I like the type of humor in this movie, but it just makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> I have this movie on VHS 3 days ago (yes, VHS, because it was cheaper - just $ 3). I watched it as soon as I returned home, but I had to see it again because I was missing a few parts for the first time. The second time I watched, I felt much better and I laughed a lot more. I definitely call it a DVD because I have to see special features. <br /> <br /> It is very funny how it happens. Two people collaborate as animators / actors / artists. They get well on stage but really claim they can not survive another minute, then about 15 years later you want to unite them for television. This is in this movie. Matthau & Burns were great in this movie. It's a damn shame they died. George Burns earned Oscar. He did a powerful comic performance. He was also 78 when this film was shot. Meanwhile, he is the oldest actor to win an academic award in old age. Jessica Tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress. Richard Benjamin was also fantastic. He won the Golden Globe for Best Actress. He deserved the Golden Globe. Though many people may disagree with what I mean, everyone in this movie gave a strong performance. This comedy is an instant classic. I highly recommend. One more thing: Who hates this movie is "Putz"
