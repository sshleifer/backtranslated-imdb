Behind this film is a certain genius. I laughed all over. The sex phone scene in the phone that discusses how love heals doppelganger was a nice attempt at this genius / humor. Execution is bad, but you see a writer's message and have a certain talent. The Doppelganger split at the end ... as "ok, it was not quite like that, but let's see what the movie is supposed to say". Definitely a ridiculous but sweet idea, and indeed very strangely related to the story. Is the movie point logical, or is it fun or communication at the emotional level? I'm very boring in many movies, but this one keeps my whole interest. I think the story may have some auto-biographical roots, but that's just an estimate. Bad, but good. I'm looking for other movies this guy can do (with more experience).
