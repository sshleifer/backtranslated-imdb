This is my movie. I'm fascinated by strange psychic nightmares and this movie is just that. But it's also a dark comedy. While I see it mainly as a horror / thriller, it will be someone else who could see it as a black dramatic comedy. But either it's a fascinating descent into madness. The conclusion caught me, but the end! It leaves a lot of thought to the viewer. A powerful performance, a comprehensive and detailed plot, a great screenplay full of fear and a dash of humor, and an exciting atmosphere make it a movie that's worth watching. </ br> <br /> I personally think that I will have to watch several times to get and understand all the subtleties that are inside. But it's such a movie that it will be a pleasure, not to do it.
