This is the movie my dentist really recommended, and I'm glad he did it! A mixture of British humor (should I say, Humor?) And the reality of a lost middle-aged widow who tried to keep her lifestyle was humor. Add to this combination the fact that is needed to really grow pots (the plants under the bushes are ready without the TLC they got), and it's really a funny, yet touching film. I laugh every time I conjure up the vision of all the witches sitting on the chairs on the lawn, with the sunglasses counting the light! Maybe it's just my Mendocino County blood, but the British are sure to get this right! 10/10
