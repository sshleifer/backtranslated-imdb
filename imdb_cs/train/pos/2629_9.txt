I was not sure when I came out. I wondered how Disney was stupid. I was wrong. I found it very good. I think it's not the Lion King, but it's great to see another party from a point. It was very funny. It was also not one of those unsuccessful sequels in disney, the animation was upset, it was like the animation of the Lion King. The only thing that exhausted me was the whole thing. Do not give anything, but you know what I'm talking about. I'm also funny that it was great to have most of the cast out of the original to come back. It was a very good movie.
