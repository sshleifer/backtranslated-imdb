It's a movie everyone should watch. Regardless of the immense important points (while South Africa is on the road to recovery, there are still many countries in similar situations), it is greatly managed, while Denzel Washington gives me the best performance in my career. Kline also performs well, though not as amazing as Washington. John Thaw also fits as a police chief. There are so many possible areas where the apartheid film could fall, but everyone avoided them. It would be easy to simply portray white people as bad people and black people as good guys, but Attenborough did not do it. Certainly, there were some white characters that seemed inherently bad, such as the captain at the Soweto rebellion, but adding more dimensions to all the characters would make the film unbearable for a long time. Some people complain about the length of the movie as it is, but I think it takes 2.5 hours to tell the whole story because it's really incredible. The best scene in the movie is the funeral of Steve Biko. When the crowd starts singing the South African national anthem, it's probably one of the most important scenes I've ever seen. If you have not seen this movie, watch it. Maybe it's not a nice watch, but it's definitely worth it.
