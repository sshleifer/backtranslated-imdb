"Good Earth" is a great movie that you do not know much about. There are many major disasters and events, but it's also a passionate love story. All this happens in just over two hours, which is short on today's standards. Special effects and costumes are very good for this period. <br /> <br /> I am surprised Luise Rainer has received an Oscar for such a limited role. Essentially, he has only three emotions: submissive, hungry, and broken. <br /> <br /> The performances of Asian and Asian-American actors are amazing. <br /> <br />
