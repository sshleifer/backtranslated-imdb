After seeing several Villarong films, I had a very clear opinion about him - he concentrated too much on the personal aspect of the characters and forgot the rhythm of the film. Therefore, although he has good criticism, his films have never caught the public's attention. The ARo tracks the same line, but actually improves the rhythm, especially at the end of the movie. Frankly, I was sleeping the first part because the first part provides the necessary information, it is really slow. However, the second part is absolutely amazing and makes the entire film the best film ever made by Villarong. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
