Scarecrow was one of the most fun killers I've ever seen! In addition, he is in most cases really jumping when he jumps, which was amazing! He also had an excellent voice, perfect for him. Stories were also great. I like how the soul of the children was transferred to the Scarecrow, which was great! Besides, he had a reason why I meant all the killing after what these people did ... I would also be angry! The look of Scarecrows was really good! his gaze gives this person "OMG!" when he sees him! Which was the great look he got was funny! These people were stupid to look at it for a long time! They would look at it and run for their lives ... though it would make no difference!
