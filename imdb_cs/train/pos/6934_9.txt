Winchester '73 is a great story and I like it. This is not your everyday western - it uses a rifle that goes through the hands of different characters - as a mechanism for telling a story about these people. Rock Hudson plays Indian boss, Jimmy Stewart plays a great lead man with heart and strength, and Shelly Winters plays a gal that has to cope with the reality of her husband and wild west. It's important to be aware of those politically correct types - in this film, many Indians will be killed without accusations. According to today's standards, it is still very violent. But it's a great story and it's worth watching. Enjoy!
