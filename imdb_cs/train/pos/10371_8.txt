This is an extremely powerful story based on a real story that can be enraged and attentive. I say this because the brutal can be a puppet for people, in this case an innocent Australian couple accused of killing her child. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep gained much appreciation for his performance when this film came out, but I thought Sam Neill was just as good. Let's say they were both excellent, but it was a bit harder for Streep because they had to learn the Australian accent. (She learned so well that I had problems understanding it in parts.) Without doing anything, I can only say that this film will wear you emotionally.
