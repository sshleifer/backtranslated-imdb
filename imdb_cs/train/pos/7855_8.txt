Tess of Storm State was the Mary Pickford vehicle I wanted to get for some time. Finally, I found a copy of the VHS at a reasonable price and enjoyed it. Mary gives her a typical bold, innocently sexy portrait of a bad girl who wins the heart of a rich heir. Only this time there is a higher proportion: false murder charges, illegitimate child (and subsequent case of erroneous motherhood), and suicide. One can understand why Pickford wanted to do this again. The story is the true story of the morale he loved in the game. Controversial topics are not always clearly explained; does the viewer need to pay attention and pick up help to capture everything that is supposed to be at first viewing? although everything is eventually explained more or less. The only negative comment I can make is about Jean Hersholt and the dog. Hersholt, whose character, Ben Letts, seems to be about 6-2, 200 pounds (of course, bigger than Mary) is sent off in panic when he gets a religious chocolate lab of 60 pounds! Then, as long as it does not answer (or perhaps justify its confused fear of a dog), it can pinch it to the ground and somehow hurt it so badly that it is still trying to fight much later as the storm crashes! This is the same kind of lab that sleeps with Frederick (Lloyd Hughes) and pet with Mary! But Mary later casts boiling water in Ben's face, which is slowing him down! OK, I blew Ben and the chocolate lab! In addition, the film was quite moving and definitely kept me in mind. Pickford's support cast was strong and credible. This is surely among her better movies.
