I saw it in the theater and I immediately thought it was so good that I own a video. I'm a big nut for sci-fi action moves, though so. <br /> <br /> Without telling a story, it's worth seeing if you like Sci-Fi without having to think much. The story is basic and the plot is very good. You stand for a time to see! <br /> <br /> Maybe they will continue? :) <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
