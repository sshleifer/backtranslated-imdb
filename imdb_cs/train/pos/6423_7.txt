This film is an amazing, uninterrupted laughing revolt including all the usual addicts of Dawid Dhawan comedy - horror heroes, crazy supporting characters, made dolls for heroines, nasty villains, wisekracks, rocking soundtrack + choreography and a small batch of action. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda both are in double roles of policemen and minorities. The Amitabha cop's heroine is Ramja Krishnan, and Raveen is against police Govinda. Heroines are common unbuttoned props. Horses do not have any heroines. Paresh Rawal carries his villainous act at DAUD Forward (played similar to Don in KHOOBSURAT too). Asrani shines in a short role. He makes retake on his famous "Angrezon to Zamane to Jailer" act in SHOLAY. <br /> <br /> Govinda is as flawless as usual - like wisekracking, good-humored policeman Pyaare Mohan and as conman Chhote Miyaan. He mimics the Bihari style of Hindi speaking with cheerful results. Amitabh Bachchan, believe it or not, fades in comparison with him. But AB is fine. Madhuri Dixit is a song called "Makhna" as a song. They dance like the wind. <br /> <br /> I know Shah's music is amazing. Take a look at "Kisi Disco Mein Jaayen", "Makhna" and the title track. <br /> <br /> Do not go looking for any LOGIC because it's a comedy and the script is comfortable. Just enjoy.
