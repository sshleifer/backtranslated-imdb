I like the movie that reminded me of my marriage. It is very clean, you can see it with your family. Very nice done. The pisces are also fine. I think the director is great. The film shows how marriage progresses over time. Having couples at different stages of life and relationships in their lives, the film beautifully displays several parallel stages in parallel in the same story. Some of the dialogues are pretty good. The film shows intricate human emotions very nicely, not dramatized. Also showing perfect is after all not so perfect. It shows very well the dynamics of organized marriage when it is new. The film is very well written and directed.
