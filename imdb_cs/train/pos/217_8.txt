SUNSHINE BOYS was a bizarre screen adaptation of Neil Simon's 1975 film about the murderous Vaudeville team played by Walter Matthau and George Burns, who had a very hot farewell and were asked to rejoin the TV specialization or something like that. The problem is that these two are still hating each other and wanting nothing to do with each other. Richard Benjamin appears as Matthau's nephew, a theater agent who has been given a monumental responsibility for making this meeting a reality. This warm and winning comedy is a beautiful valentine for the forgotten form of entertainment ... vaudeville and works mainly thanks to one of the better scripts by Neil Simon and the excellent work of Matthaus, Burns and Benjamin. Burns won the Best Actress Oscar, but I think Matthau is leaving with this film with his flawless performance like Willy Clark. Matthau was nominated for Best Actor, but he did not have a chance against Nicholson for ONE FLEW O CUCKOO'S NEST; but next year it was an Oscar. Matthau controls the screen and there is no fake note in this beautifully timed performance. The scene where you compete for a potato chips business and can not get the product name right is a classic. SUNSHINE BOYS is a warm and winning comedy by Neil Simon, which shines through unrivaled chemistry between Matthau and Burns.
