Skippy from Family Ties goes from a purely cut to a metal child in this relatively cheesy movie. The film seems to have happened in response to all the upset parents who claimed that metal music is turning their kids badly or killing them - besides, a dead Satan metal star tries to return from the grave (using Skippy's help). And while the conspiracy is ominous and clich√©, anger (such as a bad green fog that takes off girl's clothing) and soundtrack are what makes the movie so cheerful (and great). And of course there is nothing like Ozzy Osbourne playing a preacher who asks what happened to a love song :). Definitely a movie that has several friends for good laughter. And when you're up to it, do a double feature with Slumber Party Massacre 2 - it's a "bad rocker" (as shown on the video box) killer killer in a black leather w / fringe. It must be seen for cheese fans.
