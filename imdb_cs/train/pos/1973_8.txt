I never believe someone's opinion about the movie. This also applies to critics. Sure, if it's going to have a positive review, it's okay and plus, but most of the films that get the critical rave I hate. I enjoyed the movie for what it was, a fun movie. It will pull you out of your life for a few hours and into a fictitious character ... that's Catherine Trammell. Sharon Stone is amazing in this role, just like the first one. Anyone who says she is horrible in this movie must feel like it's the same thing in the first b / c that she's back in the same way as in Basic Instinct 1. Catherine is hers and she plays her to perfection. Its one liner is great, just like in the first one. Who can forget the first movie when he tells the cops: "If you arrest me, do it ... otherwise you'll get out of here!" Great scene and trust me to do it again in this. She was amazed. Her clothes, the way she smoked cigarettes, believe me it's worthwhile to see Stone's show. I can not wait for this movie to be released on DVD, uncut because I can only imagine how much better it will be. And yes, there are plenty of twists, like the first, including the end!
