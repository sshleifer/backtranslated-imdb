CAT SOUP has two "Hello Kitty" kittens that set off on a bizarre journey after a lifetime where something can happen and do. This Asian short thought does not use any dialogue, instead replaces the word balloons. There is no way of describing this demented cartoon, except to tell you to see it yourself. And make sure no one under the age of 10 is in the room. Representation and cannibalism and cruelty and savages and sudden death and insignificant negligence towards others are common themes. Honest. Perhaps the most unforgettable picture is the elephant composed of the water that cats can swim and in and also ride. But like virtually everything else in this movie, the silly, picar interlude soon comes to a terrible end.
