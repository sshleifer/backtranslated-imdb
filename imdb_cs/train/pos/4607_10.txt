My favorite film, Jackie Chan, will always be "Drunken Master" (1978), followed by this 1985 film "Police Story". Chan is playing a super-policeman in Hong Kong, who reports a notorious crime and his gang, and is then commissioned to protect Brigitte Lin's girlfriend to turn the country's evidence. As the story goes, the gangster sends his boys to send Lin, but Chan takes things into his fists and legs while keeping his girlfriend Maggie Cheung in the bay. Like the "Drunken Master," "Police Story" has many sign-ups and the convincing martial art / action choreography Chan has become famous for culminating in a royal battle in a crowded shopping mall. In his role as director Chan he overcomes perfection, giving a charismatic and entertaining performance that highlights the action. While the light of the humorous humor "Drunken Master," the heart of "Police Story" is just that, a police story, a frantic cop-thriller that would be copied in the years to come. <br /> <br />
