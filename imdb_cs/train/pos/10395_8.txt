Fantastic Arabian Adventures. Former King Ahmad and his best friend, thief Abu (playing Sabu from Black Narcissus) are looking for Ahmad's love interest, which was King Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). There is not much here. Always invent a new adventure for heroines. Personally, I find that Ahmad and his princess are a little dull (there is no need to ask why John Justin, who plays Ahmad, is ranked fourth in credits). Conrad Veidt, always an entertaining actor, makes a great villain and Sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves who suddenly find the genie in the bottle. I really liked Miles Malleson as Sultan Basra, Father of Princess. She collects amazing toys from around the world. Jaffar bribes his daughter with a mechanical flying horse. This would probably belong to one of the biggest children's films ever, but special effects are now terribly dated. Kids will surely suppress overlapping images when Abu and genie are on the screen together. And the scene with a giant spider looks particularly horrible. Although most younger generations probably think that King Kong looks bad at this point, Stop-motion Willise O'Brien's animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that is far from appearing to be a spider. 8/10.
