Yet another example of what British cinematography can achieve: a simple story that is said and works well. Brenda Blethyn gives the film and warmth performance as the recently widowed and financially reassured Grace, who is absolutely helpful with solid support for the cast. The "Unpredictable Small City" card is played on handles, much like a series of television series and films that have come from British Isles in recent years (Ballykissangel, Hamish Macbeth and others). Like the aforementioned film, it uses some beautiful rural scenery, in this case the wet and wild coast of Cornwall. Some audiences might consider wholesale cannabis reception as fairly demanding, others might find the end a bit too cute and safe. But it's a nice spliff, sure.
