If you went into this movie and you see some huge Academy Awards ... oh, but if you want to see the funny, beautiful adaptation of old classics, you'll love her. Jim Carey was incredible as usual. The story line was great, some of the parts added to Grinch's history made it even better. Ron Howard will never miss. But although there were a few comments for adults and adding happiness, it is a children or a family. Try not to lose sight of that ... if you're really used to the movie ... and when it comes to commenting on Ron Howard, try to direct the main movie and see how you do it ... it's not as easy as it looks .. .
