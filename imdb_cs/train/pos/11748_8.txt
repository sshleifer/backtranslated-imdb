Exceeding. I have to say that I was a little disappointed in the first few episodes, but with confidence in the show and the undoubted talent of Abe Forsythe I continued to watch. I can safely say I'm glad I did. The story developed quite well and all the characters have a strong base and most of them have no information missing. The only thing I can think of in this production is the rather unpleasant voice and pronunciation of Lizzie. Some good actors associated with the star conspiracy actually get this show across the line. Here is hope for the next season!
