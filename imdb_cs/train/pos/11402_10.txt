I saw "American in Paris" when I was still in school and immediately fell in love with him. I returned again and saw it again the next day, and I lost counting how many times I saw it, both in the cinema and on television. It makes fantastic use of some of the best music and songs of the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century (George Gershwin) and presents the best male (Gene Kelly) and female (Leslie Caron) dancers in Hollywood history. The supporting cast of Oscar Levante (as strange as ever), Georges Guetary (why not make more movies?) And Nina Foch (brilliant in a non-speculative role) are at the top of their form. The final ballet, superbly choreographic to title music, makes great use of the sights and sounds of Paris and the paintings of impresionist and post-impressionist artists. All the Gershwin songs are beautifully introduced, but the most memorable are "It's Very Clear" (Caron and Kelly on the Seine Coast) and "I Got Rhythm" (Paris children joined Gene Kelly in "Une Chanson Americaine." If you love Paris, If you've never been to Paris in your life, look at this, but see!
