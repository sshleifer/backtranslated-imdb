I remember more than Nausica from the winds of the ages when this story was too serious for me. Laputa, whose title seems to have influenced his release in the US to avoid confusion with his broad-based Hispanic audience, has the cartoonist talent of Conan's debut film debut. In fact, Pazu has dense bones and the immortal vitality of Conan, who jumped out of a thousand stories, carried the girl in his arms and landed on his feet, then began to run. It makes him the most animated and pleasant figure. Techie fans of Nausice can be disappointed with flying errors and retro technology over Laputa - the only exception being a robot. Unlike the Princess Mononoke and the valley of the winds, the Laputa theme is not directly linked to environmentalism. If it has a theme at all, it's anti-war. The importance of natural life - that is associated with the flying castle, is negligible briefly discussed and really does not follow. Overall, I consider this piece to be a crossroads between feelings and anger.
