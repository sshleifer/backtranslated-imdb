A long Beta Midler fan has to say that her live concerts are my favorite. Bette excites us with jokes and brings us to tears with his ballads. Literally a rainbow of emotions and talent, Bette shows us her best of her solid repertoire, as well as new songs from the album "Bette of Roses". Throughout the generation of people, it offers something for everyone. The only and only Divine Diva here proves to be the most talented artist around.
