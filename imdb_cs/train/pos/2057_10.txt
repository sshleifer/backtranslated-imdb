In 2002, there was no day when scarecrows would not be hunted me. I felt that this film had a serious problem. He brought a lot of memories because he was so realistic. <Br /> <br /> Even today I have nightmares on corn on the tap and I can not even approach the tinned fabrics in the fear of my life. I have to admit, however, that at one point I had to shut down when it turned out too close to home <br /> <br /> For those of you who were never attacked by a scarecrow, watching this movie you could be educated about how this is for us victims <br /> <br /> This film teaches us not to take life as a matter of course or mess with corn, believe me I was there and I have scars Watch the movie, its amazing and educational
