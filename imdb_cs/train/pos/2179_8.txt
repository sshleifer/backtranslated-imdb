Prix ​​de Beauté took place at the peak of the transition from silence to the sound that came a little later in Europe than in Hollywood. Originally conceived as Silent, he was released with a dubbed soundtrack in France, with a French actress speaking to Louise Brooks, but was released as silent in Italy and other parts of Europe. I was lucky to see Cineteca di Bologna a remarkable new restoration of the Italian silent press at the Tribeca Film Festival. I have not seen it yet, but I think it is certain that the silent version is much more satisfying because all the dubbing news is badly done (Louise Brooks clearly speaks English so her lips can not be.) The film is also made in a quiet, a few of the titles and a little need for dialogue.The Prix de Beauté tells his story visually, with an exciting, imaginative camera.The opening is instantly kinetic, with fast cut scenes of urban life and swimmers running down to a public beach.In the whole film, emphasis is placed on visual details about clothes, machines, decorations and symbolic pictures, such as a caged bird, a pile of torn photographs, a diamond bracelet, a technique of silent film at the top. <br /> <br /> Louise Brooks is of course responsible for rescue the film from the unknown, seeing it just makes more heart to reflect that it was her last to play the lead role. Lustrously beautiful, it dominates the film with its charisma and at the same time it perfectly naturally continues to perform very well. Her role here, more than Pabst's best-known film, is a woman with whom we can fully understand and sympathize. She plays Lucienne Garnier, a scribe with a wealthy fiance who wants to make more of her life and secretly enters the beauty contest with immediate success. She is then torn between the excitement of her charming new life and love for a man who insists on giving it all or losing it. All characters are rendered with nuances. The fiancé inspires pity and is not just crude: he loves Lucienne, but he is a limited person who can not cope with having a life outside or attracting other men's attention. Even the "other man" in the story is not a simple slimeball that we are first attracted to, though his intentions can be as good as a fiance. <br /> <br /> ********** *************** WARNING: SPOILERS BY ************* **** <br /> <br /> The film has many fine pieces, including Lucienne's triumph in the Miss Europe contest, which has been shown by the comic reactions of various listeners who have ended the heroic accumulation of flowers; her suffering as a housewife, the robbing of potatoes, while pendulum clocks mean time behind her; a spooky trip to the amusement fair (in a silent version, it takes place late in the movie, after her marriage), on which Lucienne, crushed between her low life and her husband's depressed machinations, decides that she can not go with her present existence; and especially the last scene in the design room where she looks at her screenwriter test. Louise Brooks may never have looked more beautiful than she here, with the projection beam blinking on the alabaster profile, her white-shouldered shoulders and her face glowing under her black hair as she watched her sang on the canvas. The double shot of her beautiful corpse and still-life on the screen is particularly palpable: the picture of Louise Brooks, like Lucienne, remains immortal despite her frustrating abortion film career.
