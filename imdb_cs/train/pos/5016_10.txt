This movie is one of my favorite. It's hard to explain why. Maybe it's Corin Nemec's innocence and his clumsiness coupled with the courage of Cheryl Pollak, but it certainly has something to do with the soundtrack. Some characters also have small lines, movements or moments that are fun in themselves. Finally, the story is the one that always suffers on my heart, and the last scene is so hot. Overall, I love this film; it's perfect for a sultry, sentimental nightgirl.
