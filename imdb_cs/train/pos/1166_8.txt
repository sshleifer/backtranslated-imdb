Icy and deadly ace hit-man Tony Arzent (divinely smooth and commanding performance Alain Delon) wants to leave the assassination business, but the dangerous mobsters he works for will not allow it. After his wife and child kill, Arzenta declares that it is an open season for everyone who is responsible for their death. Director Duccio Tessari focuses on the absorbing storyline at a constant pace, keeps a serious and nonsensical tone throughout the picture, smashing shattered shots and exciting rides with distinctive rip-snuffing breezes, and telling narrative blasts of blast of bloody violence. Delon's glamorous and charismatic presence adds to the next class in a soothing drive. This film also uses sterling bang-up casts, Richard Conte's witty contributions as wise mafia king Nicholas Gusta, Carly Gravini as supporting ladies Sandry, Marc Porel, Arzent as true Lord Arzent Domenico Maggia and Anton Diffring as merciless, calculates Capo Grunwald and Lino Troisi as a poisonous Rocco Cutitta gangster. Silvana Ippoliti's silk cinematography boasts several tuned lakes. Gianni Ferri's fun score will hit a broken spot. Erika Blanc and Rosalba Neri appear briefly in handy parts. But it is better that there is no filler that we are talking about, and we even get a decent, delicate, non-binding, naked nude. This surprising conclusion includes a medium and persistent rectangular extension to the gut. A solid and satisfying winner.
