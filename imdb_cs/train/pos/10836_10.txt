I thought this movie was fantastic. It was hilarious. Something reminded me of Spinal Tap. This is to be seen for every fan of the 70th Rock. (I hope mine and my friends are not like that in twenty years!) Bill Nighy gives great performance as a singer trying to recover that old spirit <br /> <br /> Stephen Rea fits perfectly into the film as a glue that tries to keep the band together but fails. <br /> <br /> If you love music and when you were in the band, this movie is definitely for you. You will not regret seeing this movie. I know not. Even my family thought it fun and it says something.
