Elmer Fudd laughed as he lounges in his light chair and reads a comic book where the dog is conveniently sleeping in front of the fireplace. Everything is quiet until the fleas freeze. (Blázon is dressed in a farmer's suit with a big somber and wears a strap called "A. Flea" on it). He exhales his binoculars and spots on the dog. (We see a big shot from dog ass and crazy whistles of excitement, screaming "T-Bone!" Then he sings: "Food is around the corner, food is around the corner!" This makes the story of this cute but dirty </ p> <p> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> </ p> <p> the most funny dog ​​I've ever seen in a cartoon Poor Pooh, under the threat of having to bathe because he does not react when stupid bleeding causes pain It's almost painful to watch how fleas he uses pikkas, jackhammers and the like on a dog. It's brutal!
