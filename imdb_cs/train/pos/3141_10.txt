Make sure the last season (# 8) was one of the worst times in every show I've ever met (I've never found dry spells that would last for the whole season). However, if you judge this competition last season, of course it will become inferior. This is a totally unfair assessment - because "To '70s Show" was a great and funny sitcom of the past, and how the people who lived there were not as different as we were in modern times. <br /> <br /> Well ... ignores Season 8. <br /> <br /> Topher Grace stars like Eric Forman, a horny geek teenager with eternal love for Don (Laura Prepon), a feminist girl next door. They play their friends, Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso), who give a fantastic performance in (almost) every episode. The best one is probably Fez, a student of a foreign currency, who is as mentally promiscuous as they get. Which country is it from? Try to come! For another dimension of entertainment, Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith are phenomenal as Eric's parents. Rupp, like Kitty, is both scary and sweet, like Mrs. Brady meets Marie Baron, while Smith's Red exists mainly to scare off everyone. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play very well opposite each other as Donna's parents, a chauvinist but sympathetic Bob and the airy Midge. Tommy Chong has an occasional appearance as Leo, a stoner who acts as a father character to Hyde. In addition to the anachronistic mistakes that appear quite often and the timeless lessons that come from time to time (and that "the 1970s" is an amazing show with amazing writing, direction and feelings that vibrate with every episode.) Everyone is all right.
