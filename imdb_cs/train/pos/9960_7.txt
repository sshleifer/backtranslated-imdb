I noticed that this film had come before he got into the theater and I did not have much hope. I thought it was another type of movie "You Sit", with some nice dance moves and horror gaming. I was in the theater and I decided between these and Spartan and chose it. To my surprise that acting was not bad at all and the movie was really good. The fact that he has a lower score than you did is totally absurd. Instead of listening to the rubbish, I recommend seeing the matinee that would show this film so you will not spend too much. I think you will be pleasantly surprised by how bad everyone is. As far as dance films are concerned, it is certainly one of the better ones that perform far better than many others. Watch the movie and judge yourself. Hopefully, ratings will increase after they appear on DVD, and more people will check the movie instead of reviewing it based on comments before the movie was released. <br /> <br /> The film is now approaching its correct rating. More than 1,000 people gave him a rating of 9, a bit too high, but at least he helped settle the ridiculous voices 1.
