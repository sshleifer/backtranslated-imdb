A recent tour of ENTERTAINMENT SUPPORT gave me the urge to watch many of the classic MGM musicals from the 1940s and 1950s. ANCHORS AWEIGH is definitely a smaller film than NA CITY. Tracks are not as good, neither chemistry between characters. But the film beautifully blends classic favorites such as Tchaikovsky. And the scene in the Hollywood bowl, when Sinatra and Kelly emerge from the forest above him at the top, and then running down the stairs while dozens of pianists playing the piano is the best scene in the movie, although the scene in which Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse is more famous. Classical music enthusiasts will undoubtedly identify music played by pianists. Sinatra, then loud, "I fell in love too easily," before making the apparitions she loves. Color is beautiful, Hollywood looks nice with mountains and no air pollution (Can you imagine Hollywood in the twenties, let alone in the mid-1940s?!) And piano music is absolutely famous. MGM certainly had the taste to create such lyrical moments.
