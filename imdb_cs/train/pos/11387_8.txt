The American in Paris is a great musical about an American painter who lives in Paris as an inspiration. He meets a rich woman who admires his paintings on the street and believes his work may be even more popular for the public, for example, in the museum. The Golden Globe nominated Gene Kelly as the artist Jerry Mulligan is just perfect for both singing and dancing. She also meets Leslie Caron's main girl, Lise Bouvier, who is dedicated to her best friend. She can not help her feelings for this girl, even after she finds out who she is employed with. Filled with a nice novel and wonderful song and dance it is a very good musical film. It can be a bit of a dance with your dance sequence, that is, Paris ballet in America, but it's a good happy ending. She received Oscars for best artistic direction - set of decorations, best cinematography, best costume design, best music, musical screenplay, best song, story and script and best picture and was nominated as Best Director for Vincent Minnelli and Best Film Editing, BAFTA for the best film from any source, and won the Golden Globe for Best Film / Music / Comedy and was nominated as Best Director for Vincent Millenni (Liza's father). Gene Kelly was number 66 on 100 movie stars and was number 15 on 100 years, 100 stars - men, "I Got Rhythm" was the number 32 on 100 years, 100 songs, the film was 9 on 100 years of musicals, that was 39 for 100 years, 100 passes, it was a number of 68 for 100 years, 100 movies and that was the number 58 on the 100 biggest musicals. Very good!
