I'm far from the Sylvester Stallone fan and I think the only time I really appreciated his looks was in the French movie Taxi 3, which is an almost nonexistent little role. And yet I have to admit that this movie was not really that bad, even though I was afraid of the worst. When Gabe (Stallone) fails to rescue a girlfriend of one of his friends and she falls to her death from a 4,000-meter-high mountain peak, she can not, of course, be forced to continue working as a mountain ranger. For almost a year, he has not made food in his reserve but before he returns. Soon after returning, they received an emergency call from a group of tourists who were trapped in a snowstorm. At least that's what they say. In fact, this is a group of robbers who crashed with their plane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases of full money from a flying government plane failed. Cases spread across the reserve and need help from professional climbers to load them ... <br /> <br /> This is not, of course, one of the most intelligent movies at all, but in his genre it's a nice one. I especially enjoyed John Lithgow as the evil master and leader of the gang of robbers. I know him best from the television series "3rd Rock from the Sun", but I also liked this movie. Overall, acting is fine, she has had many events and, of course, some unicorns, but she also offered very nice decorations. This film was filmed in a magnificent natural environment. I loved snowy mountains and valleys, mountain rivers, and forests ... Maybe that's why I give this movie a higher score than what I normally do for an action / adventure film of this kind. I give it 6.5 / 10. If you do not expect too much, it's a nice movie.
