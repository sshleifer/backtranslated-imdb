The only complaint I have about this adaptation is that it is sexed-up. Things that were just outlined in the novel are shown on the screen for some special reason. They thought the audience would be too stupid to understand if they did not seem to think so, right? Besides, it's very good. All the actors do wonderful works that bring their characters to life. The shallow women are worth seeing at least because Toby Stephens as Gilbert is the most northerly thing at all. If I were Helena, I would have forgotten that I was still married the moment I looked at her ... <br /> <br /> Some spoiler - The final scene is a funny reversal of what happened in the book.
