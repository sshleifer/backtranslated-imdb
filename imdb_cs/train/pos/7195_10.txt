I loved this rising Republic series! The story was one of the best I've ever seen! Even the hard, image quality was not the best, but OK. Fencing in this series is also a bit bad, but not terrible. They only had to do something more. As I said, the story is great! Just sit and wait for Don Del Oro! The theme music is great! He's the same guy who listened to the music for the Worta Disney Zorro version, which listened to the Fightin Legion. Costumes and buildings are very good. Zorro is really cool and they are also legionaries! I highly recommend this series. Buy! <br /> <br /> I love Reed Hadley playing Zorro! He's fun, smart and brave! Marking: 6.
