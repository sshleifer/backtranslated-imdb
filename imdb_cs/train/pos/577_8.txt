This is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. The shot is extraordinary, sometimes fascinating. He also won an Oscar for Best Picture and Worthwhile. I have a lot of movies in my movie collection and a few others I've seen next to them, and many of them are not beautifully or even as beautiful as those. <br /> <br /> It's a unique and overall great movie. Cast is amazing and does a great job of displaying their characters. We follow their fate of devotion and come to them very emotionally. On the way, we learn about ourselves and our lives. I think most of this film for what it represents, and how it represents. I cordially recommend it
