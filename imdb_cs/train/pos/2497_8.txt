Indeed, drug use, warehouse, "Matrix" bullet escort, a futuristic city with a mix of Asian races, and a lonely vampire - that's in the same movie - seem to be a story that could only be portrayed by a Japanese pop / rock star. And that's exactly what is "Moon Child" and more. While all of these elements together may sound the perfect subject for the B-movie campaign of the week, "Moon Child" pulls out with a few expected bumps and strokes along the way. <br /> <br /> The film has a distinct, definitely independent feeling to jump from one scene to another, not a smooth transition, but rather sporadic jumps and boundaries that watch the lives of the characters and hardly scratch on a real conspiracy. The film, however, does not make any justification, but instead transforms the story into friendship, love, trust and treachery, all the sugar coatings in the above-mentioned elements of the futuristic society, fighting against gangsters and vampires. HYDE, as the dark vampire "Kei" is excellent, gives depth to the character and overstates Gackt's overly keen act as Sho, the orphan who is spinning with Kei. Lee-Hom Wang also shines like a revengeful 'Son' who will become a friend with an adult Shoem. The story revolves around these characters and their widespread friends and families at different times in their lives, and how simple friendship can be so easily changed to sadness and betrayal. While it's sometimes unrealistic and special effects appear only as a show-off, the only thing the movie never does is to assume it's the extremely popular Asian singer it offers. Superstars as actors have their mistakes, and so do their characters. The film is seldom bored and ends where it should be, after a jump. "Moon Child" is rather pleasant, sometimes humorous and even very touching: definitely worth it!
