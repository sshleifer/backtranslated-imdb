Cor blimey. This movie really surprised me because it's a comedy. Billy Zane is awesome as a central character and everyone can play it enough to make the comedy natural and easy. Soundtrack is really good and sets are happy. I recommend that you watch this movie with a bunch of friends, several bottles of your choice alcohol, and be prepared to be amazed and very entertaining. This continues so perfectly from kitsch's works, such as Plan 9 From the universe it is in the true "B" film tradition. But what makes it more than that is the caliber of the people who were involved in the film. Ron Pearlman for example. I'm still giggling at the scene where Zane rises a few steps without any apparent reason almost in the ballet. All a little mad and the better.
