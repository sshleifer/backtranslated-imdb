This movie deserves better. It's great fun, it has some wonderful jokes and gaggos, some stuff for "Geeks" between us (and we know who we are) and the effects are really effective. Watching Paul Reubens, the winner of Oscar winners, is worth standing alone. I have never read a comic series before I saw the movie but since then. how good they are, I still recommend MM. (Although Flaming Carrot had a character like he was great), Greg Kinnear is, well ... amazing as Captain Amazing and no one else could be The Shoveller except William H. Macy My favorite movie in the movie? "We have a blind day with Destiny and it looks like she has ordered a lobster." Watch this movie. BUY this movie! It's just $ 5 and some changes on local Wal-Mart. Thank you. You really will. Oh, and Mrs. Garafolo is in it. This in itself gives attention
