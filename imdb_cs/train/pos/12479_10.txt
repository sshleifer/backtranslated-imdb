What are the chances of a "Mermaid Silk Balloon" from Yuba City, Ca. (November 8, 1993) and landing 4 days later (on November 12) at MERMAID, Prince Edward Island, Canada (about 4000 miles). That's a great movie. It is based on a true story. This film helps not only children to cope with losses, but also older people. I hope everyone will enjoy it !!! Rhonda
