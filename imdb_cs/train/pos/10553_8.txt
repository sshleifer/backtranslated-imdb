... than this ;-) What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams were collaborating on one film? This movie starts with a touch of Brazil ... when at some point the story moves directly into the area at dusk ... it does nothing new, but nothing ... and nothing is great fun! When Dave and Andrew start exploring their new environment, is the movie really nice ... bouncing head? so ... yes ;-) <br /> <br /> ... this movie was the biggest surprise at this year's FantasyFilmFest ... As in Cube and Cypher Natali he gave a minimalistic, weird, but very strange look, thanks which is hard to find the place of the story or its time ... in some way timeless ...
