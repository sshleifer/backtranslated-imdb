Oh, real memories. At that time I lived in the Netherlands and every Sunday night, and later on Tuesday I looked at him eagerly. I saw it in 14-16 years. Very good for my English (at that time for schools), as Dutch TV provides subtitles for other languages ​​except today's children. So you'd hear your original voices and tongue. - The best series was the first three, and then after the third series, the great character of the Nazi Von Gelb, who was such a terrible enemy (I do not think he actually caught him), always escaped, so the next story revealed the space to get back because it was evident that the series was also distributed to Germany, and the Nazi enemy would not go very well! It's bad because Geoffrey Toone did such a wonderful convincing job of portraying an intelligent Nazi aristocrat who had this constant obsession to avenge England. the real pleasure of seeing this kind of high-quality performance in the youth series but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good counterpart and the youngsters were so normal I was very faithful at the time and as a child I could imagine being a part of these young people who were at that time four years older than I. It was a great excitement for me or a series that in my memory of those times acted as the special exhibition "traps." I hope to publish high-quality DVD series, which would be great. Even the bad copies around are still nice to watch. The later series was not so good, they were watering and were not as fun as the first three. Hopefully they will find other Von Gelb series that will be featured on DVD. Greetings from Canada.
