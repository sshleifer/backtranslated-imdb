The show is really fun. Nice motive. Jokes and one pad are really good. With little over-tuning, it can become a very popular show. The only main negative point of this show is the cast. David Spade does a great job like Russell, Megyn Price has a good job. But who the hell shot Patrick Warburton, Oliver Hudson, and Biance Kajlich. Technically, Russell and Jeff are the main show celebrities that make viewers want to watch the show. Russell is a playboy and Jeff is a sort of frustrated family man, a relationship wiz ... with experience of all the problems of a married couple in a relationship. <br /> <br /> Patrick Warburton - He's doing a terrible job like Jeff, he's not suitable for this role. It's like a robot, literally in his dialog delivery there is no punch. <br /> <br /> Cast is really very important for viewers to enjoy it. Poor acting will surely have a show off the hill ...
