I first saw this movie about 20 years ago and never forgot it. It's beautifully shot and the story keeps one riveted all the time. It's hard to believe that it happened in 1946, because the story is still fresh today and you really think. I'm not too familiar with film technology, but the special effects in this movie are amazing when it happened. In addition, acting is excellent and the use of English and American actors is quite stunning. I recently bought a DVD, so now I can watch whenever I like it. I highly recommend to anyone interested in post-war British films to watch.
