Steven Spielberg (24) has already recorded two great 1971 episodes titled "The Psychiatrist," starring Roy Thinnes. One episode was about a 12-year-old boy who felt emotionally concerned, and the other was a lively young man (Clu Gulager at his best) who died of cancer. Both episodes were amazing, visually unlike anything else on television and emotionally complex and adult. The creators of the "psychiatrist" were Richard Levinson and William Link who created the "Columbo" and also produced their first season. Peter Falk insisted first-line experienced television directors for the first season of "Columbo" like Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smight. But Falk agreed with Spielberg after watching part of Clu Gulagher's episode "The Psychiatrist". Spielberg says on the DVD "Duel" that he loved Steven Bochca's "Murder by the Book" story of Levinson / Link) and tried to make production look like a million dollars, even though he thought he had a lot less money with it. <br /> <br /> This episode, "Columbo", is far more stylish and makes better use of soundtrack and background music than almost any other episode of "Columbo", although the series has always been used by top directors. Spielberg can keep the great Falk and Cassidy to get too crowded, but both actors are still a lot of fun. Spielberg also gets great support from Martin Milner, Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby. All performances have freshness and vitality about them. The only episode of "Columbo," which was approaching being so well-directed, is "By Dawn's Early Light" with Patrick McGoohan (directed by Harvey Hart). I think two episodes of "Psychiatrist" and this episode "Columbo" suggest that Spielberg was not as technically developed as a director. He was great from the beginning. In fight!" DVD comment 1962 episode guest star Albert Salmi, Robert Altman says the episode was quite as good as he ever received as a director. Perhaps the same applies to Spielberg.
