Absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time. I've seen it at least a hundred times, and I can not walk without crying. I'm going to look at Celie and Nettie or Shugh and Father and not feel your eyes get foggy. Whoopie Goldberg should have one award for amazing display. And for a person who said you can not love a movie if you love a book, wrong! I'm a witness.
