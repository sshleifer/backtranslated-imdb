Extremely amusing rain, which takes place in the 1930s, is the spin on the classic Cliffhanger series, as well as the "Raiders of the Lost Ark", at low budgets and many camps by director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes promise a liberal amount of gothic art nuveau, two decades ago Batman. He plays Ron Ely (Tarzan) as a perfectly occupied hero and gorgeous Pamela Hensley as the local Latin Mona, who is our hero on the golden hunt in the non-existent Hidalgo country of Latin America. The best line, our hero Mona, holds her with her fist on her chin as well as you expect her to be soft with her and embrace her: "Mona, you're a brick!" Paul Wexler ham and blackhat cheese, Captain Seas is an absolute joy. Expect a bit of "Raiders ..", a dash of "Batman", a little "lost world", a bit of "lost horizons" and a lot of campiness and you will have the right one. Watch out for the cult favorite Michael Berryman as a watchman and enjoy the camping use of patriotic music by John Philip Sousa. The main candidate for the DVD is definitely overdue. An unforgettable experience for the whole family. 9/10
