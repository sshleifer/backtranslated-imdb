I took my 10-year-old daughter to see Nancy Drew over the weekend and found out that I had fun. First it was clean and I think of my standards. Most of the movies for children today are full of crude toiletry humor and rough jokes that cause cheap laughter from the preschool crowd. Nancy Drew, however, is smarter and humor is subtle and smart. Emma Roberts plays the lead role with a refreshing life, courteous and polite, without becoming annoying. Unlike The Brady Bunch, where the anachronistic characters are encouraging and ridiculed, Nancy's style is treated with respect and dignity. It's a great moment when LA "stylishly conscious" girls with their Paris Hilton clothes refuse the boutique owner, while Nancy, in her penny moccasins and homemade Butterick pattern dress, is accepted. This film avoids the need we want to enlighten - this-healthy girl who has taken so many Hollywood movies. Nancy remains faithful to herself and her values ​​in its entirety. The secret is sometimes tight enough to get involved. There were several exciting moments when my daughter nervously grabbed my arm, but there were no free shock scenes. Everything is based on tension and mood and there is plenty of fun. Supportive casting is good, especially Marshall Bell as a creepy manager. There are some great cameras from Eddie Jemison, Chris Kattan and Bruce Willis and many moments that adults smile. This movie deserves better ratings than some have given. Not only was I glad I was not attracted to another computer animated film where animals are moving and moving around, but I also enjoyed it. If I were without a child, I would still enjoy the movie. This is one DVD that will have my daughter's name under the Christmas tree.
