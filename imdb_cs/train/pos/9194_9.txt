I first met this show when I was in Japan for six months last year. I found it on the Internet when I was looking for subtitle dramas to help me with my Japanese. My host mother warned me to stay away from her because she thought it was weird, but I found it wonderful! Koyuki showed such contradictory characters, and Matsujun's spirit made my day every time I tune! I first saw him on "Hana Yori Dango", but I liked him much better in this! Although the characters are interesting and well developed, I was disappointed to see that they did not change too much in the show. Their relationship grew, but not really. Still, the fun time was over (even for Fukushima!).
