In my opinion, it will remain one of Superman's top performances on television, as well as one of the most loyal comic books. 70s / 80s and Superman comic series "reboot" since 1986 ("Man of Steel", "Superman Vol 2", "Action Comics", "Adventures of Superman", etc.). The final scores and titles were screened, based on John Williams' scores from the films, updated for the Saturday morning action series. Marv Wolfman, one of the main contributors to rebooting comics (writer "Adventures of Superman"), was the perfect choice for engaging in this animated series. Overall, the show had a more mature feel, while still very friendly. <br /> <br /> Superman was presented as credible, powerful and iconic. His recurring nemesis was Lex Luthor in his megalomaniac / CEO incarnation. Daily Planet characters Lois, Jimmy and Perry were portrayed well. One of my favorite performances was Wonder Woman and the story spun around her home island of Themyscira ("Paradise Island"). Both her suggestion and her mother Hippolyte were in line with the similarly rebooted Wonder Woman series of comic books of that time, and it seemed that even the same animated series could have been developed for it, <br /> One thing that is hard to believe , is that it was not released on DVD / Blu-ray! He deserves it.
