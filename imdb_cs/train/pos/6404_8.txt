When I watched this movie and began to see how its characters grew, I felt it would be an excellent picture. When you get this feeling and the film really meets expectations, experience is rare. During this movie I felt that kind of feeling. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played rivets and amazingly strong parts that were both Oscar worthy. The support cast was as strong as the winning basis for image growth. I can say without hesitation, look at this movie does not disappoint.
