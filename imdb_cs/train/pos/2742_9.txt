Richard Brooks A great 1967 novel by Truman Capote in COLD BLOOD is a perfect accompaniment to the Oscar Philip Seymour Hoffman's winning performance in 2005 CAPOTE. They really play well together (try them on separate nights). It's unusual to find movies that are made on average for 38 years to be so good. These two really improve each other. Although different actors play the role of Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, both pieces fit well. Only part of the writer (played by Paul Stewart) in Brooks is weaker because they give him a name other than Capote. I suggest that I first watch CAPOTE, followed by IN COLD BLOOD. It makes a great experience!
