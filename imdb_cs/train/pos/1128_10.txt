Although part of Homer's epic "Troy" with Brad Pitt was once again being talked about, it was fun, "Iphigenia" with glowing bloody Irene Pappas is breathtaking. Developing in a natural environment with Greek actors who speak their own language brings such authenticity. Random encounters with this film on one of DirecTV's many film channels have made me feel fascinated despite my concentration problems. There is no glitter or "bling" in this movie, just a wonderfully rich tale of impeccable actors, so a real person feels he's listening to a real family in turbulence. I think even Homer, if he really existed, would be proud of what he says. JLH
