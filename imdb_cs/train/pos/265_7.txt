A series of random, seemingly insignificant thefts in her sisters' pension were very disturbed by Mrs. Lemon. Ring, bulb, backpack, lighter, stethoscope, shoes? it seems that none of them is neither rhyme nor reason. Miss Lemon asks her employer, the great Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, to look at this matter. But what Poirot sees is something far more ominous than Miss Lemon could imagine. And Poirot's fears are confirmed when one of the students lives in a boarding house if found to be murdered. It's up to Poirot to bring the murderer to justice. <br /> <br /> Hickory Dickory Dock is solid, but not spectacular, entering the long line of Poirot. I appreciate how faithful the scenario is to the original story of Agatha Christie. I realize that certain freedoms must be taken, but I still appreciate that effort. Are the main points of secrecy all there? petty thefts, guest houses, students, a torn backpack, and, of course, the ability of Poirot to see something happening ominously before it really happens. With a few exceptions, students are almost the same as I introduced them. Among the group include Damian Lewis and Jessica Lloyd. As a sinner I have always enjoyed by Poirot David Suchet, I get a real break from the episodes with Inspector Japp Phillip Jackson and Miss Lemon Paulina Moran. This episode is a real mood because Miss Lemon gains more time on the screen than usual. Finally, I was enjoying an ever-present mouse as an observer in the hostel. It's a fun little game on the title of Hickory Dickory Dock. I realized that when watching Hickory Dickory's dock, how great is the influence of Agatha Christie's work on highly stylized Italian mysterious films or Gialli in the 1960s and 1970s. Take the murder of Mrs. Nicoletis as an example. If you encountered the graphic nature of the scene, you should have something from the early 70's Giallo. In fact, the whole site of Hickory Dickory Dock could be used in Giallo. It's just intricate and interesting to work.
