The very first movie that scared me to death. I caught it when my older brother was looking at me (r.i.p.). It was on black and white television and not a really good picture, but it caught me. Shortly afterwards, my people bought a color kit, and as a lucky one, the Million Dollar movie would show one Sunday. I forgot most of the conspiracy, but it did not take long to catch ... so I was frightened that I had a lot of sleep that night! I mean, it was just a movie, but it was about a creature that not only came from the universe, but you did not hear it or even saw it ... and when it did, it was too late. Even now, all the time it's still shaking my spine. The true classic and even better classic I've seen scared the pants of the new generation! <br /> <br /> Long live The Blob!
