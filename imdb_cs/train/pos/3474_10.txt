This film is worth seeing for himself as an excellent portrait of John Lennon. It does not matter that Harris does not like Lennon completely; his ways, expressions, attitude, accent and attitude are pure Lennon. Best scene: Lennon at the local cafe sparring verbally with a stuttering fan whether Paul McCartney & Wings "Silly Love Songs" is good # 1 in America.
