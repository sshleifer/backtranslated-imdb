After her Oscar nomination in "Secrets and lies", Brenda Blethyn played in an equally great "Saving Grace". And let me tell you this is not the kind of movie you find everyday. After her husband commits suicide, Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) finds out that his irresponsible financial decision has left her. massive debt. Fortunately, he finds a way to meet the goals: marijuana. That's right, Grace is starting to cultivate her. Every aspect of this film was very effective; there is no boring moment in it. And I certainly did not see the final scene coming! But anyway, you have to see this movie. You can just feel a little more festive when you see it. If nothing else, it can act as a good lesson on knowledge of finance. Of course, there is much more than that!
