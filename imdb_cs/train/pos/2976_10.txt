For comedy it has a decent and inventive plot and comic timing Trey Parker and Matt Stone is perfect. There are dozens of fun moments to this fantastic movie. I especially like the number of colors and the way the scenes of the sports arena meet. Robert Stacks Unsolved Mysteries spoof is also very fun.
