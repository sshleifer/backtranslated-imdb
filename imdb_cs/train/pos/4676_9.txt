I found this film provocative and its ambiguity refreshing in the world of fast-moving movies where we are manipulated with the love of a "good guy" and I hate the "bad guy." Scott Cohen, a very good TV actor, is doing a great job in showing a family black sheep / lost child trying to get his father's love and respect, as well as his widowed sister-in-law, with whom History clearly has. Judd Hirsch plays against his usual good guy like a father who triangulated his sons and is now left with the one he always refused. When I saw it at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was amazed by the beautiful way that sawdust was used to portray the family tradition, as the director explains. It is a proper successor to the classic "ordinary people". I just realized that this is Judd Hirsch!
