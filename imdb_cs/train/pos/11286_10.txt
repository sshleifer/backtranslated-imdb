I recommend watching this movie with your significant other if you are planning a romantic evening with him. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so warm that it could blur the screen. After the original film, we begin to see Tarzan and Jane adjust to the jungle and to each other. Jane's modest jungle and Tarzan's protest, when Jane is interested in her visitors, illuminates that they are not just romantic but also sexually in love. The only imagination can add to the constant touches and love between Tarzan & Jane telling how much Jane teaches Tarzan about love emotionally, romantically and sexually. And the student Jane not only embraces but also thrives with his untapped sexuality. <br /> <br /> The skin show in this movie is out of charts. Besides Jane's two-part sexy midriff, legs and hip costume, he also has underwater swimming with Tarzan. (although it is not O'Sullivan, but Olympic Fighters Josephine McKim, who doubles in this scene) Weissmuller also reveals a huge body and a perfect calf in his crate. The ladies will be pleased when Weissmuller emerges from the water after his long struggle with a huge crocodile and sounds his ringing - with his water-soaked belt that practically falls off his hips. It is a pity that the excessively protective censors have diminished the adult character of the Tarzan films after this entry. Although Weissmuller Tarzan's films would still prosper in the coming years, they would rarely approach the sexual appeal of this film.
