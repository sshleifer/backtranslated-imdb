The most amazing, spiritually uplifting film about the restoration of the Gospel. Far better than any other film or film about restoration yet. If you have not seen it, go to Salt Lake and see it now. You will not regret! You really have a sense of what the first saints have had to fight, and give there the full and complete faith there of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Finally, you will get some understanding of the things the prophet had to fight and the persecution he faced with people. If you have any questions about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and our modest beginnings, just read this movie, it will be complete and meaningful.
