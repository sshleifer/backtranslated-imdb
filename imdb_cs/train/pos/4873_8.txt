For those of you who are not aware of the subject that Kusturica is intermittently exploring in his films - the Western attack on traditional Serbian values ​​- you will not be able to understand his narrative. This contiguous theme, expressed through a fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle, is one that Kusturica chose to mandate. From his fantastic work and Magnum Opus' Underground, Kusturica films' Black Cat White ',' Life is a Miracle ', and recently with' Promise Me To ', his slapstick, carnival style underlines the' westernisation 'of Balkan culture, its ambivalent advent an attack on the traditional idiom. In the case of "Promise Me This", the paradox of the urban (urban) and village (traditional idiom) space contrasts. The world of the city reflects Western attributes that capture space and time; organized crime, sexual exploitation, disturbed sense of identity, and vehement ignorance of traditional values ​​- as expressed against the young boy - the villager. The end of the film further illustrates this concept because we see funeral mass and a one-way wedding. They are on a collision; The wedding, which represents the rescue line and pulse of a village, that is, traditional values, is about to conquer with funeral mourners, an example of the death of tradition in this context. But Kusturica greatly examines this subject through its unique, stylistic singularity. With his blatant and flashy style serving as a portrait vehicle.
