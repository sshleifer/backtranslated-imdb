This movie is finally on DVD in Italy (completely restored). I have seen this film so many times, and nowadays (2003), when Italy suffers again with some brainwashing dictatorship (or the USA), I find it real. I'm glad they are climaxed like the one who plays Mastroianni in this movie, which can sing from the melody; maybe they can teach Sophie Lorens of this world how to be strong and fight to be recognized as human beings. Back to the movie: As most people mentioned here, acting is amazing, but the sound background is stunning. I have to assume that something will happen if you do not understand the Italian language, but I can assure you that the shot of machismo, the distortion of reality in this ever-present radio-chronicle of Hitler's visit to Rome can really make you glitter! <br /> <br /> Masterpiece! <br /> <br />
