I think it's time, this movie was amazing ... and yes, if you have no desire to become a Christian, then why bother watching it. I saw this movie after I was already saved and found to be very moving. Now I see that these films have taken on a different level and have created a series of Left Behind ... they have a close comparison and certainly are more modern to appeal to people. I think that in order to really judge this movie you should see him, are in series 3 or 4, if I'm not mistaken ... do not use our comments to judge, look at the movie alone! ! God will bless you if you are watching them.
