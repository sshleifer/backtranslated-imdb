Finally, I made a DVD on request to find films that are not available in the store. I chose The Souler Opposite, because I like Christopher Meloni, as well as small, often ignored movies. This is such a cure! Meloni has such a spell in this area. It's an easy dovetail that you see only as its alter ego Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this film, Meloni is, by the way, an unconnected mediator who interferes with sliding in many ways just to find the way to happiness in an unexpected person. The relationship between Barry (Meloni) and the nature of Tim Busfield is realistic and not finished. I have not seen Busfield since I was 30 years old and I was watching it fun. But it was Chris's movie. I have become such a fan of the girl again. <br /> <br /> At the beginning it's a bit slow, I confess. I thought some of the "flashbacks" could be downgraded. Overall, this film will please you - male or female - because it has a sincere, refreshing look at today's relationships.
