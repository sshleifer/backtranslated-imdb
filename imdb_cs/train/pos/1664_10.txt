I thought this movie was amazing, with extraordinary performances by Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi). Cervi portrays Artemisia so exquisitely, with preliminary but intimate manners, her hands mapping the idea before, instead. The passion that Artemisie gives to her art is only magnificent to observe. Although not every character was obviously beautiful, the film became more realistic because the facial hair and clothing were perfect for that time. <br /> <br /> Overall, I thought this movie was fantastic.
