It's a wonderful and unexpected film. You start by watching a young man who hopes to get into a qualifying football game between Bahrain and Iran. If they win Iran, they will get to the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The problem is that a young person is a girl and girls (or women on that) are not allowed into soccer matches "to sit with men". What follows is a wonderful comedy, she played with a perfect skill with a small cast of the ensemble. The film explores the absurdity of restricting the freedom of women (and thus young soldiers who have to detain them). There are some excellent sets of pieces, not least when one of the girls has to go to the toilet and of course the stadium has no toilet for women. Working with the camera is the easiest and in some respects this story could be explained as a scene. Yet it is a small scale that gives the film its bite. Great cinema? No, probably not; great entertainment - of course.
