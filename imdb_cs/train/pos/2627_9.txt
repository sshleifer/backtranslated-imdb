Ultimately, Timon and Pumbaa in their own film ... "Lion King 1 1/2: Hakuna Matata" is an unwavering new take on the classic story. Which classic story do you ask? Why, of course, "The Lion King!" Yes, if there's one thing Disney never gets, it's narcissism. But that does not mean that this is not a good movie. Basically, it is the "Lion King" event, as reported in Timon and Pumbaa. And because of that you will have to know the story of the "Lion King" to see where they come from. Anyway, on one level, I watched this and thought "Oh, my God, it's so chrome ..." and on the next level I had the ball. Much of humor is predictable - I think that when Pumbaa makes two beds, big for himself and small for Timon, in the first nanosecond we all know that Timon will have a big one. But that does not make it cheerful, which, IMO, is "Hakuna Matata" in a nutshell. It's not what's going on, it's so. <br /> <br /> And notice: there are also some funny farty. Seriously, did you expect anything else in the movie where Pumbaa will be in the center? But since they are fictitious jokes, they are especially good and should satisfy even the most well-known experts. Returning voice talent is great. I am a bit surprised that some actors were willing to come back, most of them having only two or three lines (if they are lucky). Whoopi Goldberg is especially welcome. <br /> <br /> Music is also great. From "Digga Tunnah" at the beginning of "That's All I Need", adaptation of "Warthog Rhapsody" (a song cut off from 'The Lion King' and sincerely improved in this incarnation), music leaves me nothing to complain about . <br /> <br /> Finally, Timon and Pumbaa are awesome characters, and while it can be argued that 'Hakuna Matata' is just an excuse to see them in a variety of fun and varied compromise situations then it will be. It's rare to find characters that you just want to spend time on. <br /> <br /> I started the sound scary? Either way, 'The Lion King 1 1/2' is great if you've seen The Lion King too many times. Especially when you were thinking right now, "Do not be stupid, too many times it's not such a thing as" The Lion King "!"
