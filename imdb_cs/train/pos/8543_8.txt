This was one of those movies I probably never picked out of the shelf but one day I came to the IFC and I said - Eric Stolz, William Forsythe ... why not? If I changed the channel, I would really miss a treasure. <br /> <br /> The subject is depressing - the young author paralyzed the crash in a climbing rehabilitation center. It would be so easy and tempting to handle manipulative tears. But that did not happen because it was written by Neal Jimenez after he was unhappily paralyzed. No Hollywood Happiness Here. All patients in the ward come from a very different environment, but they share the sense of helplessness that they are on the mercy of others. Stolz is very good as a "lone wolf", forcing himself to be embarrassing to his girlfriend (Helen Hunt); Wesley Snipes is fine as a former ladies man whose family is falling apart; but William Forsythe takes the cake as a tough guy who is determined to make someone pay for his independence. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie.
