What would happen if a depressing policeman worked with a shortening on probation? There can be a lot of fun ... This film has set the benchmark in the action / comedy genre of the Argentine film. Dearable characters, the likely story and the tempo that has some excitement among laughter. I recommended it for fun. Peretti and Luque join the fight against a cold and daring enemy at a time when it's hard to trust someone. This movie will surprise you, on the other hand, the "Analyze me" coin, but not the same, without being dependent. And if you want to know Bs.AS where there are few scenes from the city center and downtown.
