When I was a child, I've seen it many times and I remember the song Happy Cat quite often. All the songs are great and really unforgettable, unlike many children's musicals where songs are simply blocked without a real reason. Scenes and costumes are rich and acting is very well done, which is not surprising given the cast. Christopher Walken is very cat and does not need silly make-up or cat costume for the viewer to believe that the cat is transformed into a human. And Jason Connery is as cute as the shy and unpleasant miller's son, Corin, who falls in love with the beautiful and daring Princess Vera. This is a truly entertaining, entertaining, feature-length movie where, unlike most fairy-tales, characters are celebrating. Some of my favorite parts are when a kitten makes Corin pretend to drown; on the ball when everyone starts dancing dancing because it's "all fury abroad"; when Walken is in the kitchen, he's dancing on the table (he's a pretty good dancer!); and when Vera tells Corina everything she did when she was young, like she pretended to be a miller's daughter. I would recommend this film to children and parents who love spells and fairy tales. And in fact it's a movie that you can watch together because it does not lift adults into the wall.
