Of the modern sensitivity, it is sometimes difficult to watch older movies. It's annoying to watch the stereotyped library of the migration library, which has to take glasses and become nice and silly to get men. Especially such a shallow and disparate person. It is, of course, a player (I do not trust him to stay with her), who does not want to settle down, just looks at silly attractive women and always calls them "baby" (ick!). Even after she has completely changed her appearance and her life for him, she goes to her after being (allegedly) rejected by another woman and learning that Connie has spent all her money and renovated the ship for him. I wanted him to stand up to him, not search for him! His sudden transformations in a few minutes were totally unrealistic and they did not work for me. Besides, I liked the movie. How do you like sailors dancing together? (You can say that they were from San Francisco .... D) The "test" dance was great and he watched Ginger Rogers deliberately fall in and out of the "right steps" he was great. The last dance scene "Face the Music" with beautiful costumes and art deco sets was beautiful. And I really liked "We have seen the sea" (though they used it several times too many times, as if they realized it was their best song). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plot was a bit faint, like most of the musicals (IMO) - and the songs were fine, but the dance is worth watching the movie. I wish they could show some of San Francisco's pictures because it was a movie that was probably set up. It is also strange to see such a light marine film with the knowledge of what Hitler does at the time. I have to try to stop all the knowledge to dive into the fantasy land created.
