The first thing I thought after watching Mystery Men was how could this movie be so unpopular? I found this movie so adorable and entertaining that it is like a bomb that is out of the way. Well, I hope it will become a culture in the future and you can count me among the fans. <br /> <br /> Simply put, and without doing too much off, the movie makes comic books for "Princess Bride" for fairy tales and "Who Roger Rabbit?" for classic cartoons. This should give a more accurate idea of ​​the tone of the film than the marketing committee he unfortunately signed (that's one of those cases like "Iron Giant," where the studio had no idea what he had on his hands). Rent it next time when you're in the mood for something extraordinary. You will not be BeeGees listening in the same light.
