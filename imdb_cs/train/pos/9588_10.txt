When Paris Burning appeared, I totally rejected it. I did not want to go into the Madonna and fight the phenomenon. I thought it would be camping and stupidity. How bad I was about this movie. I watched when the movie was ten years old and I fled and bought it. He took me back to time and place of fun and excitement. I felt like I personally knew all the characters. The 1980s were spectacular and the film captured the essence of gay culture. What a wonderful job! I went to the internet to find out what some of the original cast members were doing, but I was not able to find all of them. If anyone has any information about one of the cast members, let me know. <br /> <br /> I hope they will do another document. I'M LOVING YOU
