Watch on the Rhine began as a Broadway play by Lillian Hellman who wrote the film and saw it opened on Broadway at a time when the Soviet Union was still bound by Nazi Germany by the infamous Neagression Pact signed in August 1939. So much for Hellman repeated the communist party line, the line did not change until a few months later. Lillian was in fact months before his time with this work. The Rhineland Watch game ran from April 1941 to February 1942 for 378 shows and five players came from Broadway to play their role as Frank Yilson Eric Roberts as the youngest son, Lucile Watson as a family mate and the most important villain, George Coulouris and Paul Lukas. <br /> <br /> In 1943, Lukas won a valuable hat-trick for the Oscars, Golden Globe, and New York film critics for Best Actor. Probably, if the Tony Awards existed, it would also win. Oskar is even more remarkable when considering Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca, Gary Cooper in The For The Bell Tolls, Mickey Rooney in the Human Comedy, and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie. Each of his competitors was a bigger movie than he was. Luke's nomination is usually such as the academy gives round the field. Jack Warner knew this was why Mady Christians did not repeat her Broadway part, and the role of Luke's wife was given to Bette Davis. Davis did not participate because it was a particularly good role for her, but because she believed in the picture and wanted to be associated with it. It's the same reason why the Man who came to dinner did a much lighter game than that. Davis is the daughter of the late US Supreme Court, who married a German citizen in Weimar. After long years of hardship on the European continent, Davis Luke and their three children come to America, which has not yet entered the European War. They are welcomed by Luciol Watson, who is naturally excited about meeting grandchildren. <br /> <br /> In the summer there are some other guests, Geraldina Fitzgerald and her husband who is also from Europe, a Romanian diplomat and aristocrat George Coulouris. Coulouris is a murderer and lost escape, and he smells the opportunity to act twice when he suspects Luke's anti-fascist background. <br /> <br /> His suspicions are quite right, that's why the family of the vagabonds that have happened. Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was injured here. His health was no longer the same. His family loyal to him in any decision they make. These decisions concern all other members of the cast. <br /> <br /> Adding to the Broadway game, including some beautiful fascist creatures, was Dashiell Hammett, who was an important Lillian Hellman. Coulouris playing cards at the German Embassy were Hammett's production with such nasty types as Henry Daniell, Kurt Katch, Clyde Fillmore, Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders. <br /> <br /> Coulouris is really one of the most versatile characters to view as no Runmanian account count. It was a metaphor for her own country, who was marching around the Nazis with mood, then refusing them, without losing sight of Stalingrad. In 1943, Lucile Watson was featured as Best Actress Actress, but lost to Katina Paxina for whom she bells. Dashiell Hammett was nominated for the best adapted script and the film itself was lost for the best picture with another anti-fascist classic Casablanca. <br /> <br /> Even though it is fixed in these specific times, Watch On The Rhine still contains a huge anti-fascist message that counts repeatedly.
