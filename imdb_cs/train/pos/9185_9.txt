DOUBLE EXPOSURE was a great surprise. It features excellent acting (especially from underestimated Callan), fine cinematography and an impressive story. In other words, it's one of the best horror efforts to come out of the eighties. Callan plays a fashion photographer who experiences dreams of murdering his models when he meets his psychologically unstable brother (who accidentally misses his hand and foot). When the Callan models combine to kill, they actually turn away, the photographer begins to doubt his own mental well-being ... but there is more than the picture he sees. This movie has never received praise deserves. Most critics and filmmakers put it in the hordes of Slasher films that are released at the same time, but they stand high above most of that ugly amount. It's smart and unique, which is not something that can be said about most films of this genre, but it is also passionately created and performed. DOUBLE EXPOSURE is a precious stone of its kind.
