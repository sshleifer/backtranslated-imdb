I saw this movie today and I must say it was much better than I expected it would be about a few hours before I saw it. Personally, I had some prejudices about his tongue, but he completely changed my idea. In most cases, the film was surprisingly good with acting and acting. It was a story about a boy who had a dream and who did everything to get it. That really touched me and it made me feel like a movie based on a true story. The new school, the psycho director and the young boy who get to know the new teacher are a little different than others and fight for things, even if it does not seem to work. It turned out how few things can cause huge changes in many things, and what difference can sometimes cause difficult situations. I also think that the selection of actors has done well. It was like feeling like watching an episode as an outsider when it happened. Before I blushed the movie, I must admit that there are some things and situations that did not look and were not realistic ... like the one where the school principal beat Frity aka. Martin before class, at the end of the movie. He was really bad, but the only thing he did was another blood that came from his nose when he compared it to the first slaughter at the beginning when Frits got some stitches ... and I think every movie has its own mistakes. I have to say that if I ever find this DVD somewhere in the store, it's a certainty that I'll take it with me.
