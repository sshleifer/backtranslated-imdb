Every time I look at this movie, I'm more impressed with the whole production. Finally, I concluded that it was the best romantic comedy ever to have happened. Everyone involved is perfect; script, acting, direction, set and edits. While James Stewart can always rely on good performance, and supporting acting is spectacular, it's Margaret Sullavan, who reveals what an underestimated actress. Her tragic personal life gives meaning to her features as an artist, where comedy acting skills can not easily be achieved. Lubitsch managed to get the best, and of course he did the best. See the number of scenes that were made in one place - breathtaking.
