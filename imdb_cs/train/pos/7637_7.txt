Actually, I like this movie, even though I like James Belushi very much. In this movie you can actually see some big names on the rise, namely Linda Hamilton and Courteney Cox; Caine is, of course, big. The story in this movie is simple; as well as a sliding door movie. However it was conscientiously stated and I like comedy moments in it. I tried to revive my important moments in life, such as What if I chose a girl for a movie and not for another, etc. It tells us that the people around us could have different roles in our lives, the minutes should change. It also reminds us to be careful what we want. Life is not always as good on the other side as we think; Perhaps what we have now is the best for us, all weigh.
