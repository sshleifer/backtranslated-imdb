I believe this is the most powerful film ever made by HBO Pictures. This movie was to be launched in theaters for the public to be on the big screen. It's available on a video, so make sure you look at it and check it out. Chris Gerolmo has done a great job with direction and script. The performance by Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland and Jeffery DeMunn is flawless. Masterpiece of this genre.
