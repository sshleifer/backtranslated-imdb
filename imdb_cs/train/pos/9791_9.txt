I will not let anything tell the story of this film's plot than to say that it is starting with the return of a young blind woman to Israel, whose closest friend and companion committed suicide. It develops as a detective story when a blind woman tries to find out why her boyfriend has ended his life. When it follows its investigation and the information accumulates, it leads inexorably to the devastating conclusion. The film is professionally related, and acting, especially Talia Sharon as Ya'ara, a blind woman, is excellent. Israeli film is definitely of age and is now fully competitive with other foreign films, although few have found a large audience in the US.
