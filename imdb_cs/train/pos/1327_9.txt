How tasty my little Frenchman is telling a story that is alternately sad, terrifying and life-giving. It ends with the brutal finale you've learned that must happen, though you were hoping - maybe even beleiving - it would not. <br /> <br /> The strongest is the greatest power of the movie: with your emotions and expectations, then a bomb will fire you. I saw it in the movie theory class at USC in the mid-1990s. It's not easy to find, but it's definitely worth chasing.
