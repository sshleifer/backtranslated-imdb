Some actresses were a little suspicious. I recall that confusion Alexander Walker (Evening Standard, OK, now dead) began to guess about this film that it was a disgrace that portrays NI Protestants as murderers. Now, with all NI protests, this film was loosely based on Shankill's butchers (who were loyal) who roamed in Belfast in the 1970s. Believe me, they were not called butchers for nothing. my main moanings about this movie is that it does not show any ray of light or hope, it's all scary and grumpy, I think the little girl had to die at the end. Maybe it sounds frantic, but it might take a moment that not all Prodi's are bad or totally good.
