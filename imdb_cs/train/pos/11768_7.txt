This film surprised me surprisingly. From the box, I thought it was an action thriller, but it was too funny to be a thriller, though it was somewhat exciting. There are plenty of nice disposable and funny situations. this movie and James Belushi was born doing Bill Manucci, doing a great job. The rest of the cast is not half the bad, and especially Timothy Dalton is a cure. The story can be quite difficult at times, while new characters appear during the movie. Things get complicated because nobody rarely tells the truth about things. If you do not pay attention, it might eventually be a bit tricky, but I really liked it. Louis Morneau is not so well-known, but he has done perfectly well with this and I have never really looked impatiently at the film. <br /> <br /> Manufactured men are worth noting.
