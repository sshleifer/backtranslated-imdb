"You can contain spoilers" <br /> <br /> "All dogs go to heaven" is a great movie, I saw it in 1989 when I was two years old but I did not know well, but as I saw it more and I love songs in this movie a few times.It's favorite songs are "Let me surprise you" and "you soon come home." These are beautiful songs The only thing that bothers me the film is Charlie's dying.When I was my little sister <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when Annabelle and Charlie fly around Heaven is beautiful in the movie and the "clock" is very clever. I also have I love Itchy, I actually have 3 my own dachshunds. They are so cute. <br /> <br /> Overall, I like this movie and I recommend it to everyone to see it.
