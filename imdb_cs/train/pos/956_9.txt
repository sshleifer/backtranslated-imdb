The simple handheld camera both gives this film almost a documentary feel, and it also concerns dogmatic films. <br /> <br /> Have you ever bored with the boredom of those Hollywood movies that are confronted with the crazy boys who are going to endeavor to james bond? Dropped up with a woman-living-only cop, a divorced-but-family-man, personified donut, and a tough hunter? Have you ever wondered how the real police are? <br /> <br /> Well, for Germany, this movie shows you. In the north between West Germany and East Germany, the former DDR, a post office clerk who is fresh from a Polish school begins. She quickly finds her way around regular customers and gets used to life as a policeman ... but that's not much fun. Other German films like Derrick, Der Alte et cetera have decent officers to talk calmly with the suspects. These police officers have to deal with the lowest on the social rankings. Good dialogue and realism make this interesting opinion, even more so if you know this part of Germany a bit.
