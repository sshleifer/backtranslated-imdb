Unrecognically reminiscent of the 1940s Westerns, as the "Treasure of Sierra Madre" (1948), "Red Rock West" is a story of conscience, greed, and betrayal. Michael (Nicolas Cage) is a young Texas man who goes west looking for work and money. He finds both, but not as he expected. The film script contains lots of surprises and plot. Excellent cinematography, amazing movie editing and moody western music add tension and tension. The large area of ​​the large sky provides a wonderful environment. And acting ranges from good to excellent, with outstanding performances by Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh. Dwight Yoakam's particularly recorded country / western song gives the film a strong end. Correctly labeled as neo-noir, "Red Rock West" feels like something else. The story is full of amazing casualties and unlikely timing, so others may think the script is wrong. Usually I would agree. In this case, however, in combination with the moody atmosphere and the fact that the small town of Red Rock looks almost empty from everyday life, coincidence and unlikely timing suggest a story that is "noirish" ... superlative. It's almost as if fate deliberately interfered with unlikely events to force Michael to stand up with him. From this perspective, coincidences are not the same. They are essential points in the horrifying story of a young man who has to face his own demons ... dressed up as other characters. All we need here is Rod Serling, in the post-script, explaining his always-spoken voice that ... a young man looking for himself stops in a small, almost deserted city a thousand miles from nowhere. It's his last break on his way to the ... twilight zone.
