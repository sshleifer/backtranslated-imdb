If you like "Othello," you'll love this movie because half the film revolves around the stage production of the game. The film has a great cast with Signe Hasso and Shelley Winters as women in Colman's life, while Edmond O'Brien plays an enterprising press agent. Several supportive players I particularly loved were Millard Mitchell as a singing reporter who finds some angle, and Joe Sawyer, a 1940s response to Drew Carey playing a policeman on the trunk. <br /> <br /> Great raw moments in this with reality noir.
