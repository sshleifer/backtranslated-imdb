It was the eighth and last film of Columbia Whistler and the only film without Richard Dix, who left the movies and was due to die the following year. It's still a competent thriller, the machine was without it perfectly, but ?? something missing: Dix! Stories in the Whistler series have always been interesting, sometimes brilliant, scenarios were often noir always atmospheric, but not only that Whistler himself hung on the screen, Dix did. The young couple will go out for fourteen days to get the urge to marry in the rain, but they are confused when the potential bride disappears then they are discovered that they are married before she is obviously crazy. Is a potential waiter deferred, even if the private teller he hired to put her in the slips and laces, or is the love blind? Who turns the question. Michael Duane is fine in his penultimate movie when Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein showed up the best film by Lenor Aubert and Richard Lane was as amazing as anytime on a loan from Boston Blackie. Also, the only trip where Whistler himself had to soak up to get wet in the rain, if he did not set it up in the Voice with sea foam. There's been a lot in the last hour, it's worth watching and again, as usual, fans of the genre like me. The Whistler radio series, which began in 1942, continued until 1955 and recorded almost 700 half-hour shows, almost all of which are available on mp3, and on the basis of what I have heard, almost everyone who is worth listening to.
