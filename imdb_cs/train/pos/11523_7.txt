This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I saw it on DVD and the disc does not have any special features or menu, but it does not necessarily mean what I care about. <br /> <br /> I tend to judge movies on a case-by-case basis, depending, among other things, on whether it's a big studio production or a smaller movie. It's a smaller movie and I'm willing to forgive small things. That means I think he has one of the most imaginative and original titles I've ever seen. I enjoyed talking to all the major players. Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin particularly liked me. Alan Arkin has most of the funniest lines. The character portrayed by Claire Forlani may be unrealistic for some people, but I have personally recognized real people with emotional problems that are very easy to look at the decision about life as her character does. It helped me pick up the nuances where her pain could go through the veneer of her humor. It's not a movie for kids, of course, but it does not engage in free sex and nudity. There is quite a bit of language for adults, though, but it can sometimes be very funny. (Especially the character of Alan Arkin, who does not even know correctly.) <br /> <br /> Also watch the cameras from famous actors.
