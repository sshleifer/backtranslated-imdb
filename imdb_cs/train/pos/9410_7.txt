I like this movie. But I was surprised to see that they were referred to as a comedy. It was fun sometimes, but it was not funny. If I expected it to be a comedy, I could be disappointed with the movie, but when I went without expectation, I found it nice and nice. Maybe it was because I identified myself as a protagonist as an engineer. I was less concerned about the satire of capital or labor and more about the basic story of a man who fought for his invention. A person who has less interest in the money gained from his invention than the one who sees it is coming to fruition and production. She is absolutely heroic when she refuses to take big money and a hot woman for suppressing her invention. It seems to me interesting that people compared it to the Jurassic Park; I compare it with the fountain.
