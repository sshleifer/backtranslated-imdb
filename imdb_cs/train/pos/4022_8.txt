Further detailed work on this topic from Dr. Dwivedi returns us back in time to the provisional division of Panjab. Dr. Dwivedi has chosen a difficult subject for his debut film. He worked on all the careful details to bring the story to life. The treatment of this subject is very delicate. <br /> <br /> Even though we were not in this area at that time, they really look like sets and costumes. Unlike most of the films that are divided into a partition, it does not focus on the horrific details of violence that attract the audience but its consequences. The characters come alive. Priyanshu Chatterjee was making a tremendous effort. Manoj Bajpai was at heart and showed the situation when a man was burgled. The rest of the cast also did a good job.
