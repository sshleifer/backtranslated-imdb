I first saw this movie as I walked through the film channels on my DirecTV parents. It was on the Sundance channel and it's just starting. I love music, especially at the end of the 1960s, and that's what BJM was saying (The Dandys are all right). Everything about the Brian Jonestown Massacre caught me from the music, Antonov and Joel's personality, about illicit drug use. It was funny because when I watched the first party scene, when everyone was making the rows my parents were going through, they decided to watch (the look on their faces was invaluable). Anyway, it is definitely one of my favorite films because he introduced me to the Brian Jonestown Massacre, which is now my favorite band of all time. Just look ... seriously
