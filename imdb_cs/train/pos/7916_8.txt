Well, well .... Roeg touched a little nerves, did not he? It was a genius when he cataloged the descent of his various characters into psychosis for decades, but once he has a bad taste and suggests that a redemption (or even some good advice) can be found in the old Catholic Church, the swing than the alternative movie crowd gets extra malicious. Worse yet, the Theresa Russell's character - in the face of experiences that she does not say for her credibly rational prospects - is reluctantly forced to deal with these experiences at a different level - spiritual. You know, the area of ​​unconscious and superstitious, what should be over the binoculars of art houses. Oh, horror ... So she finds her marriage - the idea that this can be an unmistakably important commitment - confirmed by what seems unpleasant as a divine intervention. People who find this idea a prima facie offensive might wonder why they instinctively jump into the assault regime when they are called upon to take seriously the idea of ​​the spiritual dimension into their lives. But they probably will not. Sure, this movie has some problems, especially Talia Shire's delirious hamwork as a overwhelmed nun, 1950s-style clothing and all. And the dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest in their last scene is directly from the Interpretation of Spellbound from Glib's interpretations (although Hitchcock's film escaped similar accusations for a source of wisdom with a perfectly secular commission as a freudian psychoanalyst). Nicolas Roeg, however, sadly seems to have solved critical problems, even for a question as to the possible answers that this film poses.
