This is a collection of documentaries that last 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 slide from artists around the world. Documentary films are diverse and deal with a variety of concepts. The only thing we share is topic 9/11 as a topic (in some cases very small). Some segements are weak, while others are very strong; some are political, some are not; some are just 9/11, some simply use theme 9/11 as a subject that affects human feelings, emotions and tragedies that are universal; some are the mainstream, while others are abstract and artistic). This movie was not censored to anyone, so the ideas you see are very crude and powerful. This is a very controversial film, especially for conservative Americans. I think the two segments could really reflect the right-wing (one of Egypt where the dead American soldier and the dead Palestinian bomber returned as spirits, another from Great Britain who talks about the overthrow of Chile, backed by the United States on September 11, 1973, in 50,000 deaths and terrible atrocities). The segment from Mexico was the strongest and told about the fall of the towers and the resulting death in a live form (you must see it). Even though the end product is uneven, some segments are almost "unnecessary", I still recommend it. The film is very difficult because the segments differ all over the place (some weak, some very strong; I give this rating 9 out of 10 simply because some segments were excellent and covered the issues that usually get censorship (Mexican segment, British segment, Japan segment, Egyptian segment).
