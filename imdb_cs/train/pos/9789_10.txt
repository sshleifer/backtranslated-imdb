The story is smooth. There are no interruptions. Flash flashes are seamlessly drawn into the presence. Casting was great. Young Ya'ara looked very similar to Ya'ara looking at this age. Her image of the blind was convincing. Director Daniel Syrkin has done a great job in getting different actors involved in this story. Cinematography is very good. You feel that you are with Ya'ara and Talia who are walking towards the ocean to the edge of the cliff. The English subtitles are very carefully following the Hebrew script. It is interesting to note that although "Not out of sight" there is no direct translation of "Lemarit Ayin". Both names are very appropriate for the story.
