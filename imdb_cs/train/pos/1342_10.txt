An amazing, stunning view of the movies that inspired the excellent Martin Scorsese. Many of the films he talks about are easily related to his work, especially with earlier, silent times. Very nice, even though I was a bit long, I thought it was one of the best documentaries on the film. Required viewing if you admire Martin Scorsese and his work.
