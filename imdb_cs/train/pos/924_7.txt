Father of pride is a pleasant surprise: it is funny, funny and has a great voice effect. The show is about the Lion family, which acts as the attraction of the show Siegfried & Roy. In fact, there are all stereotypes, but that's what makes them so funny. FOTP is not a children's cartoon film that contains gross adult humor, but in a very mild manner. It is full of pop culture and celebrity portraits and most of them are very well done. I'd say 7 out of ten, because it's pretty well done, but not too original, I've seen many of those stereotypes many times, even in that particular order!
