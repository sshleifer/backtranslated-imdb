I remember watching this movie a while ago, and after watching 3000 miles on Graceland, it all flooded. Why have not any videos or DVDs yet? It is hidden that this spectacular filmmaking has never been released while other garbage has been. In fact, it's John Carpenter's film, which was not released. In fact, I have not seen them on television since I watched him. Kurt Russell was the perfect choice for the role of Elvis. This is definitely the role that was born. John's carpenter's break before horror brought this gem that I would love if the television were to play again. He is well-behaved and well-performed in terms of singing. Most of the biggest hits of Elvis revealed with taste. I think it was also a film that formed a partnership with Russell and Carpenter, which made them create a series of great movies (Escape from New York, Case, Great Difficulty in Small Porcelain, and Escape from LA Someone should release it before, than anyone does a remake or own version of my life, which in my opinion would not only ruin the king but also destroy the charm that this one has. If it does not, we will be at the Heartbreak Hotel.
