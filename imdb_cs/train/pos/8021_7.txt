The third Muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and enjoyable, with the gang taking its modest music school to bright (yet unstable) lights on Broadway, filled with typically naive optimism. Of course, their first attempt fails, and Kermit (the group leader and show author) blows his peak; so everyone else goes on their separate paths so they will not have to feel responsible. Kermit himself engages with a young girl fashion designer who finally meets with food in her father's dining room (the old man has a line in particularly fragile non-sequiturs!). We got our usual acting performances by different stars: Art Carney (as producer), James Coco (as the dog's lifetime owner), Dabney Coleman (as a confidant), Elliott Gould (also in MUPPET MOVIE [1979]), Gregory Hines, Liza Minnelli (like her own portrait in an elegant restaurant replaced by Kermit, a sporting fake mustache, as a seemingly celebrated businessman in a bustle that attracts publicity to the Muppets show), Brooke Shields, and even director John Landis (perhaps even the most entertaining scene of the film as a Broadway producer , before which Kermit appears streetwise and chummy and merry dress shades and afro wig!). The other Muppets more or less pass through their typical culmination, this time with (justification) the smaller space that was given to Gonzos; while Miss Piggy is something with me, a scene in which the other spies about what she wanted to be Kermit's romance with the waitress? and especially its violent reaction to this? are undoubtedly fun. However, what is disappointing is the top-of-the-line show (after a relatively unnecessary middle section where Kermit gets amnesia and eventually raises an ad on Madison Avenue), which, rather than expected sacked routines, provides nothing more original than the Kermit wedding ceremony and its eternal flame Miss Piggy !
