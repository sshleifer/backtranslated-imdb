Personally, I have seen many Disney movies in life, although absolutely none of them match Bedknobs and Broomsticks in any way. Although I personally would not go live with live animation, it was an improvement when I tried to dress people as animated characters. The film shoots three World War II evacuees sent to stay with a quiet and socially clumsy woman in the country. I have to say that the casting was great. Angela Landsbury has made perfect Miss Price, while David Thomilson has made a terrible desperate interest in entertainment. The endings always surprise me, and that was no exception. It was neither happy nor sad, though I do not know if it was intentional. The dialogue was not great, but because it was designed as a children's movie, it's okay. Overall, I would perform nine out of ten, dialogue six out of ten, casting nine out of ten and costumes eight out of ten.
