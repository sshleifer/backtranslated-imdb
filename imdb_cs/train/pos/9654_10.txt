Stephane Rideau was already the star of his "Wild Reeds" tour and is one of the biggest stars of independent francs. In this film, Cedric, a local boy, meets Mathieu (the newly arrived Jamie Elkaim, in a stunning, nuanced, ethereal performance) on the beach. Mathieu has a complex relationship with his sick mother and requires aunt and sister (with whom she has a competitive relationship). They soon fall in love. The film's broken story-which consists of lengthy flashes, pieces and pieces present and in real-time forward movement into the future-is a little daunting. Director Sebastien Lifshitz does not tell us what time period we are, and the story line can be difficult to watch. But keep it: The final 45 minutes of the movie is so stunning that you will not be able to take your eyes off the screen. At the turn of the century, this film ranks as "a beautiful age", such as a cinema.
