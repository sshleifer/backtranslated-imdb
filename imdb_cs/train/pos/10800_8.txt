This movie is much better than the original The Jerk. I recommend it to everyone who likes special humor. From this movie, we've included almost as many rows into our daily discourse as we have from Monty Python. Card game with hobos and then with Mr. Suicide. The dinner scene and his dislike of the turtle soup. The original The Jerk was too choreographic and staged. While I like Steve Martin, he seems to be trying hard. Jerk This is spoof and will be enjoyed by everyone. Jerk Too is a family friendly, unlike the original The Jerk.
