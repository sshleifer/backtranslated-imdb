I just watched the 139 minute version (widescreen) with a few friends and we were blowing. I will not bother repeating what others have said. What the filmmakers are doing with the concept is unexpected and fun. The enormous battle is exhausting. Then we were amazed when we found out that it was still nearly 30 minutes, but that did not prevent us from being completely engaged and amused. One thing almost destroyed it and it was horrible music / songs. Blues, Country / Folk and rock ballads are not here, and every time we use them, we all laughed. It's awful. You were warned, but the story and story will keep you on the ground. <br /> <br /> There are some great moments that make you appreciate the camera talents. There are many uses of silence and slow photography that work beautifully. I really wish I could delete the music, but unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Find it. It's fun, it's different and takes you to places you would not expect, and that's very refreshing.
