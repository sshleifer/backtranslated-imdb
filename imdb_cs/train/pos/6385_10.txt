This movie was great! It was an excellent rendition of the ancient myth. The animation was somewhat strange, but nothing new from Disney. It was definitely better than expected for Disney movie without singing. The background animation was magical. It was a different level of work for Disney's people. Some of the characters were a bit fragile, but it was more than just replaced by the beauty and lush scenery. The music was mostly instrumental, but it was great for the movie. It certainly was not a movie that needed characters to get into the song. Perfect. 10 out of 10.
