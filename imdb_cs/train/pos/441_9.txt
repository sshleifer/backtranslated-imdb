It's a wonderful movie about looking for bliss in everyday life. Pacing, working with camera, emotions, scary music scores, and the pure spell of this image make it a must see. It is not easy to appreciate immature or emotionally stunted. The only bug I see in this movie is that it was not captured in a technically superior movie format. It deserved Todd-AO, Technicolor and the high quality audio format available. (An intimate film can be made in seventy millimeters.) The amazing Italian villas on its inhabitants would become even louder and the little beautiful moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard. Likewise, it still requires attention as a small moving small movie. I can not stop watching it every time it's on the satellite. Transforming characters from occupied, tight and untrustworthy is always a joy to watch and I really should recommend it more often. Casting is perfect, mood is perfect, acting is over reproach. This is a middle-aged movie and the choices people make. He is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer with a heavy hand. Watch it in one sitting and let it affect you. If you do not succeed, you probably have not been satisfied or something else with you.
