If you test UFO facts, this video is very important. The "meat" of the video is Buzz Aldrin's commentary. It is undoubtedly one of the best in America. Trained to be objective, honest, and factual in their reports. Many astronauts from all over the world report any contact or UFO and video observation from some of these missions. At least something has happened that requires further objective continuous investigations. I think this testimony by Buzz Aldrin shows that it is possible that another world might be interested in our progress. As with all anticipated documentaries, this film can be tilted, but contains more information and insights from a successful American hero. They do not come every day. So the fact that some people are not interested in details should not deviate you from viewing this video. If nothing else, it's interesting and I recommend you to watch with an open mind.
