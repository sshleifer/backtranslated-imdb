Man, I really love the new DVD Universal released. I have never seen SENTINEL look so good, because I had to keep the dirty, grainy VHS tapes for years. Unfortunately there are no trailer allowances that look much worse. And avoid DVD Good Times at all costs. That's upset. By the way, the wandering model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves into a haunted NYC brownstone, it's more than just scary. It is also a portal to hell, and the Vatican keeps an old blind priest (John Carradine) watching him and making sure that the devil and arch angels do not escape. <br /> <br /> It is a star starred by all the old actors such as Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, etc., as well as the 1980s including Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum (who was mysteriously exaggerated) and Tom Berenger. And you will not even recognize Jerry Orbach from LAW & ORDER. I had to make a double departure when I did not quite notice where I had seen him before. Nice gore scenes that Alison cut their eyes and nose from a fleeting dead father. from the devil. And there is a clean end, where disfigured, deformed people try to commit suicide to Alison, so that there is no more to prevent the portal. It seems that Alison's turbulent past makes her the Vatican's chief candidate who will become another guardian. The superb, ghostly 70s from director Michael Winner, which should not be missed. I also recommended it for those who want something more imaginative than usual silly teenagers and horror comedies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span>
