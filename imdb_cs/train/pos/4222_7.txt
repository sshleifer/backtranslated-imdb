I like this episode a bit, Ruth Gordon is good, if not a little hammock, as she always was. As mentioned, music is very good and has a mood that does not exist in all episodes. But there is one big hole that is so wide that you can drive the fleet of trucks it. It is found that the light in the vault does not work. Do not you think the very intelligent Columbo or the rest of the police think they'll check if the light bulb works? Would you think they would unscrew the bulb in a very short order and find a note. It's a TV series and the different holes will always be found, but it seems to be too ugly. In fact, Columbo does not mean to be a hidden genius when the light does not work, but the evidence of the "fatal bed" continues unlikely, seemingly over the course of days.
