I have made sense to see this film over the past few months. I was really surprised at how good it was. The task spins around a group of young schools who bully Marty's boy. He's always worried about it until one of them becomes a terrible mistake, leaving Marty awfully burned. A few years later, a group of ruthless teenagers is invited back to their own high school, which is now abandoned by the party. Though even one of the ruthless teenagers did not organize this party. Later in the film, the teenage girl will die in the most terrible possibilities. I certainly can tell you they are also horrible. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie you will find it was a dream and nothing happened. But Marty is in a hospital with heavy burns. Though the murders did not happen, the burns and jokes were probably happening. <br /> <br /> The game is terrible, but that's fine. <br /> <br /> I love the story. I really sympathized with Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). The bullies ultimately get what comes to them, and in the end you feel satisfied when the victim receives his sweet revenge. I would like someone to pick it up if you're looking for the 80th slashers. /> <br /> I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. Good cheese!
