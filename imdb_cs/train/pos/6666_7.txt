I can not say that this film deserves nowhere else than the amount of vitriol that some reviewers accumulate on it. Yes, it is filled with over-stuffed time, abridged editing, and excessive reliance on special cheeseball effects. And he lacks the amount of energy the comedy needs to hear the average listener without checking his watch. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it's also some laugh-out-loud funny lines, a talented and earnest cast, and a classic underdog assumption. Macy, Stiller, and Azaria are great as "core" teams, and Garofalo and Studi are doing a great job that adds conflict and diversity to the cooperative. I can not say that Reubens or Mitchell added a lot to the film, although each of them had some chances to shine. <br /> <br /> The plot, as I said above, is your classic "underdog-doing-good" stuff. There is no surprise, because you know they will triumph. What it does is not absurd, the heroes and villains, but the dialogue and the interplay between the characters. Underneath, they are all hearts who want to do the right thing. The best scenes in the film give this film its emotional background. Look at the relationship of Azarius with his long-suffering mother; Macy has innocence in reluctance to accept Cap. An amazing secret identity; Stiller's anger (not unlike the weird, spasmodic child you once knew, who always shakes, exhausted on the pitch); Garofal's desire to avenge his father. This child's belief that the feeling of justice and good always brings the world a better place is the real attraction of the comic superhero; and under his parodic exterier, "Mystery Men" shows us why these complicated comic tropes depend on so many. <br /> <br /> Never really gels to a satisfying whole, due to the huge number of half-empty (romance, family life, conflicts inside the team, etc.), but the main storyline is so fun to do it. The fact that it's supposed to be a good, nonsensical fun seems to be lost to some reviewers here, so I'll issue a warning: if you're the type of viewer who looks forward to the scenarios, unexplained and illogical ("I think it's some sort of ... * snort * ... _magic_ xylophone? "), then you are too literal and merciless for this movie. Listen instead to Sandler. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
