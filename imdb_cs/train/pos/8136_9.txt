This movie is very powerful. He watches the NWH band, made up of Ice Cold, Tasty Taste and Tone Def, thanks to his unique journey to gangster rap, mines, and back to the summits. Through troubles with women, egos, policemen and Caucasian, this band gets to the top of the world of gangster rap, because this film goes to the top of the guitarists. I know that every favorite is powerful This is Spinal Tap, for a very good reason, but I think if it's in the right mood, this movie is just better. Laughter never stops, even for someone not in rap culture. I am a white guy who is not interested in rap music, culture or anything else related to it, but I love this movie. Rusty Cundeif, who wrote script, plays and played in it, showed great potential, and it's a shame I did not see him from the fear of black hats. However, I've seen him once more than you have, so I recommend the fear of a black hat to smile quickly. Do not forget: "Do not shoot to see whites! ... their eyes do not throw away to see whites." <br /> <br /> FYM and enjoy the movie.
