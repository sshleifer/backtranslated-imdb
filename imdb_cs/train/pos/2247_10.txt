I am disappointed with the lack of contributions to this surprising and effective little film. Jordi Mollà, probably best known for his role as Diego in "Blow" Ted Demme. It writes, directs and stars. I do not make any disruptive points because the movie (at least for me) was very exciting when it did not know about it. If you have a netflix account or you have access to a video rental store that could wear it ... I highly recommend. It's crazy, fun and sometimes very thought-provoking creatures. <br /> <br /> The direction of Mollà is * quite * impressive and shows a lot of promise. <br /> <br /> Unpredictable, with stunning shots and great lead performance spoken in the beautiful Spanish film "No somos nadie" (God is in the air) is an amazing movie that you can show to your friends.
