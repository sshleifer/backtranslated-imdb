Unlike some comments, my positive one is. This movie surrounds a dining table with a group of friends, some like you, some do not. Several have a relative - mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not smooth, happy with everyone and with all, the type of life - just like real life. Some story lines are not developing, they just happen. But like true families and good friends, they stick together. They want to be parents who buy a baby, they are - holes! You are happy for the end. Poor Delmar was stuck between the rocks and the boulder that cared for himself, his mother, her son, and he tried to keep his whole life together. It does not end with a walk or house in "swamp" and everyone lives in the world of dreams, but they represent the real life of people who live every day, month to month. Overall, it's a good story and a great movie!
