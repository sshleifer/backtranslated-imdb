I went to see Fever Pitch with my mom and I can say we both loved each other. It was not a typical romantic comedy where someone searches for the other, and blah blah ... You did not expect the first kiss or to finally meet them. It was true because you saw them through a relationship, rather than the whole film about how they connect with them. People really could relate to the film because it did not seem like extraordinary circumstances or impossible situations. It was really fun and I think it was Jimmy Fallon's best performance. Overall ... I would definitely recommend it!
