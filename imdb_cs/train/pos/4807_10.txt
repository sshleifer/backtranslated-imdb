I really thought this movie was great. History is not only correct, but the style is a lot and still intimate. I was a fan of Emily Blunt's introduction to Victoria and how she kept her spirit, even though she was forced into virtual exile in her youth. Blunt depicts the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic way that Vicotria has become famous (perhaps infamous). The romantic elements of the film are so real and gentle that you really understand why the Vicotria decided to live the rest of its days in Albert's mourning until the end of the movie. Technical aspects of the film are good notes as well. I appreciated the beautiful score, which is quite decent along with the dramatic movement of the story. I also considered cinematography to be excellent, some of the scenes have left me breathless because of the seduction and splendor they display. This year, so few films have been shot that are beautiful and gentle as this movie, as one of 2009's best!
