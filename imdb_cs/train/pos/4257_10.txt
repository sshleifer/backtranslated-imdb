This movie about the two Italian brothers who came to Germany with their family is just great! It's not an idealistic film, I think it shows life as it is or was in the 1960s and 1970s the main story is happening. The characters are very nice, but they also have some "dark" sides that lead you to believe that they are real people. A great movie with great actors proving that life is not always sad, but that you can find happiness with "fire and passion," as Gigi says the main character.
