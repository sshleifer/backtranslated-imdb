I grew up watching this movie, and I still love it today as I was when I was a child. Do not listen to critics reviews. Eddie Murphy is really shining in his role. You can sit with your whole family and everyone will like it. I recommend this movie to everyone. It's a comedy with a touch of fantasy. With demons, dragons, and a little bald guy with a power like God. This film will bring you from LA to Tibet, to a stunning view of the beautiful temples of the mountains in Tibet. a beautiful view! So do your favors and catch this! You will not regret it!
