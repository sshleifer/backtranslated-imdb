One of the best comedians ever. I've seen this show about ten times, and I'll watch it for at least another 100. My friends and family cite this DVD so often, you think we've done nothing but watch it. The opening section about Alcatraz is a little slow, but it either passed, or zip to where Eddie is on stage. Look at the "Cake or Death" section and the "Hitler / Pol Pot" section (Hard to explain, just watch it). The best part of the show can be Eddie's facial expressions. She can tell a lot with her eyes. (Maskara, eyeliner and eye shadow are likely to help, right?) Right warning: Eddie tends to throw a lot of four-letter words.
