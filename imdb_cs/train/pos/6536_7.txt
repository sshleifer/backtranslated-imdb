Let's look at it; Nancy Drew has never been great literature. She is in the same category as babysitting, charming tree house, Goosebumps, ABC Mysteries. In fact, it was one of the original stories. Nancy is perfect, pretty, thoughtful, "pretty", she has no internal conflicts at all! and will never change. Ned is almost the same. The movie was true in this style and I must say I liked it. It will never be a great movie, but it has the same nostalgic taste as the book. It was the right amount of stress for my children (8 and 10). There was almost no assault language. I enjoyed trying to make a more conservative dress. Corky was a little uncomfortable. He was a bit out of place in the high school campus. I never knew why he was there.
