This movie is a movie that you have to see everybody. Congress should see this true document from the point of view of a soldier, like everyone in America. An earlier evaluator has completely neglected this point - the aim is to reveal the truth about how to teach our soldiers to kill people who are not terrorists but live only in our territory "enemy" and what it does to soldiers. We must support our soldiers by immediately bringing them home before another person is killed or injured. It also reveals that the government does not help its veterans, those who are mentally injured, ptsd-post-traumatic stress disorder or physically lost limbs. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL
