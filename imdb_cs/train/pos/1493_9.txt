I thought Mukhsin was greatly written. It's not just fun. There are tons of fine news I think Yasmin is trying to transfer. And yes, it could be unclear for some of you (especially if you did not have 76 hours watching Sepet and / or Gubru). I bet they noticed how they used the characters of the two movies earlier, right? It's really ironic how those characters are concerned. Just like the boss's neighbor is the prostitute from Gubra. And the cat on the billiards will turn out to be religious in the future and the wife of the godly man. <br /> <br /> And I absolutely love the voices. Her crude but exciting fresh. Like when they photographed the signboard Rumah Tumpangan Gamin, Mukhsin's voice suddenly spoke: "Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim .." (the scene when he climbed the tree). Caught the Malaysian attitude (and in some mild manner, sniggering on how stunning it is) portrayed in the character. For example, even children may be really sharp tongues (complete with loud restless voice) and simply bad mouth ppl the whole movie long. And how can you become so busy talking about a PPL if your own life does not resolve. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say is that this movie has fully met my expectation if it has not gone beyond it. <br /> <br /> I did not hold on to the screen, I could not even tear it from my eyes. I will not do it in cinema either. Ha ha.
