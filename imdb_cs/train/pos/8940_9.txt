Autobiography on which this film is based remains one of the most heartfelt books I've ever read. She tells the amazing stories of two sisters who have received devotion and respect, they work well for 70 years as a teacher and dentist, then live for 30 more years with dignity. Ruby Dee steals the film with her perfectly graduated performance as the rebellious "blacker" Bessie, the dentist. Not only expresses his anger, anxiety and wisdom well; she lets you know exactly where they come from using word words. Diahnn Carroll has a feeling from an older nurse, teacher, perfectly, but I'm afraid he'll never believe he's over 100. No matter - the stories are worth saying. Amy Madigan is a bit too extreme and disturbing to be working in the first half of the film as a NY Times Caucasian reporter. This is also a slight distraction. Stories, all true, are attraction, and though two or three are slightly damaged in translation, most of them do well. <br /> <br /> I recommend the book as a basic reading to all people who recommend books. I can not quite, but this television movie in this unique air, but it certainly captures enough flavor to make it very useful.
