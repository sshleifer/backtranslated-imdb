OH WOW. I saw this film on the Irish international film Fleadh in Manhattan on March 12, 2000. Both stars were present and were available for questions later. WHAT CHILDREN'S FILM! Although it was in the middle of Catholic / Protestant antagonism in Ireland, the story could happen anywhere between two groups of people who hate each other. The horror of how fast people can get away when they get the chance to bleed their hatred and anger was beautifully woven with a moving love story full of humor and fun. If it does not get in the US, it would be really unfortunate. As for the stars and supportive players ... FIRST RATE. They call Orla Brady of Irish Meryl Streep, I have heard. I think it's better than Meryl Streep. They should call Meryl's American Eagle Brady! Liam Cunningham's constant and powerful depiction of a simple and private man sucked into a political war was great. SEE THIS FILM.
