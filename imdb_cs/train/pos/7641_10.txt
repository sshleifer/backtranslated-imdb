In this "little nice movie," everyone plays their part very well. Belusha gets the chance to live part of her life differently but eventually realizes that what she has is going to be just as good or maybe even better. The film shows us that we should take advantage of the opportunities we have, not of the ones we can not or can not have. If you get a video for about $ 10 for this movie, it will be an investment!
