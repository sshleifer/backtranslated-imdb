I felt like watching this movie on TV and I could not leave it ... It's really a great movie that makes people learn about the history of the Americans with the Vietnam War, time of flower power, racial struggle ... Which illustrates the generation conflict , political opinion, race that took place in the 1960s. I was born in 1980, so I did not know all the stuff before ... In France, US history is not a priority and the movie really taught me a lot of facts! By the way, I think all the actors are great; especially Jordana Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell. Now I can see this movie for more than 1 day every day! It's really great ... what a pity it just appeared on TV, not in cinemas ... <br /> <br />
