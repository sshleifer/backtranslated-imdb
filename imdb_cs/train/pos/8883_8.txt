The film design seems alpha and omega to some of the major issues in this country (USA). We see relationships across the university film environment. Well, obvious student v.s. the teacher is present. But what the film adds to its value is his other relationships: a man v.s. woman, white v.s. black and single v.s. company. But the most important of all and in direct relationship to all other relationships is the individual v.s. alone. <br /> <br /> I was overwhelmed by the bilateral view that the director gave her to show racial relations on the site. Most movies typically show the inequities of one party in showing the suffering of the other. This film has shown injustice and suffering on both sides. She did not try to show how right it is, even though I would say that the heads of the skin are much harsher and more vengeful (quite obvious to the end). The film also discusses sex and rape. Ironically, this injustice, which in some ways brings two races together for a certain time. Lawrence Fishburne performs as Top Professor Phipps. It breaks down the idea of ​​racist favoritism and instead shows the parallelism between lazy and cramped with the hardworking and the positive. The other stars of this film are Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport gives an excellent idea of ​​confused youth with an irrational anger looking for admission. Tyra Banks makes her film debut and proves that supermodels can act. Higher learning gains its name in the show school as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper. In fact, I would like to say that the film is almost a satire in that students show interaction with each other, rather than a dry book like real university education. It's a learning process, not a texture. I think you will find "Higher Learning" is related to important issues in many universities and even in life in general. 8/10
