I just came back from the screening a few hours ago, and I was very happy with the movie when I left him. It is very intense and closest to me that I was crying for the time in the movie. That's the merit of Adam Sandler, who delivers fantastic performance on many levels and who deserves Oscar nominations, it was not so early in the year. Don Cheadle gives his usual excellent performance when playing a direct man on Adam's upset. There is some humor, but most of it is really funny compared to the tearjerking moments as Adam deals with his loss, and Don tries to help him. Adam plays two levels very well ... when he is mentally stable, he is fun and appealing, but when he is, well, less stable, he is powerful and dark. I recommend this to anyone who likes intense mental drama about the difficult friendship and loss.
