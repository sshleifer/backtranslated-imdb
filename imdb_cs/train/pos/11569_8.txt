Bob Clampett is "An Itch in Time" milk seven minutes crazy action from a very small assumption. Elmer Fudd tells his dog that if he scratches again for a dreaded bath. Sadly, for a dog, an inexorable blcha makes it all but impossible to stop scratching. The cartoon switches between the evolution of the flea inside dog fur and the desperate attempt of the dog to cope with it. In a great sequence that really captures the frustration of itching that can not be scratched, the dog changes the color from brown to blue to red to polka dotted on a hat! It sounds absurdly unreal, but perfectly produces an indescribable feeling of itching in a way that Clampett can do. There are several other elements that make "An Itch in Time" a clean Clampett. There is a grotesque concept that leads to some graphic scenes of lightning that touch the dog's flesh. There is unlimited violence that develops in every scene with a cat. Most notable is that there are dirty jokes, including a giant shot of a dog behind which the blush becomes a wolf whistle and a hysterical sequence in which the dog tries to scratch by pulling the back of the floor. For a moment he breaks down and asks the audience: "Hey, I better say, maybe I like it!" With a very limited conception, Clampett has managed to create an "An Itch in Time" unique mortar-based caricature. Just like the early episode "Seinfeld", "Itch in Time" is practically nothing but very fun.
