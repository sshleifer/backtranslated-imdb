I enjoyed this movie very much. I was really interested in Deanna and Alicia being friends over such a tragedy. Alicia was just an upset soul, and Deanna was so happy to see someone after she was shot. My only complaint was that at first it was a bit slow and it took a while before it came to the foundations. Besides, it was great.
