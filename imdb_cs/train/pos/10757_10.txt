Given that the Naudetas did not try to tell the story of September 11, but rather as a newcomer to the firefighters, men's emotions and connections with them are much more realistic and stronger than they would be in a standard retrospective. <br /> <br /> In the sense of the film, "9/11" is a textbook. If the events were a real script, they would be excellent because the characters are based, and then throw the curve to which they must respond. This is all the more amazing given the pains and emotions of the raw shot that directors had to go through to create this story together. <br /> <br /> The first part of the movie provides a glimpse of life inside a fire station; specifically, how the newcomer collects into veteran crew. The part itself is quite good and if the document is based on the assumed direction, it would probably be solid. The brothers seem to be realistic about the process of becoming a NYC governor. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, everything hell will be released. Chaos after the attack on the WTC is live to see, because the different characters we met are being thrown into terrible situations. To see not only the attacks, but also the first-hand reaction is a very moving image of extreme human emotions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Life and death hang in balance. Unlike many movies, the viewer not only does not know who will live and die but really cares about them. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I have to say is that the delusions of Robert DeNiro (which I like) are uninformative, useless, and they did not. They were probably added just to attract more TV viewers. Bottom Line: The best document I've ever seen. Neoprene portraits of raw human emotions and drama. 9.5 out of 10.
