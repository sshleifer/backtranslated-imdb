Any way the wind is welcome is Tom Barmans (who is also known as the front man rock formation 'dEUS'). Completely filmed in Antwerp (Belgium), the film begins on a sunny Friday morning and skips between events that fill a dozen main characters. When the movie ends, you have a lot of things to think about because most of the different stories are open. The film has a (purely instrumental) sound track, socks off. In most scenes, music actually enhances the overall atmosphere and feels, it really does the film of hallucination to watch at certain times. The main scene in the movie, the party, is very well shot. The director did not hesitate to use the techniques of video clips whose main characters dance on one of the best soundtracks I have listened to lately. <br /> <br /> The script is a great thing. Camera and color angles are very well chosen. "Costumes" are very hot and very "seventy". And I loved (most) acting. The thing I liked best in the movie is the delicate touch of absurd, surrealistic, very dry or even cynical humor that blends together. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Without claiming to be a comedy (this film is certainly not a comedy but rather an alternative artwork) <br /> <br /> It's the debut of one director that should not be over. I hope to see more Tom Barman movies in the future because I had a good time. Cheers.
