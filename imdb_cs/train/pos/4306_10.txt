The mere fact that after decades I still think of a movie is what really talks about the movie. For me, Grand Canyon justifies it as a movie that will touch you one way or the other. I really believe that before the Crash was Grand Canyon. The main difference between these two films is, in my view, the timing of their release. I will not guess which one is better, but we will try to share the same message. I would like to hear from those who have an opinion on this topic. I'll start commenting at http://www.myspace.com/62229249. Maybe you will also find me to publish other topics related to the films we can share because I have a real love for the movie.
