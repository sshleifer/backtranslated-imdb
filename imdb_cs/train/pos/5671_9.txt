The attackers are fast-moving SCI-FI THRILLER IN THE MAIN ROLE BEN Cross and Sean Young. BEN RENN RETURN, PASSING FROM ANOTHER GALAXY, SEARCHING ANIE (HARDEN SEAN) WHICH IS PHYSICALLY NOT USED TO HAVE A CHILD. This child, if left to be born and returned to the planet, may be the only chance for his RACE to survive. Enemy aliens who destroyed LIDI Renn's has also been followed by Renn across the STARS that stop the birth. CROSS AGAIN shows a great deal from the comic beginnings of Alien entering the local bar and ordering his first earthly cocktail, to his RACE with the enemy and drama on whether he can keep Annie and the baby NES ALIVE.
