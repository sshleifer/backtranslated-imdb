Best show from Seinfeld. It's really fun. Her utter concentration, neighbors of neighbors of homosexual stoners, going to a song or cartoon makes it the freshest TV show. One of the few shows I'm watching. A scene with a wise old black gentleman at a pharmacy ("oh wait, when you're close, you look old," he turns his face with his finger and lol goes), overdose with syrup, sleeping with God, it's so funny or so stupid it's a lot of fun. Examples of weak spots are her sister and cop just because they are too normal! I really can not wait for the next show, something I did not feel for a long time.
