He has seen it on Sundance Channel several times and got a nice cinematic hit. The semi-rigid, yet hard boundary focuses on modern media culture (or its deficiency), targeting some seriously disturbed, remote residents outside Hollywood. It was an entertaining initial performance by Mark Ruffal and some unforgettable cinematography from DP, which made films of Polish brothers. There was a wild, uncompromising humor and a strangely original feeling that surely separated him. This movie was written around the world with a classic cult, and I'm surprised it's not on DVD yet. <br /> <br /> I hope soon.
