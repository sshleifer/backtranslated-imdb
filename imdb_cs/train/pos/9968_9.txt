My mother took me to see this movie as a child and I long to see it every year when I make all my other Christmas favorites. What I remember most is the stupid devil, and Santa is looking through his binoculars. I waited, and every year I looked at the TVV Guide to see when it would be shown. Usually I would have played it on Saturday afternoon. I found the film only in English, which took something special from the film and wanted to find a copy of it in Spanish. I watch this movie dear to my heart, and I have never suffered from nightmares, as others might suggest. Yes, that's another movie about Santa Claus and that's what makes it strange and unique. I can not wait to get a copy of this movie and look at it with my children as I explain their favorite parts and memories to them!
