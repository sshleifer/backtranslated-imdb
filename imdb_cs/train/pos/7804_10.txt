I keep watching this movie over and over again. I have to watch her at least once a week. I'm from Africa and looking at the film taught me some things I did not even know about Africa. Denzel's films are full of lessons for people living in the environment. I wish he was my brother. I also saw and loved your Masala Mississippi. What an exciting situation. When Denzel tried to close his brother to work, he reminded me of his teenage age when my brother always went crazy with me to be still employed. My brother always took care of his old father, and he wants to see me as well. By the way, where did Denzel get the African accent in the movie Cry Freedom? I first saw this movie in Africa and I did not know that Denzel was an American until I moved here.
