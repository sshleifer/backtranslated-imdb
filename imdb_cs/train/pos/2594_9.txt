This film gained Jerry Springer's access to super-human power. "Wilder Napalm" is the film based on topics I love, addressing the idea that the miracles in America are defined either by their gifts or by attempts to hide them. At the same time, the film points out that every miracle animal is just human and no longer has to worry or worship any other human being. It was a great comedy, fun, and a man with that light satirical edge.
