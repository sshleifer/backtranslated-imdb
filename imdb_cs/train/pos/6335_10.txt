Well, I come from Bulgaria, where it is almost impossible to have a tornado, but my fantasy tells me that I am "very, very afraid" !!! This guy (Devon Sawa) has done a great job with this movie! You do not know exactly how old he is, but he did not act like a child (Well) And now a tornado - it was not very realistic, but he scared you if you want a nice time in front of the TV - this is a movie!
