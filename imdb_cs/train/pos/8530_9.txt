You're not sure why it does not play in Peoria, it seems, but it's a very fun, smart British comedy. It is set at the end of the "Swing of the Sixties". Peter Sellars is fantastic as a rich, twenty-four-year series. Perfectly charming Goldie Hawn, who plays a 19-year-old American girl in London, is Sellars's "catch of the day" at first. But the critic of TV food in the urban area can not stop because of the dizziness of the American blonde. <br /> <br /> Humor, pathos, great script, strong leadership and supporting caste. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie and the best gag is the last line. <br /> <br /> Try it, you will like it.
