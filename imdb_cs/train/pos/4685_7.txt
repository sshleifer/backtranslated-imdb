In Lizzie Borden's "Love Crimes" (1992), Sean Young plays harsh D.A. in Atlanta. She is a loner who is too involved in the case of a man (Patrick Bergin), who represents a famous fashion photographer and seduces women, takes a compromise photo of them and then leaves them. Naturally, this tough loner decides to enter a fake dungeon by confronting his prey and intends to bring him to justice. They meet, they love, then another thing they know is over the wedge and they get. (Note: The scene is only in the "unrated" version of this movie, the R-rated version omit it and several other scenes that would tighten the plot.) This psychological thriller contains several scenes of female nakedness and disturbing images such as Bergin, one of his victims in the vicinity of the room, filled with an equine crop. As a thriller, "Love Crimes" is best when Sean Young plays her cat and - a game with Bergin trying to catch him in an incriminating act. It's unfortunate that the movie does not end but just stops. It is true. Director Lizzie Borden can only have a story to tell, but after 92 minutes the credits are rolling and we are left behind by the mystery "what happened?" he got lost. <br /> <br /> Developing Young's plan is engaging in style, but the lack of a coherent end will be a shutdown for some viewers.
