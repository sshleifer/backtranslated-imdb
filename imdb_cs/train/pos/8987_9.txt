I recently rented this doctor because I remembered hearing about IMDb.com and being interested in the assumption. I knew very little about these bands, but I remember hearing that "The If You Were The Last Junkie On Earth" by The Dandy Warhols long ago and enjoying it. That said, this is my look at the doc: <br /> <br /> One thing I found incredible about this movie is that there is no need to have any previous knowledge of any of these groups. Director (Ondi Timoner) does not waste time engaging the audience and familiarizing them with the people in this movie. I quickly got into the lives of Anton and Courtney, as well as their respective bands, the massacre of Brian Jonestown and The Dandy Warhols. I think it's part of what makes this document so good, and what Ondi Timoner does as a doctoral documentaryist. He loved me too, as the story of these bands was told. Most of what you see is from bands on a tour. Both bands start to play in small places and try to do it in the recording industry. Throughout the movie, each band strives to keep the standard unique and uncontrolled. However, this is what makes two bands alike, and so a brilliant insight into how two bands of feathers can go in such different directions. Basically I would recommend this for anyone who likes the film in general. You do not have to have a special love of documents or some of the bands. Music appreciation helps, but music has a back seat on the relationship of love and hatred between the massacre of Brian Jonestown and The Dandy Warhols.
