I recently looked at the "54 version of this movie with Judy, and when I appreciated the story and the music, I found out that the film could not hold my attention. I expected the remake of 76 to be the same story, except when Barbra I was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and more modern view of glory, money, love and the price of all, much more realistic than in 1954, with probably better music, better acting, more grasping plot and, of course, I do not understand why the previous movie is on the list of the 100 best American film institutes, while this fascinating remake fails to mark the list of critics.
