This is the best of 43 films produced by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; his most successful at least. He was one of the leading directors in Germany after the Second World War. Hanna Schygulla was as cool as cold, she calculated Maria Bruana, who had lost her husband to war, found him after taking the American soldier as a lover, lost him again after he went to prison and found him at the end. Her day and a half of her marriage before he disappeared was longer than their time together. That's life. Things come and go and you do the best you can. You can surrender or modify the way you think to survive. Even though Maria has adjusted her mind and done what she has to do, she has never ceased to love Hermann, which ends up with such a tragedy. Great drama.
