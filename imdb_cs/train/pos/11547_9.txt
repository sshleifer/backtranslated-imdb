and laugh loudly funny in many scenes. The film's basic film is well recorded, the story of the opposite is trying to find a way to survive each other in close proximity. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the best film of Lemmon and Matheau as co-stars, and the interaction between the Hearing Oscar and the Felix OCD are classic. The scene where Oscara line up a double date, leaves the room briefly, and returns to find Felix and the two girls, all crying is invaluable fun. For every fan of intelligent comedy, The Odd Couple "Come Out of Your Way to See" Movie.
