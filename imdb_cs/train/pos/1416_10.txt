COUNTRY should be seen for children and adults. My son had great fun and watched all these funny birds and ice bears. We can learn a lot from this movie and we should be proud of our great treasure on earth. Some animals are in danger of disappearing. Exactly such a problem should prevent all the organs of our planet. This documentary offers many extraordinary images I have never seen before. Then it is well accompanied by heavenly music. The director is very much engaged in doing so. Nothing can stop me and my family from giving the Earth the highest degree. I hope so much will make a sequel.
