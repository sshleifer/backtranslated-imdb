There are four great movies depicting the Vietnam War. They are (in no particular order: Apocalypse Now, born on July 4, Platoon and finally Tigerland.) Tigerland focuses on the real war and the men in it. The Boz character is one of the most important depictions of a man who casts doubt on war, and the absurdity of what has happened in many war films, but rarely in the Boot Camp. It is also a very complex character whose method of dealing with his feelings and emotions are the driving force of this film. Position Boz makes this movie so good. It is a shame that he did not get a major release. It is evident in the field of every film fan next to the above film titles.
