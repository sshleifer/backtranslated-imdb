I will always have a delicate place for this movie, another part of their live action / animation part that has been trying to recreate the success of "Mary Poppins" and never quite done it. When I was in elementary school, we had a film day when the whole school got into the caf√© and the film would be screened in an old-fashioned way, with several discs and all. At the time it seemed to be a momentary opportunity anytime that day came and "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is one of the films I remember like this. And from what I remember, it's pretty charming. Angela Lansbury never made her name to anything she was not at least competent, and she wins here as a witch with a magical bed (a boy who might be misinterpreted, right?) Who can take her with some young children on magical adventures remote locations. Well, what would not the baby like this bed? <br /> <br /> Step: A
