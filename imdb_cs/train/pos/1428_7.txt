There is some spectacular, heart-stoppingly beautiful photography here of a variety of scenery and animals, from Arctic to Tropical and everything in between. Camera techniques are diverse and in place from close up to aerial work. The editing is huge and the commentary is also in place, just with the right tone and some dramatic and telling facts about our world. Where the film is falling, it attempts to cover and integrate four themes - seasonal patterns, climate change, individual animal stories and hunting / hunting interactions in different environments. In the end, it all bites a bit and is not related. Overall, it is worth seeing especially because of the problems they are facing, but they do not expect an Oscar.
