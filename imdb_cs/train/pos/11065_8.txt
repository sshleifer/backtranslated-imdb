This comedy with great pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail. There have been many films of this genre with more remarkable actors trying to achieve this elusive mix that did not come anywhere near the depth and oppression of this. This is for sure because the exceptional cast with excellent performances from Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy look so spontaneous that the reality of their characters quickly grabs your interest and emotions and keeps them all over the film. Initially, it appears that this action seems to be rather wallowed and saddened, but gradually learns that these two rather poorly damaged people desperately and reluctantly try to heal themselves, even incongruously, to each other. Rogers's heart-shaped facial expressions of wounded injury and Sheedy's angry explosion are so telling that one feels when they are watching them. You will care for these two sympathetic but deep-hearted people and hope they will succeed because they are in doubt and all hang on fine emotional threads. Hopefully the audience will learn more about director Rogers and ally Sheedy because this film proves their merits as a very successful actor no doubt.
