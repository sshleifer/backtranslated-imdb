To be honest, I had to go see this movie back, did not expect it much, but hey, I did not deceive, I had time. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is such a fresh breeze despite some of the things that have been trying to modernize Nancy Drew, but it reminded me of young 60-70s from Europe and Quebec where they managed to make children interacting with adults. In this case, a 16-year-old teen tries justice by trying to solve the mystery of the death of an actress who died 25 years ago. However, because her father had a shop in Hollywood, why not borrow the secret house behind the door? Well, at least Emma Roberts does a great job here. It's a bit like a dork boy who first naively brought his nurses back to Nancy, but eventually he found Nancy quite cool enough to keep her, even with her affairs ... <br /> <br /> The rest of the support is great and happy to see Rachael Leigh Cook in a different role this time: a single mother (she did it in Family Rescue, but this time she plays a mature woman ...) It does not look like it's fun!
