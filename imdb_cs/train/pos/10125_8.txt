This movie is the first trilogy of tricks of the Miikes triad, and the trilogy is a great start. Films in the trilogy are only thematically linked, and these themes are really noticeable in all of their films if you look close enough. The Shinjuku Triad Society is about a policeman who tries to prevent his brother getting too involved in a rather extreme gang of outsiders and fighting them up to Tokyos yakuza. A tiny brother is a lawyer, and the triad gang is increasingly struggling with the progress of the film. The film takes place in a very harsh environment and is therefore very violent and hard. Miike has made it worse, but because it's a serious movie, it's very hard for you. As usual, there are also many perverse sexes, mostly homosexuals in this. The film is in many ways a typical gangster film, but with a great drive and a real whistle. If you only saw Mikae's movies (Ichi's assassin, Fudo, etc.), it's a compromise between his aggressive style appearing in these films and his more serious side, as seen in other trilogy films. And as always with Miike, there are at least two scenes that you will NEVER ever forget (check out and see which ones for you). <br /> <br /> 8/10
