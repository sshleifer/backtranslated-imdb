I did not have much interest in watching The Flock. Andrew Lau co-directed the master trilogy of Infernal Affairs, but was fired from Flock and he was replaced by Emergency Director Niels Mueller. I had a feeling that Lau had made a good film, but did not get enough to study, so they fired him and hired another director. This usually does not work well (remember the invasion). But the flock ended better than I expected. great movie, but it's an interesting and fun thriller. Character development is very well done and I can know the characters very well. Also, the relationship between the two main characters is natural and credible. Richard Gere and Claire Danes bring competent performances. , let's go to the negative points. One element that really bothered me (it was the moment I was irritated) was a surplus of tricks to get the film "stance" and style. Their presence is arbitrary. Plus, I think the film should be more ambitious. Despite that, I recommend The Flock as a good thriller. It's not at all memorable, but it's fun.
