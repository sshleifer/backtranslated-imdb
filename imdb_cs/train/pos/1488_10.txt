This is one movie that shows you whether you want to marry or whether you are a married couple. This film features a couple in Italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion, infidelity, juggling and family. The so-called "culture of death" that we are experiencing today in the world is terrible and this movie will surely transform you. <br /> <br /> You have to see. I hope it gets as it should be. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the cast and the director. <br /> <br /> Two inches up and 10 ratings from me!
