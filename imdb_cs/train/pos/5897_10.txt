This movie must be featured on DVD. It was so funny and I loved it. Really, really cute and fun. Unrealistic but not a prerequisite. The only thing I did not like was that the girl relied too much on that guy. However, it represents a time period of thinking. I tried to shoot this movie for so long and it was not available in the US format only in the UK and it is not played on American DVD players. It's a sadly surprised Classic movie! Believe it or not, but this movie can easily become a favorite cult for all ages. It is a pity that we do not legalize certain things that could actually save small countries or our own. Lindy is unsinkable, a positive character, making lemonade lemonade. It's fun and charming. She stole the show!
