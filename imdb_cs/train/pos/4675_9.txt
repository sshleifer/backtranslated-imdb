I saw the "brotherly shadow" at the Tribeca Film Festival and I found out that I was thinking about it two days later. The story of a dead son (Scott Cohen), who returns to the family-owned furniture company behind the shadow in prison, offers all the necessary features of a solid drama - an unforgettable figure; sharp and attentive dialog box; sensitive use of the camera by a filmmaker who thinks visually. But more than that, it is something that is too rare in today's multiplex: the uncompromising vision of mature sensitivity. Dance talent of director and screenwriter Todd S. Yellin appears to have emerged, but we get a sense that he (as well as his protagonist) has paid his rewards. He knows how real people are fighting in this world and knows how we want to see - or at least - experience victory - success. Still, Yellin respects his audience too much to blow smoke into our backs. Finally, we can see that Jake's triumph does not lie in commissions, nor in the respect of his family, but he could not leave the "work" if he tried. <br /> <br /> (and especially the film industry) that can not stand above the 'bottom line'. This film deserves a wide audience.
