First of all, Riget is wonderful. Good comedy and mysterious thriller at the same time. A nice combination of a special "dogmatic" storytelling style along with good music and great actors. But unfortunately there is no end. As for me, it is unacceptable. I thought ... how could the story go without Helmer and Drusse? ... and I have some idea. I think Lars would have a different RIGET III. I'm sure the third part without Helmer would not be the same. So here's my suggestion. Maybe a little stupid, maybe not. I know Lars likes to experiment. So why not run a small experiment with Riget3? I think the only solution is to create puppet-based animation (for example Trey Parker's "team America") or even 3D animation. I know it's not the same as real actors, but basically I think it could work ... just so it's possible for the actors to feed again. For Riget fans, it should not be so big - if the animation is done in good measure, the average "observer" will consider it normal after the first few films. The most important thing is the story now. It is quite understandable that with actors today it is not possible to create Riget 3. So why not play with animation? And ... look at the options he gives you! Even marketing one! The great director finished his trilogy after 10 years of puppet animation. Just dreams? I hope to see Riget 3 once ... or just see the script. I'm curious how the story ends ... and how I expect - everyone here is doing it. <br /> <br /> Greetings, slaj ps: I'm not talking about Stephen King's "Kingdoms of the Hospital" ;-)
