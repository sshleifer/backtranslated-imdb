Woody Allen's second film in London. The Tarot Card Killer kills prostitutes in London. Journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) becomes the pinnacle to be Lord Peter Lyman (Hughem Jackman). It starts to love it, but it quickly falls in love. It helps the rider magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen), who does not like what he sees. I like it better than the overrated "match point" from last year. It was shorter and moved much faster. The conspiracy is old, but I enjoyed it and it let me guess until the end. It's not really a comedy, but a secret with some very good comedic lines (everything from Allen, of course). It's not one of Allen's best, but it's much better than his worst. Acting is largely very good. Allen is bad, but he played this character a million times before, and it's quite difficult. But Johansson and Jackman are great - they look fantastic and they give two very attractive credible performances. Also, Allen (surprisingly) works on their sexual attraction - there is a sequence in which both are in their bathing suits to take on their handsome bodies. The only real debauw is that Allen still does not know how he was shooting in London. He's not the same as he did on Match Point though - maybe he'll be better when he goes. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing. I give it 8.
