The "Chinese Story of the Spirit" is one of the most amazing movies in Hong Kong I've ever seen. It's a great mix of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror and martial arts. The movie has some wonderful visuals and amazing matches. the scene between Wu Ma and the tree demon language. Really original and refreshing film and other fine recommendations from Embalmer.
