In this Muppet movie are Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Scooter, Camilla, Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Animal, Janice and Zoot graduates of colleges who have decided to bring their successful college musical tune to Broadway. Unfortunately, neither producer nor Muppetsy meets. After too many producers have been refused, Scooter suggests that Muppets decide to act alone. However, Kermit still believes he can get his show on Broadway, but after he finally does and we all know he sells the show, Kermit gets amnesia and the others do not know where he is. <br /> <br /> It features many great scenes, including the live action sequence introduced by Muppet Babies, a wedding sequence full of Muppets, including Cast Sesame Street and Traveling Matt (from Fraggle Rock), Scooter as Cinema and Rizzo, and others rats cook breakfast. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that more characters were not included more. Of course, many of them appear at the wedding, but there should be some important roles for Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard and Sweetums, and Lips was to be part of The Electric Mayhem in this movie, like last season's The Muppet Show and The Great Muppet Caper and Miss Piggys Foo Foo was to be with her (after all, Rizzo The Rat, who also starred Steve Whitmire, had a big role in this film and was not well known at the time).
