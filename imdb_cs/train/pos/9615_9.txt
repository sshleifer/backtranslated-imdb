This is a great movie! Most of us have seen Jurassic Park, where the theory of chaos is summed up by the narrative about butterfly wings, causing a tornado on the other side of the planet. Well, the bug is all about it (or at least something, do not worry it's not a spoiler) I'm definitely not a religious type and I do not believe in the destiny, fate, etc. But this movie certainly makes you wonder if there really is a coincidence .. <br /> <br /> In addition, the acting and camera are excellent, further proves that it is still possible to make a good movie without a million dollars
