When I read a number of Scoop reviews in the last few days, I went to Woody's autumn theater. Fortunately, I could not be wrong. Woody, an artist, slows a touch or two, but Woody writer / director is in good shape - and found a trusted way to integrate my 70-year-old I into the story. According to obedience to the laughter and fury of the audience, Allenin heard one ship and dialogue in a way I did not see in a few years. <br /> <br /> In the film scene, dominated by software-approved story arcs, twenty sentences of taste and recipe for children is a source of satisfaction and inspiration for Allen to follow his highly personal and always rewarding journey.
