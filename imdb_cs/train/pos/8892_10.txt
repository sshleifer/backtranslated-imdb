Great, great, great! That's all I can say about this movie, but imdb want at least four lines of text to make it work. The cast was great (Jerry O'Connel is so cute!), The music was great (the 1960s had the best music ever, imho), the historical material was interesting and so was the way the actors from the 1990s were playing as if they were really in 60s. And most of all - the stories of the main characters brought tears to the eyes, and that is the size of some drama. BUT IN ONE WORD: LARGE!
