This movie is very entertaining and never boring or running for almost 3 hours. Al Pacino, Michelle Phieffer and the rest of the cast are great in the movie and are very credible. Violence was a bit extreme in the film, but it turned out how bad the drug traffic was at the time of the film. The end is amazing and one of the best scenes is one of the best. A great movie and you will really like it.
