Resident Evil: Veronica code is a great video-professional game, it has great graphics, very comfortable control, great story and fun factor. The story is Claire Redfield, who gets to the island for a twist on Umbrella plots and trigger triggering that they are the main lab in search of her brother. A copy of Veronica graphics is very good, fire and rain effects are great looking. The controls are comfortable, but the pattern button does not suit the Dreamcast control, which is hard to get used to. It's still fun when you walk around some uneven place and shoot your teeth from the zombie.Code: Veronica also has a little "Romance" between the two main characters. You can also play as Chris Redfield from Resident Evil 1. The sound in this game is better than ever, even though I hate a new feature. When the giant spiders crawl, their legs have a disturbing sound, and the weapons are much more realistic. Great graphics, great stories, comfortable controls and realistic sticl sound are Resident Evil Code: Veronica definitely beloved. I give it 10 out of 10.
