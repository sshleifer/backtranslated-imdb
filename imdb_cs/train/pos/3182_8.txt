The handsome, temperamental pilot of the British airline George Taylor (a solid portrait of Guiseppe Pambieri) gets whip after a crazy night in Hong Kong. George meets and falls in love with sweet and virgin dr. Ema Wong (a gentle and charming performance of the beautiful Chai Lee). George gets health and returns to work. When Emai will not hear George for a long time, she is desperate and becomes a prostitute. While director / co-author Bitto Albertini is actually delivering a satisfying amount of anticipated tasty nudity and watering the soft core of sex, this film is something different than your routine that is hidden in a skewed elf. Instead, it is a surprisingly thoughtful, moving and tragic love story between two well-drawn and highly appealing characters (Chai like Emy Wong is especially radiant and cute). The image begins to be bubbling and cheerful, but the tone is radically shifting to a darker and tougher mood about two thirds of the way. Emmy's descent into a crime after he falsely assumes that George has left her is sorrowful and disturbing; as well as remarkably sad and heartbreaking surprises. It is true that the narrative is certainly melodramatic, but never too stupid or creepy. In addition, sexual scenes are very tasteful and even really erotic. The well-known Italian porn star Ilona Stallero has a pretty strong support part like George's jealous and unfinished secretary, Helen Miller. Guido Mancori's polished cinematography offers many surprisingly beautiful shots of exotic places. Nico Fidenco is a horrified, pulsating score hit by a groovy place. It is worth looking for those looking for something else.
