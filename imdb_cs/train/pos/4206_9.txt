Skip McCoy is a three-pound pocket that can not restrict the instincts on the street, choosing a Candy purse on a subway train. What she does not realize is that Candy carries a top-secret microfilm, a microfilm that is a great concern for many organizations. Director Samuel Fuller created an extraordinary drama, located between the submerged New York City underworld. Communist spies and shady government officials are all gathered to make Pickup On South Street beat from the first minute to the last. Based on Dwight Taylor's story Blaze of Glory Fuller, this adaptation with a heavy political agenda excited, something that many felt at the time that it was over, but focused only on its anti-communist tendencies, makes it a major downfall. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> It's a pretty good success that Fuller created one of the best anti-heroes of the 1950s and I'm sure he was very grateful to Richard Widmarck's performance as McCoy, all the smile and the cold cold heart, his concerts with the wonderful Jean Peters Candy is excellent and is that movie heart. However, she is nominated for The Oscar Thelma Ritter, who plays the actor's awards, her Moe is strong and as crazy as the characters around him, but for her is the tired heat that Ritter expresses majestically. <br /> <br /> It's B movie in texture, but the movie in execution, Pickup On South Street is a truly elegant and entertaining film that is the best of its most exciting directors. 9/10
