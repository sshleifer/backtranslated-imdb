Bore normal movie movies that look at Halloween I've seen over and over again, I got a chance at "The Sentinel," I hope to get my horror juices again. I thought I just came back when I saw the remake of Dark Castle "House on Haunted Hill" - complete and total bullshit. Fortunately, "The Sentinel" BLEW ME AWAY! In the film about the model that moved to a haunted Brooklyn Deep building, the film offered everything I hope to find in a good movie - (1) Camps and fantastically juicy characters, exchanges and dialogue, including the horrific stories of Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum and in particular, Martin Balsam, as an absent professor - (2) Horrible terror! (3) Fantastic gore, amazing make-up and a handy (though very irregular) direction from Michael Winner, who is rather nice with this unreal current. treat. If you loved "Evil Dead 2", "Dead Alive" and "Deep Rising" - it will be your favorite queen. Just to emphasize my love for this film - after watching it for the first time, I fell into my forehead, overturned it and watched it again. It is now one of the favorites of all time. Take a favor and look at it!
