The title of this film almost did not allow me to watch. Not just a Manchester United fan, Beckham's just mention of Beckham was a little out of the way, but I've passed on my prejudices and I'm glad I did. I did not expect much movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. The film has never been with me and I have enjoyed it every second of the movie. If you like the East's East, then you'll love this movie. OK, so the story is nothing new and the classic storylines are contained in the movie, but everything is done very fun and with fresh air. The film moves very fast and keeps the audience entertained. Occasional fun moments are a good taste and not a bad humorous attempt, and it's best a good British comedy.
