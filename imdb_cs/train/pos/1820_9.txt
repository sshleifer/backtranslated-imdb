I remember the movie, since I was young, I loved it and I still do it. I managed to get it on DVD for my 18th birthday and was overjoyed because I found it so difficult to find it earlier and it was only to be leased when I was younger. My favorite character is Charlie because he learns to be a good dog. The film is full of fun songs and music. The animation is great and the characters are perfect. This film has always been tearjerker for me, but I think if I did not see the movie when I was young, I would not have seen it as brilliant and fascinating as I did, even though I still believe I will like it because I'm really into animated movies.
