A mild, enchanting little film that is sure but perfectly carved. Gwyneth Paltrow is shining at this early show for her British accent, and the actress gathered around her is evolving. It appeared around the time of Sense and Sensibility and I'm sure I do not know why they all got the Oscar's attention. Emma is the most accessible and the smallest thing Jane Austen, she said well.
