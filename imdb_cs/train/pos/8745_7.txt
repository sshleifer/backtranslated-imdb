After graduating from high school, the best friends Alice and Darlene decide to travel to Thailand. While there they are meeting a charming Australian guy named Nick. After spending some time with Nick, he asks if they want to visit a weekend trip to Hong Kong. They agree. At the airport, however, they are released for drug smuggling and then sentenced for 33 years in Thai prison for something they claim they did not. They do not know what to do but contact Yankee Hank, an American lawyer who lives in Thailand with his wife. The word is that if you have money, it can help. Things start well, but they can not get out. The movie is really good because it does not allow what happens and is interesting all the time. But I could not believe it was over. It was one of those endings where you do not know 100% true, but you still know what happened to Nick and drug smuggling for "ownership" etc. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale here provide quite good performances . But Beckinsale's performance was a bit weak. Both friends of Danes and Beckinsales are good, but they seemed to be stronger. Paul Walker even has a small unrealistic role. ;) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I thought Brokedown Palace is a good movie and I give it 7/10.
