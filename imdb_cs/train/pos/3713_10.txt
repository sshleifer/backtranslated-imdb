This film is about style, atmosphere and acting. It is true that I did not believe all the development of the land, but it did not matter - amazing acting, unexpected conspiracy plot, and a glamorous atmosphere that drew me straight in and brought me on the road and I had a great time. Kenneth Branagh is not only a great actor but also a master of accents, and proves once again the flawless accent of Georgia. He is surrounded by so many supportive talents (Robert Downey, Jr., Embeth Davidtz of Schindler Leaf and Fallen, Tom Berenger, Daryl Hannah and Robert Duvall) that I just blew. I recently bought a copy of this movie and I never have to look around. One of the best thrillers of the year. If you ignored this movie (and you have a chance), I suggest you check it out.
