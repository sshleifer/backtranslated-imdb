Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here. Cage and Boyle are all right, but what gives this neo-noir its juice is Hopper's haunted, violent character and JT Walsh sneakiness. The one who moves is wrong with a man and tries to make a little bit of dough from it, but gets across his head. At the beginning of the scene of this movie, I found a strange parallel when Cage's entry to the Wyoming trailer got a drill job with the help of his buddies ... and the opening scene at Brokeback Mountain when the character did the same! But that's another story. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper is in the best of what is here ... jagged, one-stage vicious, shrill, and explosively violent. JT Walsh (RIP) is also great as a man with a dark past, trying to live legally (well, almost). <br /> <br /> There are only 4 real characters, except for the hardworking agent in Red Rock, Wyoming. The first procedure appears at the beginning and from there it's a nice neo-new adventure in some sleepy town. Satisfying. 8 points.
