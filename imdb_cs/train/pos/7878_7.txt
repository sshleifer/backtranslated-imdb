As the story goes in my family, my dad, Milton Raskin, played the piano for Dorsey. After Sinatra joined the band, my dad practiced with him for hours. Then my father said to Sinatra that he was really good to be tied up with such a small group (band) and that he should dare himself. At that time, Sinatra had enough credits under his belts to do it! Dorsey never forgave my father, and the rest, as they say, is history. I got some pictures and records and Berkeley University in California. <br /> <br /> I've seen almost every Sinatra film more than I would say, and his films never get older. . . Thank you Frank
