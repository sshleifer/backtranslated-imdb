Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor McLaglen are three soldiers in 19th-century India who, with the help of a water boys (Sam Jaffe), got rid of thuggee murder. Chemistry among actors helps make this one of the most fun movies of all time. Sam Jaffe is exceptional as a discarded water boy who is ill-treated to all and still wants to be accepted as a soldier in society. It is free from the poem Rudyard Kipling. Everyone who enjoys this type of movie must see it.
