I'm totally addicted to this show. I can not wait until the week comes to show another show. it's a great story line and the show is the best actor and actress. I will tune every week to watch it, even if I'm not at home I always have my VCr set on the band monarch bay. simon rex is the best actor on the show. is thrilling and exciting. I think this show should stay in the air, and I believe everyone should tune in to watch it. I saw the first episode and I really did not want to watch it, but one day I watched my life and decided to watch it because it was and I absolutely love it and right now it's my favorite show. I really mean it.
