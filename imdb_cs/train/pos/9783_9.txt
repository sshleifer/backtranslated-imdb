How can you say that Peaches with their complicated story dealing with many problems, the "little TV idea" is outside of me. In addition, I can think of many movies that have a "little TV idea" on their land. Your apparent dislike of the television industry ("Sue Smith could not grow up over her TV background") is confusing. especially when you have such a "great time" on TV. If we could all be as talented as Mrs. Smith (no, I'm not a girlfriend or a relative) - the AFI Award for King of the Bride, the Way of Coorain, etc. Everything made for television. Think about what other "small television ideas" such as "Against the Wind", "Bodyline", "Forgiving", "Scales of Justice", "Blue Murder", "Water Under the Bridge," etc. I think Peaches is a good fun movie I was interested in and most of my friends also from start to finish. That's far from perfect, but I think it's one of the best Australian films I've seen in recent years. Who knows that with a few more views (there's so much we can think of), it could be just a classic like "The Year My Voice Broke," "The Devil's Playground." I really enjoyed this film much more than "Somersault" and "Three Dollars". I think these films had their moments - surrealistic, atmospheric, realistic and dealing with important contemporary issues, but as far as entertainment for mr.and mrs of average filmmaker and me was concerned, it was very common, if not boring. When I go to the movie, I've always been aware of the audience's reaction to the movie (through the reactions in the cinema and listening to interviews in the foyer and loo). Some came out of the Peaches that shook their heads, some with negative criticism, but many of them seemed to enjoy experience.
