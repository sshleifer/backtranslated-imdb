The first film of the film shows a mining ridge in the morning autumn fog, and my thought was: "That's almost too beautiful." And it goes on as follows: Landscapes and animals that look like a number of romantic images, each of which is perfect in every detail. Even a girl's room, her father's car - everything is nostalgic, romantic, beautiful. It may seem obsolete and leaky, but it suits the story, which is in itself a quiet beauty that is happening on the border of life and fairytale between Diane Fossey and Le Petit Prince. Every minute I enjoyed it. Extreme parsimony of the film, which had a simple, slow story, only one actor and few special effects, developed a strong charm. That's why I find it regrettable that at the last minute I gave up this parsimony when two other actors suddenly introduced themselves (a girl as an adult woman and her son). Another drawback is music that is often disturbing, Hollywood and sometimes inappropriate: I could not bring English pop-song along with French mountain glory. I went to the film together with two little daughters, but I recommend it to adults because they appreciate this film. Of course, not everyone.
