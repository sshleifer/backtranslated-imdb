Rating "10/10" Masterpiece A few years ago I heard that Spielberg commented that here and there the film would happen again and again if he had a chance. Well, Mr Spielberg, I think nothing is perfect, but this movie - along with Schindler's list - is the best. Even Oprah works well in this! <br /> <br /> What made me the most is story realism and drama. Such things have happened and are still happening in the world.
