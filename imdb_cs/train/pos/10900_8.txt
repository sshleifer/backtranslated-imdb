It was a document I had to see when I missed an opportunity in 2004, so I was definitely looking at repetition. I really sympathized with the main character of the film, because it's true I have a milder condition of the skin problem he had, Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). It's a sad, sometimes fun and very emotional documentary about a boy with a severe skin disorder. Jonny Kennedy talks like a child (due to the loss of vocal muscles) and never went through puberty but is 36 years old. Most sympathetic moments see his horrible condition and carry bandages. Jonny had a pretty nagging sense of humor, even telling the tombs when he showed his body in a coffin. He tells his story with the help of his mother Edna Kennedy, his older brother and celebrity model, and Jonny's supporter Nell McAndrew. She won BAFTA for Best Actress and Best New Director (Factual) and was nominated for Best Sound (Factual) and Flaherty Documentary Award. It was the number 10 on 100 biggest TV shows in 2004. You have to see a documentary!
