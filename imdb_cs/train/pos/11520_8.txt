A remarkable road movie ... if your ideas about road movie include three future wizards with East European accents and Claire Forlani. (One in four is not bad ...) No talented magician with a look at showmanship (Max) watches a very experienced pocket (Hugo) who runs his store in New York. After Hugo convinced that he (Max) is a) mentally and ab) desperately needs a partner to make his dreams of being a magician on the stage, not so the dynamic duo acquires the managerial knowledge of the inventor of the illusions Milo) and ah, the finer attributes of beautiful waitress (Lydia). Unlikely four stacks in the van (obtained by Hugo ... you guess where it comes from) and head to Vegas. Havoc is a consequence. Anyway, it's fun, it's well written and the end is surprisingly good. A solid comedy with a warm heart, and so it was better that it was completely unexpected.
