Clint Eastwood returns to Dirty Harry Calahan in Dirty Harry. Clint is older, but he still has it, Harry has been given a holiday after some trouble that has happened because of the robbery (where the unforgettable "Make My Day" comes from)! But the city that took the holiday was worse, the woman became vigilante after the attack on rape at the snorkeling and began to get punks one after another. The last movie Sandra Locke saw in Clint Eastwood! Improvement after The Enforcer, which was a bit more comedy and less serious. Clint Eastwood's sunglasses were Gargoyles, which are best known for sunglasses worn by Arnold Shwartzeneger at The Terminator. You are worth the attention if you like Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry movies or action thriller action.
