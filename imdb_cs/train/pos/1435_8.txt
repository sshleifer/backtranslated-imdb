I appreciate such films: intelligent and well-crafted, fun, absorbing, well acting and nicely oriented. Nobody - even Pacino - chews the landscape *, tries to stand out; one of the most effective moments in the movie (Aielo, which stretches on her beloved ramp) is just mitigating because of the limitations. <br /> <br /> It's not as good as when you say, QUIZ SHOW, CITY HALL has a similar substance: involvement of the mind as well as eye, ear and heart. Why is anyone like that well-carved fun in the box office? <br /> <br /> * You know, Pacino chews in one particular scene, but precisely because it's necessary. Great scene too.
