It's a long lost horror gem with star Sydney Lassick ("Carrie" and others) and Barbara Bach. Sometimes it's hard to find a copy of this movie, but it's worth it. This film is both scary and cheesy. It seems that three young newlyweds (Karen, Vicky and Jennifer) travel to the small town of Solvang, California, to cover the festival when they talk to their hotel room and seek refuge in the house of Earnest Keller (Lassick) and his strange wife, Virginia . Vickie stays in his back, feeling bad, while the other 2 are gone to shoot their story. She is soon murdered by the house, in a very gentle way, some unknown power is hiding in the ventilation system (she is decapitated by closing the debris cover as it collapses on her while she is pulled over and into the basement). Soon Karen returns and she is murdered in a brutal way by her face thrusting through the ventilation lid. Jennifer struggles with her (ex?) Lovers in a rather boring partial conspiracy, and when she returns home, her hosts (who we've already discovered as brother and sister and what's in the basement are their son) think of a conspiracy that has also attempted kill her. Virginia totally disagrees with Earnest's plan to kill Jennifer but she is cheated to go to the basement where she meets Juniors. Here the film is almost funny because Junior (hysterically portrayed by Stephen Furst) is a distorted, mentally inadequate male man whose actions and movements cause a few giggles, even if it is to be scary. This is where the pace of the movie rises and the end is well done. Actors / actresses are doing amazing work with material, especially Lassick, Furst and Bach, and though it's not the most frightening movie ever, it's very fun!
