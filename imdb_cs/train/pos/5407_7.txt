I've always enjoyed Pokemon movies. Yes, I know, they are all very dirty in some areas, average and certainly, although they are targeted at young children, they are too grown in some fields to protect them by saying, "Hey, you'll lighten it, it's a kid's movie," but all aside, are not they still good fun? In my opinion, it is so and I very much like you. This is as pleasant as the previous three, and is definitely better. It has really sweet and touching moments because it's a nice, fresh Pok√©mon Celebration. It's not the best movie Pokemon, but it's more than third, though the third is not bad and the whole series is fun, harmless, fun family popcorn and should not be considered as nothing more, no less. This movie has some high signs of intensity and interest, especially around the top / end, as well as all repayments and characters, while a bit more nuanced than the previous three, I thought, are still pleasant and humorous. This film is the smallest and most criticized of the four length adjustments and does not deserve it.
