In New York, family dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) meets randomly on his street with former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler). Charlie became a lonely and angry man after losing his wife and three daughters in a tragic September 11, while Alan has problems with his wife discussing her deepest feelings. Alan recalls his friendship with Charlie and becomes close to each other. Alan tries to fix Charlie's life and send him to psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie has an aggressive response to treatment and is sent to court. "Reign Over Me" is a good drama about loss, friendship, family and loneliness. September 11 is not relevant to the plot; it could be a car accident, fire or any other tragedy, as well as Donna Remar's sexual harassment played by the wonderful Saffron Burrows, Alan. But the family drama works, supported by great imagination by Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is quite incapable of being recognized, I do not know if she uses excessive makeup to look older, but her face is weird. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Reine Sobre Mim" ("Reign Over Me")
