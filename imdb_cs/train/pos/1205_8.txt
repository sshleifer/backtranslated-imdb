This movie is exactly what his title describes - an attempt to buy what writers have to offer. <br /> <br /> First, it's a little fun to see Toronto in the style of 1996, which I remember with all his silly hairstyles, sunglasses, clothes and attitude. It did not really change; just a nice, safe, cheap, provincial small urban garden that makes a great place to meet international movie types! It's also fun to see Kenny and Spenny head to Los Angeles and find out that it's Toronto again, with a strange selection of beach bums, musicians, players and even more feverish types of movies. <br /> <br /> Pitch is not seen as a movie to look forward to; it's not fun if the viewer does not look forward to pulling one's desire. I will take Pitch as a warning that power and money are actually stored in studios and production houses. Writers, musicians and actors who will want (and "succeed") continue to be simple transient events even when they reach Great Time. So Kenny and Spenny are trying to sell you a warning. Buy it or not, but the message still exists.
