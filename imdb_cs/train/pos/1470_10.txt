There is a danger with the critic / philosopher Slavoj Zizek with his film, directed by Sophie Fiennes, who together combines the amazing amalgam of silent, horror, sci-fi, surrealistic and other contemporary thrillers together to make his Freudian points a comparison of congestion. But in Pervert's film guide he also makes far-reaching points of departure from any other analysis I have seen on the collective of films. While this does not include the extensive territory Scorsese films documentary, there are the same attachments and Zizek has a certain love for all these "perverse" examples and films, especially the works of Hitchcock, Lynch, Chaplin and Tarkovsky. Still, it should not wait - if you find it, I should have seen it almost happily - Zizek will try and split all the psycho-sexual parts or parts that relate to them in a dull, confused way. If anything that opens one to points that should never be considered different, some would think of Marx's three brothers as representing Id, Super-Ego, and Ega (Harpo's example is the most dead for me). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> by violence in dealing with one's own self, as well as by being dual in oneself. He even throws a piece of key moment in Sith's Revenge when Anakin becomes Darth Vader, and the consequences that turn away fatherhood under this back mask when his children were born elsewhere. The ideals of paternity, male sexuality, the male view of how imagination turns into reality (at the time when Zižek rightly points to the moment of nightmare), and female subjectivity, are examined perhaps most deadly with Vertigo. Тvodu предполага ◀, ìm detecting podnik, komu Non-body, HellSpy contributed /> Now it would be a pity if Žžížek himself made these honest, excited and probably probably acceptable points, just to turn directly to the camera or to the voice, as Scorsese does. But it is a step further to emphasize your fantasy and reality, and overlap, intersect, become the same, or expand more fundamentally into some underworld or the initial sense of some characters (for example, the Lost Road) In places where movies take place , the most interesting thing is that he first sees him in a boat "pointing" towards the same tip of Tippi Hedren's ship, which leads to the beginning of the birds; Equally funny is when a blue velvet lawn is being watered, which continues to explain the versatile points of Frank Booth; just one when it's in a Solaris-like area, it looks a little raw. Zizek, however, seems to have a lot of fun with this set, and after some time he is bypassing the potential ring of this trick, and Zizek's words go through. There were some films I would have expected, especially from Hitchcock and Lynch, but the tribute to film enthusiasts comes from seeing two things - films that would never have come to be seen in a movie about Pervert's film guide Disney Pluto cartoon and exhibition on Chaplin's films, though with a great remark on the strength and distinction of "voice") and those they have not yet seen (ie the film horror film Dr. Mabus, Stalker, among several others) that inspire the immediate feelings of "wow I have to see it immediately, no questions. "Zizek is a powerful writer and makes it clear that he reminds us why we look at films at first glance to have fun, but also have a real sit-down experience and have something there, as he said, looking into the toilet, it is probably one of the best movies about the cinema and in such an amazing analysis of how Freud works in movies about the desire, Id / Super-Ego / Ego, and supernatural fantasy that you may never see ... Finally, the distribution will eventually kick off, and only on the smallest levels.
