Anna (Charlotte Burke), who is on the verge of puberty, is beginning to have special dreams that begin to influence her in real life - especially with a boy named Mark (Elliott Spiers), whom he meets in his dreams. <br /> <br /> Very unusual fantasy with some really scary moments. Despite being a teenage girl and a PG-13 rating, it's not for kids. Also, if you hate fancy, stay away. But if you're playing something else, it fits into your account. But the direction of Bernard Rose with just a beautiful musical score and a few nice, terrifying tremors. The only thing that prevents Burke from being a really great movie is not a very good actress (it's no surprise that this is her only film), and that's what the film is hurting. But everyone else is great. <br /> <br /> Spire is as good as Mark; Glenne Headley is also very good because Anna's mother and Ben Kris are both frightening and sympathetic as Anna's father. <br /> <br /> The sleeping hit when he was released in 1988 has since disappeared. That's bad - it's really good.
