As the first feature film with director Robert De Niro (although not released later this year), it is worth watching. De Niro's role is not enormous and fun as one of two friends who first try to prevent another marriage friendship only later persecuting him to force him into it. Any hard-hitting fan of De Niro gets kicked out of early performance probably the best actor today.
