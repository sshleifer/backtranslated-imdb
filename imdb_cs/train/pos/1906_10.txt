Unfortunately, the 8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter were the last comedy John Ritter was supposed to work for after his tragic death in 2003. He was one of my favorite actors. (Katey, Amy, Kaley and Martin) John (Katey, Amy, Kaley and Martin) John (Katey, Amy, Kaley and Martin) John was a star, it was mainly the reason why I was drawn to the show at first glance, and it was his perfect comedic release that cracked me all the time. <br /> <br /> I loved how the show was not all sweet sweet (just as I loved the Cosby Show, come, they were too nice to myself lol) they portrayed typical family dynamics brilliantly. It was pretty realistic with all the siblings of rivalries and quarrels amongst their parents, but they still kept it funny. A lot of US sitcoms try to make an exhibition of pure morals and what not, and this show did not do it. Yes, there were some, such as tackling important issues like drugs and bullying, but they did not try to be anything but fun family comedy. The way she wrote John's death demo was great, I always sob like a child every time I see her. You felt emotionally emotional during these incredibly hard episodes. I'm sad that the show has been canceled, I still enjoy watching the rerun and it never gets tired of me. <br /> <br /> John Ritter, you always remember that you liked this spectacular picture of this protective father who would rather lock the daughters in their room than let them give a boy =) You rock Ritter!
