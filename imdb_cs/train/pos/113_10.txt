I have not seen this movie in about 5 years but still haunts me. <br /> <br /> When I asked about my favorite movies, it's the one I think I always mention first. There are certain films (works of art such as Dark City and Breaking the Waves) that seem to touch the inside of you, a place so protected and hidden, yet so sensitive that they create a lifelong impression on the viewer, unlike life-changing events such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend ... This movie "shook" me when I first saw him. He left me an emotional hangover that lasted for several days.
