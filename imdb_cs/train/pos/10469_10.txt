I remember seeing promos for this show before it first appeared in 1993. At that time, I was eight, and now at the age of 22 it's strange to see this cultural show start and finish and look at it. they suddenly seemed so far away, what had been a great decade. Anyway, I've watched MonsterVision all the time, because I'm a huge fan of movie monsters and horror films. It was like the 90th Chiller Theater. If MST3K can get a DVD why not a Joe Bob show, at least MonsterVision was more interesting and informative. A lot of comments and information about Joe Bob's movies were just cheerful. Most of the films featured in the show were class B or C, but also a lot of A-type films, as well as Hammer's films from England, which are the most important piece of work, as well as many with the majestic stop of Ray Harryhausen. There have been many flashes that you would not see anywhere else, like Japanese sci-fi movies, of course, Godzilla, which is known to almost all and independent films such as Metal Storm and Motel Hell. With the new film preservation decade and independent director directors, I think MonsterVision would be a good show IFC could pick up because they already have a hit with the IFC grind house show. I'm sure this show will be picked up again for nostalgia sometimes, I think she'll have to wait and see. In the meantime, "It's great TV"!
