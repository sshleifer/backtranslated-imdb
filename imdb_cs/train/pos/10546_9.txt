I was thinking about this movie because I released a free new release from Free Bloc and had to grab something quickly because the store was preparing for the evening. A crazy white cover and the title caught me. I am a (relatively speaking) "old" lady and my son is a young man at the age of 30. I love movies that are totally entertaining, such as Sixth Sense, Vampire Interview, Harry Potter and Beetlejuice. My son, on the other hand, is a graduate of the film and has very specialized foreign films such as those directed by Bergman or Hertzog. In general, we hate each other's film choices. However, we both watched and loved the film NEVER! It was not a movie we've ever seen. We are both cynical / critical of the personality, and we usually crack the movies when we watch them - but in this case we just laughed and enjoyed the movie from start to finish. We believe that if this film were promoted and depicted in major US dramas, it really would have worked.
