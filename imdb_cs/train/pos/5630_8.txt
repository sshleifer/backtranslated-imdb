Marjorie (excellent and inconspicuous performance Farrah Fawcett) is avoided by an attack in her car by a bad serial killer Joe (greatly played with the dreadful conviction and intensity of James Russ). But Joe stole his wallet and found out where Marjorie lived. He will visit one fatal day. After exposing Marjorie to great aggravation and psychological abuse, Marjorie managed to turn the tables on Joe and lock him into the fireplace. What does Marjorie do with Jo? Director Robert M. Young and scriptwriter William Mastrosimone create a cruel, frantic and often disturbing story of morality that deserves brutal brutality and painful suppression of rape, and at the same time shows that any person who gets into extremes is able to shock violent and inhuman acts . Joe perceives women as objects, while Marjorie only sees Joe as an "animal". However, this film to his admirable credit refuses to get Joe out to be just a nasty one-dimensional creep; instead, it is a terribly true and utterly honest human monster with his wife and child (especially Joe's veritable religion is truly dizzying). Fawcett and Russo are both excellent leaders; they receive subtle support from Diana Scarwid as a passive Terry, Alfre Woodard as a reasonable Patricia, and Sandy Martin as sympathetic police officer Sudow. Both Curtis Clark's agile cinematography and J.A.C. Redford's mad, scratching on the skin significantly increases the claustrophobic tension. Real power plant.
