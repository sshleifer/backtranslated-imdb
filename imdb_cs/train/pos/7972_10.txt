I watch this movie all the time. I followed this with a family age of 3 to 87 years and all of them; Everyone loved her. It really shows the real scenes the dog has, and the love and fidelity you get from pet. Just beautiful. <br /> <br /> It's great for those who love comedy movies, tear-jerker movies or even pets. The music is amazing, the animals are magnificent, the scenes are really thoughtful and the characters are perfect. What I liked is a true and fairly mixed personality: Shadow (The Oldest, Golden Retriever) It's wise, full of wisdom and the thought of a dog, Chance (American bulldog puppy) is basically a puppy humorous side, comic character; A Sassy (Cat Hymilayan) It's a real cat that shows what a real cat will do for her owner, a real girl.
