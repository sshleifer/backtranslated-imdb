I have to start with Ed Furlon on this. You must. God bless this child. $ 5 dollars says the character he's playing in this movie is what he really likes in real life. She has one or two, which made me almost blown away because of the fine humor in the script. You know all the attempts this guy has undergone in recent years, and neither does Furlong even seem to be acting. Maybe that's why his performance was good. Like Madsen. You are constantly thinking, "I bet that this man is really like real life." Does Madsen even have to act? It's natural. Vosloo apparently moved from a Mummy man. I think the greatest surprise of this film was the performance of Jordan Spiro. Her reactions are stains in this film. I was fighting when it was hot or not, but I realized I wanted to see her more. <br /> <br /> It's not a big fan of shoot / em movies and hostages. But I'm a fan, there are movies with lots of twists and turns to try to keep guessing. It's not just the standard burglars who take over the bank, they kill the hostages, and the good guys win the final type of movie. The vomiting is still coming ... and they're coming. Caf√© scenes work best with hand held cams to show how it really looks. She did not feel anything. On some scenes in the cafe you can imagine the Bourne Ultimatum "lite" style. And for those Bo Boys fans - actor Curtis Wayne (who plays Karl) will make you double. These boys are twins. As I watched, I realized why some actors had a strange accent and what they were doing in this small town. In the end, it made sense that these people were smuggling things to other countries / states to have these accents. But more is revealed in bonus features, as some producers wanted to make this film for an international audience with some of their stars that we may not have heard. And some of them smoke hot. Moncia Dean? I need to say more.
