Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is mad with her average temperamental colleagues. When they suggest they need an assistant, it sounds like a final insult, but when the first applicant is a former husband, Paul (Vincent Cassel) takes the chances of changing his life. Carla covers his mistakes, and he, trying to go straight, unwillingly helps to avenge his colleagues. <br /> <br /> When Paula asks Carla to return her favor, she finds herself trapped in a criminal underworld dominated by a ruthless lonely shark, Marchand (Olivier Gourmet). She recognizes her ability to read as a weapon as no one has negotiated, the two set off to make justice. <br /> <br /> The third feature of French director Jacques Audiard, "Read My Lips," is a genre-resisting piece, moving from a dark social comedy into a visceral full thriller.
