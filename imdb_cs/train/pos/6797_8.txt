Some bad reviews here and I understand why, but I understand it as a low budget serial killer movie and you can get more of it than most. I thought it worked so, because I was dirty and wanted to take a long shower, so it's a degree of success, is not it? I would say there's the right level of slumber here to get under the skin, even if the acting is maybe a little too unequal. David Hess is just in this briphle, so do not make your hopes too much if you like Last House. Besides - it's worth seeing.
