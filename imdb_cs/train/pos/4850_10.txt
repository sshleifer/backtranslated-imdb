So your twins are gone to sleep? Does a woman visit a mother in law? You are home. Is it a dark and turbulent night and there is no football on the bodies and the stacker needs to be stacked? So what are you going to do now? <br /> <br /> I will tell you this! <br /> <br /> Go make old-fashioned cocoa (Frys is the best!) Grab some ginger nuts and sit in front of the DVD. Now select and play Arthur Askeys World War two thriller / horror The Ghost Train, return to this comfortable sofa and enjoy the evening! <br /> <br /> Ghost Train is an Original British Classic War! Arthur Askey with his side kick, Stinker Murdoch, you enjoy and I suspect cast, high octane, excitement and leakage, espionage thriller.It is set in old rural England during the Second World War. <br /> <br /> It centers around a diverse group of people who need to stay overnight, beyond the circumstances beyond their control, in the old railway waiting room, which finds them persecuted by an old train. The story unfolds neatly and precisely, and it is the result of the whole cast, it is humorous in parts and sometimes really scary! <br /> <br /> (The story was written by the old boy Godfrey of Dads Army Glory and it's smart) Arthur Askey is fun and is pretty much at home preforming his routines on you and casting, he also shows he can act a bit! Cast, however, is never unconventional, even a railroad porter and a parrot help the film with the necessary gravity. Oh, and when it's over, do not forget to put the dishwasher on the dishes!
