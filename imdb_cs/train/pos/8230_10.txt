Eglimata (crime story) is the story of small crimes that every day committed that an absolute catastrophe could occur in the crazy scenario. One of the smartest Greek series ever! Actors such as Ketta Konstadina and Maria Kavogianni showed a whole new dimension of self and talent and gave us moments of incredible "wine" laughter. Every viewer seemed to recognize the wrong side of himself in one of the characters, or at least on the side of himself, which they want. Actors of all ages who played larger and smaller parts gained the same space in the heart of the Greek spectator. My personal favorites (except the first two I mentioned) are Vassilis Haralambopoulos, Athinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidis, but so many amazing actors have gone through some episodes from time to time. Who would understand Greek all over the world should find a way to watch this series, although it was over 5 years ago that it was on TV. In Greece, they repeat the series (ANT1) in every chance that they are like summer or early afternoon zones. We will never forget the Eglimat or casting crew!
