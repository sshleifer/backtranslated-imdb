First of all, you think this movie is almost fifty years old! Still, it is still one of the best movies of all time. I wonder how many of today's full-range shots will be spoken in 2050? The story is simple, yet strong enough and the effects are phenomenal for today. I kept remembering how I first watched this as a child when the monster came into the force field that protected the ship and you saw its outline first and only. If I was trembling with fear, I can tell you. It looks like today, but more than effective. Tiger scenes show their age. You can see the outline where the tiger was glued to the Altairo shots, but they are only visible. Similarly, the effect by which the animal is shattered by Krell's door is beautifully done. <br /> <br /> It is also amazing to see Leslie Nielsen (better recalled as Airplane and Naked Gun) as a young but still mature man. He was 30 years old when this movie came out! Almost 80! <br /> <br /> Everyone in all the good movie that will surely continue to be popular for years to come. Timeless.
