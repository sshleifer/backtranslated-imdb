I remembered this as one of my favorite books as a child and wanted to read my five-year-old daughter for a while. I knew the movie would come out soon, so we went to the library to get a book and give us a preview for the next day! We hurried home and spent a book in the afternoon to compare. Not necessary. The only thing in common between the book and the movie is the first name of the main characters, the fact that there is a bet and a lot of worms. Yeah yeah, I almost forgot, a boy who cooks most of the worms, he likes to show his masterpiece with a French accent. As children know, the number of children involved, the way the bet was made, the number of worms to eat, the time period in which they must eat worms, how they are cooked, friendship, the climax of the scene, etc., NEVER is the same. But somehow it did not destroy me. All the characters are nice and the film did not let me down. The word of prudence for parents was the moment you heard how adults in the room collectively drew their breath, and that was when Billy's little brother referred to his penis as a "little dick". The awkward part came when my daughter asked those who were sitting around us: "Does anyone know what a dirty bird is?" lol. This and the occasional "close" is as dirty as the movie. My daughter thought she might worsen around worms 3 and 4 (and kept a blank nacho container just for the case) but it was a great worm 6. She and I really enjoyed the movie and had a great time sharing experience.
