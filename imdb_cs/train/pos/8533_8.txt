This film is more Lupine than most, especially from Funimation. Other than the bad oak, it's not bad. The first lesson is much like comics (which is what Lupine is the third). Lupine tries to get a tremendous treasure. Fujiko uses Lupine's weakness against women to try to get something out of him. The last bit is not so bad, it's with other women, but Fujiko is, of course, his number one. Many of Lupine's other films are more Family with Cuss and Lupine. Any good fan of Lupine thinks he will be pleasantly surprised (I know I was after I heard so many bad things about this movie). It could be a bit better without the little animations returning during credits (they make it a little crazy), but overall it's not a bad movie. Well, to be one of the few to watch Lupin III again.
