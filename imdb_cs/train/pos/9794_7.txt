I thought the movie could be a bit more complicated, perhaps in a psychological sense, but action and voice acting were top-notch. Animation was a heavy CG in many scenes, but very good at it. This is one of Batman Returns / Forever films, including Wayne romance and conflicts, and motifs for dating. 007 fans would like it, like women, a great song on the topic! Wayne was very well portrayed in this film and Penquin returned to his true form, this time no mutant genes! I liked Robin not too used to, Tim Drake was just a good computer buddy, somewhat an Indigo child or the mind of the future. The supporting cast consisted of some star soap opera, decent talents and characters were drawn to look like voice actors. Kelly Ripa was cheerful in this movie. I've rated it under Phantasm, Return of the Joker and Batman vs. Dracula, but I liked a clever script than I liked Subzero. 7/10
