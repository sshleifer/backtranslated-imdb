Five years from Tenko survivors who came home and Marion's double edges "Well, that's it". Now it's 1950: meeting time. The gang is here: Marion, Bea, Ulrica, Kate, Dorothy, Christina, Dominik, and late friends Maggie and Alice. The story that is being developed is beaut: as perfectly written and committed, and as a thought provoking and moving as the original series. <br /> <br /> All questions that remained hanging at the end of the series are clearly answered here. From Marion's family to the Joss health center everything changed in five years, and not everything has changed for the best. A trip to the Dominika plantation brings a lot of bumps and some really high technology, seat tension. There is a real sense of tragedy and catastrophe, for the fate will again succeed and women will try to live. Dominica finally shows her true colors and there are some glamorous moments of drama. <br /> <br /> Fresh shooting place in Singapore and the opportunity to catch up with a group of women who feel like they've become friends. It's such a shame that it's really over. I could track it again. Perfection.
