This is one of the biggest movies I've ever seen. The whole movie was lit inside. Music and cinema held a spell when little was done on the screen. Slow pace was set by way of traveling (riding mower with a large trailer) and was kept in the background and the sounds and slow lives of other characters. <br /> <br /> The story really happened; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76. everything was as real as if the actors really changed into a character. Sissy Spacek gave her terrifying performance as a rather afflicted daughter who suffered much more, but she stepped forward, always wanting to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth was perfectly occupied and beautifully became Alvin Straight, a tough but loving elderly man walking across Iowa to visit his deceased brother, Lyle, who had a stroke. Alvin had learned a lot of wisdom during his life, and he seemed to have won the best of the people he was struggling with. The film underscores the importance of this man's family and hopefully all of us. I eagerly expect to see it again and again. Directed by David Lynch, this film proves his directing skills. Farnsworth was nominated for Best Actor Oscar; at 79, he was the oldest candidate for this prize.
