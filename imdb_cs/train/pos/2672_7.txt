"The Path of Hope" tells of a bad Turkish family and their odyssey of hope that goes to despair in the spiritual direction of Switzerland. Although this Oscar winning film is relatively well developed, it is essentially lacking and has a lot of implacability. Much of the 1.7 hours of the movie you get to the bus, get off the bus, get to the boat, get out of the boat, get in the van, get out of the van, etc; time that could have been better exhausted or omitted altogether. The story has a predictable conclusion, especially for those who are aware of the common crime of trafficking in illegal immigrants. Valuable and reasonably enjoyable watch, but overestimated.
