This movie is great! She touched my cold heart. I could not invoke the racial discrimination Antwone experienced because I live in my own country. I think it's really hard to be discriminated against. We watched this film in our sociology class at New Era University, and I did not know it was a true story, I thought it was just created by an intellectual who wanted to bring fresh air into the industry. It's very good. The part that shocked me was when Nadine abused Antwon (who was only six) sexually. If I were on my shoes, I could jump up a ten-storey high building. I greet him because he is so strong! The scene that touched me is when Antwone eventually saw his mother Eve face to face. He did not leave her anything, instead of telling her about the success he had received over the years when they were separated. (I think I'll do it when I get a chance to trace my roots.)
