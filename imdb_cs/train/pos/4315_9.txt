I have just been watching this movie again, and I am still horrified at the number of cynics who reject it as a newcomer. A great film that has its own time for development is still approaching the edge, but it never does, and ultimately is meditative, influential and faithful to life, as most of the films that people reject their "coincidences" can see. I was angry at the time when movies such as "Prince of Tides" and "Bugsy" (although I liked them) were nominated for the best picture of that year (let alone win "The Silence of Laughter!") And this was totally ignored with the exception of one Best Scenario nomination. When reviewing, I think history supports my initial reaction!
