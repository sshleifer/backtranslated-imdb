Four words show why this movie was created - "She did it wrong". The huge commercial success of this car, Mae West, has convinced a studio brass that the melodrama of homosexuals was viable. Here we are rewarded with a fast and well-written story that neatly focuses on its stars. <br /> <br /> Wallace Beery and George Raft are excellent friendly rivals; Jackie Cooper is a bit harder, but it's Fay Wray who stole the film with his daughters in trouble. With a strong director - as Walsh proves to be - Wray could carry a lot of blows and is completely believable as the subject of both Raft and Beery. A lot of atmosphere, beautifully designed, is a forgotten movie worthy of revival.
