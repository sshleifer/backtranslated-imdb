The best film about martial arts ever. This movie is better than something Bruce Lee ever did. Classic with fun and brutal climax. Jackie Chan is the king of martial arts and the real king of kung fu. It is a great shame that while Bruce Lee was so overrated, it took Jackie Chan to become faithfully popular in Europe and America. Jackie Rules !!!!
