I remember this show from Swedish TV. I was only 7 years old and I was horrified by faith. I would like to go back to this series and see if it's as excellent as I remember, even though I suspect that my taste and requirements have changed. <br /> <br /> Even though it was released in front of a stranger and a lot of other space thrillers, I suspect it has its roots in the horror films of the 1950s and the political climate of the 1970s. When I thought about it, it was a real science fiction movie that tried to discuss scientific and political issues about who we are and what we are. The term sci-fi has since become bleak and has come to be the term for every movie that has spacecraft in them.
