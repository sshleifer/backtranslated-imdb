This film could not have been created until the 1970s! It's a bizarre action movie in a small California workers' city. A mill or a race closes, so suddenly there is an inconvenient bad behavior in the streets! Urban people are angry! So Ben Arnold (Jan Michael Vincent) goes to another town to accept his brother Aaron, played by Kris Kristofferson. Aaron is a Vietnamese veteran who looks and works a bit? Looks like a hell of another nasty vet of Vietnam. They come to the city to cleanse them (they are represented), but under good deeds, they actually run gambling houses, ask for protection against money, etc. !!! It takes a while for people to catch up, and in the biblical conflict Cain and Abel Vincent have to take their elder brother. In this movie is an interesting blue collarbone, which is interesting (note the cock scenes!). Is Vincent almost too angelic in this role? he thinks so high on his brother, he can not imagine himself committing the evil deeds he is accused of. Does he finally come to his senses? his girlfriend, Victoria Principal, is brutally shot in his back and he himself is beaten in his house. Kris Kristofferson is very effective as Aaron. Coldly denies any bad work, and even gently coos and talks to Vincent's young daughter (she is referred to as "Uncle Aaron") even though she threatens her father's life and is still smiling! Vincent and Kristofferson have a good contrast chemistry among them. Bernadette Peters makes an interesting look like a "saloon" girl who attracts Aaron's attention. This is a good 70-year action movie if you find it! Not available on DVD yet?
