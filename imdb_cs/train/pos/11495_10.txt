We saw it at one of the local cinemas in the Montrose area in Houston, TX. It was a total surprise when compared to news in the theatrical newsletter, but we were both blown away by art. It was beautifully done and (apparently) photographed in the castle (German name for the castle) somewhere in the area of ​​Munich. It is a very explicit exploration of the sexual relationships of a group of twenty men and women isolated from everyday constraints. It's fantastic on more levels than I remember. After the film, we returned home and spoke and talk until 4 am. The version we saw was in English (mostly) so there must be at least two versions since the movie in (probably its original) German version. I searched for a video tape version, but I never came. Absolutely happy to have a VHS or DVD version. It examines relationships at the basic level and is also a great tutorial how to relate to your partner. If anyone knows the writer / director, please convince him / her to go again, preferably on DVD these days. I can not even imagine that I'm tired of watching the honest performance of actors who are now probably all at the age of forty. Please bring it back.
