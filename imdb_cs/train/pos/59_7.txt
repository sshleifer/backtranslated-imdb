While I was a video rental company, I went through a dollar loan and came to this little jewel. I do not know what it was, but I only had a nose and it was okay. The story focuses on the two girls who just survived the shooting of the school. One of the girls is Alicia, who is the only witness to a full attack, and another is Deanna, who has survived a bullet in the head with some miracle. They accumulate with fate, the painful and beautiful manifestation of healing begins slowly, and they move on. I hate it only when stunning movies fall into cracks. Because wow, the performance of Busy Phillips and Erkia Christensen not to mention the rest of the cast! My only complaint is that the DVD does not contain any special features. Oh and some jumps in the movie were a bit cruel. But in all the excellent film.
