This latest Dutch film Verhoovena made me laugh. As a film fan who searches for all the little details and cross-references, etc. In every movie I can assure anyone interested in film art that this piece will entertain all the senses. I have not read Gerard Reves's book on which the film is based, but I still feel that we get the honest picture of a rather suicidal poet / writer who does not (in that sense - even spoil here). An anti-hero surrounded by characters who have ambiguous intentions as well as he. All in greatly packed cinematography, Paul Verhopven can turn the otherwise gorgeous "gesellich (?)" Dutch locations into a thrilling movie noir, an impressive work!
