Though I have not seen this mini-series in more than twenty years, I still remember how the balance between character, plot and story of wonderful adventures has been achieved. The use of special effects was more restrained, which gave the story more poetic than literal. The two versions I've seen have been dubbed (English and French), but it seems that the actors speak their own language not only in Italy, so there is a problem of synchronization. It does not spoil the story. The performance of Irene Pappas as Penelope is the most widespread for North America. Recommended for all followers who return.
