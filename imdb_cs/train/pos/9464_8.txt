Widow Family Officer Dan Burns (Steve Carell) writes a Dan column in real life that advises families in New Jersey Standards and raises their three daughters themselves. Jane (old, Allison's pill) just got a driver's license, but Dan does not allow her to drive; Cara (Brittany Robertson) is thrilled at her maternity school Marty; and young Lily (Marlene Lawston) lacks her mother. When Dan and his daughters travel to Rhode Island to meet their family, they meet Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and spend several hours of conversation. They feel attracted to each other, but Marie receives a phone call and leaves Dana and gives her a phone number first. Dan immediately falls in love with Mary, but when she returns to her parent's home, she finds out that Marie is a girlfriend of her wolf brother, Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who is also in love with her. During the weekend, the attractiveness of the clumsy Dan and Marie increases and he has to decide. "Dan in Real Life" is a great surprise and a wonderful film with comedy, romance and drama. The wonderful chemistry of Juliette Binoche and Steve Carell is amazing and it is very easy to know why everyone loves Marie. Trio Allison Pill, Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston are fantastic and their characters are responsible for some of the best moments in this story. The script is awesome and the performance of talented actors and actresses is amazing, with a realistic family encounter. Follow the instructions of Dan's columns and plan to surprise yourself by reuniting the Burns family.
