Lots of people unjustly sh! T on this series, but some of the Guinea Pig videos are quite fun. Devil's Experiment has a really fantastic effect - not just the unheard-of eye scene, but also very realistic skin on the foot and hand-to-hand hammer are very realistic - especially for video and low budget. <br /> <br /> Let me start right from the beginning for those who do not know: This film is an "extreme" torturous / fake snuff that appeared in Japan in the mid-1980s. It's a conspiracy that's simple: a young girl is held by several men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to find out where her break is. This includes brutal violence - all effective effects, including those mentioned in the last paragraph, as well as the painful prospects of using hot oil on the hand of the captured girl and placing the worms in a subsequent flake wound. <br /> <br /> The least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing tattoo meeting where the three men alternate the slap of the girl when her head falls apart and the second sequence in which the three men alternate with the soccer girl and pushed her to the ground. These two scenes are clearly presented and aggravated by the reality of the rest of the management. The actress who plays the victim of "experiment" is quite convincing that he is in pain and takes a lot of abuse and harsh things on the camera. Her reaction, since her headphones are attached to her head and the noisy noises are played for hours, are cool. Some of the other exploits she takes are at the same time she's resting her in a tree net. There is also a disturbing scene where the giggles rescue through sadness and other nasty dirty scene, where they turn in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels until they arrive. <br /> <br /> You have not seen this series I hope I've helped you decide if you want to shoot this episode. 8.5 / 10 for Devil's experiment.
