I saw this movie because it was the second feature on the disk that contained previously forbidden Video Nasty 'Blood Rites. Since Blood Rites was terrible, I did not expect much from this movie; but in fact it would seem that garbage director Andy Milligan overcame this time as a Blood Rites-like Seed of Sins and stands high as more than an adequate portion of sexploitation in the sixties. The conspiracy is in fact very similar to Blood Rites because we focus on a dysfunctional family unit and of course; at stake is inheritance. The film is shot in black and white and its appearance reminded me of a lot of trash classic "The Curious Dr Humpp". As soon as a gore appears on the display, the director seems sharper to focus on sex, incest and hate. The actor is usually horrifying, but most women appear naked at some point, and despite bad stories, director Andy Milligan actually seems to have an eye for such things because many sequences of this movie are really pretty. The drawing is thin and most of the film is feasible; but the music is catchy and the director also does a surprisingly good job with sex scenes because most of them are somewhat erotic. Overall, this is not a great movie; but it is likely to appeal to a fan of cults and get much higher recommendations than the better known and lower quality "Blood Rites".
