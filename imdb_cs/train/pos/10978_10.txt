A few years ago, when I first watched the "gray gardens", I remember how I laughed and considered it a merry camp. A few years later I still hear when I look at her, but in many ways I came to see beauty in the strange, twisted relationship between the inseparable "big" Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter "Little" Edith Bouvier Beale. br /> <br /> The mother and daughter, living together in their decaying East Hampton farm with 28 rooms, add a whole new meaning to the term "Shabby Chic." With countless cats, raccoons and opossums as a roommate, this aunt and niece Jackie O. allowed the creators of Albert and David Maysles to make their everyday life in their castle. The result is a merry, beautiful, sad and moving description of true love and anarchy. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the Great and the Little Eden is a testimony of the invincible bonds of love. And their lives are an example of drive, determination and free will. This movie recommends more than I can put into words. It's a rare experience you have to see for yourself. <br /> <br />
