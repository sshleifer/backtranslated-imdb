The movie did not do well in the box office. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the preview preview. <br /> <br /> I always enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br /> I live in one of the cities mentioned in the movie where some players have moved. <br /> <br /> The best movie ever on the screen but fun. <br /> <br /> Robin with his role. <br /> <br /> The best lines of the film at the beginning, according to Robin's character Jack: "I was the SOB!" Clean up here so you do not offend anyone. <br /> <br /> I was glad when he came to the DVD for years back in the widescreen format of the screen / mailbox. <br /> <br /> I'm not a football fan or a real sports fan. But you do not have to be one who likes this movie.
