This movie was great. Sadly, how culture is trying to cope with the sexes. This is one big warm fuzzy type of film. You have a championship that is uplifted by tradition and kind in its own way, Doggie, although it is a girl's thing that will win his affection and you are with one cute monkey with thousands of expressions on his face. This is equal to the big happy movie at the end. This movie has a good job in showing how tradition can be traditions, so immersed in being willing to die without sharing their secrets. You see parties in a culture you've never seen, which helps to improve the path that has developed near the end of the picture. Cinema-shooting is excellent, especially the opening sequence with all the sparks. Bound to be in Oscar's claim for best foreign film.
