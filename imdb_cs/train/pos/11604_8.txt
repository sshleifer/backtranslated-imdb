In the seemingly endless effort to find well-developed, well-performing horror films, it is very rare to find one that even comes remotely close to the brand. Needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised to find the "Burned for Share" channels on the US cable network. The assumption is quite simple. In 1692, young Ann Putnam (Swift) is the loudtest testimony against alleged wizards, settling unjustified charges against anyone who earns her dislike. Manipulating it for her own purposes is Reverend Parris (Peters), who also serves as a judicial guide in matters relating to witchcraft and Satanism. Things get complicated when Ann starts accusing family members of Goody's Witch. Salem (about 1980), Loreen Graham (also played Swift) begins to have unusual visions shortly before visiting the Salem Witch Museum. A strange man in a seventeenth century suit will try to take her there and the building. She continues to pursue her, while strange phenomena begin to engage her more and more. Soon she seems to be obsessed with the spirit of Ann Putnam. Unfortunately, the other description is more likely to take part and gives too much. Although the film is not focused on events and probably does not have much interest for many audiences, performances are good and the seventeenth-century dialogue used in movies is very convincing. Production values ​​are fixed with the possible exception of some special effects. He was kindly a technical advisor to Laurie Cabot, Salem's official witch. Spectators who appreciate a well-created, atmospheric but underrated horror film will appreciate it. Writer / director Bert I. Gordon has a long career in the field of horror and science fiction and is best known for his work on a series of big bug films and similar works earlier.
