As movies B go, it was considerably above average (I now warn readers that I can reveal certain key elements of the plot or other parts of the film, even if I try to minimize such a tendency). Since it was a sequel, it was absolutely fantastic (despite the "cookie cutter" that tried to copy some of the elements from the original verbal film.) Despite this sometimes lengthy tendency, she seemed to be working on this particular film, dividing her attention from the comparison with original "scanners"). The film was similar to the "Superman" series in terms of describing the main character of his early childhood and relationships with his parents (which looked similar to Kents in Superman's tales) and the theme of a morally pure hero who had extraordinary authority from an early age . Explaining the deep feelings of alienation of noble or otherwise non-children, adolescents and / or adults was a theme that reminded me of movies like "Real Genius" and "Mordrid Doctor" to a more superficial degree, and hit a particularly strong chord. <br /> <br /> The film had a positive interview, and was fun to watch. Some knowledge and accuracy (in terms of showing some aspects of supernatural experiences) I found fascinating and even deeply touching at times. These moments have occasionally appeared from all the great scholars and free sex (uality, in this case as the sex elements have been tastefully done) and the violence that B movies make (or Shakespearian games, it matters!) So much fun watching! <br /> <br /> This is to watch all the comics, science fiction, "distant watching" enthusiasts and horror fans! With proper exposure in the right circles, the film could evolve quite a culture, along with original "scanners".
