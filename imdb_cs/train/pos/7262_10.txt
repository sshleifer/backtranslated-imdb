My daughter, her friends and I have watched this movie literally tens of times. I bought her twice, and a few little girlfriends ran away with him. Then I rented it so many times. It just never gets old !!! Blockbuster does not even have it in their listings, and I tried to buy them, find them, hire them for over 5 years. It was undoubtedly the most popular childhood movie of my daughter ... it has everything! We laughed, we cried, we talked about real life and how hard it is for some children in the world. There was nothing to pretend on this movie. We joined each other and every line. Thanks to a million for renewing our faith in human nature. Sincerely, Shelleen and Kailin Vandermey. Craven, Saskatchewan. CANADA, eh !!! :-) <br /> <br /> August '07 update: <br /> <br /> Who are we to judge whether a rich woman falls in love with a poor man? or a man who has love, decides to raise a child that is not his own. Maybe it's not mine or your life. It's not just credible, it's happening every day. Thank God! It keeps my faith in the lively human nature! celebrate!!!!
