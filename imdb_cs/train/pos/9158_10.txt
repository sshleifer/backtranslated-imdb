Yesterday evening, I finished tracking "Jane Eyre" (1983), a BBC mini-series series adapted from Charlotte Bronte's novel Gothic Romance, a well-deserved classic of English literature with Timot Dalton (my favorite James Bond) like Edward Rochester and Zela Clarke Jane Eyre, a poor orphaned eighteen-year-old girl, Governor of the Rochester estate in Thornfield. "Jane Eyre" is one of my favorite books since I was an eleven-year-old girl, and my friend said "This book is amazing," and so it was, and I read it a dozen times, and I'm still not tired of it. His beautiful language, sophisticated, fragrant and surprisingly fresh, dialogues and above all two main characters and the story of their impossible love attract many creators. "Jane Eyre" has been adapted to television and big screen many times, 18 according to IMDb. Actors as famous and amazing as Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles, William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg, George C. Scott and Susannah York, Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton played a pair that overcame hundreds of obstacles from society, laws, religion, age differences, backgrounds, experiences, and fatal mistakes that would hunt for many years. Of all these films, I have seen only one 300-minute BBC version of 1983 that is approaching the novel, and where Timothy Dalton, who often plays dark and embarrassed figures, did not play Edward Rochester great and with the class, it was Mr. Rochester - sardonic, lively, nature, strong, passionate, sexy, and thirsty Thornfield. Zelah Clarke was also convincing as a sweet, subtle, intelligent and powerful Jane who felt deep and full of passion mixed with clear thinking and calm but firm will. Added September 17, 2007: Over the past two weeks, I've seen five Jane Eyre films and it's been a great experience. Every adaptation of "Jane Eyre" can admire something, though not all of them are successful. This version is still my favorite movie "Jane Eyre".
