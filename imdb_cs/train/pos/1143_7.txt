I do not watch soap. My grandmother is still following an hour with hourly glass. I made fun of them when I was ten (it was so easy). But this movie has a parody and a spell it's a new way. I found the story pretty damn funny. 80s fashion - shoulder pads, sequins and polyester - that's just the tip. Huge hair, high heels and histrionics - what combination. And all the actors just go to the city, chew their parts and spit it out into a large, scripted pile. Sally, Kevin, Elisabeth - gorgeous! Whoopi - great! Robert Downey - refreshing to see him back when he had that potential, in front of the boulevards. And Garry: why did we have to wait so long to see him in the movie? Leesa Gibbons - She was not missing it, but she liked to include her as a real-life reporter (and where do you apply for this job?) I think I could do without Sally climbing the sewer pipe. Lucy Ricardo did this a number of times, like every comedy by Carol Burnett, I do not know who and now I've done it, I can drink peanuts if I have them. It seems like this is what you are doing when you're fun at a tall building in New York City. I'm only thankful they did not pull a piece of the flag. But it was cute, it was funny, it had a conspiracy, it had it after the end of the loans before it was normal, the clothes had a nice look, they had a great cast and have personal memories for me. Really, what more do you need?
