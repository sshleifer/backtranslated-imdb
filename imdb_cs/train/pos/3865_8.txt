"Stories of the Century" was a half-hour series and appeared in a first-class syndication during the 54th-55th. television season. It was also the first Western TV series to win the Emmy Award. In the lead role of veteran western actor Jim Davis as a detective of the Matt Clark, the series set Clark and his colleagues of detective railroad partners (Mary Castle as Frankie Adams for the first half of the season and Kristine Miller as "Jonesy" during the second half) 1980s to the early 20th century. The series was very satisfying, easily traceable and fairly realistic, mainly due to the carefree spell of Jim Davis in the lead role. He looked like a real Western character. One more note. When Matt Clark arrives in the city after a long ride, it looks like he was on a long horse ride because it would be covered with dust. Very good western adult.
