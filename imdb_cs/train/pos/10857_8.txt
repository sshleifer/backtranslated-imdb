Johnny's here makes one of his best stylish exercises and makes a powerful film with a good Yakuzy story. The election of a new Yakuzy boss is the beginning of the war within the organization. In my opinion, violence is wisely used in context and creates a very strong gang film. I especially love the way she tells history, moves around all the roles within the Yakuzy family, and makes us see violence as the only way to solve our problems ... <br /> <br /> Talking about technical aspects, the film is a good example a paused, rhythmical, and planned way to shoot a movie. One of the Hong Kong movies of the year. It's like dirty stuff, but without simple action scenarios and mysterious storylines. We strongly recommend to all Asian film lovers. <br /> <br /> (I apologize for my English, I better do it in Spanish lol)
