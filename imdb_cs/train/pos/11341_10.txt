This can only be the most noticeable way back in time and time when the child begins the journey backwards, backwards, forwards and backwards, up and down and all around. Boy Jimmy, H.R. Puffinstuff, Dr.Blinky, Cling & Clang, Ludwig Lion, and even the evil Witchie Poo. The latest inspiration from Lidsville, "The Brady Kids Saturday Morning Preview Special", Sigmund & the Sea Monsters, and Earth Lost as both new and old are what this show has spanned gaps, like The Donny & Marie Show, Brady Bunch Variety Hour aka Brady Bunch Hour and even Paul Lynde Halloween Special. Maybe other things between "Beyond the Buck" are constantly expanding, even beyond expectations and unexpected bounds.Now, as we updated in March '06 we know that Jack Wild is gone and so it now makes it even more symbolic for us to really get nostalgia. Including now in August '06, when Jack Wild host plays Sigmund and The Monsters on the seaside as well as when he makes the second episode of HRPuffinstuff and recalls all the other nostalgic paths of Syd & Marty Kroft including the HRPuffinstuff Goodtime club, Donny and Marie, Brady Bunch Variety Hour aka The Brady Bunch Hour, etc. Steven "Steve" G. Baer aka "You're" from Framingham, Ma.USA.
