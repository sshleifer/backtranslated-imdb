I found this movie that is totally tense of what's happening. When Miss Stanwyck starts talking, it's only a few minutes before you realize there's a problem. The abandoned area, the lock on the abandoned door of the gas station, everything will prepare you to wait for it ... here it comes. First you think it's about a little boy, but it's too soon to keep your breath watching the tide of tide. I found this film really stressful even though I had watched it before and was ready to be revealed. Now you can watch a movie that will keep you tense even if you've seen it before it deserves some special rating, perhaps the price of white joints?
