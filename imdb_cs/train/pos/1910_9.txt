Ya. That's what I think. Sure it was a great show with John, but I personally think it's much better than. <br /> <br /> I love that CJ and Grandpa live at the house because they are so fun together. > <br /> When John was still alive, I did not really mix the same way I did. <br /> <br /> It's bad that nothing happened. (I do not think ...) because I would like to see some new material. <br /> <br /> My favorite character must be Rory. Poor Rory is almost always omitted. It's always Bridget or Carrie. What about Rory !!! ??? Honestly, it's a great show, and to anyone who has never seen it, you have to go and watch it. I almost guarantee you will laugh. well for a moment.
