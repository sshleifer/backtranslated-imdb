It's not as bad a film as some reviewers, and as a summary on the IMDB page for this movie, they say it is. Why? Firstly, in 1984 filmmakers were so brave enough to face domestic violence as one of the elements of the plot - so the reviewers who complain about the plot are unfortunately missing one of the main points! Secondly, without being an element of Prince's story with his abusive father, the musical climax will not work as well as he does - so those reviewers who say that only good music are once again forgotten one of the points - specifically why it is so good ... because all the music in this movie has a backdrop that makes music more efficient. Third, give this movie a break! For the first film producers and directors it's not that bad! There are far worse movies out there movie people! Finally, reviewers who say that music is "good," also lacked this point - look at the range of stylistic musical practices, variety, music, and Prince's performances - truly unique, musically, where no one else went through the 80s, seen in the work of other artists (clothing and movement: what costume elements came first, Michael Jackson or Prince's?) Also, let's see if you can see the stretched fingers sweep in front of the eyes the prince does in this movie long before "Pulp Fiction" Quentina Tarentina). As a sum of his parts, not a bad film at all.
