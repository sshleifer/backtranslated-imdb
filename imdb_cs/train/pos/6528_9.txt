I saw this documentary at the Cannes Film Festival, in a small 200-seat cinema at the top of the main building at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Absolutely, I got into it. I love a mixture of wonderfully created fictional scenes. It's an amazing set-design. The scenes look really like they were shot in 1920 or 1930. <br /> <br /> And the music is so pretty. <br /> <br /> I'm evaluating this experience 9/10. <br /> <br /> * spoilers forward * A documentary story about amazing blues men with black and white antique scenes of a black man playing guitar and singing. It's really awesome. But it's also mixed in new bands, and maybe it's one thing I did not like in this documentary. It's too abundant to use links to modern rock bands that play Blues songs in a modern way. I did not believe they would have a brilliant way of playing such amazing Blues songs. This is the same kind of non-perfect musical flavor I found when watching the Wim Wenders Buena Vista Social Club. Documentary was such a standing ovation on this first screening in a small cinema that the next day was documented for all and normal tourists on Croisette beach at the cinema in nature. Though the sand, the quality of the projection, and the poor sound quality seemed to have made it pleased for the thousands of people who sat in the sand at night.
