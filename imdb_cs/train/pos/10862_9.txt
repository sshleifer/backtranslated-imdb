The choice is a Chinese mob movie, or in this case three times. Every two years, he decides on a new leader and initially seems to be between Big Dem (Tony Leung Ka Fai, or as I know him, "The Other Tony Leung") and Lok (Simon Yam, who was the judge in full contact! ). Although Lok wins, Big D refuses to accept this choice and goes anywhere to gain recognition as a new leader. Unlike other Asian movies I watch gangsters, this is not an action movie. It has bloody moments when it's necessary, like in Goodfellas, but it's basically just a really effective drama. There are plenty of characters that are really hard to watch, but I think it plays a bit of foolishness. The 100-year-old baton, the symbol of power I mentioned earlier, changes hands several times before things settle down. And although the film seems to end for 65 or 70 minutes, a few surprises are still awaited. Simon Yam was my favorite actor and kind of anchor image. The prize was the winning prize at last year's Hong Kong Film Awards, best actor (Tony Leung), Best Picture, Best Director (Johnny To, who made the Heroic Trio !!) and Best Screenplay. She also had nominations for cinematography, editing, film scores (which I love) and three other actor performances (including Yam).
