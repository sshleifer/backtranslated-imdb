While it was a better film than 101 Dalmatia (live action, not a revived version), I think it was not enough about what Disney could do. It was well shot, music was more appropriate for action, and the effects were better done (compared to 101). It may have been better, but in this sequel, human characters were much more suited, and Glenn Close is really unthinkable, as in the first film. It's shooting. Her poor and exaggerated fur coats are great characters that can be lost and added to the spectacle Disney gave us. This is a great family film with little or no inappropriate material, yet it remains fun and interesting for both adults and children. It's definitely a classic because there are so many Disney movies. Here is hoping that the third will be even better - because you know they probably want to do one. ;)
