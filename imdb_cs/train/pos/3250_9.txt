Another for Babes & Bullets. The story is much harsher than any other musical instrument I've seen: the cannons hide the missing legs of women and place everyone in a generational way in a way that comes close to intelligent comment than we might expect for the local environment. It is more effective than the current "drama". It's hard to identify with a woman who holds her trousers in her trousers - on a bed. It's quite remarkable if you look at the context. Over the cannon-to-the-feet thing that provides 90% surprise, this film also chronicles how greed replaces all the other considerations in the life of a group of yakuzas who follow a woman who holds her leg hidden cannon / rocket launcher (ie no group shower scenes or belts) A hidden projectile pulls out of the protagonists back, seemingly from anywhere, in Miike's Dead or Alive (1999), The Baterka brought out by the heroine at the end of the original Tomie (2000) or the horrific flames scene in Sunny Gets Blue (1992) almost the third world of Cantinflas-esquire influence in contemporary Japanese cinema, about which I explained the loss, but I can not complain. You do not see high quality films made in Hollywood, which are completely extinct with cheap bulls that drain for cheap excitement, are just laughs. It's a real movie, and although it's great in its entirety, the end is a brilliant, if not the irreversible, tearing of some of Sergio Leon's paintings that relate to a cannon where the legs should be, and it is definitely appropriate!
