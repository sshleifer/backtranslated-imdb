I have to say that I really did not know that I would sit down and watch this movie. I think it was that there was nothing better between the class. But once I got a TV movie. More importantly, Helen Hunt has caught my eye. She was not really her big fan before this movie. Of course, Twister liked me and it was so good. But something about this movie really did. Now I would consider myself a big fan. This movie comes with high marks from ... me. Give her a chance, she will not let you.
