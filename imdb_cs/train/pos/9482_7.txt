Henri Verneuil represented the commercial cinema in France between 1960 and 1980. Always strong in a box and usually telling dramatic and thrilling stories about casino robberies, mafia settlements and World War II battles, Verneuil could be counted to give us two hours of fun on Saturday night. He worked with a crew of male actors: Gabin, Belmondo, Fernandel, Delon, Sharif, Anthony Quinn. I ... The Comic Icare is the only time Yves Montand was driving. It is a strangely static film that takes place mainly in offices and conference halls and does not contain any traceable scene and almost no violence. Montand gives good performance if it is somewhat dry and well supported by other actors. I could not help thinking about what Costa-Gavras could do with this story based on Z (Lambrakis' murder) and L'aveu (torture Artur London in Stalinist Czechoslovakia).
