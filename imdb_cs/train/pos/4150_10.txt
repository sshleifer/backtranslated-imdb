I'm looking at Cold Case for real life experience. This one was very close to me and touched me deep, so beautifully managed, thanks, Merideth. All characters are well-developed 3D, especially Coop. Material is still difficult to access, the US is far behind developed nations of the world. only this kind of sincere real experience of performance and treatment affects the population. Of course, not everyone sees things in the same way, but I feel that three-quarters of the men who have joined the crowd under 30 voted the same way I did 10th reached the hard ones - I'll forever book the "best episode" instead of this episode. Continue your efforts and accept your heartfelt gratitude.
