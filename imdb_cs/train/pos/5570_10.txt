Sophmoric this movie is. But it's funny when everyone gets out. It shows that the "boys of the mental dressing room" plays the "other side". It is good to see how these tides change and how stupid they are. But this is probably not for most women because (just ask one), "they've heard them all before." Watch it with a small group or a mixed sex party and 97.3% of the room will laugh 2 hours straight. And the other 2.7% ... can you really please them sometimes?
