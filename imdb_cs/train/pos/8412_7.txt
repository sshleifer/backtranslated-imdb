Those who joined the movie camera so early in the century had to find out their potential very soon. It's a good story about a playboy who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to Satan for a lot of money. Unfortunately, the soul is his twins and must often meet him, tearing his life apart. There are some wonderful scenes with people fading and of course scenes when they are two on the stage at the same time. The middle part is somewhat boring, but the Faustian story is always in the mind of the viewer. One thing I have to mention is the general reluctance of the people in the movie. They also managed to prevent many activities that would give something at least. I first learned about this movie about 25 years ago and finally I could see it. I was not disappointed.
