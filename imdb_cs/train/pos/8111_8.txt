Things that come is really a classic piece of speculative fiction; how the essays about the devastating nature of the war, and the horrors of progress. This makes some surprisingly accurate depiction of the war that was to follow several years later, but is pitifully naive in its utopian ideals. Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke, and Ralph Richardson form a subtle cast, although drama is more like a screenplay than a cinematographic work. There are grandiose, if somewhat confused speeches, often delivered as if the actor tries to get to the back of the theater. However, there are some deep words out there. Is the technology of humanity's savior or instrument of destruction? Film is a visual feast if one can separate from the age of effect. Sure, Hollywood is today more sophisticated, but seldom inventive. For creativity, the third law is treated: a world of underground cities, massive deco bombers, space guns, gyroscopes, and secret organizations of savior scientists. It has all the benefits of sci-fi pulp adventures, but instead uses trappings for philosophical exercises. Things that come and Metropolis were the hallmarks of the Neolithic Hollywood sci-fi cinema. They are operative in scope and visually inspirational. Technology has long since left, but their ideas are still emerging. There is art there, one with more hearts and emotions than a computer-generated mass-produced cinema today. These films are craft products, not industrialists.
