If the Lion King Disney version of Hamlet, then Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata is Disney's Guildenstern and Rosencrantz versions are dead. Like the captivating film by Tom Stoppard, we look at the action from the perspective of two smaller characters from the original: Timon, a meerkat with a tilt to break the song on a drop of a hat and Pumbaa, a warthog with gas problems. Following their story - rather than Simba - we find out why all the animals bowed because Simba was introduced from the star cluster. We will find out what caused Timon and Pumbaa to follow Simba back to Pride Rock to exclude Scar. And we'll find out how they've been dealing with hyena once and forever. Nathan Lane as Timon gets most of the best jokes but is very much supported by Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa. It is also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg who have turned their roles away. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give their distinctive voices to two new characters: Timon's mother and uncle. The only unfavorable aspect is a device with a constant start and rewind stop, which does not always allow you to proceed. After the beginning of the movie is a great zoom. With more laughter than any other third-generation Disney movie, it's worth watching the Hakuna Matata - just for a hot tub scene that's still fun, although it's a bit predictable.
