I recently watched this movie on a lazy Sunday afternoon with some of my friend and we have a lot of fun! This film is a masterpiece of the basket. Try to watch for this! Of course, it was not expected, but the actors' performances (and Alberto Tomba's absolutely the best), the weak screenplay, and the low budget created a wonderful mix of silly things. Tomba has just left the ski races, where he was the dominant technical skier at the end of the 1980s and 1990s. Tomba has won three Olympic gold medals, two World Championships and nine World Cup titles. Seriously about the director: No one knows why Damiano Damiani signed this film. All other Damian instructions are significant.
