This film was rather a transition to masculinity for one gay man and how he has to deal with everyone. His mother is depressed, his younger sister is pain, his older sister is a little accepted. The relationship looks good with his friend / ex-boy and leaves his family to try life with this first guy. Unfortunately, the new person is throwing it and says it does not really mean anything. Our young homosexual leaves and ends in a looney basket and eventually leaves, jumps out of his new lover and begins again. We stay with him when we start and look, we do not get lucky. So maybe they'll be better in the future. The end was a bit downer, but the whole movie was completely realistic, so I let this real end slip with a high score.
