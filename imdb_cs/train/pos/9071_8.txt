Preschool humor is present in large quantities. The actors and the story are great if you can lose that concept. Those with weak institutions will have some difficulty, because "worms" are so realistic that they will cause more than a few people to appear in the audience. Tom Cavanagh and Hallie Kate Eisenberg stole the spotlight, but young Ty Panitz would be on a serious time screen over the next few years. <br /> <br /> Miss Eisenberg has grown from a cute face to a strong young actress with charm and amazing comic book. The story does a great job in the fight against bullying, friendship and justice. It creates an opportunity to discuss these topics in an open and honest way, reminding of some "rough" scene from the film.
