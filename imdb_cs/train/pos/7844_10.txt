I really like this show, it's like reading a book and every chapter does not want you more. It will think about what will happen in the next episode, and struggle to keep friendship over the years. After the end of each episode, they leave a sweet, bitter taste in their mouths because they know that: One - The show was good, you can not wait for the next episode and really think about what happened to your friends for twenty years. And two - the fact that the show was placed "on hiatus" and we will not see the completion of the show in its entirety. Fox obviously does not know what they did, they say they are losing viewers in the 18-49 category, of which they clearly do not know what people want to see if they get rid of a good show like "Reunion." But I have one question I would like to wake up. If they were to return the show and go on again, how does it work, because each episode is happening in one year and the story is based on what's going on in twenty years? Your answers are welcome. Bring Reunion! Bring Reunion!
