I've seen this movie a while back after ordering for my friend, who is a big fan of Dominic Monaghan. The movie itself was very interesting, although it had its positive points, which for me was Donnie Darko kind of "wtf?" factor after movie ending. <br /> <br /> Of course, negative points will also come. For me, the young girl in the movie was incredibly good, and Dominic Monaghan also did a good job. Unfortunately, I do not have this opinion on Daniel Burke, who played Lonnie. It could be just me and I do not say I'm a serious critic in such a way that I have not found myself qualified enough but just does not seem to be convincing as an actor. Perhaps it is even more remarkable, because even though I'm not a critic, it attracts attention. Finally, I think it's definitely a movie that's worth watching. It's interesting, confusing and you should have seen it.
