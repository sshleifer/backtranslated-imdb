Thanks to Kevin Smith, there are plenty of predatory people who say that the Jedi's return is not good because it's really fun to watch. And no! Muppets are plugged! It is bad! Everyone likes to return the Jedi until somebody in Kevin Smith's film remembered it. Now suddenly people look at you as if you have a disease if you mention how much you like it. This movie is much better than something Kevin Smith ever thought about creating reminds me that the guy would even think he condemned it. This movie is good fun! It's as awesome as I remembered when I was six! Enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing the opinions of Kevin Smith! His mistakes are not correct! <br /> <br /> And the song Ewok at the end ruled! I bet people do not even have "Ewoks: Battle for Endor" !!!! I'm going to set you on fire!
