From this writing, "Halloween" John Carpenter approaches the thirtieth anniversary. Since then, there have been 7 sequels, remakes, a whole mess of imitation and every year around Halloween when they make the 'Top 10 Scariest Movies' lists, always there. This is quite amazing for the film, which was made with a budget of about $ 300,000, and was then almost totally unknown cast and coming young talent. I could go on, but the big question here is: What is the movie today? And all I can say is fantastic! <br /> <br /> Advantages: A simple yet spooky introductory credit sequence that really sets the mood. An unforgettable score and violin reminiscent of director / co-author John Carpenter and Alan Howarth. Great cinematography. Stellar in the direction of Carpenter, who keeps the tension high, gets some great shots, and is careful not to show too much of his villain. Good performance from the then mostly unknown cast. Good sense of humor. Michael Myers is one scary, bad guy. Many mysterious moments that stay with you. The pace is slow but stable and never goes beyond. Unlike most other slasher films, it's more about tension and horror than about blood and a large number of people. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Probably not as scary as it used to be. Many goofs really excel. <br /> <br /> Ultimate Thoughts: I want to start this section by saying that this is not my favorite movie in the series. I know it's not a popular opinion, but it's really a feeling. Still, it's really an important film that still reaches new generations of movie enthusiasts. And precisely because it was reworked for the new generation does not mean it will be forgotten. No way, no. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
