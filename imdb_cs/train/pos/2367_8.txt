I could not get rid of this film when he appeared on the cable. Dialogue and costumes have the quality best suited to the fine core. In this case, it serves a purposeful plot as a vehicle not for sex, but for serial thrashings with nunchuks. (Maybe for sex, but not for Indian TV.) <br /> <br /> Not just a fan of the genre that I could not build Jeff Wincott and I did not have any search help. Only once when Brigitte Nielsen traded with a futuristic nurse (so the mayor!) For what we remembered from Beverly Hills Cop II, I made a positive ID on her. <br /> <br /> This movie will undoubtedly entertain any admirer of the early 1990s or the sentiment and blink of an Ã  la Paul Verhoeven. Can we add a genre tag for "so-bad-is-good"?
