Being a man who does not like boxing, he feels that he focuses only on the box and not on the characters themselves, this film has really moved me. I loved the ability to see the main character of Diana (Michelle Rodriguez), who was going through so many things in such a short time, that was amazing to me. Michelle (Rodriguez) has done such a great job playing Diana, especially since it was her first acting experience, she showed real emotion and she had a wonderful picture of Diana. All actors had chemistry on the screen and made this movie even more amazing. I highly recommend this movie to those who usually do not watch boxing movies. 10/10
