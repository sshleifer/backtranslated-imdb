Lavish production values ​​and solid performances in this straightforward adaptation of satirical classics by Jane Austen about marriage within and between classes in the 18th century province of England. Northam and Paltrow are a good mix as friends who have to go through jealousy and lies to find out that they love each other. Good humor is a maintenance virtue that leads a long way to explaining the availability of the old starting material (which has been a little weakened in its harsh skepticism). I liked the look of the film and the way images were shot, and I thought it was too much to deny the succession of headlines like most other 80s and 90s. Very good results.
