First I will be the first to admit that the scarecrow is quite wrong. A slightly acrobatic scary film could cause this film to be far less shy. But overall, I think it's one of the better movies B. Tiffany Shepis is absolutely amazing, not to mention incredibly beautiful. Although this film is missing an all-important act, there are several other films to see. But here she gets all the bad-hotties, especially towards the end, as she drives away from the flooded scarecrow. Also, Richard Elfman does a great job as a sheriff and as a drunk friend. Yes, it's a low B-movie budget. But of all I've seen, it's definitely one of my best favorites.
