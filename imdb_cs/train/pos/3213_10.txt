What a perfect example of "Less Is More ..." Kurt Russell (Sgt. Todd) has only 72 lines and something like 104 words. What a challenge! Just like a black-and-white photo, when your eyes are filled with empty spaces, facial expressions, physical tracks, emotional gestures, everything will come together to make it stronger. This is one of the best 5 movies I can not live without, right there with a classic such as Road Warrior. If you like, check out "Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior" and "Braveheart" where Mel Gibson plays. Also "Gladiator" with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen, who was also a soldier. "Thirteenth Warrior" starring Antonio Banderas and "Blade Runner" starring Harrison Ford.
