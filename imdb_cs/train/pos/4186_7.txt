I was watching this movie yesterday, and I have to say it's the best movie for the $ 36,000 horror I've ever seen (I'm sorry for Steckler) The film is definitely worth looking for if you're a zombie fan. This film likes soul and atmosphere. Some of the zombie shots are the best one ever made to shoot. Very spooky looking dusty bodies from the body are slowly spreading to their screaming victims. Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. <br /> <br /> Hot sexy Canadian women with sexy accents will keep you busy before HORROR picks up her undead corpse. The film was fun from beginning to end. I could not ask for more than that. My only complaint is that it's too short.
