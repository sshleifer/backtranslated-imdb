The 40 year old lady is about Andy Stitzz, a forty-year-old man who works in the e-commerce and has not a lot of social life and is very annoying about women. Some of his business associates pick him up once and find that Andy is still a virgin, so they're going to help him lose his virginity. One day at the Andy store she meets a woman named Trish who gives her her phone number and eventually Andy works with enough courage to meet her date and they really start to like but Andy is still very uncomfortable when she goes about sex, and he will have to tell Trish, a lot of his embarrassment, if he really can get enough courage to tell her before things get unpleasant. A 40 year old virgin, good direction, good screenplay, good comedy performance, good cinematography and good film adaptation. The film stars are written by Steve Carell, who has a very good comedy breakthrough and his writing for the film is also very good. I was very pleasantly surprised by this film. It is sweet, fun, fun, fun, pleasant, smart, good nature and good time. This movie is as good as this year's wedding crashers, and both movies are two of the best comedies I've seen in a while. A 40 year old lady, she really has a lot of talents and is well-used and works like comedy and romance, and she's sweet and fun. One of the greatest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.
