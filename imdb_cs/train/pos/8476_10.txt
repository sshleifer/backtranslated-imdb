*** Spoilers * <br /> <br /> My father shot this movie for me when I was 3. I watched over 400 times over 5 years. I just watched it and watched it. And I'm still doing today! She has a terrifying story, Lamb's mother is killed by a wolf - a very emotional scene - and wants to become a wolf like him. After years of training, the lamb has become a real thing that really looks bad. He and the wolf travel to their old barn but can not kill the lambs no matter how much he wishes. Eventually he will kill a wolf, but his former friends are no longer considered lambs and can not return to their previous ways of life. Art is beautiful, the songs are .. well, well, and voice acting is better than some things today. <br /> <br /> Overall, you just * should * see this movie, it's a great masterpiece. Although today it is very difficult to find it. <br /> <br />
