This is the first review I wrote for IMDb, so I went with it, but I caught it on HBO and I was glad to watch it. Richard Gere is great in this movie as a passionate agent / detective who bends the rules to do the job. I think the story is great and it's never a boring scene that slows the pace of the movie. Some parts of the film that are dealing with demented sexual addicts are quite shocking, but if you've ever seen a crime movie like Se7en, you'll be able to take the scenes well. <br /> <br /> So, if you're looking for a good detective / exciting film, ignore the low ratings that IMDb got on this movie and definitely watch it.
