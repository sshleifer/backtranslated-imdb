This is OK customization, but not as good as a TV version. Actors are generally fine, but I found Jeremy Northam rather wet as Mr. Knightley, especially when compared to Mark Stronge in TV. Gwyneth Paltrow is all right and her English accent is pretty good, but I once again preferred Emma Kate Beckinsale. There are excellent supporting performances by Toni Collette, Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompson. The script is often played too much for laughs, the book is a comedy, but there are too many set-piece gags here, and also attic Frank Churchill is almost completely missing. <br /> <br /> My biggest criticism is scenery. It's too lush. England has never been that. Looks like a chocolate box. Only the Americans would do that. Despite these criticisms, I enjoyed this film, but I would recommend more TV adaptation.
