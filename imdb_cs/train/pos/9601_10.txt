Darius Goes West is a wonderful documentary about Juveniles with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and his 11 buddies who take him on a trip to find out if Pimp My Ride runs out of his wheelchair. <br /> <br /> I recently watched this movie at the Sunscreen Film Festival. He played twice during the festival. This film is an amazing story about the spirit and spirit of Weem's friends. I do not say often about movies, but after watching this movie I feel moved to do something. Every festival in which this film took part received this film awards. She is at the Tribeca Film Festival and goes to London and Athens to Greece. I would not be surprised if this film came to the Academy Awards. It's snowballing out of control. If anyone has a chance to see this movie, whatever play, go! Take as many people as possible and go! He heads to New Orleans for a film festival, then to Atlanta and Palm Beach, FL. Darius comes from Georgia, so I expect Atlanta tickets to be sold out if they are not. Please check out this movie! DGW (talk about it) <br /> <br /> -Kish
