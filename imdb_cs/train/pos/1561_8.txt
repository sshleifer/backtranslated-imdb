I really liked this episode. Seeing Flash, Cyborg, Green Arrow and Aquaman (although all he did was swim) made my eyes bigger. To see that most of the founders of the Justice League trying to knock Lex Luthor is what I expected. It sounded a little out of the way, but shooting the Justice League live show would certainly cause me to put everything I usually do during the week down to watch one episode. That's the excitement I got from watching this episode. I wish this episode was a bit longer, like two hours special, because I felt that one hour of the Justice League was not enough. Now that I have given you birth (if I do not have my own), I just want to say Smallville is fine again. Something like that was lost when the show began to focus on Lana. But I'm sure the writers just get back into the loop. :( So be aware of this episode, who knows when the next good will come out on Thursday, February 22nd, if you missed the first broadcast.
