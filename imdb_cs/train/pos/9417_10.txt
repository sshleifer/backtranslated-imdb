The unbeatable, gentle and slim film "Man in a White Suit" is another breath of fresh air in the film format of the Ealing studio. While I suspect that some modern audiences may find obscure at first, I doubt that many of them will not be enchanted by the expert, what is the plot, the themes and characters are easily transferred during the film course. Alec Guinness gives another gentle characterization in the movie, perhaps not as apparently virtuoso as Ealing's inspired "Kind Hearts and Coronets" from 1949. This time, however, he plays only one character than eight, but as a stubborn inventor and scientist, Sidney Stratton always finds the right tone and expression. Along with Guinnes' gentle, expressive performance, the rest of the cast is effective, with Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger as the major players, as the crippled but influential business grandee, while Parker is reliable as an inefficient and yet pivotal owner and father of the mill. , that is, Joan Greenwood, a comedic actress who is at this unmistakable peak in this film, an excellent and seductive aspect and diction, is very sublime in this film, which is a gentle contrast to Guinness's unusual but bad Guy. it seems to be trying to try it, it was played so blindly that it's deeply dizzy and fun ... The themes are processed very efficiently without a simple morality, the complexity of the relationship between science, business and workforce is thoroughly explored Experimented by Alexander Mackendrick is technically competent in all areas, an evoking photographer ie, adaptation of sound effects and music and modest scenario, all of them silently impress. Completely satisfying film with the magnificent Guinness and Greenwood. <br /> <br /> Rating: - **** 1/2 / *****
