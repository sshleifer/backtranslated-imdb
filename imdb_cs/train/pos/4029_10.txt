I have no words to describe how good this movie is. Only a genius like Amrita Pritam could write such a real picture of the days of division. The film drew me for days. <br /> <br /> Urmila took the role of her life in this film. She gave life in the role of Puroo and Manoj Vajpai had nothing less in his role as Rashid. It is hard to imagine anyone other than these two playing the role of Puroo and Rashid. The Punjab costumes looked so natural for Urmila and Mano looked like a natural Punjabi Mussalmaan. Sandhali Sinha as Lajjo and Suri as Ramchand with wonderful work. Priyanshu Chattarjee did a good job like Triloki. Some of the scenes you just can not get out of your mind. When Puroo first meets Lajjo, it brings tears to your eyes. The culmination is just a murderer. I was expecting a tragic end, but fortunately the end was wonderful. This movie is in the same category as Pakeezah, Mughal-e-Azam, Banaras, etc. We can not miss it.
