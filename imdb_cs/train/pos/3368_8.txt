A visit to Hitler in Rome is the backdrop of this story of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren plays home and mother of six children who stay at home while the whole family goes to a military show in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. He must stay home because the family can not afford a maid. She would like to go along with the whole residential complex where she lives, a keen admirer of Il Duce. However, there is one exception. In the courtyard, Marcello Mastroianni sits on his chair and thinks of suicide. Reason? He is a homosexual, and he recently lost his job as a radio announcer. The movie really starts when those two people meet by accident. Mastroianni is in despair and badly needs a friend. Loren, frustrated by his own cheating husband, misunderstands Mastroianni and in a masterfully filmed, controlled and acting scene on the roof of the building complex, offers him a body to refuse him. The initial wedge will soon be replaced by hunger for this man, for this fascist, for this gay man, for this other world who is so willing to give her everything he desires. This is a beautifully created film with two of the most talented actors ever. Loren here proves to be an acting caliber when it is well controlled. It is a simple yet powerful film about fascism, love, ordinary people, and above all about human conditions. In spite of its sad end, revelation of hope is over, things are changing, somebody understands it.
