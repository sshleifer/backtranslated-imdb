For all reviewers on this page, I would like to say that this film is worth seeing. So it was made in 1972, so what. The fashion in the movie was exactly the same as his time. People who have not studied the culture of decades will think that this film is cheese. Compared to the modern series, `Left Behind, '(which is for our time period right now), it looks nice. However, the only cheezy part of the film is fashion that has been back in the past for over 30 years. BUT. The message that is sent in this movie is very strong and carefully preserved. There's so much I say, but I refuse to say it. (for fear of spoiling it) So get out and check out this movie! If you do not like the message it sends, you have problems that require some attention!
