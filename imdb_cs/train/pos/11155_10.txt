The young, handsome, muscular Joe Buck (Jon Voight) moved from Texas to New York and thought he would feed on being a student. He gets there and quickly finds out that it will not be easy - he goes through one humiliating experience after another. At the end of his rope he joins the crippled, dirty Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Together they try to survive, get out of town and move to Florida. But will they do that? Very dark, disturbing and fascinating film. Director John Schelsinger portrays a very dirty portrait of NYC and its inhabitants. This is how it is dated - the city could have been so bad in 1969, but it has been thoroughly cleaned. It also uses all the camera tricks in the book - the color becomes black and white; trippy sen sequence; flash forward; flashbacks (especially in the case of rape); shock cuts; strange sound effects ... you name it. It becomes disoriented and out of center - but I could not stop watching. There is not much story - basically focuses on friendship between Rizzo and Buck. There is a consequence that they can be lovers (the final shot shows that). It's just a portrait of two injured characters who are trying to survive in the cold, cruel urban jungle. Originally it was X in 1969 - the only reason the MPAA did not think parents want their children to see this. However, it was a big hit with high schoolers (at that time X meant no one under 17). It was also the only X rated film ever to get an Oscar as the best picture. Hoffman and Voight were featured at great fare, as (mysteriously) Sylvia Miles, who was in the picture for a total of 5 minutes! It was eventually reduced to R (without cuts) when it was released in 1980. Also the excellent song "Everybody's Talkin" was introduced in this movie - and it became a big hit. br /> <br /> Great movie --- but very dark. I give it 10. Do not see it on commercial television - it's a ribbon cut and incomprehensible.
