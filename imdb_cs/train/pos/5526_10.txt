I like a cinema, so what I'm going to admit is profoundly embarrassing me. I put my thumbs down to "Che, Parts 1 and 2" without seeing the movie. I know so much. But I felt the trap he committed ... who? I really do not know, but there was a negative word of mouth that spreads like a wild fire, and no matter how clever I think I am, I fell into it. Fortunately, I came across Armenian filmmaker Martin Donovan, the man I love and admire. When I told him I did not see it because I knew the movie was a failure, he looked at me as though he was ready to face me and Donovan was a pacifist! He took me aside and told me how much he loved the film and why. I immediately looked at both parts and "Che, part 1 and 2" is the best movie I saw in 2008. It is such a purity that it will remind you of the work of some great masters the past. Looking at your audience is something we are no longer used to. I do not know if we've ever been. Riveting, movement, without concessions and Benicio del Toro is simply exceptional. We see his soul, we can actually perceive it. Humanity is overwhelming. So thank Martin Donovan for honestly educating me. Bravo Del Toro, Bravo Soderbergh and everyone involved in this landmark. Do not make the mistakes I should catch. Go on, now, on the big screen
