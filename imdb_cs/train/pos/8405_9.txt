I'm proud to say that he owns an unwanted copy of this selection of the 70th Crown International in sexploitation comedy on DVD. It's really a stupid and pleasantly insignificant film with pretty breezy'n'easy 70 is the atmosphere to do it. He tries to make a sincere point about true love and friendship, which is more important in life than a cool set of wheels and a fast tail piece. Sure, it's basically a glamorous teen male fantasy pic - Bob Hamilton's main character teen gets the girls, respect his friends and shows a local murderous sniper - but it's too tiny and kind to hate. Stuart Getz as our glamorous protagonist gives the cute guides, Deborah White as the main subject of Getz's affection is a pussy, Connie Lisa Marie is just as delicious as a beautiful blonde girl and strangled Neanderthal cakes Stephan Oliver (60th Biker Perennial Movie) is beautifully hateful like brutish Dugan Hicks. The special remembrance of Danny DeVit is an absolute rebellion as chef of chef Getze, who is frantic to wash the Andy car, which is a pretty indecent, untreated well that carries very nasty Hawaiian shirts and suffers from a serious gambling habit. I especially love the scene where two criminals brutally defeated Danny - one holding hands behind his back while the other man is working over Danny's hull! A Sammy Johns' insidious catchy random hit song will jump around the skull for at least a week. In short, it's super groovy retro-70 fun!
