The penultimate collaboration between director Anthony Manne and star James Stewart (except for a few days when Mann worked on a night pass before staring out in a less than friendly way), The Far Country denies his mainstream to offer another portrait of an angry man reluctantly to his own redemption, to fight every step. This time, a cattle driver whose reaction to work problems - causing trouble with difficult ties to shoot at the end of the trail - leads to his cattle being confiscated by John McIntire's robber judge from Roy Bean's School of Law and Order. By stealing them back and moving them across the Canadian border, he soon finds himself reluctantly drawn into the growing conflict between the prospect and the judge as he cheats or kills them from their claims ... Though it's not a big surprise how Stewart turns around, it is surprisingly hateful critter along the way, even using the desire to stay alone to apologize for not announcing a group prospering for an approaching avalanche when he has a chance because it is not his problem. For most of the film, McIntiro is really just a wide range, something that the judge instantly recognizes, indulging in a companion spirit, even if he deliberately plans to lynch. In many ways, the city's people who believe in it are likely to be aware of this - despite their appeal to their dead and buried better nature, there is an unrecognized acknowledgment that the only person who can stand the judge is someone almost so bad he is. <br /> <br /> As usual with Mann, the extraordinary use of high rural sites, although once the final settlement is on the plane and the film is almost perfectly occupied with strong support from Walter Brennan, Harry Morgan and Ruth Roman (though young romantic interest Corinne Calvert to Irritability). The charming cinematography of the Canadian Rocky Mountains, however, is sad that the DVDs are clearly transmitted mainly to the theater trailer.
