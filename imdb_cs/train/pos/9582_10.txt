After I grew up in the rough streets of Detroit, MI and had friends who traveled to New York, I got into the lifestyle of being a member of the house. I entered the House of the religious. We've made the same rules as most homes, but they were professional fraudsters who would support and commit credit card fraud to get the wonderful jewelry and clothing we demanded. I even learned how to confess the execution of checks and driving licenses and earn them in more than seventeen states until the jealous Queen called me a secret service and I went to a federal prison. But from these queens I learned a lot from this film and I highly recommend that you watch yourself. You can even read about how I grew up in the homes in Detroit and the criminal activity we deserved. My Identity Schemes is available for sale at Amazon dot com or Identity Schemes dot com. But believe me, it's much better than Paris burning, because its 2005 year.
