After you saw that you got to the post and you were disappointed, I decided to see the original movie that inspired this movie The Shop Around the Corner. I was amazed in this movie. It's a real jewel, and from that moment on, one of my favorite movies of all time. The game is so perfect, the story is so beautiful that if you have not seen it, I would urge you today to see it. I'm not against re-make and sometimes I like a new version more than the original, but this time I have to admit that you are Got Mail is a bad adaptation of this classic. Do not miss it, go to your department store and rent Shop The Corner Corner today!
