It has always been one of my favorite films and will always be. Over the last couple of years I have become 50th and 60th Sci-fi, trying to assemble all the better ones that were made at that time. I love a lot of things about how spiteful they can be on how some of them are technically correct. Great colors and sets also do me. It's a shame to re-produce some of those good old movies; almost everything is happening - Just look at the recent re-opening of the day the Earth stopped, it's totally waste! Forbidden Planet is one of the benchmark space movies of all time, and now it tries to do it again, and I shudder to think how it will be new! In my opinion, some things like fantastic classic films should be what they are, classic examples of great attempts to tell simple stories and give people excitement in the process. Once he adds all the techno-cakes we have now available, the film seems to be more canine from the Hollywood sausage factory - nothing special. By the way, I notice that cosmonaut uniforms in the Forbidden Planet were also used for the "Queen Space Space"! It just says the budgets were a bit lower, right? Hey, less money and better movies, hmmm .... Great performances in this movie by Leslie Nielsen, in a serious role, and Anne Francis, Walter Pidgeon (who has always been one of my favorite actors), Earl Holiman and Robby Robot of course! <br /> <br /> Special effects are fantastic and the story is not too exhausted. This is a great science fiction experience!
