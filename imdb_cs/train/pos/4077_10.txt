I first saw it back in the early 1990s in the UK, I liked it, but I missed it, it's been a lot of years, but the movie always gets stuck and I've lost hope to see it again, the main thing I've got a good story, it's a great story, great music, the list goes on and on, OK, I'll tell you how good it is, but everyone is taking their own best off with them, once she sees it, yes the animation is splendid and beautiful to be watched, she showed her age in very few parts, but now she has become a part of beauty, I'm so glad she came out on DVD because it's one of my best 10 movies all . Buy or rent it just to see, the best watch is at night alone with a drink and food at your fingertips so you do not have to stop the movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
