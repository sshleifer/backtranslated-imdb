As one of the previous commentators, he said that it had the basics of a great movie, but something happened on the way to delivery. Such waste, because the performance of Collette was scary and Williams was credible. I just waited for it to improve. I do not think it would be a bad adaptation or a different director, it could have been the movie. It appeared as a Canadian movie, something like the first couple of X-Files seasons. It's not cheap, just hokey. It also needed a little more strain. Something that makes you jump out of the seat. The film reached that moment and then disappeared; something like a false culmination. I see that it would be too thrilling to take the "reality" of the story, but I thought that part was achieved when Gabriel was looking for the boy in the hospital. This movie must have a director's cut that tries to solve these problems.
