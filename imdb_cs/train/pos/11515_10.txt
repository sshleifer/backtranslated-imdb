It has been so many years since I saw it, but I feel compelled to defend this jewel against those who enjoy it. It is interesting and unusual to see the variety of opinions here. That's what I expect humor. It is subjective. It's either a charge of your funny bone at 60,000 volts, or it leaves you cold and you wonder why you gave her time. This show has some of the best British comic actors compiled in the story, which is stupid and disrespectful and the result is merry. Dialogue and visual comedy are beautifully delivered and two wires (Cleese and Lowe) are great together. This is done for them. <br /> <br /> I can not really say than to ask you to find it and look at it. You will not be disappointed, and in a world that does not have a soft humor, it is a classic, uncomfortable and harmless piece of comic luster.
