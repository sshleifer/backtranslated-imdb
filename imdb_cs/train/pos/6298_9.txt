Great fun. I went with 8 buddies to watch this movie. We came to see another, but after ten minutes we were wondering what the hell we were getting to this point, that the jokes were fun and they stayed fun for the whole movie. In the first part, you are still asking yourself about "malinski" and "bellini" (there are many other examples of this lingo) and because they repeat the same jokes (with different twists), they become fun and entertaining. In searching for this malino, all the main characters are introduced first, which is even more than the other. By the end of the movie, we did not even know the title of the movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this tricky track, but we certainly had a good time. The house was loaded (about 250 people) and I think about half did not like it and the other half loved the film. If you like strange comic movies with a great conversation, you will love it. In addition to Clooney, this film deserves much better than the 5.6 IMDB rating it has at the time I write it, but when I saw it more, I'm sure it will go up. 7.0 is reasonable, I think I would give him 8 out of 10. (10 out of 10 after a few beers) <br /> <br />
