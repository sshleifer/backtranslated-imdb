An effective film with four urban whips in the Appalachian crisis became synonymous with rural corruption. Each of the four entrepreneurs faces the darkest fears when faced with the demanding cruise water on the river to be replaced by a dam. When locals decide to "have their way" with their counterparts, it leads to several deaths and lots of trauma to the survivors. Each of the passengers is excellent, although Voight gives leadership and the most powerful performance. Rural scenery and culture are well captured, including breathtaking battles with banjos. I saw it the day it came out, not exactly the perfect data film (though we enjoyed it). I remember this as a dramatic performance for Burt, Voight was already founded. Not such a movie that you can watch every week, but it has a strong shot and is beautifully shot.
