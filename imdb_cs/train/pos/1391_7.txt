Since it was produced with a low budget, Daily Time is over, you can make the most of your budget with surprisingly good work with special effects. The story involves a family that is about to move into their own sun - thinking home in the isolated part of the Mojave desert in southwestern California, just to find out that it's trashed - motorcycle vandals, he thinks. But their youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) has begun to see mysterious things - the green pyramid, the strange humanoid characters, and so on. And recently, light from the star explosion of the stars elicited an extremely unusual polar light that appeared in the desert sky. The family, led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone, finds itself in the face of strange alien forces that are in space-time warp. <br /> <br /> Mixing in the elements of 2001: SPACE ODYSSEY and THIRD STREAMING, DAY TIME, IF YOU ARE LOOKING, despite its obvious shortcomings and uneven performance, remains interesting due to David Allen's excellent work with special effects. Desert setting is great for close encounters with this movie; and while the film can not actually be compared to either Kubrick's or Spielberg's films, Daytime Time is much better than many other 2001 / CLOSE ENCOUNTERS knock-offs. I acknowledge the director John "Budo Cardos", whose 1977 thriller THE KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS has made an interesting precursor of ARACHNOPHOBIE, at least because I tried - and on this basis I am giving Daylight Time 7 out of 10.
