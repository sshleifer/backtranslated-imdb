I saw "Fever Pitch" by accident; played on an airplane that headed for Europe. In fact, it was not bad either. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is the # 1 Red Sox fan in the world, but his relationship with Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore) can do it. The film is quite an interesting view of how world events can affect people's relationships. It's a special opening time when Red Sox ended up with an 80-year loss strip. I think these things are happening and we simply do not tend to observe them. That's not bad. Another movie that shows an unusual relationship to baseball is "Frequency" of 2000. Check both of them.
