I really really enjoyed this movie. (So ​​I was surprised that so many users on this site had so low a rating!) I do not say it's a film masterpiece, but it was a great way to spend a cold, snowy Saturday night. It's funny, dizzying and great stories about the rise and fall of female friends that take the hard times and bad things your friends have with each other! (Fess up ladies, we all have it!) Bill Paterson shines like Reverand Gerald Marsden and Andie McDowell proves she can be a good actress when the role is right and she thinks so. (And really there is the best "wedding getaway" I've ever seen or dreamed of in this movie ... more courage than anyone I've ever known!) You'll laugh and cry - ignore all marketing campaigns and how this film is marketed ... it's a hidden jewel to make TONNES out of the box office. (now I have to look around and buy a copy!)
