This film seems to be well remembered as the time Tom & Jerry signed a peace treaty. Things are idyllic for some time, but it is predictably worse. Probably the most memorable moment was an endless fight involving a pipe, a frying pan and a baseball bat, which two more Butch's dogs deal at the beginning and at the end of a short one. I liked a bunch and you should try to catch him on Cartoon Network.
