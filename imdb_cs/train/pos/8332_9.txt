The part where Meg visits the drive and says, "Is the piston short?" (suggesting poor sexual energy from her fianc√©e) was cheerful. I love Meg Ryan and is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie. Very nice and very intelligent. Her innocent angry expressions you want her to be yours. The hero treats the garage mechanic with the transformation of physics. Einstein had a romantic side of his soul? He liked the puzzle before the press and the audience did well. It is badly underestimated and deserves appreciation and attempts to revive. It loses one vote for including the very unlikely far-reaching theory that the American governor has bought. I do not understand why it's not in the top 20 romantic comedies of the century. A big movie, it's got a presidential seal!
