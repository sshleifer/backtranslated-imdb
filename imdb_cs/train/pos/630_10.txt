I did not expect much from this movie. I got a ticket to an advanced screening. I just got out of work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait in the movie for 40 minutes, and there seemed to be no cool air flowing through the corridors of the theater complex. After settling in the theater, tired and frustrated, the film began, I did not know any of the actors at the beginning, but the flow of the film was perfect. Right from the start, I was getting involved with the movie, getting more excited every minute. I think this movie is destined to be a fantasy / fairytale classic. The actors were wonderful, the pace was perfect and the end was magical.
