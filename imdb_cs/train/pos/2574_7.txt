Ten years after the first film, James Belushi, one of the most talented and more than the last twenty-two, has appeared as a comedy actor, he returns as Detective Dooley for this film. If you expect more like the first movie, you will be disappointed, but it's still a good movie. He realized that all boycot scenarios in the fight against boys were likely to be used in the first film; this approach approaches a bit more psychologically because it focuses on the criminals who fix the recently deceased wife of Dooley after refusing her book and kills Dooley for her death. The script does not have to be the best, but the film allows both Belushi and Christine Tucci to showcase their good acting skills, and still retain enough light humor to make it work, and chemistry between the two stars is all there to see. <br /> <br /> A simple, lightweight movie that, although perhaps worth buying, if you are not a true fan of either the first movie or Belushi, definitely worth watching when it comes to television. <br /> <br />
