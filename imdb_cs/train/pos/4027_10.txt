Very good adaptation of the novel amrita pritam. Urmila and Manoj Bajpai gave the best. <br /> <br /> There is a natural taste in the movie and I felt it right. It seemed as though Bollywood had finally made it a charm, and some artists on the screen were on the screen. The content of the film describes very precisely what exactly happened during the division by showing the suffering of a certain family and also showing that trust in the life of man goes beyond religion. <br /> <br /> The best part was that it did not do a drama with a lot of tearful intermingling and melodrama. <br /> <br /> I just loved it.
