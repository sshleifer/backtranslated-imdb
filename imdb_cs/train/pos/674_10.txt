While most people watching the movie will be of little interest, but of the many hundreds of films that deal with magic and occult in one form or another, it is probably the best in many ways. <br /> <br /> From Golem to Craft, the theme seems to be the endless interest of the film industry. Most of the films that touch it make it childish (for example, "Witchboard," a real piece of complete waste in every direction) either to take over transcendent elements such as cheap excuses for bold special effects, or villians plumber cutouts (cf "Sorcerer"). It appears more often in a hysterical religious context (the antichrist is inevitably the essence of some New Age practice in various films aimed at revealing). Rarely it seems that the film shows at least some experience of magic as it is practiced in real life, but the occult presentation in such films may at best be described as allegorical rather than literal or symbolic, or ... that is not entirely true. I watched the film many years later tonight. I've already seen it on VHS; it's a dark, moody piece and after watching it on DVD, I would say that if you intend to watch this movie, watch it on DVD, do not watch it on VHS. <br /> <br /> Darkness and mood are in VHS overflowing, but the DVD movie has a very different tone. I think Weir pushed dark aspects deliberately into style, but when the film is transformed into a lower color VHS medium, it goes over the edge. DVD re-animates the movie and I saw it differently. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I saw it as though for the first time I realized that magic therapy is very good in this movie. It's hard to go to all the reasons why I do not like it. <br /> <br /> For anyone who is curious if you want to see what it is in real life, this movie is just very real on countless levels. And for anyone who is not, you really have been reading the time of reading at this point.
