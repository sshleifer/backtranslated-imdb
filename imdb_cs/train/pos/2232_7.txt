I saw it when I was 17 years old and since then I have not seen it. "CBS Late Movie" appeared regularly at one time. I remember how sad and disturbing it was that my belly was really losing me. The effects were not what they were today, but it still made him feel alone in the Amazon after he had lost both parents and was looking for a way out very well. I remember the errors and worms most, so realistic that eating her meat. It's a dark film, which was a controversial topic at the time, though it was probably hard for TV. I wish I could remember more details and if I ever had the opportunity to see it again, I can comment more. I've been looking for years. I believe it could have been proven on CBS under the other name. I have no idea if it was ever allowed on a video.
