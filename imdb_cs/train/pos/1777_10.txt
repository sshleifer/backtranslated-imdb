When I first saw the Romeo Division last spring, my first reaction was BRILLIANT! But in future views I got much more than a masterpiece. This film has a unique voice that will reflect the entire history of the film. <br /> <br /> The opening assembly provides a wonderful palette that JP Sarro can use to create his art on this canvas of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Sarro actually uses the camera as a brush while driving us on a journey that surrounds the audience in a giant action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we are accustomed to, and immerses deep into the dark themes of betrayal, revenge, and the importance of society. This film is the dream of every director in his very heart. But Sarro was not alone in this epic business. The script provided by the scribe Tim Sheridan was just as fascinating. The dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such presence and charisma on the screen. In particular, the final scene (WARNING: SPOILERS !!! SPOILERS !!!), where Vanessa reveals itself as coalitions and dangers all the time, is written in such a dark tone that it is one of the coldest endings I've ever seen. Sheridan is another Robert Town. <br /> <br /> In the final note, it is clear that this production was not a small performance. That's why it must be a lot of praise to producer Scott Shipley, who seems to have the creativity and genius to walk alongside Jerry Bruckheimer. I have never seen such a production with such great attention focused on every little detail. Producer work is one of the toughest movies, and Shipley looks easy. This whole film combines creative writing, stunning production and masterful direction. This is the art of the best film. When the movie ends, the only thing that's required is more. Romeo Division is a pioneering, masterpiece and most importantly, the Romeo Division is truly art.
