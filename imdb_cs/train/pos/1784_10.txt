The evening is a fun movie with pretty depth. All actors and actresses are in spectacular performances. However, starring actor is expected with a huge cast, but expectations are exceeded in this movie. One can relate to personalities and situations in their own family. When looking at the interaction of family members, their family memories are immediately remembered. This is one of the few films that inspired the book. It is usually the opposite; one reads a book and then wants to see the movie. I will definitely receive a copy of Susan Minot's book and read it. Rhode Island scenery is spectacular, just like a soundtrack. Every car buff will look forward to a professionally restored car. Needless to say, but I recommend a lot in the evening. See that you will like it.
