I fell in love with Emily Watson in Breaking the Waves and then fascinated her diversity and perfection in Hilary and Jackie. Now comes this amazing picture of a rich girl who refuses to breed and convene in favor of the mother of the tortured soul of a child of a man who obviously needs maternity. Her eyes are the mirror of his soul - and what fine and beautiful eyes are. Those who take things literally find the poetic and allegorical direction of Marleen Gorris quite frustrating. Romance, who are willing to go with amazing kinetic energy, is this rewarding allegorical poem well rewarded.
