I saw a movie at the Vienna theater a few years ago, where the audience liked. I also enjoyed the Phoenix summer show, which I was always interested in, so I decided to write a comment. The story takes place in London around 1900 when a Jewish girl decides to become an actress. Desperately trying to become one, but that's not before you treat her badly, she realizes on the stage that she has the talent and that she connects with the audience and appears to be a stronger person. <br /> <br /> There were some reviews, her performance was broken, she accused her of being boring, unable to bring her personality life. I think it's her powerful thing, that's exactly what Esther Kahn should be, and Phoenix boldly decides that Esther is a pretty boring girl. So its transformation at the end is stronger than it would otherwise be. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is great, the pictures of London around the turn of the century are very dark and sad, you can see what annoying life it was. <br /> <br /> The only mistake, in my opinion, is the length of the movie, the loss of touch with the characters, after all, it's just about finding an actor inside, so there's no dramatic action in the movie. It is Phoenix that they did not lose interest in the film after the first hour.
