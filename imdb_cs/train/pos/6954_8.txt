This movie was one of the most entertaining films I've seen for years, and my laughter with listeners supports me. Not since my big fat Greek wedding (2002) laughs as spontaneous and intense. Easily complicated than last year's mistress and Mrs. Smith (2005) in the use of parody (espionage with Mrs. and Mrs. Smith and sex in My Super Ex-Girlfriend). Director Ivan Reitman, the balance between comedy and drama, crazy and totally absurd is great. Never get shocked and dramatic to seriously crack the rule of comedy. At the same time, this predictable, romantic comedy never loses the emotional elements in question, even if the end is broadcast in advance. In some ways, it's so obvious that it's great to see how it plays. Just as in real life, sometimes the truth is so obvious that it really can not be seen. Only eight out of ten stars have coached with Tootsiem (1982). Maybe nine (depending on how they appear on the second view).
