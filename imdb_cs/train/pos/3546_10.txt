One of the best musicals he has ever done is an example of where producers and directors are afraid to select actors for their talents, rather than what people could expect. The lighting and set are unique, giving them a very interesting effect (it has a strange name I do not think of). The dialog is also unique in that no contractions are used. The film is great, beautiful and interesting from start to finish. Real joy is MUSIC. Such a line of first-class songs from the beginning to the end that are perfectly executed and organized. Also, the music is very original and very memorable and I think it is superior to many musicals from the 1930s to the 1960s. It certainly has original and more beautiful songs than most musicals that can only have two or three. It's not bad for a director without experience with this type of movie. Another quality is that it's fresh every time you see it.
