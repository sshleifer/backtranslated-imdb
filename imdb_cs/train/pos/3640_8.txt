This is one of my favorite sports movies. Dennis Quaid moves and convinces the part of the man who has given up his dream of being a pitcher of baseball when his hand has reached him. As a college coach, he urges players to win a division championship by telling them to try the baseball team if they do. They win (partly due to all the work they take with the coach who can go over 90 miles per hour), and he keeps his side of the deal - and it's signed! <br /> <br /> If you've ever decided to try something new and frightening as an adult, the Jim Morris story will resonate with you. It is moving and inspiring, and human relationships are true. <br /> <br /> Inspiration is not the only reason why I rented this property. Dennis Quaid is purely pure in this part, and a baseball movie with a handsome man who changes the diaper is my thought in the sky. Ladies, if you feel like I'm doing this, check this out.
