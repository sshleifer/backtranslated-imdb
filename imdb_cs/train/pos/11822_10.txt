Dick Tracy is one of my favorite movies. I have to admit to those who have not seen them. You will either really love or you really hate it. It was a year after Batman's success. Every expectation was so high that many of them were released simply because the plot is so simple. But it's based on a comic book ... what did you expect? Creatively, this movie is amazing! Sets, makeup, music, costumes and impressive acting make this movie fantastic. The film has bloody violence and no bad language - it's rare today. Director, producer and star Warren Beatty as a warrior ese crime against the evil Big Boy Caprice Al Pacino and his mob of criminals. Madonna steal the show as a seductive Breathless Mahoney. This is one of the best characters Madonna ever played. It's what I've heard! Fans Madonna would like to! One of the best things about the movie is that they only used seven colors to look like a comic book. This film is really a work of art unfortunately overlooked by the public. To summarize things, this film will bring a child in us all. It's a movie that smiles at the end.
