I love Ashley Judd and I think all her movies are great. Ruby <br /> <br /> in paradise is one of the best. It's a very underestimated movie that you really have to watch to appreciate it. A story about women who are trying to do it on their own and refuse to be tempted to make life easier. Some of her films, such as Kiss The Girls and Time to Kill, were probably thriving in the box office and video rental. They were also very good movies <br /> <br />, but take time to really look at Ruby and I think you'll agree that she is one of Ashley's best. <br /> <br />
