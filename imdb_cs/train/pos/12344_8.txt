Marine observation was made from the original scenario of Akira Kurosawa and it's really a fresh and warm film. Watching it will be a pleasure! Kei Kumai as a director is definitely not equal to the old but eternal master (especially the mass scene at the beginning of the film has some horrible acting) but the overall mood and landscape is very pleasant. Another thing that is missing: Kurosawa has always managed to leave the characters much more than what they actually show and do. It was probably his magic on the set when filming; and perhaps this scenario has not yet fully par. <br /> <br /> Maybe we just miss the commander's eye. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful and sweet film, but it's no Kurosawa. Expect that it could be very stupid ...
