"Stanley and Iris" show the triumph of the human spirit. For Stanley, this is an attempt to become literate and realize its potential. Iris needs to find the courage to love again after becoming a widow. The beauty of the film is a dance that Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda are doing together, starting and stopping, before everyone has the skills and courage to fully trust and continue. In this sense, he gives us a very good look at how life is often and therefore is trusted. Unlike some other reviewers, I found that the characters that are displayed are consistent across the image. Support for cast is also carefully selected and adds the depth of character that the main characters gain added value from supportive performances. Overall, this is an excellent movie. The best thing I take from it is hope.
