And I'm fanatical Nicole Kidman. I would pay to see her and hear how to read a telephone book in Moscow, which, apparently, she might do when she spoke Russian in this film. <br /> <br /> All four principles are excellent, but the film itself is a series of good shots and better scenes that are unrelated to anything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> While a person is always ready to stop mistrust while watching a movie, this question is too much from the browser. <br /> <br /> It could have been very fun (partly) or quite frightening (which is in one scene), but the director apparently did not know where to go.
