I believe Sarafina is a huge effort by Whoopi Goldberg. Besides her there are no other stars in the movie, and her role is smaller than the title character, Sarafina. As I work in high school with urban children, I think it's an important film that shows the South African apartheid history. Sarafina is a film about the education and relationship of a teacher with his disciple Sarafin. I bought a video for virtually nothing on the videostore. I looked at him and quickly passed the musical numbers. I strongly recommend that this film be understood by the teachers and their students. Now that they do not know the other actors and actresses in the movie, I suppose they are very popular in South Africa and I'm glad to have filmed South African cast and crew except Goldberg in a small role, but if people appear this film before Whoopi reaches a worldwide appeal .
