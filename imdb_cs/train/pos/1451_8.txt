I've seen this movie about 6 times. And every time I look at it I'm more impressed with the story and the acting. It's like watching a train wreck on the move. Their gentle approach, but very effective in achieving their goal. <br /> <br /> Spoilers-> There is a very nice dichotomy at the heart of the story. On the one hand, we have Deputy Major Eddy Calhoun (Cusack), who unwittingly tears in the Old Boys network that forms the throat of the New York headquarters, and on the other hand, we have the Zapati mob boss who deliberately attempts to maintain the status quo by all means. This situation will peak to the end when Zappat orders Alselmo to make it easier for himself and Calhoun has ordered Pappas to do the same, politically speaking. The film also contains some really great unicorns like (my personal weakness): - at one point you are not disturbing the life of a person - The only thing new in this world is a history you do not know <br /> <br /> All in all, great a movie that deserves a much higher rating.
