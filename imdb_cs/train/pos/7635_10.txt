I've seen this movie a lot of time and I have to tell you, I have always enjoyed it. That's according to Belushi's top film. Belusha and Lovitz are so common and identifiable with an ordinary person who can not help, but engage as soon as you start watching. The film has a wonderful cast of stars, some have been great and others have just begun. It's billed as a good movie, and that's exactly what it is. This movie teaches you that life is not so bad. Sometimes you have to look at things from another perspective to fully appreciate what you already have. When you watch, you will appreciate things that have a lot more and you are smiling. From the movie, I think you can not ask for much more, not to mention that it's a funny movie and you never lose interest. Very Very underestimated movie here. <br /> <br /> Rating by me: 10 I'm out!
