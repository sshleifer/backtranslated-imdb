As a big fan of the romantic comedy genre, and so I've seen a great deal of these films, it's rare that someone thinks she's absolutely unique. It's so seldom that I breathe laughter during several scenarios. The love story is a little thin on the ground, but I think it's probably the best, because this romantic comedy has a strong emphasis on "comedy" and in any case extends the credibility limit a little more than I love most rom. Four scientists have provided some of the most entertaining moments not only in this movie but in any movie I've seen long ago. I hesitantly finally decided to choose "10" for "9" because I think too many people use it without distinction and therefore the maximum rating loses part of its impact. I'm also a big fan of Meg Ryan, who is helping, but it's one of the few movies I've ever seen that I'm totally overshadowed. She and Tim Robbins are cast as guides, but for me, I play the second violin in the fearsome intellectuals. Original film of laughter.
