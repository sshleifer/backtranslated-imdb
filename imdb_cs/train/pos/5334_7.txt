Let's look, although we do not like it, we must all suppress our concerns about the extreme likelihood of experiencing the events that happen in this movie. You know that you will get to your car and immediately start thinking, "God, I hope today is not the day my accelerator is holding at a comfortable cruising speed of 55 mph, all four door latch breaks in the locked position, the main and the emergency brake fails , my ignition switch can not turn off and I have a full gas tank all at the same time. "Fortunately, for most of us, our Thorazin will board before we really decide it's a bad idea to drive a car. It's not so for the creator of an annoying, white-knuckle, the edge of your seat (if you're just about to leave the room) action juggernaut, "Runaway Car" But they go forward and they're going the same way! <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <i> I am extremely pleased to have found (thanks imdb) that this movie is real and that I not only dream. <br /> <br /> This film is at least one fantastic monument that you will see on your way to find El Dorado from the Very Bad Cinema. <br /> <br /> I recommend this.
