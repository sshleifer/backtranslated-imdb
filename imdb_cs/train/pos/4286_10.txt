I saw this movie (English title is "Who Sings There?") At the Montreal International Film Festival in 1980. He won raves and ... vanished. Terrible damage. He is great. Speaking, ridiculous, sad and extremely entertaining. Scenario is a work of art. It's been 19 years and I have seen only a few musical comedies (or some other genre) that can match its originality.
