I bought it a year or more for two dollars (yeah, $ 2), left it on the shelf for ages, now looking at the DVD while it was cold with cold. This is a scary movie. Brilliant performance of all the actors, especially the boy 6yo (the only smile you get in this movie). The plot reminds me of my favorite movie sometimes, Grosse Pointe Blank, but of course it's careless is a hard heart. <br /> <br /> As a psychologist, clinical and forensic psychologist, when I discovered the identity of the new treaty, I was shivering. Scary things! Brilliant work everywhere. <br /> <br /> Pete
