This is a fantastic series in particular. It is very well done and very interesting. As a great defender of the Second World War, I learned a lot from seeing this series. One of the best things to say about this is all the interviews with past individuals when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, quite rightly it is. It's nothing against the men you see in today's interviews, it's just that most of these men have not really been involved in the upper stages of what happened then. One of the best parts is the story of Sir Laurence Oliver. I would recommend it to all who want to know about World War II, but they really think they will want to buy or track more than once. My only real complaint about this series is that some facts are not as accurate as we know it today. In particular, information about the Soviet Union is exaggerated or simply inaccurate in places. This information is now different, which we now know because of the collapse of the USSR. Overall, the fascinating view of World War II and a serious historian of the Second World War must be both professional and personal.
