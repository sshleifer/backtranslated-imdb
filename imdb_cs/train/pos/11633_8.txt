Red Eye is not the kind of film that will win Palme d'Or, but Wes Craven has never been such a director, and his branding is a good sign of what movie fans expect. > <br /> <br /> The fact that Red Eye is a tight small, unpretentious package after 94 minutes is part of his magic and suggests Craven's craft in producing a light but generally pleasant cash register. In fact, it's the perfect kind of movie that will turn out to be entertaining fun and attention without causing the viewer any intellectual or emotional problems. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is a feeling of cheese, an indefinite terrorist subplot of motivation and supportive characters, and the main part is a TV movie. But there are certain elements of the Hitchcock tension and Schumacher's Phone Booth echo, which is ultimately a more sophisticated (and challenging) game on the same idea of ​​an emotional crisis that is being suppressed in public. <br /> <br /> For a film that focuses primarily on two people sitting on aviation seats, they live or die on characters and scripts. Cillian's icy, but eloquent Jackson Rippner and Rachel MacAdams inventive Lisa are the main reasons why the film will be taken away. Not only do you do dialogue, but you also give some dimension to the Adama-type Ribu in the fight for "male logic" against female "sensitivity". In the final part of the movie Craven, a bit of Scream style feels like a man-chases-girl-with-knife. The most striking thing here is what Brian Cox looks like after "Just for Men", his ubiquitous appearance in films such as Super Troopers, Ring and it makes him a sexegenarian version of Jude Law. <br /> <br /> Entertainment for short distances.
