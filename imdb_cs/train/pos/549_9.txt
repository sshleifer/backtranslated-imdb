It is 1896. Jeff Webster (James Stewart) does not like people. There's only one friend he has, and it's Ben Tatum (old sympathizer) Walter Brennan. They are led with cattle herds. Their key to wealth. Skagway gets into trouble when Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire) takes cattle. Now Jeff just has to get it back and drive it across the Canadian US border to Dawson. Now they have a group of other people with like ladies Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) and Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet). There, two men get into the gold shop. Anton√≠n Mann and James Stewart in the Fourth Cooperative, The Far Country (1954) The acting work is wonderful. Walter Brennan makes an amazing sidekick for Stewart. Roman Roman is great and Corinne Calvet is beautiful. Jay C. Flippen is very good as Dawson Marshal Rube Morris. Big Jack Elam and Kathleen Freeman are seen in smaller roles. It's fantastic to watch Jimmy Stewart overcome. They're the men and his rifle. But it is also vulnerable.
