I have to admit I went to Fever Pitch with low expectations. It's not a huge revelation to me that the last film by Jimmy Fallon (Taxi) was frantic, and the trailers for the Fever Pitch were all right, but they did not satisfy me. I've been working some cheese baseball for my reviews ... <br /> <br /> "I like Jimmy Fallon, but Taxi hit one in my film career, well, now we have steeeeee-riiiiiike twoooooooo! , and it's back to SNL! "or" Buy some peanuts and cracker jacks, but do not buy Fever Pitch tickets, you'll go out of the theater and never come back! " Then the film should go and be much more fun than I expected. But hey, I can not let my toys go to waste, right? Another reason I thought I did not care about the film is that I hate Boston Red Sox. My whole family is hating. Just mentioning the name of Pedro Martinez sends me when I run into the bathroom. Oh, man, hold on ... <br /> <br /> ... All right, I'm back. However, my mom who is a fan of St. Louis Cardinals, still believing that the World Series was manipulated last year. She refuses to believe that Sox has earned her. But I'm a man to admit that Fever Pitch made me feel compassionate, though only gently, due to the misfortune of the Red Sox fans. Anyone who has a passion for sports will be able to concentrate the film on some level. If you do not have a favorite sports team, you can not fully understand the extreme peaks and minima that a fan like Fallon Ben can pass through. There is nothing as fresh as the smell of a new season and nothing as smooth as pure slate. Well, figuratively speaking. It's a pleasure to be a sports fan. "Wait until next year," it becomes your mantra, your motto, your prayer - and Fever Pitch effectively captures this essence. I love the fact that the film takes a fictional story and throws it against the real backdrop of the unlikely world series Red Sox running last year. I do not love so much I'd take it, but you know what I mean. I expected it to be rather cheesy, and while some of the humor is a little stupid, it's quite realistic. You see, Ben's uncle took him to his first Red Sox game when he was seven years old and when he died, Ben left his two tickets. Ben will not miss the game in 23 years. At the beginning of each season, there is a design day when they gather together with their friends to find out who can attend. He does every dance for Yankees games and whenever someone complains that he is threatening playing cards with Royals (sorry Mr. Shade) and diablo rays. It's a very good scene and it works so well, because I really know the people who make the "ticket design". I also have to admit that I can rely on Ben to go to dinner with Lindsey and her parents. Red Sox are playing a road game, but instead of watching it on television, Ben decides to bandwagon. One of the most dangerous things in life is to record the game and then go public and try to avoid interrogation. He was there. It is a tense and frightening situation. Weeeeeell, Ben enters the dangerous zone when a boy comes to the restaurant and says he is looking at the game. Ben immediately covers his ears and starts shouting like a banshee so he does not hear the result. Lindsey is embarrassed and her parents do not know what they think. Yeah, sports fans can be weird, I do not deny it. But it is real. <br /> <br /> Now, if you expect the rough, ugly things known by the Farrelly Brothers, then you might be disappointed. But they have their moments, as when Ben says he likes Lindsey sometimes speaking from the mouth of "like the adorable victim of a stroke," but overall it's definitely softer and romantic. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the movie is sometimes too agile. Luckily, when the sand begins to pee, Farrells know when to lose. The romantic moment when Lindsey jumped into the field and ran to Ben to say she did not like love, turned and Ben honestly replied, "You have to tell me what's going on in the playground." Jimmy Fallon proves to be the right material well done on the big screen and Drew Barrymore remains a constant source of romantic comedy spells.Fever Pitch is just a good and solid fun that captures a somewhat fresh look at the romantic comedy genre.It's a movie that can be related to boys and girls. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Now that the Red Sox fans have been able to close the Curse of the Bambino they will appreciate it My Memphis Tigers NEVER won the NCAA Basketball Championship, so I officially declare my life is bigger than you. <br /> <br /> GIST Fans of Jimmy Fallon, Drew Barrymor e, romantic comedy, Red Sox, baseball or sport Fanatism generally should think that Fever Pitch should look like. I would not be out of the way to rush and see it in the first available time, but it will be a great matinee. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.25 (of 5)
