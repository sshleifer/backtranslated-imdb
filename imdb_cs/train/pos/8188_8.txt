I was looking forward to the first part of these two parters, The Impossible Planet, and I was a little afraid that the second part would not last as well as it had been in the past two parters of the last 2 Who series. Fortunately, my fears were unjustified when I found myself in this episode as well as the previous one. Anyway, we start with surviving crew members on the run from Ooda, who have become the Devil's Pawn. There's also a little philosophy on the doctor's part in the episode that I liked quite a bit. Needless to say, it was a good solid Doctor Who story. It could be too intense for younger audiences. <br /> <br /> My rating: B +
