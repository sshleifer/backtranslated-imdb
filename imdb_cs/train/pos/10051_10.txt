Family issues rely on real life and that's about the movie. Love can hold members together through trials and experiments, and that's what this movie is about. One person, Dad, has maturity and endurance to keep the family face to face. Children are growing up, it's hard to realize that no matter how older they are or parents, the parent still loves their children and is willing to give them a cushion when they fall. All the actors who displayed their characters did excellent performances. Yes, I flew along the way because I knew I had a similar experience as a young adult and later as a parent. This true life is one that every young adult and parent could see well, although some do not realize it until they are even parents. They must see for those who care for their families.
