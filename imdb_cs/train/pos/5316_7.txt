This is the second film I've seen as director Ida Lupino since the 53's. I think it was a better movie than this one. This girl has a girl to marry, and she is sexually attacked, and she does not like everyone who's looking for her and talks about her to run away and be accepted by her family. I think Leonard Maltin's review is right, just to give him 2 and 1/2 stars.
