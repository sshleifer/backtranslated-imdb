This is one of the best crime-drama films in the late 1990s. He was packed with great cast, powerful action, and many of the players who played on him gave great performances. Pacino was great; should be nominated for something. John Cusack was also good as long as the viewer does not mind his Louuu-Siyan accent. It may be unpleasant if you can not endure this dialect. The way Pacino's character interacts with Cusack's character was believable, dramatic, and slightly comic. Danny Aiello was as good as ever. David Paymer had a great supporting role. Bridget Fonda was good, but unforgettable. There were times when he mentioned so many characters in this figure, probably too many. It may take a second time to remember: "Who was Zapatti who was?" After so many cross references, one has to stop and think about just to reappear. The end had no stings. It was built for so long and then was a little disappointing. This was one of the few problems with the film. Since the movie was not accounted for as a "huge, successful hit" on the big screen, it forgot that this film even existed. Pacino and Aiello were great, but the film's lack of "splash" in theaters may not match any nominations. The domestic market was partially successful and viewers still learn that this title is out. Made in 1996, it still stands and remains popular for many years. <br /> <br /> So make some lemon pudding (you will see) and you will see this movie!
