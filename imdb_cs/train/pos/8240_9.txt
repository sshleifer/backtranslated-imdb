I was also at the premiere in Toronto. This movie was a kind of consolation when I thought I could not get my first choice. Well, I was completely bleeding. By the time I got into the theater, I remembered something other than the basic script of the movie (yes, I actually forgot who was in it). An amazing performance from the cast. Carrie-Anne Moss was great in the real departure of her days as Trinity. As far as Billy Connolly is concerned, I do not think that since Chaplin played so well, he has no borders whatsoever. The kids were great too. Be sure to check this option if you have the option. <br /> <br /> And by the way, I still saw my first choice - and that was much better.
