I enjoyed the silent noir of the first part, the acting of Pacino and Cusaka, especially their scenes together. It was influenced by the mood of the environment and the concentration of the old pole and idealistic youth. I wish Bridget Fonda had more scenes in the film; was a serious and attractive figure. The film came from the railing when the mayor assistant began to move around the mafia to get to the bottom of something his boss would not want to interfere with. No one in the right mind met a landfill on a deserted dock. Here the story became unlikely. Something I do not understand: why the cop and Vito got a shootout if the other guy provided information that could destroy the corrupt referee?
