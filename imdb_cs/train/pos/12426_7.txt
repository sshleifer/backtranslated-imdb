David Duchovney creates a role he should have somewhat replicated in Californication - a talented problem. And that's the role she plays well. <br /> <br /> This thriller begins with speed and takes you to the end. Timothy Hutton plays a delicate villain and Angelina Jolie. The story of an abused doctor who has entered the criminal world is well written. Drug addiction and the desire for a drunken Jolie mix a hectic cocktail. Unfortunately, at the end, the story is a little weaker and the relationship between villains and FBIs is confused and rushed as if they were only created to create the final scene. But it's a side of the movie that's worth seeing.
