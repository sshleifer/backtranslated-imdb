I think if you asked most of JW, if they expect miraculous treatment because of their faith, you will find that not. I know not. You find instead of believing that the promises that Christ created the resurrection. So even if it gets worse and we die while maintaining our integrity, Jehovah can and will correct it. It really gets to the simple question: is it true God is it all to believe? If he is real and you trust him, you will follow his instructions no matter what short-term result he may be. I had a heart attack a year and a half ago. One in my family was horrified when she saw the words "NO BLOOD" written in capital letters on my chart. I thought with her that if I were in a position to save my life only by blood transfusion, would it be a good time to excite me, only to return to my life when the time comes? She did not have it - God simply is not real to her. Very bad. I wish she could have the well-being of the strong faith.
