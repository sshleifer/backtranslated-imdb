When they both saw "fear of black hats" and "it's a spinal tap," I can honestly say that while they are similar, they both have to see. It will be many times in the "fear" that will have you in the hysterics. No wonder why both films have such a huge cult. "Fear" will soon be available on DVD. Rent it if necessary, but the only way to enjoy this movie is to have it for yourself.
