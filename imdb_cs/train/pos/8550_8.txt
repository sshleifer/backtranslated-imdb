Now I like American Pie 1 and 2, while 3 were great for the performance of Seanna William Scott as Stifler, but then the quality was down. Band Camp has maintained a relatively high standard with the characters you really care about, but Naked Mile was the same joke and fence-recycled lines (Erika Stifler's sex problem is like Jim's). She had several fun moments like a football game against the dwarves and a "punishment" for the Co-Oman, but overall she lacked originality and "Mile" was simply stupid and sad. Not to mention an irritating girlfriend who does not want to have sex. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enough of the Naked Mile. I was looking at Beta House with worries because I thought the series could get a new one, but I was pleasantly surprised. To be honest, there is no real conspiracy, but it is full of zealous girls (Ashley's incredible) and humorous funny sex. Yes, it's the wording and the jokes are old, but Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) raises the bar with a lush performance. The Greek Olympics are especially entertaining and final events, while the story of Christopher McDonald is fun. But there are weak points. The Co-Earth is as irritated as he was in the first one, I still think of how he got to him. <br /> <br /> While the Co-Earth is bad, Erik Stifler is worse. John White made Naked Mile a pain to watch, but in Beta House he took his performance to a whole new level. In the first place, it lacks charisma, which is a prerequisite for Stifler. You really do not have to worry about him. The only reason I was worried about his relationship was that Ashley could be on the screen! They light up on him, like the rest of the cast. Seriously, John White is a bad actor and has so much charisma as a dead fish. <br /> <br /> Let's say the movie is entertaining and Cowan's fear that his girlfriend is not exactly a girl is great funny. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is worth renting, getting a few of your buddies and laughing at the vomiting-fest events and bleeding your anger at Erik 'loser' Stifler.
