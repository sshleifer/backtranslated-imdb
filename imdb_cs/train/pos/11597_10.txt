I have read so many comments that I also remembered sharing and wanted to see it again, but I did not know the name of the movie. Fortunately, because I searched for and found a title on this site, I read the comments that stayed here, and I realized that this is the movie I remembered. Then I searched and found the film and was so excited that I could watch the film 40 years later. Thanks to this page and your comments, you helped me, so I want to thank you all. I want to share how I was able to find this movie for all those who were looking for a copy as well. It was a VHS version of Wonderful World of Disney, called "Call it Courage," which featured 2 movies, the other being The Legend of the Boy and the Oul. He touched me as much as he had 40 years ago, and now owns his own copy. I think it's only available on VHS. I found it on eBay and I saw several copies there. Enjoy it, I know I did it! It's a wonderful story about love for the boy and the eagle that he took care of. When it was time to sacrifice an eagle, the boy set the eagle freely, for he could not afford to be killed. After the boy was forced to leave the tribe for punishment after releasing the eagle, the eagle saved him and taught him how to survive. The proximity that the boys and eagles shared in the wilderness was so moving and shooting was truly remarkable. What a great time. I've never seen something coming close to this movie!
