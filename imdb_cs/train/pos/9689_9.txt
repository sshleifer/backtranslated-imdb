So you think the talking parrot is not your cup of tea, huh? Well, think again. Paulie is a wonderful film full of touch moments. Characters are all nice, especially Paulie, when it enters the lives of many people on their way. It is the way it is worthwhile to experience. Do not miss! It is available in home video.
