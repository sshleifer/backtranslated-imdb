PG-13 rated for violence, short sexual humor and drug content. Quebec Rating: 13+ (should be G) Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> I saw a police story a few times. In my opinion, Police Story is Han's best 80's film originally because he did not like another policeman movie to play in which the Protector was. I did not see the protector, so I can not compare. The act is not too bad and the plot is quite good. i do not remember the story well because i saw this movie back but what i remember is this movie has a lot of great action stunts and comedy just what a good movie Chan needs.If you find Police Story and you are a fan of Chan buy this movie! <br /> <br /> Running: 106 minutes <br /> <br /> 9/10
