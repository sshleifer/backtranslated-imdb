Freely intended as satire D.W. Griffith's intolerance, The Three Ages was Buster Keaton's first attempt at a feature-length comedy. The only similarities with intolerance are the introductory "book" scene and the fact that similar stories for years have been co-edited into a complete film. Keaton's reason for adjusting this style was that if he failed as a feature film, he could drop to three reels. Fortunately, The Three Ages are great as comedies and includes some of the funniest routines I've seen in one of Keaton's films. There is nothing unique or courageous about the story. This is a simple boy-meets-girl, boy-losing-girl, boy gets-girl lands, but satire times are exciting and set a standard for future work by Mel Brooks and all the films of this genre. However, I do not believe that someone has ever given up on this comedy. Nobody can play a nice goof, like Keaton, and the spells in this movie are some of his best. In addition, Wallace Beery, like Keaton's competitor, seems to be adding to this film. Anyone who thinks comedy from the 1920s can not be appreciated by a modern audience needs to see this movie.
