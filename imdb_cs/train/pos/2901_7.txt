Tiempo de Valientes is greatly suited to the action film genre but surpasses its roots thanks to the excellent cast, the gigantic interconnection between its drivers and superb photography. Diego Peretti plays as dr. Silverstein, designed to ride a shotgun with detective Diaz (Luis Luque), who was charged with investigating the murder of two small hoods who appeared to be involved in a conspiracy of smuggling. Diaz was suspended from duty, but he is the best man for this job and must have professional psychiatric help to be restored. Silverstein and Diaz soon find themselves in a forbidden plot involving Argentine intelligence communities and uranium, and the film separates them at a decisive point that allows Silverstein to develop his impressive capable sleuthing. Peretti and Luque are excellent together and remind me of the screen of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, although Peretti is not as handsome as Hill. Not surprisingly, after almost two hours, Tiempo de Valientes is not exhausted, and indeed writer-director Damian Szifron sets a potential sequel to the charming code of the film. Overall, this is an amazing and very entertaining action comedy that is not even subject to the lowest common denominator, nor does it offend your intelligence.
