I already loved "How Grinch Christmas Stole" when it was released and I still love it now, 5 years later. Still a lot of people are far from agreeing with my opinion, and this movie has never really gotten a lot of love at the time it came out. Sure, the film is over the top and the camp, but that the same thing is why this movie is so magical and fun. All sets, costumes and characters are done in a perfect way, without ever becoming true laughter. It's a visually beautiful movie you can watch. It's a camping movie that does the best! Director Ron Howard will actually surprise you with this fun little Christmas movie. The main reason why the movie works and why it's so fun to watch is Jim Carrey like Grinch. The film really has a good and fun role. Of course, she is helped by a compelling make-up that has also won the Oscar. Of course, if you're Jim Carrey hate, you should not even think about watching this movie. This movie is really his film and he does it all the work and so much fun to watch. Another fun and unforgettable role is played by Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as young Grinch. The film has good morals, but it's a little scary for me. Maybe it's because I'm Dutch and in fact we celebrate Christmas that is excited and big here, just like in the United States or England. For me, the film was just fun and fun, and the morale just left me cold to be honest. James Horner's musical score is good and fun, although it's your average Horner diary, it all works perfectly for the movie and helps make some of the scene work. <br /> <br /> Perfect Christmas Fun. <br /> <br /> 8/10
