The direction behind this movie was fantastic for comedy. Many of the scenes appear to be comic and much darker (visually - not the wise story) than what I expected. This movie may not be the most funny movie you've ever done, especially if you're in gross sexist jokes because it has little (compared to others like Mary or American Pie). Once you repeat this, a few jokes are great and fun. If you've ever read a comic book or watched comic-type movies (Batman, X-Men, etc.) and liked them, you'll probably enjoy the humor that continues throughout the movie. If you do not like it, you can look forward to the respectable mockery that this movie has for you. If you liked this movie, dvd has some cool accessories. (8/10)
