Original vampires (1998) is one of my favorites. I was curious as to how the sequel continued, because he did not use any of the original characters. I was quite surprised how it won. The sequel is never as good as the original, with a few exceptions. Though this was not a great movie, the writer kept well on the main themes and vampire traditions from the first in the tattoo. Jon Bon Jovi was a disadvantage at first, but he turned out to be a very decent Slayer. I doubt anyone could first come out with James Wood at first, though ... unless you come to Buffy! Overall, it was a decent watch and I would watch it again. > <br /> I was rid of two questions, though ... what happened to Jack Crow and how did Derek Bliss become a killer? We guess we just have to leave it for imagination.
