I would like to imagine that if Steve McQueen knew he would become an icon and start "Finding the Dead Alive" in the same year that this film appeared or was in The Magnificent Seven in 1980, it would not do that. But he did it and we are richer for him. Sure, it's a classic camp. The horror of how it should be for the theater. It's fun and nostalgic. Interestingly, the last lines of the film were: Lieutenant Dave: At least we stopped it. Steve Andrews: Yeah, if the Arctic stays cool. <br /> <br /> They would never have imagined that the Arctic would have shaken 52 years ago. Blob will be back soon.
