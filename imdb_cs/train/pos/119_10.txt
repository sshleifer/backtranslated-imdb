The best way to describe Europa, which is on the list of the most popular films, is the scream that came from the companion after the film ended: "I did not know that the movies could be like this." Totally original in its visual style, it is one of the best examples of what a cinema can do. It's far from the "master and cover" of the shooting style as it can be; Perfectly integrating many layers of image, sound, effects, props, dialogue, voice, performance, editing, lighting, etc. ... all the same, no predominant. Despite the Hollywood "dialogue" shortsightedness, the cinema is not about dialogue, nor about beautiful lighting, action or music. It works best when all elements are in an equal position where only the idea of ​​BLENDING these elements in the order or in combination in which they are presented. Reduce or eliminate the contribution of one element and the movie has no meaning. "Europe" is what the cinema should do for it.
