Whether it's a good movie or not, movies of this kind have to be done, I think. He remembers "I Love Huckabees," a mostly mysterious film with Isabelle Huppert, who is sodomized by a young American in a muddy pond, in a merry sadistic-masochistic way (?? !!!!). I hope that the director will continue across borders as though I feel that the choices Vincenzo Natali created was not always subtle (some of the scenes were unfortunatelly "tarte-à-la-crème" as childish ghosts), talk about scenario and cinema ? The color of the "Cube" was black, "Nothing" is white, more cheerful, surprising than the former Natali movies.
