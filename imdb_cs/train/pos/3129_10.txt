This is one of the best action meetings when Adam West and Burt Ward parody and enjoy when they do it. It's an amazing amount of effort that has gone into detail, especially the 1960s, Batcave set, Wayne Manor, costumes and actors selected to play the younger versions of West, Ward, Burgess Meredith, Cesar Romero, and Frank Gorshin! This 90 minutes is worth your time and is a pleasure for all fans of the classic "Batman" TV series of 1960. I noticed that the clips from the movie "Batman" came from the movie and not from the series, probably due to legal constraints. Let's hope the three shows are on DVD.
