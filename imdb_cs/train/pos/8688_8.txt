The very high standard story of Columbo, which was actually the first filmed episode of a long series, but originally was second (after "Murder under the Book"). Robert Culp is the first of three to host a serial killer and plays a private detective agency who sucks Patricia Crowley's wife from a wealthy, highly influential merchant (Ray Milland plays very sympathetically) after falsifying the message in her favor after was found to have a matter. The woman later revolts against the blackmail scheme but is killed in a rage .... Very satisfying episode in many ways, especially when the plot is so strongly set up and subsequently developed and also because of the rare Columbo component that crime is unpremeditated killing. The whole thing is further strengthened when a married husband uses a murderer to help Columbo in his investigation: a feature that facilitates numerous high-quality scenes, especially first of all when three main characters meet and Columbo's fundamentally fraudulent features are a wonderful proof. <br /> <br /> Directed with the touch of Bernard L. Kowalski and acting at the appropriate level, it really set the tone for the whole series (since "Murder By The Book" was released by the bad end). The script by Columba Richard Levinson and William Link is accurate, well structured and well thought out and supported by a steady, productive pace and meaningful sequences that really show the unpredictability of the story. In the end, the finals duly agree that Columbo was always one step ahead of the assassin. Overall, it is a very fine piece of detective work for Columbo and strongly suggests that the production team has worked positively and constructively to create the polished Columbo story.
