This movie is fun. If you liked "Dave" with Kevin Klein, you'll get it out of it. Do you think that "Dave" left South America because Dreyfus plays Jack Noah, an actor in the work that is being channeled by Parador's secret police chief of state to replace the drunken dick Alfonse Simms after he had a heart attack and died. Noah encounters and helps his role as a former dictator's mistress when they try to defeat Raul Julie's plans. Jonathan Winters also looks like a hearty American emigrant who turns out to be the CIA. Also played by Polly Holiday and Fernando Rey. <br /> <br /> There are a few absurd moments like the old dictator's body stays frozen all year long and the last scene where Sonia Braga, who bees holding the bloody, limp body of Dreyfus, can be seen a moment later all in intact white , with a smudge nara on her. But all this is a great story.
