This is one of the few movies that are very erotic without being pornographic, even though it is a very rudimentary plot. There is not much loud sound or dialogue; but the actors are making voices describing their experiences, why they attended, etc. <br /> <br /> It's a documentary. <br /> <br /> It's fine. <br /> <br /> I can fully understand why no one else has ever tried to do something like this. There is something like that. This. :-) <br /> <br /> Note: The producer does not have the right to distribute the DVD version. I have never seen it sold anywhere; one can send Mr. Boerner and order a copy of VHS.
