On the recent Sunday, we came across a Gray Gardens documentary and got us without warning. Everyone who entered the room turned on television and attracted Edith and Edie pictures who seemed to live in practically one room of a large dirty mansion on the beach eating ice cream and corn on a tap (boiled on a bedside table) and the cat urinates on Edith's bed and her incredible words: "I'm on it (smell)". We did not see the beginning and wonder what we watched and how these aristocratic women managed to get to the position they were in. Magical! you must see!!!!
