This is a little jigsaw puzzle for many artificial people from Lynch. They tend to try to enroll as some kind of nonsensical, raw, side project by Lynch. Just as Lynch goes through the gas between his real pieces of film art. Well it can be fool, but it's one of those interesting fates that caught the excitement and they're embarrassed to admit you like it. <br /> <br /> Dumbland distilled over is art. What you can do with aspects of modern life, but laugh at it. If you took it seriously, you would go. You engage in it, feel it, taste it, feel its agony, its senseless stupidity, and then express it on whatever medium you choose. This is called art, and art is not stupid. But it's Dumbland.
