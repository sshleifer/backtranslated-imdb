A good thriller who works. It separates both secrets and secrets. How reluctant blacks buried racist legislators. It depends on unfair sanctions. Even if an innocently condemned innocent friendly black person can be a really vicious baddie. Sean Connery is great as an unknown, deeper than the hero. Laurence Fishburne is remarkably amazing as an average, arrogant but good cop. Underwood and Harris are over the top and refreshing as a malevolent psychos. Capeshaw is all right. Ruby Dee is great as a tough grandmother. The rest of the cast is also great.
