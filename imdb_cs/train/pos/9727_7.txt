Simon Pegg plays a crude gross and often out of control celebrity journalist who is brought from England to work for a great American magazine. Of course, his winning ways create a variety of complications. A fun comedy based on facts that Danny Huston and Jeff Bridges together with Christ Dunste (looks more grown). It works mainly because we like Simon Pegg despite his bad behavior. We will fully understand why Kristen Dunst continues to talk to him despite his frequent loses. I liked the movie. It's not all of it, and it all ended, but it was a nice way to cover the evening of sitting on the couch watching movies. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
