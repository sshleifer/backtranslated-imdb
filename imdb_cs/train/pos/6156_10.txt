This movie has always been my favorite Disney movie. Then, on 21/21/01, I saw the 30th anniversary of this DVD movie. WOW I remembered why I loved this movie. The DVD is so great, it has 30 extra extras that the original did not have. I did not know when I first started looking. The film has since become even more. The music they cut should stay in it. You did not see this movie until you saw Full 131 min. Many people say music is forgotten. I remember every song in this movie, every song has its own Charm it's all alone and it connects like a hole. I remember when I was younger, I had the song "Eglantine", which I held in my head for several days. Like the "Briny Sea" (the song was intended for marriage poppens but was cut off from the movie) Please check out the new uncut 30th anniversary movie and vote again for this movie. 10 that it really is.
