It is always satisfactory when the detective packs the case and the criminal is brought into the book. In this case, the top makes me even more pleasure. To see how the smiled smile shuddered Abigail Mitchell's face as she realized that her victim had left a "Trial of a Dead Bed" that did not doubt her guilt was very satisfactory. Please understand: while I admire Ruth Gordon's performance, her character really * really * irks me. She is selfish and demanding. She gets her own way by dressing in a nasty "girl" act that is embarrassing to a woman of her age. Even worse is that she now stood as a judge, jury, and executioner against the wife of her dead niece. When Columbo gets too close, he tries to get rid of him by manipulating him by doing an off-the-cuff speech to an audience of high-quality ladies. He is perfectly taboo by giving a very warm and humane account of the realities of police work. Nothing can derail Columbo from the pursuit of justice. Abby's final appeal to his good character is rejected because he has too much confidence to not do his job well. Here is one situation from which you can not get rid of Mrs. Mitchell!
