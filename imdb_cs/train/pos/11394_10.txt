While the story is sweet and the dance and singing in the main part of the film is joyful, the uniqueness of the film (and what makes it a masterpiece) is a dream. Based on the combination of the highest form of truly American music (Gershwin), the fascinating beauty of French Impressionist art, the fascinating choreography of Kelly (including his noble "pas de deux d'amour", a genuinely independent genre) with the most beautiful palette of color ever created for this set. The adaptation of growing music and the visual explosion with these dances was a true piece of creative genius and great artist.
