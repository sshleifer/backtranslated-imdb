Actually, one particular person / character is not "right there," but my summary line refers to the strength of the film. And that's all done without the imagination of camera movements and / or large production kits, but with a big story and very (credible) and good actors to pass the story (arc). an accompanying piece to great Japanese movies / cinemas (such as Tokyo Story, etc.), of course not a story but more moods! Great acting, the nuances in the show that are really gems. If you have the desire to experience a touching story and want to see a movie that touches you emotionally, it's the one to go. As you have noticed (as with many of my reviews), I do not go into the story. There are places in IMDb where you can look at it, I'm not one on the story spoilers at all!
