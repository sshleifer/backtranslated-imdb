I can not believe they took it out of the air. Especially when only a few episodes left. My daughter, sister and some of my friends like to watch this show. We were so excited to stop showing it because of so-called Ratings. It's not fair people watching this show from the beginning. We had the right to see the end. I wish that all of us vote with a three-year voting system. They could send emails, and we, as spectators, could vote on all the programs we're watching or heard about. This could also help in promoting a new show. People would see it and wonder what it is. Not only can you see what audiences are watching, you can also use it as a free ad for TV and cable channels. We want to see more episodes. Bring it back!
