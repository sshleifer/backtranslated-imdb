I've been watching this movie twice, and I thought it was quite good for the limited equipment that was used to create this movie. (filmed in 1947) Heyerdahl explains his theory about the migration of South American pre-Columbian Indians to Polynesia through the fall of large balsa trees. This document follows Dr. Heyerdahl, and the crew when they pick up balsa in Equidor and swim with them down to the Pacific for a rally in Peru. They begin with a 101-day marine adventure that tested the power of their primitive raft, surviving only the means available to the natives of that time. Look for yourself, a real adventure!
