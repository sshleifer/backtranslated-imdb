This movie was amazing. It's an inspiring cinema. The characters are fully developed through the truth brought by director Lucy Walker. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for the special film that shows humanity in the human condition. Lucy Wlaker presents landscape beauty. This film is a real example of a human being. nature and sometimes human vs. human. Internal confusion and triumph are immense in their subject. The subject of Tibtans seeing blindness as a sign of demons is interesting. This film casts light on a culture that has never been presented. Lucy Walker gave Erik Weihenmayer a voice that would not normally have been heard. I thank Lucy for being perceived as the filmmaker.
