A new way to enjoy the work of Goldsworthy, Rivers and Tides allows fans to see his work on the move. Watching Goldsworthy build his pieces, one develops an award for every stone, leaf and thorn he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, rivers and tides inspires and influences his work. Although I was happy that the film covered most Goldsworthy pieces (no snowballs), I felt it was a bit long. The filmmakers have done a great job of bringing Goldsworthy's life and creating a beautiful movie that has been delighted to watch.
