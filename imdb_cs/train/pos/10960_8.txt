I really can not remember who recommended it, but they said it was one of their favorite movies. It's certainly strange - such as not damaging rubber in a traffic accident. Someone said the truth is alien to fiction, and the truth is to see something here. I really can not understand how this fictitious account of this document should be issued this year. How can you improve? Aunt and cousin Jackie Kennedy have fallen out of the New York society and hidden in Hampton. In the process, recluses become and what is best described as "crazy ladies of cats". They would remain hidden if the city did not move to condemn the property for the dirt and the rescue of Jackie. This movie was made after the rescue. All the while you could not help but think, "how bad was it before?" It's a view of a high society from the darker side and it's totally fascinating.
