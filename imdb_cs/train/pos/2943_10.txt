I think this is still the best routine. There are others like Rock's "bring pain" and Allen's "men are pigs" who are cheerful; "The Last Stand of Damon Waynes" is also sad - but this routine does not make any mistakes. All the jokes are fun and the time limit of 70 minutes is perfect. It only takes so long to last 20 years. I just love how it allows viewers to be completely alone and unlimited. I'm a fan of a classic and a guy who looked at a lot of Jim Carrey who grew up and watched the comics look better. You are not included in the category with Ellen and Newhart, but something you can watch if you are inflated. Thanks to Eddie, God bless.
