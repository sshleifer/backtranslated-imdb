Tony Arzent, a Sicilian hit man or professional killer, decides to leave the business and his former employers disagree. As for content, this very fun action movie does not have one; As far as entertainment is concerned, it's fun, it's very melodramatic, violent, quite brutal, automobile pursuits are remarkable. "Arzenta" is an undemanding, yet very nice film, much better than the current Hollywood waste that gets the same label. He comes from Delon's rather short flirtation with Italian film B in the 1970s. Carefully uses Delona's tough guy who belongs to the gallery of bad criminals he did in his youth. <br /> <br /> I was very pleased that Delon made this film that he had a role in a good Eurocrime movie. <br /> <br /> The score is very good with a good introductory song that the Italians considered the film to be a synthetic work where an important role in musical art plays. In Tony Arzent / Big Guns / No Way Out is very fond of Erika Blanc (31 years in 1973) appears as an unnamed swing. Meanwhile, girlfriend Arzent, Sandra, plays Carl Gravin (starlet who practically left the movies after 1975). "Arzenta" is an interestingly filmed ambitious visual concept, some Expressionist strange angles. The film was directed by the prolific Duccio Tessari, who also created Zorro (comedy Delon). Or, to mention that these two films, Tony Arzent (1973) and Zorro, are very dissimilar. The first is the bloody melodramatic violence action movie - the second is a cheerful comedy, more related to spoof, though remarkably coherent and skillfully made. Duccio Tessari directed movies like Kiss Kiss ... Bang Bang (1966), Satan's sons, Bloodstained Butterfly, Viva La Muerte ... Tua! , Tough Guys (1974), Safari Express (1976)
