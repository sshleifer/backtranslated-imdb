Well, it's Ivan Reitman's film. with a rare exception, Ivan likes to enjoy. His films are generally not "deep," but they are often fun enough. My Super Ex-Girlfriend surprised me by laughing more than I thought. Uma Thurman is just so great and I love her ideas. I also like Luke Wilson and Rainn Wilson was direct. Never take seriously, the film is over the top and yet not too unique, nor is it where nobody went before .... it's a nice rental though and probably the OK date of the movie, especially if you have headaches and do not want to strain your brain. It's an escape fun and there's nothing wrong. When you get rid of "super-girls", you have a story about relationships and relationships are bad. He is a boy meets a girl, a boy leaves a girl. And finally the characters are looking for love. Not every one of them is "thrown out" just as they could ... a shortened life.
