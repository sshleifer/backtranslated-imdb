I'm sick of people screaming at Ewoka! True, they are not the best what ever happened to the Star Wars, but it happened, so deal with it! Besides, they are really cute and I do not care if they are tradable. Yubb Nubb! <br /> <br /> This movie always leaves tears. It's perfect. The end could not be better. I'm excited about The Phantom Menace because it suddenly directs the whole story from Luke to Anakin. I like how it is revealed at the end - it would not be too much resolved. So those of you who complain that Vader's helmet is removed, think about it for a moment. It is very effective. Vader, the man who hid behind the mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick man. He is not a complete machine - he is vulnerable. I do not know how the actor should choose such good actors in New Hope. Everybody is so good. They are credible characters. Hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development. Fisher does a great job as a female model (I mean it is! Jabba killed, though so many others failed!). Harrison Ford - Do I Need To Tell More? <br /> <br /> Music is great again. It's very touching and significant when you can choose the motifs in different parts of the movie. The best peak is when Luke yells "NOOO!" and jumps to fight his father in the Final Battle. John Williams is not genius! What a wonderful person! The movie is much more important to me for episode I. I can not wait to see it at theaters (CAN WAIT ???) and then look at the original trilogy again. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
