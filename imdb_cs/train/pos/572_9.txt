In response to the person who made a comment on how the film stretches out and who believes it does not make sense for the role of Jess's brother, there is my answer: The job of Jess's brother is to provide a form of dramatic irony in the story. Craig Sheffer / Norman could anticipate the problems associated with living life when he looked at how Jess's brother showed up. There are various cases where Brad Pitt and his lives run in parallel, for example, when Jess's brother takes Craig Sheffer to the unconnected bar and later finds Brad Pitt a few days later. The dramatic irony was that Craig Sheffer's character would have more mourning sadness at the death of his brothers, knowing he could do more to prevent it, and then make the film more moody.
