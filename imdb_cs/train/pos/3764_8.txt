Okay, I admit it - I'm goofball and sometimes I love a really stupid comedy. While I saw more films from Kurosawa, Bergman and Truffaut than virtually anyone on this planet, I still have a weak spot for a comedy bagpipe who does not try to be sophisticated but just fun. Several such films that I immediately see are MONTY PYTHON AND HOLY GRAIL, UHF, START REVOLUTION WITHOUT ME, STRANGE BREW and the films Bill and Ted. Everyone has no dream appeal, but only zombies or professional film critics would not like it. While BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is not as wonderful as the original Bill and Ted movie, it's still great fun. Also, unlike the original one, it seems to actually improve with repeated viewing. I remember not loving the movie for the first time I've seen it - maybe because the second movie set such a high standard of laughter. But every time I see it again, I am amazed at all the great moments - especially those about Grim Reaper. And by the way, this chisel is about as different from Bergman in THE SEVENTH SEAL as you can get! Besides being laughing a lot, this film is equipped with some excellent music - one of the ways it is really better than the first movie. The Kiss anthem at the end is great, but the other of the hard rock melodies - unless you're an old killer like De Nomolos. Great viewing for both children and adults.
