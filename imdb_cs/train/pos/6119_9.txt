OK, but just stupid. It's not about horror / comedy. I read how people switched with the Michael version, and that's a good trick in my opinion, because some adults hate horror and see that it's going to be interested in horror movies like this or maybe (he never saw it) horrified maybe a comedy), Uncle Sam, I'll have to see the rent or purchase of this movie, but the other is much better than this, but I bought this one on VHS Amazon and got it on November 21, the day before Thanksgiving. for four dollars, l.o.l. on this movie. <br /> <br /> 9/10
