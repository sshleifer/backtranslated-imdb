This document really opened his eyes to what people outside the United States were thinking about the 11 September attacks. This film was professionally compiled and represents this disaster as more than an attack on American soil. The consequences of this disaster are reflected in many different countries and perspectives. I believe that this film should be more widespread for this point. He also helps in the healing process to finally see something other than terrorist attacks. And some of them are really funny but not abusive. This movie highly recommended me and gave the same feeling.
