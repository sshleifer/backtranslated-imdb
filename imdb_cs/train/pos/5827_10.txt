This three stooges flick is in connection with my other favorite movie "Disorder in Court". This is a laughing laugh for every Three Stooges fan you can enjoy. The boys are employees in the recording studio when you hear how beautiful Christine McIntyre sings the great version of "Vocals of Spring". She will be offered a record deal, but she is scarred to be honest with her father about her career choices and prove she's a real singer. When she and the others leave the studio, the judges decide to have some fun and play her record and Curly dress like Christine. The contracted lady, who has Christine's career, sees Curly and misses Christine and calls on Curly to sing for her party. Of course, there's a man who's upset about being at a party, and they're destroying his solo in front of the crowd, so he finds a way to go back to them. stoge flick, it should not be missed! <br /> <br />
