I absolutely love this movie and I really would like to have it sometimes. It's just a fascinating legend about eagles who wear a turquoise necklace, I loved them and I'd like to see it again! I do not remember too much, but a Native American boy lives in a nice village with his family and I do not remember what happens but he has to go to the desert itself. His sister packs some food and he goes. While outside, some other Indian boys get exhausted, put some feathers on him and he turns into an eagle. The legend says that if you ever saw an eagle with a turquoise necklace, it's a boy. I have always been fascinated by legends, especially native American legends, and I would like to see that the DVD has ever gone, please PLEASE who is concerned!
