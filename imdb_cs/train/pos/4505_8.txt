Eskimo is a serious film about the cultural divide between the indigenous population and the interfering white man. Although documented in documentary style seemingly unprofessional, Eskimo is an experienced production that includes a plausible story that the audience wants to see until the last shot. Native Eskimo has simply different beliefs and behaviors about women and life than whalers who dampen his country. When an Eskimo man loses a friend, it is natural that the other men share their wives with their boyfriend. It is also customary for their wives to take the place of a missing husband. All this appears to be natural in the context of the desolate prejudices of the Arctic environment. Confident Eskimo is the prey for unscrupulous white whalers (with heavy European accents) who do not understand these natives as equal. Fraud, drunken orgies, rape, and death occur after eskym men leave for work on the cold cold seas. Eventually the leader of Eskimo (Mala) realizes that he has been deceived and he will take revenge on him. The audience would enjoy the theaters of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Enter the Royal Canadian Deployed Police and the moral dilemma of whether you will invite Mala to court. Mounts are played like feelings of police officers who know it's not a cut and a dry case. Will Mounty get his man? Is it fair to hold Mal to code of conduct outside of his traditional society? Is there any way to punish Mala? Is it inevitable for White Man to prevail? Is there no hope for innocence? This is not a great movie, but one that you will like at the depth of the problem, which is solved in a very different environment. I suspect that the filming of the sequences with the animals was done before today's disclaimer that none of them were injured in film making - so beware of raw natural sequences. Highly recommended.
