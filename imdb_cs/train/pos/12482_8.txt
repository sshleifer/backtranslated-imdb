I read nothing but good things about this movie and eventually I had the opportunity to watch it late last night and it was all I expected it would be and more. That's the way the right horror movie should be. I think that was a scary reason because it was so realistic. The scary sound score was perfect for setting a dark mood. I liked the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed the rest of the movie. It was very easy to watch and understand, unlike some movies that are too complex. very good.I would like to see more horror films like this one.This is easily one of my favorites's.A realistic thunder and thunder would set a nice atmosphere for this film.Other then that had all the elements of a good horror movie needss. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good scary movie that pulls no punches.I will add to my collection.The DVD has some interesting special features.
