Wow baby, this is really some fine Asian horror / gore and a crazy indefinite film. It is a Japanese splatterfest that reminded me a little of Tetsuo, except for this case with all the blood and guts, there is a bizarre love story. It is hard to imagine how they even dreamed of this visually stunning film with some unique extraterrestrial creatures that infect humans like parasites, transform them into a submachine or think cyborg. The only thing that struggles with these creatures after taking over is that they have to kill each other and eat the other. hmmm, yum yum. This would probably be called industrial shrubs or something like that, with an excellent soundtrack that adds to the fun. The film also lends a bit of Carpenter "The Thing" in creative design and effects. I put it in the category necessary for gorehounds because there is a continuous massacre and some very gore gore. And the necessity for your friends because you do not even have to read the subtitles, the visuals themselves are enough for the mind's journey. The design of the small creators who inhabit the human body as a fetus reminded me a little of Frank Henenlotter's films, which is another tribute to some excellent gore films with a sense of humor. "Meatball Machine" is great fun for gorehounds, there is no doubt about it and I just loved it.
