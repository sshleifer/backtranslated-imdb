"Written on the Wind" is an irresistible, beautiful kinky movie, as only director Sirk did. The film is immersed in a bucket full of Freudian symbols, strange melodramatics and color contrasts. The link between financial success and moral decay is the main theme of the film. Sirk seems to suggest that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism. But I prefer the film to be an example of what Sirk could do with kitsch material. The color palette is particularly impressive. The movie in the movie is also great. Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall are horribly glamorous and give this film aura elegance, but the film belongs to Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (who earned the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress) who can keep the movie boiling. Kudos to the pulsing score by Frank Skinner, the great cinematic work of Russell Metty (each shot is a masterpiece in its own right) and the design department. The title track is also beautiful. It's an unforgettable movie.
