Nurses in law create the same directors of a rather curious fascinating "divorce, Iranian style," which was exactly as it was when we saw the divorce court in Iran. They have now turned to the judicial system in Cameroon, Africa. What is great about this court is that two judges are women, which is so unusual for such a country. In any case, they deal with a lot of men who dressed around women, but this film is remarkable in the fact that women seem to have made great success in society, with divorce and women's rights recognized. So judges often try to make men behave primitively at these times. Do not say that women who appear in court receive lesser treatment. One of the most important focuses of the film is the case of child abuse by an aunt. Judges do not waste the time to get angry at the woman. And who said that justice is no longer delivered? With these 2 behind the bench. They often make maximum punishments! Ya! Go ahead, girl!
