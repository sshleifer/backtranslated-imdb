ITALIAN is an amazing film for his time. Amazingly filmed, with dazzling effects that are really noble, it's an early gem that clearly reveals that REGINALD BARKER is the pioneer of D.W. GRIFFITH and MAURICE TOURNEUR. How much control Thomas Ince has spent on production is hard to know, but this film still has extraordinary strength. The simple story of an Italian immigrant trying to keep his family in New York is very moving. Topics of social injustice, revenge, and forgiveness are now completely relevant. The use of details is excellent and the power of GEORGE BEBAN is electrifying. What we now need is really a good print to DVD, so we can truly appreciate this early cinema work.
