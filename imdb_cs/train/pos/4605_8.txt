This is not just one of Jackie Chan's biggest films, but also one of the biggest kung-fu films of all time. We have come to expect crazy pieces and fast, creative acting in Han's films, and that sets the scale that others will follow. It's two hours of pure entertainment that works great. <br /> <br /> In addition to great action, we have a viable story and credible characters, while Chan takes everything that looks like a Western approach to writing, blending Eastern methods of solution (ie kicking the ass). Overall, it's fun, serious, fun and pioneering. It has to be for every fan of kung-fu, while at the same time it remains accessible to wider circles of the film community.
