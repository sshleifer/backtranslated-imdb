This movie is just brilliant. Cinematography is good, playing great and the story absolutely breathtaking. This is the story of Donald Woods, a South African white man who thought he was a liberal until he found the reality of apartheid. Kevin Kline is absolutely convincing - so much so that when Donald Woods appeared on television a few years later, I recognized him from Kline's portraiture. Denzel Washington is also going to change in a masterful performance, as always. <br /> <br /> I urge you to look at it. It's long, but it's worth patience because it tells an incredible story. Remember, people, it really did.
