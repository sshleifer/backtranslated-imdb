Planning episodes were somewhat boring, but when they arrived in the desert, it was very fun to watch. The reason I say this as the most realistic real estate show is that, to my surprise, Charley has dropped out of race pretty soon. When my hands were sore, I expected the usual stress and then the repair of the miracle, but instead actually left the race. The most disturbing moment of the show had to be when Max was stuck in the desert with almost no water or food! The end was great and I was very glad that at least one of the teams did. Overall, it's not as big as a long wheel, but certainly an interesting patrol when you get a look at the world's toughest races.
