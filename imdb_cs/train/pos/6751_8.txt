Pretty good movie from Preminger; labyrinth while exploring sets and locations from different angles and perspectives as if it were a film of nature on the inhabitants of a modern city and how they live. In this sense, it is visually and spatially satisfying because its hero, a good cop with a bad mood, gets into very hot water when he accidentally kills a man with a plate in his head. Dana Andrews plays leadership as if it were Hamlet and has never been better. The story may be a pure melodrama, but Andrews gives it weight and almost raises it to the level of tragedy. Like his girlfriend, Gene Tierney is attractive, but not insignificant. Gary Merrill makes a very interesting villain, whose natural warmth provides a nice contrast to Andrews's cool; his smiling, friendly, seemingly dirty man seems to be constantly inviting his enemy only by being emotionally open, unlike the heavily injured and moralistic police pursuing him. <br /> <br /> There are no big surprises in this movie, which seems to be transient for all concerned. For Preminger, this is a meeting with his stars Laura, Andrews and Tierney, who graduated their career around the time the film was shot. Support for the cast - Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand - are, of course, more optimistic because they were all on their way up. Preminger, as a quiet observer as always, let the events unfold without expressing a strong view, because the morally ambiguous end is somewhat disappointing because the game for the cat and the mouse between the two antagonists seems larger and archetypal than any other film to contain, much less to solve . <br /> <br />
