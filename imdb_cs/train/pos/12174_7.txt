I think the deal with this movie is that it has about 2 minutes really, really entertaining moments and makes a very good trailer and lots of people came with the expectation from the trailer and this time the film does not fill the trailer. It's a bit slower and slowly stretches for such an exciting assumption and I think I see from the comments that people have a relationship of love and hatred with this movie. However, if you look into this movie for what it is, and not what you might think of a talent cast, I think it's still pretty good. Julia Stiles is obviously a star, she's so scary and carefree that she fits in with everyone else's, just shining and the whole audience falls in love with Lee. The rest of the cast, of course, Lee's testosterone-filled coworkers, his elegant mother-in-law, his brother-in-law Jim and his bride to be all, do a great job that fits into the stereotypes of consensus and boredom that make Stiles the first. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> style = "font-weight: bold;" Perhaps it is a source of disappointment. The film itself, despite a little slumber and a few jokes that do not look funny, as the writer intends, is still quite funny and I found a rather intelligent movie. Match themes and "safe way" seemed to be cleverly aligned on several layers. For example, there was the whole motif of imagining scenarios, but he would never deal with them until the last scene, or how he listened to a radio program on the highway and talked about how everyone responds, or how everything selma blair and julia stiles "characters he said and did it reflecting that the subjects of one person were safe choices and one was a risky choice. Another good thing about the film was that it was a kind of screwball comedy in which Jason Lee must continue his film and who, thanks to stupid luck (for example: the chemist's guy turns out to be a good chef) and some cleverness comes from his side with him for the most part. <br /> <br /> While it was not as fun as I expected and there was a little waste of talent, but overall it's still a good movie .
