I do not know why I chose this movie to watch, it's a weird title, and it looked like something else. Every moment, it is good to try a movie that is a bit different from the mainstream of the Hollywood hero / thriller, and this film is certainly different. Right from the beginning, this movie was taken, but I could not understand why the movie ended when I realized the movie was great because the characters were so real. I thought acting is excellent and character development really cares about them and I hope that things will eventually prove good. I think anyone looking at a movie could somehow connect with one of the characters, and that makes great prospects and some good laughs with the utter regularity of the actors. <br /> <br /> When you have a movie, you get a sense of well-being and you stay with the type of feeling "things will be fine". I'm sure it will be very interested and should be able to.
