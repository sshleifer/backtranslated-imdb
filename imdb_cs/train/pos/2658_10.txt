Kubrick re-introduces his stunning ability to create a perfect atmosphere for the film. Mainly through cinematography, but also with the genius score, it produces a cool and sinister tone that is hidden all over the film, and from the beginning my spine slows down. It's really this flawless atmosphere that makes The Shining a masterpiece that's in my eyes. Of course it will not hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. A terribly authentic view of the mind crazy. Duvall and Lloyd are artists to be nice, but it's easy to watch around the two when the rest of the movie is so brilliant. In addition, it includes actors with the greatest name of all time (Scatman Crothers).
