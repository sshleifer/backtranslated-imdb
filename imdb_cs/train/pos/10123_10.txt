Shinjuku Triad Society: Chinese Mafia Wars is unlikely to be distributed west of the film festivals. Why? Could your censors film a movie where police officers raped men and women rape to talk (and sacrifice to them) or to see that the old lady's eyes were pulled from the skull? These are few of the shocks that are the visitors of the viewers of this ultraviolet story of police and gangsters. This makes Clockwork Orange, which has long been forbidden in the United Kingdom, to look like a Disney cartoon. If you see this movie? YES This is fantastic and essential viewing for Asian cinema fans. Shocking moments are here to show what is in the world of these characters. If you like it, make sure to catch Dead or Alive, which is very similar (of course, that prevents crazy ends in DOA). Great for Japan, they have a talent like Miike working at the same time as Takeshi Kitano. The best opportunity to see this film outside Takashi Miike's retrospective at the Film Festival is on DVD. If I do not, try looking at the Hong Kong version because I'm sure it will be in this country.
