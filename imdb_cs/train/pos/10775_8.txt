A nice movie with a great soundtrack that spreads through the rock landscapes of the 70s and 80s. Radiofreccia describes the generation, describes life in a small village near Correggio (the hometown of Ligabue, a singer who wrote a book that inspired the film), describes the lives of young people and their world-related problems. It reminds Trainspotting, with a touch of Italian touch.
