Yesterday I saw "El Mar" and I thought it was a great movie. It begins with a childhood episode in the lives of three main characters: Ramallo, Manuel Tur and Francisca. Then we go for about 10 years to the hospital, where 3 friends meet again. Religion, illness, love, violence and sexual fury throughout the film and intense and exciting film. > <br /> I see people who complain that the movie is too horrible and I think they lacked the story. It's a violent, intense and sad story. It is expected that people will suffer. Poster. Get hurt. Bleed. And I think that what the film shows is not made for pure shock value or presented unpleasantly. I know some people like their movies "clean", even those who have violence in them. But sometimes the film needs you to feel uncomfortable working. That's one of those movies. And it's a great movie. The only mistake I found was that there were 3 or 4 moments when some details of the conspiracy were clear, and only after thinking of them at the end of the movie all made sense. But for the whole story it was nothing of great significance, so I still give this film 9.
