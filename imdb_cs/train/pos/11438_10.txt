Ralph and Mumford, unsuccessful in their own country, are disappointed that they are ignorant Infantrymen Synanomess Botche. Twice a time is a story about them, the attitudes they encounter, and their quest for proper set-up. With a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and gorgeous voice that performs some of the best in business, this extraordinary movie will hit the mark. The animation process, although similar to the "South Park" cutout, is much smoother and much more three-dimensional. If I did not know that animation is this style, I swear it's a traditional pen and ink. If you can watch this movie in Dolby Surround or THX format, PLEASE! You will not really miss anything if not, but if you do, you will get much more from experience!
