Of all the reviews I've read, most people at Alexandre were extremely difficult. Neither Marie nor Veronica ever seemed to be very desperate to keep Alexandre because she was only slightly intelligent, though not intellectual at all, because most of us are, no matter how difficult it is for someone to admit. Alexandre is getting rid of his life, being completely cared for, getting and giving what he wants. girls allow it, Veronica loves sex, Mary is his patron. is there something in it? is anyone in love? really? I do not think so. Although the New Wave cinema in France is prone to preload, and so on, it's amazing simply because there's no need for a conspiracy to create emotions. Simplicity is absolutely nice and everyone in Alexander's position in the city can ask. Looking for a patron, someone interested?
