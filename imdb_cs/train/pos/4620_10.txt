This movie Rocks "Just sexy as always and Polly wow we really do that young this movie can still touch the hearts of many teenagers need to put them on DVD soon or become a classic." This movie I always had to crush on Just now I'm too old, but this movie is made for all the genes> you know I came from the early 80s with the area I was I had to watch all the els live the life I wanted but through the movies I can do it over and over I think in I hope shortly and I wish this movie was not lost in time but reborn for the youth to enjoy the warm heartbeat you learn about hormones and dating problems and how to get away with things that seem so great at the time, but it does not mean so now, so this movie is a dating tool.
