All Dog's Go to Heaven is an animated children's movie, like no other. Playing, drinking, death, weapons and hell are a plot, and although the children will have very few, adults will scratch their heads for why this film was shot as a gangster film. The real film is by no means clear, it's just a special combination in which a child's film is made. <br /> <br /> Charlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) is a player dog who owns half the casino with his partner Carface (Vic Tayback). After drunkenness (dog ... drunk ... in a kid's movie, it sounds strange.), Charlie is cheated and Carfax murdered. When in heaven, he finds a way to return to Earth, but he will no longer be allowed in heaven. He is still returning to Earth and meets his old friend, Itchym (Dom Deluise), and plans to return to Carfax. Meanwhile, Carfax has a small orphaned girl named Anne Marie held in captivity because of her amazing ability to talk to all kinds of animals, which helps to predict races. Charlie and Itchy free her and try to help her find a family while learning a lot about herself. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the few Disney that will appeal to both children and adults. Children will enjoy fun characters and live animation, while adults will have a nice, sweet plot and more than normal characters. One thing that keeps it is that it's a musical instrument. Usually it's a good thing, but the music is frankly horrible. They tend to jump, almost sounding ad libbed, without any secondary tooling. In fact, these are probably the worst songs I've ever heard in an animated movie, but fortunately the rest of the movie is strong enough not to fall apart due to some bad comments. it works from this movie, but I really hate it. It's sad, but happy, but sadder than happy, and makes the film feel as if it needs a sequel. Considering how bad this continuation was, I wish the end was not a reason to go on and that would end in a nice, super happy ending. This is one of the few movies I feel like, but I'm doing it. Overall, it's a nice family movie with special motifs that suit, but it's still a good thing. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** from ****. 85 minutes. G.
