Gunga Din (1939) is based on a poem by Rudyard Kipling. The film is directed by George Stevens. It is located in India during the 19th century, when three British soldiers have to stop the evil guru and his murderous cult. Gunga Din is an amazing Adventure War comedy with plenty of exciting moments. The three main men are brilliant. Cary Grant's Sgt.Archibald Cutter, Victor McLaglen's Sgt.'Mac 'MacChesney and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (the legendary son you know who) is Sgt.Thomas Ballantine. Let's not forget other great players, including Sam Jaffe playing Gung Din in a brilliant way. Beautiful and gifted Joan Fontaine is Emaline Stebbins. It's really fun to watch Tommy and Emmy's wedding plans. Gunga Din is terribly fun.It can be funny, it can be exciting. This can be all that a good film requires.
