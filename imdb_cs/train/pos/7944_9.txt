Have you ever had or have a pet that was thick and thin with you that would have been lost without and who you love no matter what? Betcha never thought you were feeling the same! <br /> <br /> Wonderful family movie. If you have a soft place for animals, it is guaranteed that you will cry regardless of your age. I have been watching this movie all the time when I was a little boy, and I found out that now, at the age of sixteen, I love it just as I do. I could never decide for a favorite character and I still do not think I can! I love all three animals. Dialogue seems very real and comfortable as a loving family. I love Chance and how he finally says he finally has a family. Cheese, yes, but we have to remember that it is to be a family film and perfectly fulfills this role. Sassy has just the perfect dose of "sassiness" and Shadow is the perfect lead / role model for young, adventurous chances. Animals the way people get together, but of course most lazy moments are to be during interactions with them (ie, rescuing Molly and the end). Not to mention an incredible soundtrack that gives even more emotion and an accompanying feeling of heartbeat every moment. I give it 9/10. They were compared with (and even rated better than) cats and dogs and babe.
