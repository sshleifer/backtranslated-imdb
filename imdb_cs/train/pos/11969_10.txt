I loved that actress grew up and I'm still staring at the first DVD season at the age of 19. What can I say? I grew up in a house like the one on the Full House. I had my father, two sisters, and a dog. I think the only difference was that I was not with my uncle and my dad's best friend. I also grew up with my mom in the house. I do not know what I would do without a Full House television broadcast. I think Stephanie (played by Jodie Sweetin), D.J. (played by Sister Candace from Kirk Cameron) and Michelle (Playing Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) are my favorite characters. I can join them because I'm Steph's middle child, I'm a younger sister like Michelle and I'm an older sister like D.J. I like how the show always has moral value, because today I really do not like any of the O.C. I like Comedy Full House. Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), Joey (Dave Coulier) and Danny (Bob Saget) are gay as a uncle's girlfriend, a friend's father and father. The story is that after the girl's mother, Danny's best friend Joey and his brother-in-law, dies, Jesse moves to help raise children. Three men trying to raise three young girls = cheerful. Every character on the Full House is full of hearts, fun and truly believable. Joey is an ambitious comic with a child's heart and soul. Jesse is a cold, motorcycle rider, a tough uncle who is softened by his three nieces and later by his wife Becky (Laurie Laughlin of Summerville). Children and adults will love this show. Guaranteed.
