But sadly for the rights that will almost certainly never happen. The transcripts of Joe Bob's comments on the sub-B films he screened are available on the internet, but they do not completely capture his minor weakness, which was a true story. Currently, Joe Bob (the real name: John Bloom) is limited to making complementary elements such as "I Spit On Your Grave" (featuring what some fanciers call the biggest gang of rape on a film of all time); Jason X, one of the most saddest Friday's 13th sequel of all time (the series was never the same as she left Paramount). The only thing I could think of when they canceled it was, "Damn, where else would I have a blink of meat, blond jokes and horrific trivials every Saturday night? Does that mean I have to get my life now?" It is sad. But in my horror hungry heart there will always be a place for "Monstervision". Hold Drive-In!
