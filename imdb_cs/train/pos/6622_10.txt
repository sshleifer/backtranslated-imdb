I just went through a film screening during the Expresion en Corto, a short film in Guanajuato, Mexico. One of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction. The film was filming and I was amazed at the first shot: one long continuous flick of futuristic Paris in the famous black and white. I should not go on with the details because I think it's a movie to see. The science fiction story may be average for many people ... it was really good for me. The event is great, the camera is able to fly everywhere and I think everywhere. Things you could not do or see are beautifully fulfilled. The performance of the cast is good, in my opinion no one supports the bad note. Now, the thing I thought was great is animation. 3D graphics look like 2D. Communist book BW brought to life. Background details provide more texture as if it were done manually (I'm sure it was, but when you change the angles, you will see the depth). <br /> <br /> The producer at the premiere talked about the hard work behind the film: 7 years! The director, she said, was great, but maybe he was very inexperienced because he had only one short film in his life. So many people have a true faith in them. They started their own studio from the beginning and since they faced the challenge they brought. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it. I think you will not regret ... maybe Richard Linklater, because the final view of this movie is better than I think.
