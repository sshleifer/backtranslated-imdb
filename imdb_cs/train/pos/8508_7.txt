Richard Dix has decided to retire and Michael Duane has taken on his role as Ted Nichols, who meets a young French girl named Alice Dupres Barkley (Lenore Aubert). These couple knew only two days and decided to take the peace judge (judge), and when they went to the judge's house, they found out he was not home and did not return the next day. As the couple is inside the house, you can see that someone is picking up the bonnet of your car and taking the car part of the engine. Once you see this event, you realize that this pair is a great surprise, and the story of the beast reveals a very mysterious event that surrounds Alice Barkley and so the poor Ted Nichols begins with a lot of trouble and without marriage. Good mystery, but I missed Richard Dix. Enjoy.
