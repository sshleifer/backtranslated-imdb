This movie started with Nick Cage. It's a story full of twists and turns - a movie of motives and motions. Of course, Dennis Hopper was a ham, but J.T. Walsh and Laura Flyyn Boyle are the perfect pair to capture the unsuspecting man who has fallen into his site. Everything about this movie is good - cinematography, the story of the tempo and especially the end. Cage excels in what he does best - he is not an action hero but a human being captured in life.
