Since the musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to create without the talent that is needed to make a study agreement, I doubt we will ever have a story about the real life of Enrico Caruso. <br /> <br /> But if it were all right, it was no coincidence that no Hollywood studio attempt failed to do so until Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had commissioned Mario Lanza. No one else would do it, I doubt it will ever be tested again. And why should it be? I think Enrico Caruso himself would be happy with his singing being shown on the screen. His tenor voice was his life, his reason for being on the ground. <br /> <br /> To say that the freedoms have been taken with his life, you have to be modest. Caruso, like the man who portrayed him, was a man of great taste, though with much more self-control. He has had a number of relationships with several women and has begun two sons who are not in this film. <br /> <br /> His contribution to the recording industry is considered almost an idea. He showed up in the recording studio one late in life. In fact, he began recording at the turn of last century, and along with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA Victor, the record industry made what happened. When Caruso and McCormack were at their heights, you had to virtually inherit a ticket to see that one of them would perform live. However, many Italian and Irish immigrants had a phonograph and three or three of these men. That's why they both became legends that they are. <br /> <br /> The film has some beautifully presented opera arias performed by Mario Lanza, a taste of what he could have been when he had the Caruso discipline to hold operas. Grand Caruso won an Oscar for sound recording and won nominations for costumes and stage design. <br /> <br /> Mario himself helped popularize the movie with RCA Red Seal albums from The Great Caruso. Unfortunately, due to contractual obligations, we could not get real album casting with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten and Jarmila Novotna as well. Although Blyth sang in the movie, Lanza had a big hit record The Most Beautiful Night of the Year helped to popularize The Great Caruso. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for the life of Enrico Caruso, it is not. If you are looking for a great singer at the top of your career, you should not miss The Great Caruso.
