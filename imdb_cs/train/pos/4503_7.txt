This zip and fun short since 1916 - a time when Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle were a great comedy - portrays young Oliver Hardy as a neer-do-well who must quickly impress his rich uncle by creating a wife and baby for his visit . <br /> <br /> Of course it's not smooth and it's sooner more women and children than to deal with it; plus the mandatory chase and misunderstanding which are a characteristic feature of early film noise. <br /> <br /> Renewed well, it can be considered part of Oliver Hardy's Early Films, and is now available on DVD, to the available corpus of the popular comedy duo on the big screen.
