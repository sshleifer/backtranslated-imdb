The first hour of the movie was mostly boring. However, it improved after the Valentine's Day began. In addition to hiding the identity of the killer at the very end, the scene of murderous wars was one of the few relatively unforgettable aspects of this film. The scene in the garden with Kate was well shot and so was the last scene ("twist"). There was some real tension and excitement in those scenes, and the scene with the murderous hot spa was uncomfortable at the edge (as slasher should be). Earlier murders are frustrating without a gore.
