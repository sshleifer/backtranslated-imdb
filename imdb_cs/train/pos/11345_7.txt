That's why I still have nightmares. This frightening film (musical) was considered child-friendly in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> The boy goes on a magical journey to the island. Mayor of the island, Pufnstuf, allegedly a dragon, looks more like a myth with conjunctivitis, and the magic flute is aimed at the witch (Billie Halliday, who was considered "a little alright" at the time). <br /> <br /> The flute appears on an "interesting" convention of witches, with witches who have gay old time. The boy dresses in a turn, then as a "fairy" to restore the flute. <br /> <br /> Not suitable for children.
