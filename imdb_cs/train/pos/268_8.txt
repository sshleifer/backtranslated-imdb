I loved Dedee Pfeiffer (is it true spelling?) In Cybil. I have not seen her yet, and I forgot how much I missed. I thought he was doing a great job in this job. The support cast was also pretty good. In some ways the daughter looked like young Nicole Kidman. The kidnapper was pretty scary, and the story generally had some good twists. A young boyfriend was hottie. I thought my husband had something to do with it. <br /> <br /> I just got Lifetime Movie Network for Christmas and I love these movies. I kept my interest, and I look at it again when they repeat it. Can anyone recommend similar films? You can post posts on the blackboard or send me a private email if you want. Thanks in advance.
