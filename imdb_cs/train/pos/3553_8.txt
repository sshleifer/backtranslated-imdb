Boys and dolls are itching for remake. It was made forty-eight years ago. Its two major stars are either dead or 409 pounds. Although the remake, with big stars now, would be a box-office success, it would not be able to capture the charm that went into this version. Its never-ending energy can not be captured again, nor the pure joy that you get when watching something like this: a large, wide-angle, great entertainment movie. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando (who last came to Â£ 409 for the last time I heard) is playing Sky Masterson, one of New York's biggest players. Frank Sinatra is Nathan Detroit, whose famous star, often referred to as he may be, is poorly known. However, when one place that he kept is billing $ 1,000, Detroit needs money quickly. He bets Masterson $ 1,000 that he can not go to missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to Havana with him the next day. Guys and dolls are basically nothing more than rude types of singing and dancing, as it does here, to add fun. It's obvious to see how this was a Broadway musical: there were not so many files and the scenes were long. If I had to complain about one thing, it is how the songs were uneven. Sometimes there were two songs in the scene; otherwise there were thirty minutes without one. Boys and dolls are never boring, it's a great time. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Not rated.
