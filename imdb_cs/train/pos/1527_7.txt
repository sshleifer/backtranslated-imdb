Once it's released, this movie looks nice and sounds great. The glory of intelligent and sophisticated acting, from Gielgood, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and above all Anton Walbrook, and a moving central performance by the beautiful and incredibly young Jean Seberga. Preminger does not jump and show - his long slow shots encourage you to listen and think, and Graham Greene's script condenses Shawa without sacrificing complexity. A bit has a look made for a television movie, and it's bound to be a studio, but nothing worse. Too many contemporary films about "historical" themes can not resist bankruptcy. What would Mel Gibson do from a mercenary? Many pitted shots from her on the rack are likely, and then rise to the BBQ as the flames hold. Preminger will not do anything about it. The burning is mainly due to the reaction of guilt. There are some weak performances, but it is not enough to cause serious damage. I recorded the movie on TV and did not expect to see him, but I was gripped. In our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Joan's story has unexpected resonance.
