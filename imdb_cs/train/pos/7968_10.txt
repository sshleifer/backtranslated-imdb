I first saw this movie when I was about 6 or 7 years old and did not really think it was strange. As time passed, I saw it a couple of times and started to grow on me when I began to understand the morale of the film that will come later. I left this movie for a while and did not watch it for a while. When I was looking for an old classic movie that would be done a few weeks ago (now 15), I dug VHS home. After this observation I stayed on a natural heights I could not explain. The film gives a stunning feeling of joy that you never expect. The film nature of three completely different animals that work together to find a way home actually sends a message home that no matter how different you are, you can always find a common cause, something you all need. The way personal characters are selected is really fantastic. The fact that you have an old knowledgeable wise golden retriever who cares about "coincidence" or fun loving about a lightly clumsy young American bulldog, with a smart, vulnerable but sure cat. The movie follows these three friends or companions on a path that is so realistically impossible that it creates charm by starting to believe that this path can happen. <br /> <br /> I do not want to sound like a grabber of soft tissue when it comes to movies, I assure you that I am absolutely the opposite, but the most advanced part of this film is undoubtedly the return of shadows, when the shadow desperately tries to escape and coincidence and smarter, painfully tells him to leave. When the two animals return to their beloved owners, it is silent until the shadow is bind over the horizon, when everyone has fun. There is a fine line between heartwarming and corny rubbish, but this film is a pure charm even at age 15. This film does not have to be Lord of the Rings, but for Disney to produce such a fantastic film with animals and for it to rise as it does at this age, which deserve 10/10.
