Fantasy is a terrible thing to be wasted ... especially when you have talented actors. Writer / director Jones does not waste time by looking at the audience with his protagonist. <br /> <br /> Everyone who shares a flat with sloth will cry laughing. Anyone who came when the handset puts a ticket on your windshield simply crys. We all wanted to get away with the terrible toupee from the head of man. It's just a snippet of what's been done watching "Cross Eyed," a hearty film that should be a springboard for Jones and his sad sense of humor both before and behind the camera.
