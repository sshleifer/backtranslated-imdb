What's in the Name? If his name is Jerry Bruckheimer, expect it to be filled with action. In Bruckheimer's last movie, Gone in 60 Seconds, all about the nomenclature. With characteristic pianists such as Kip, Sway and Sphinx, and cars idealized with names like Diane, Sue, and elusive Eleanor, it's just a non-stop action that prevents you from just playing the name of the game. <br /> <br /> It's not a profound scenario but it's a great tool for action because Nicolas Cage as Memphis Raines along with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvalle comes from retirement to save his brother's life by stealing the list 50 exotic cars in one night. Remake of a cultural hit in 1974, this film may not be designed for the same cultural status but is fun. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, it's an action that keeps track of you. Although they are charged with stars, none of them have exceptional performances, including the very poor performance of one of my favorite and most popular, Giovanni Ribisi. Even Jolie, coming from the recent Oscar victory, is just a symbolic love interest with almost no time on the screen. Can many beautiful cars and the pursuit of cars engage in a great movie? I think yes. The film is a pleasure to look at and although one scene brings you to an unbelieving area, the action is uninterrupted and the tension is convincing. Just be careful with the other drivers who fight for the pole position when you leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 of 5
