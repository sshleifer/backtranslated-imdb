This is the best movie ever created. It deserved more than what she had won with the Oscars. Nominated for such things as his score, artistic direction, supporting role (Newman), this movie could be simply nominated for Best Picture, Director (Mendes), Actor (Hanks), Newman and Law and won! Hanks gives one of his best performances and the guy playing Michel Jr. was so good that I'm surprised I can not see him in more movies today. Critics themselves do not give this film enough recognition. But besides incredible performances, another real star of this movie is incredible music. This was by far the best score of the year. She was nominated but did not play. It's a great movie that everyone should see. My grade-A +
