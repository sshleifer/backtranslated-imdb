There are only a few movies that will make me feel like the movie "Nedel Kelly" by Gregor Jordan. At first, I only heard half the recommendations and decided to see for myself. Since then, I've got both a video and a soundtrack, and I have to say that after a few views I'm still very impressed with the basic character of this movie. It's also wonderful to see something Australian! I appreciate its quality on the ground that when you ask me it's a rarity, just like the absence of stickyness that drives so many movies. This film proves that you do not necessarily need decorative costumes and a glamorous set that absorbs how many millions of dollars it will do. Casting was a bonus, including a number of well-known, and I can add good-looking people who have gotten well into the role of such unique characters. It is interesting to note that a lot of criticism about this film was about who played what and what they called so many lines. However, if there is any criticism, it should be constructively focused on the fact that a few basic elements of the original events were excluded. In fact, it worked to make it a punch that it is in Australian history. For example, in closer examination, it can be found that there is a lot, much more of a relationship between Joe Byrne and Aaron Sheritt, and that it was in fact responsible for much more end-to-end gang than was investigated in the film. It was also overlooked that it was not just Aaron Sheritt's attempt to give the Victorian police a glimpse of the emerging mystery. Yes, it is their interpretation of the story and it is understandable that true stories require a sensation and sometimes a modification of the original plot to attract the audience's attention. I feel that this is the only limitation. However, I believe that perhaps historical accuracy is only relevant to those who are particularly interested in realistic events in the situation. It certainly inspired me to look in more detail. So, watch and decide for yourself. Maybe you do not like it at all, that's your opinion, and that's fine. Maybe it's a movie that likes the Australian audience very much? For me, I call it fresh air!
