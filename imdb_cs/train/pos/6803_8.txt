In one of the first films, Romy Schneider shines like a young Queen Victoria from Britain when she suddenly enters her throne at the age of 18, learns to follow the machinations of politicians, and ultimately romances and marries Prince Albert Saxon. Kytovsk√Ω and Camping (although surprisingly true events), this romantic piece is irresistible. Seeing this film about British royals spoken in German adds to its quaint charm. On this side, one wonders why the Austrian film was about the Queen of England; but then we remember that in 1954 Austria was still in the occupation of Allied troops, including the British. Perhaps it was one of the reasons for the existence of this film.
