I'm a kung fu fan, but not a Woo fan. I have no interest in gangster films that are filled with a cross-border game. Now, martial arts; *that's beautiful! And John Woo surprised me here by producing a very fun kung fu movie that almost fought * too much * if that was possible! That's a good thing. Many combat scenes are very good (and some are less good) and the main characters are fun and appealing. The criminals are a bit incredibly evil, but they are fun. You have to see a sleeping guide! He can fight only when he is asleep - it's hysterical! With repeated views, however, Last Hurray For Chivalry tends to be a little boring and long lasting, mainly because many combat scenes are in fact not so good. That's why it's "just" 7 out of 10. But it's really almost "8". In all the better kung fu movies that are made in the heart of kung fu cinema is best. All the really good kung-fu films are from the mid to late seventies, with the exception of the late 1960s and early 1970s (and early 1980s).
