I've never commented on the film. I watched this movie with my girlfriend last night. I've read comments that say this movie stays with you. It is. It's been almost 24 hours and I'm still totally hit. This movie let me question myself. How can I cope with a character like Ben, who is totally selfless. I loved this movie. I like movies that let me guess and think till the end. I feel two emotions predominantly, happiness and sadness. An amazing good movie and also a very sad movie. So I wanted Ben and Emily to be together, but they were forever. If you did not see this movie, look at it. Just make sure you have no distraction. You will want to see every nuance in this picture. One for my library.
