Most hillarious and humorous Brooks movie I've ever seen. I can watch and watch the tape again 100 times. I laugh and cry for a moment. It's a really good and fun movie, and if you like Brooks - it's a must! In short - Brooks (miliardare) gets into the street like homeless for 30 days to get the whole poor district from its competitor. Reality bites, but in the end it is a warm relationship between people ... We strongly recommend!
