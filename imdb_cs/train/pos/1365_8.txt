He-he-hello! It's a really funny movie. In Party Girl, you're basically a New Yorker kid who is independent in the early 1990s. Together with his party friends, he meets a well-established Turkish salesman. It's a story of age for those new adults who are looking for what they want to do. It's nice to see a woman slacker develop into a mature woman. I hope that everyone will feel the only way they can keep them when they manage to keep up and dig a good party. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey is great on the side of the note. I've never been a big fan, but this movie just wanted to watch all her movies. There are gentle manners that have perfected her character. If you want a good laugh and fun time, do not forget to check out this movie. Re-viewing is required.
