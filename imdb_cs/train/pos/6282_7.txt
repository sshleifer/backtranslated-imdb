Nick Cage is Randall Raines, a retired retired officer who is banned from retirement when forced to save the life of his brother, Kip (Giovanni Ribisi), when he ordered a job by finishing the work of his brothers, killing 50 cars a night. He has to get in touch with his old crew to believe he can help him pull him out and get his girlfriend from Dutch. But the cops are on him, so he can pull him off? He was one of the best film candidates to re-shoot because the original was far from classical. And if you do not get into expecting a lot and turn the mind part of your brain in order to ignore the story of the plot and just take the film for what it is. You will finally enjoy driving. Watch it on a double account with "Fast and Furious" at night high-speed hijinks, just do not take the car out for spin then. <br /> <br /> My class: B - <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: 7 minutes Jerry Bruckheimer Interview; Bruckheimer Bio / Filmography; Congestion: Highlight reel; Big Chase; "0 to 60" featurette; "Wild ride" featurette; Stars on the road; The Cult "Painted On The Heart" music video; Theater trailers and trailers for "night shanghai", "missions to Mars" and "coyote Ugly"
