How can anyone say it's wrong is outside of me. I loved this show before I even saw her. For 3 reasons: 1. Story interested me, 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Do not forget to ignore bad comments and observe the entire first season before you decide it's bad because I know that if you are looking at the first season, you will love it and go out and buy season 1 and season 2 on DVD and then join Campaign to Get Season 3 Made! <br /> <br /> I hate Fox and I'm sure many of you "Dark Angel" fans hate too. They have something for Canning Good Shows! Do you all agree?
