The "Direct Story" is a really beautiful film about an older man, Alvin Straight, who runs across the country to his estranged, dying brothers. But that's just a basic synapse ... this movie is much more than that. This was the last role of Richard Farnworth before he died, and it's definitely the one to be remembered. He's a stubborn old man who does not look like a lot of old men we know about you and me. <br /> <br /> "Direct Story" is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives. It reaches and touches some parts of you, at least if you have a heart, it will be.
