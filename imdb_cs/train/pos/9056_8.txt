So we compromised. It was a pretty charming movie, I liked the artistic direction (felt much more "real" than most children's films) and the costumes were not very cute. Child actors were not badly watched (adult performances were directed to cheese). It was great to show how a crazy child pushed the others and the children who stood up for bullying. I do not know how many adults it would like to see on its own, but it's a great movie to get a kid. And since Barnyard probably attended more than 100 children, I'm really glad we picked a badly-watched show of "worms" instead.
