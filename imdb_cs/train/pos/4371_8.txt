When he bravely came out, I was fascinated and was certainly one of the worst movie fans. When Rob Roy came out, I was fascinated, and although I liked the film, I did not think it was a great movie. However, as time ran, my recognition for Rob Roy increased, and my enthusiasm for Braveheart diminished. Braveheart is great fun, of course, but there are mistakes. The most important is, in my view, the clumsy picture of Robert Bruce, who was undoubtedly the greatest Scottish king. Another is the historical inaccuracy of the film that damages the film in relation to many historical deformations. I think I'm also concerned about the fact that in this film, which I saw only (at least in my view) in a retrospective view, it was possible for the first time to clearly see the beginnings of Eugene Mel Gibson. Rob Roy has grown over me over the years. Partly because I largely avoid the mistakes I have the most in Braveheart. But also because Rob Roy is like fine wine, which makes it ripe and more complex at every glance.
