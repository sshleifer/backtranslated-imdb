By a special telescope, Dr. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) successfully demonstrates that a meteorite appeared in Africa years ago, containing an unknown but extremely powerful element. Dr. Benet (Bela Lugosi) forms an expedition led by Rukh to find the element. Rukh unexpectedly discovers "Radium X", which is even stronger than radium and very radioactive, and Karloff becomes contaminated and can kill someone by touching them. Sparks are actually flying between Lugosius and Karloff in this classic science fiction film during the Second World War. Director Hillyer has used several "FLASH GORDON" series of staples that were filmed at the same time and also introduced several shots of Frankenstein electric machines. Universal has dedicated the public to not being aware of the special effects that are used in this great classic movie. Karloff and Lugosi were in their best condition, and they both liked working together and would be looking forward to future generations.
