I only saw the first part of this series when it debuted in the late 1990s and only recently had the opportunity to watch all three parts through Netflix (convenient services by the way). Overall, I enjoyed this carefree, sometimes genre infested mini series. The story of a young man who falls into an older woman seems to work and the actors are all right. Yes, she has some romantic clich√© that runs in the rain or farewell to the train station but the characters have a chance to be explored so it does not seem to be sweet as if it were a Tom Hanks or the like. Robson Greene, who sometimes reminds me of Scott Bakula separated at birth, does a great job of someone who is in love overhead, and the tide and flow of desire and rejection throws a series of observable fares. Personally, I think the series could have been made with two episodes, but that's for the debate as I suppose. It is obviously a continuation that should come tomorrow through Netflix.
