Stunning movie. The usual outstanding acting of John Thaw, which he recently went through. A man who has always been so casual. He was one of the top ten actors from Enguns, which was certainly my time. He can be remembered for his famous role as Inspector Morse. As Jack Regan hit the television series Sweeney in 1970 and as a lawyer at Kavanah QC. I have to see for the whole family and great DVDs for my collection. Filming will bring some memories of people who remember Britain's war and certainly those evacuated from London to escape German bombings. Interaction between two main characters. Tom and William William were really good at acting and faithful to Michelle Magorian.
