There's something about every "Hammer" movie that I see will really take me to the new fantasy of the world. There is something in the world of "Hammer" movies. "Guardian of Abyss" is one of those types of movies. He is deeply interested in occult and hypnosis to bring another kind of horror. Overall unforgettable movie. 7.5 / 10.
