I decided I followed this for recommendations from this site. I have to say it is worth it. You should, however, keep this film going for 210 minutes. If you do not have enough power, add it to the tape and watch it for a few nights. Now the movie I'm talking about will contain "spoilers" and if you do not mind, here goes: <br /> <br /> Alexandre is a promiscuous bum, feminine and gigolo. She lives with her older wife Marie. Marie owns a retail store and provides Alex. Alex spends his days in cafes and restaurants. The story reveals that Alex had previously impregnated Gilbert with whom he lived. Gilberte threw him for a less attractive man he did not love because Alex was abusing and abusing him. At this point, Alex was willing to get a job and helped raise his baby before he discovered that Gilbert had canceled him and planned to marry someone else. <br /> <br /> Accidentally, Alexandre meets Veronica and they come across a relationship. Veronika and Alex first fell in love with Alex, after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past. Marie and Veronika fight for Alex's affection and have menage à trois on boot. Finally, at the end she finds out that Veronica is pregnant with Alex's child, and Alex has asked her to marry him. We assume (as already stated in Gilberte's situation) that Alexandre will even get a job and be the provider of his new found love and family. There is hope! <br /> <br /> With the name 'La Maman et la putain' I deduced that Jean Eustache was about the character of François Lebrun Veronica. It was fucked and then she became a mother. That's why the mother and the bitch are the same? Anyway, what I know! French films are mostly (not all) very sloppy, aimlessly political, preaching, theatrical, insipid, lamenting and full of quotes. Lebrun and Léaud played their characters well and held the film together because part of the script became a bit lost and inconsistent. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad effort. 7/10.
