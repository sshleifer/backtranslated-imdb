This is generally a nice movie, a good story, great actors and great songs. Cinematography was unfortunately bad. One of the weakest points in the movie is the unpleasant string of sequences copied from Pretty Woman. Why? Will it hurt an attempt of some originality, Abbas? Mustan? Everyone who? <br /> <br /> The film is about a newly married couple, Raj and Priy (Salman-Rani). Priya can not count on the injury she had during her pregnancy and eventually decide to use a replacement mother to wear her baby. They choose Madhubal, the vulgar prostitute played by Preity Zinta. The film is not really realistic, I think it is not easier to accept? And even if they chose the girl, does that mean she must sleep with her? Did you hear about insemination? By the way, I think if this writer were to hear, the film would not be created, so the concept is obviously deliberate. Salman is doing very well. It's nice to see he's playing a serious character. But his character suffers from unnecessary and inexpensive dialogues about his great love for his wife and how hard he finds he is sleeping with another woman. Come on, it's charming and unrealistic. Rani is fine; she is generally effective and is trying to do something with the role but completely overshadowed by Preity Zinta. The film belongs to Preity, which is a great way to slide the show with its flawless performance. She transforms from loud prostitutes into a sensitive woman easily and naturally. She lives in film, emotion and makes you love her and admire her at the same time, partly because of her role, partly because of her magical and positive personality. It's one of the best performances in his career. There is no doubt that she is more talented than her current industrial. It should simply do more of that role. The film ends only points to what I said above. It's jerky, exciting and very good acting. Watch it for Preity. <br /> <br /> 7/10 for the movie! 10/10 - for Preity!
