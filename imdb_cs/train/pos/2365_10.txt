Jeff Wincott is not only Hunk but can kick his butt! This movie has some of the best martial arts movements I've seen for a long time. Okay, maybe Bridgette Nielson is not the first person I would take to play a ruthless politics, and it really did a great job! And let's not forget that Wincott has a partner in this movie, played by a martial artist / hairdresser Karen Sheperd. So she's not Cynthia Rothrock, who's watching ?! It's just as good, if not better! (look at her scene at the end of the movie, one word: OUCH !!). My suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible, because if you did not see it, there really is no big martial art.
