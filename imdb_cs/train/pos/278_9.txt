I have to say that Undying's Clive Barker is by far the best horror she has ever done. I played Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Evil Dead and Castlevania, but none of them captured the pure joy that this game faces with its terrible features. Barker is good at what he's doing, combining horror with our world and showing that his hand is clear everywhere in this game. Heck, even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters. Full of fresh visuals and ample atmosphere to shake his wand, Undying is a game I have to overcome in the books as the best title of horror. I just want to do this to the console system, but unfortunately the poor sales of computers have worsened.
