This supernatural thriller, Peter Weir, is truly one of the most intriguing and fascinating films ever seen. Richard Chamberlain best performs as an Australian lawyer who defends a group of young indigenous murderers. When he approaches the case, he discovers more about the main accused, Chris and, last but not least, about himself. Chris tells him it's Mulkurul, which looks like a race of supernatural beings who lived in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, it seems that the extremely high precipitation confirms the indigenous prophecy about the arrival of LAST WAVE, which will drown the world. Snake sequences and supernatural effects enhance this movie and make it a spectacular experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are solid in supporting roles as well as a difficult-looking kid playing Charlie, the old Aborigin, who can turn into owl. The culmination and the end do not disappoint, unlike many other supernatural thrillers who, after a promising hour, fall flat. But that can not be called a pure thriller. It's also drama and talks about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. The masterpiece of Peter Weir, commander of visually stunning dramas.
