I managed to see it at the New York International Film Festival in November 2005 with my friend. We were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot, and we found it moving emotionally. He was very well focused on strong shots. The visual effects were amazing - especially short. She had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious subject: This film is about a young girl who is attended by a demon offering that helps her with her abusive father. There is also a surprising twist at the end that caught me. This is based on the Gothic atmosphere. I'd like to see it as a full-fledged movie. - Carrie
