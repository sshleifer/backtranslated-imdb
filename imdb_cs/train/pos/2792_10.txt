I love this movie. It's a great film that combines English and Indian culture with feminist-type issues like girls who want to play sports previously reserved for men. It shows the struggles of both Indian people who want to overcome their cultural barriers and women who want to overcome sex restrictions in sports, especially in England at the time. I feel that cultural struggles are more emphasized than other issues. Unlike other comments, I do not think this movie is like Dirty Dancing or any other such feline movie. This step loves many types of people, both men and women, young and old.
