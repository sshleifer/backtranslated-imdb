Do not allow my constructive criticism to prevent you from buying and watching this Rom Schneider classic. This film was shot in a lower budget, probably against the will of Ernest Marishka, so he had to do due. For example England is pictured as a border with Germany.BY will wisp Victoria and her mother take a vacation to Germany just in a stroller. They came too fast. It probably could not have helped, but the castle they rented for the film was Austrian. When she told her she was a queen, she went to the royal room where the courtiers, where the British citizens are outside the castle, ask for her new Queen? Why does not the ISBN show itself to the balcony to greet her subjects? Low budgets! Where did the audience learn about this imperfection? I wonder how do critics feel? During the inn, he meets Prince Albert, but he is not excited. During a meeting on the diner's side of the pub you hear music from famous old American civil war songs like "My Old Kentucky Home" and "Old Black Joe". What? civil war songs in the 1930s? Is Romney Schneider displayed as Scarlet? Where is Mammy? Magna Shnieder also plays her? Is Adrian Hoven Rhett or Ashley? What was in Marishko's mind? So we add it to the camp. It is an inadvertently satirist story of Queen Victoria. That's the only reason you should gather it or see it 03 11 09 correction Germany and England are connected
