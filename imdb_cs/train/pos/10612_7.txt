It's so cool, it's scary, it's rough, but that's what makes it so funny. It's over the top melodramatic moments that are just ridiculous. This movie is great for fun. Rent her for good laughter. The film focuses around three female reporters, in the face of mobile phones. They go to a small town to cover the festival, but they can not get the room to stay at night. And so they meet Ernest Keller. It's a haunted psycho. And it will offer them to stay at their home. But he does not tell them the truth about who lives. <br /> <br /> Stephen Furst's performance is as amazing as "The Unseen," that it actually carries this movie. Most of the film is so boring, though the finding of the truth about Ernest's family is interesting. <br /> <br /> Just look at this cast in these scenes so it's worth seeing. Barbara Bach and Doug Barr make nice eye candy. <br /> <br /> I think the film is an old jewel that is hard to find and worth seeing.
