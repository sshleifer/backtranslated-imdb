Okay - I'll confess. This is the movie that loved me what Michael Keaton could do. He's doing a beautiful parody of someone who's doing a parody on James Cagney, with a spell of free space. Supporting cast are all solid workers and will do the right thing and do a great job in this 80s comedy. Soon, from gangster films of the 1930s and 1940s, he constantly breaks new lands with remarkably original material. (Well, yeah - some of that has been copied since then - but when this movie was made, it was original and much of it was not copied elsewhere.) Watch Joe Piscopo warn people not to do ______ with one of the best taglines spoofs. Look at Roman Moronie, what do you do with English that would make your teacher grammar. Look for amazing visual labels, such as Johnny Kelly's store owner, with the price tag for puppies and crackling kittens. Take a look at the biggest educational film "Warning Before Sex". Take a look at the most distorted interpretation of the Latin church, while a person who has never entered the store class will collect the Thompson machine gun from the parts. Watch the lines you will use in an occasional conversation for the next decade. Look at Maureen Stapleton, who is the perfect counterpart to a hard working mother with surprising gags you will never see. When you see a gag that does not hit your funny bone, be patient - another will appear in 30 seconds or less, and it's courses, you'll have to pause until you end up on the floor several times. Duckies and bunnies? I also. Look at fine things - some visual gags can go unnoticed by the first pair of views. There are some minor flaws - but it is probably the best of spoofs. Some are approaching, but none of them are so good.
