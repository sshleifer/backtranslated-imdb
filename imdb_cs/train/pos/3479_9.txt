This show started with big mysterious episodes. I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. She then began a short episode of Shaggy, Scooby doo and Scrappy doo. I think Hanna Barbera Productions had to change for 20 minutes episodes for short episodes. Some voice actors have become inaccessible. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Welker (who played Fred) became inaccessible. I think the voice of Velma will change after the first 12 episodes because the first vocal actress who played Velma was not available. And the network ordered Han Barber to shoot more shorts with Shaggy, Scooby doo and Scrappy doo because the rating was high. So they had to make more shorts. I wish they were mysterious like 15 episodes. Yet it's a good show.
