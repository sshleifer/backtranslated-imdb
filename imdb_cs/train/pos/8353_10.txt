I remember seeing this movie as a child in 1977 or 1978. HBO would see it late at night if they were the only film pay in existence. At that time it was NEUTRATED and was the only film of its kind ever shown on pay-TV ... especially then. I would like to see her now as an adult where I would be able to understand an adult subject. It was probably the closest thing I've ever seen on pornography at a young age of 7 or 8. Luckily, I had silly guardians and parents over the weekend. Most of my memories of this film were completely irregular sexual behavior of these two boys. Arriving home to sniff lingerie, fed foreign breast milk on a public bus, and thinking in the cabin at the request of one of their female items, there were only a few of the falling escapades that these boys pulled out of. Very nice film in the early 1970s. Until I checked the IMDb, I had no idea that this movie was like that. Most people I talk about have never heard of it.
