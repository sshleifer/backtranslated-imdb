Winchester '73 was a movie that shifted Mann from b-film to a big league and rescued James Stewart, who was in a post-war career as a conflict hero (though he inherited a project from Fritz Lang, maybe Lang deserves credit). Both men would go to much darker places - Mann with a remarkably gloomy devilish entrance that remained MGM delayed until Broken Arrow succeeded in releasing him? but the movie about a man who hunts his brother as a rifle title is passed from person to person along the trail before he ends up in one of the director's beloved shootings on a mountain slope, is an ever stronger meat than you would expect from the system to expect. Big dialogue, impressive supporting cast? Dan Durya, Will Geer, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntire, Jay C. Flippen, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson among them? and Mann's excellent visual sense lift the bar with this.
