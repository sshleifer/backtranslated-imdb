I remember this game. He always sat alone on the desks until one day he decided to try something new and get this game. I was looking at him with amazement, because it was the first PS1 game I owned, which had 4 disks. When I played it, I could not give the manager down, seriously. The story of this game is so good and twisted, it's almost as good as the Final Fantasy VII Story, and it's hard to reach. When you play the game, you get involved with the characters, it's incredible that it's only PS1 because it's like a movie. And I believe it should become a movie. It is a pity that this game is a very unheard-of game and hardly anyone played or did not like it because it's one of the games on which the ends of the shelves are sitting, with a 50% sign on it, trying to sell it. Well, I'm one of those people who always look at the ones at the end and try them out and most of them turned out to be really good. Damn it, I got into the Fantasy VII final, looking in the catalog and finding her. But that's different from Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> Legend of Dragoon is the only game or RPG that is surprisingly better than most Square Enix games. I would not be surprised if Square Enix did it, but it is not. Few games I play are better than Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, but that's it. But what really misses me is why it is very little known and not praised, which should be. Graphics are pretty good for PS1, but what can you expect from it? It's a PS1 man, made in 1999. The story I've already mentioned is amazing, almost outperforming VII. Characters are awesome, you engage them enough to deal with them and their actions. Certainly 10 out of 10. It certainly deserves more praise and a very well done RPG from a company other than Square Enix.
