"Hollywood North" is a film euphemism when they go to Canada to shoot movies for tax evasion and cheaper costs in a civilized city such as Toronto, later in Vancouver. Peter O'Brian, director, has probably seen many California invaders that this film seems to be the right way to deal with incoming celebrities who are trying to exploit the economy Canada has introduced. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, "Moon Lantern," a successful novel written by the Canadian author, has changed into "Flight to Bogot√°", which has nothing to do with the original film. The great egoist was, Michael Baytes, who is obsessed with what is happening in Iran, is being offered the main part that is becoming a catastrophe. The film seems to be saying that too many chefs have spoiled the broth, which seems to be the case of the end product that is being saved by its producer, Bobby Myers. With the help of Sandy Ryan, who shot a documentary from Toronto shooting, parts of the film are eventually transformed into a cohesive film. The film process is cheerful and the action is generally good.
