I have no idea how to describe this film, and would like to give others the same opportunity I had - seeing it without prior awareness of what to expect. I liked it very much, but I can also say that I barely understood what was going on if there was anything in the first place. David Lynch (tangentially) or especially Guy Madden movies should be enjoyed in particular, and all EIGHTBALL fans are likely to be together with joy and wonder (it's close to any movie I've seen on the tone and mood Dan Clowes creates so efficiently. ) One note that just warns someone who would easily offend - this film, if rated, would be NC-17 sure. Fans of male full queues of nudity, however ... hmm, well ... yes. That's strange wild things.
