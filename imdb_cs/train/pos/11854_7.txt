I agree with "Jerry." It is a very underestimated cosmic film (of course, how good low-budget is not underestimated?) If I remember correctly, solving the mystery was a variant (but not a "rip-off") of 2001 because the spacecraft computer was in fact a man somehow became a computer. And just like HAL, they tried to disconnect their "mind", but not its mechanical parts, and, as with HAL, it led to a disaster. There's at least one funny moment. When the character of Christopher Cary, who can not find food, finds a deserted bird, there's a little ominous moment, but then the obvious thing is not happening at all.
