When you compare what Brian De Palma did in the 1980s, what is going on now, his movies still look better and better. "Blow Out," "Body Double," "Scarface," and "Carlito's Way" are excellent pieces of cinematographic craftsman at the height of their power, a pure Hitchcock with an 80-inch dash of perfect perversion, a loving story of lust and murderous bloody images help to overcome logical holes while the amazing performances of Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (good director himself), Nancy Allen (wife De Palmy at the time) and Michael Caine make every scenic special.Navte the virtuoso of you on an incredible, terrifying, erotically charged odysei and you will enjoy every shot of "Dressed To Kill."
