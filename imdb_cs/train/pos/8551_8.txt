Ti% s and As *, lots of shoes. Some great characters, fun full of jokes and well assembled teenage action in this split from Amercan Pie franchise. It feels like a really old school. It feels a bit like Porky's for 2000. Some great humorous figures combined with some very humorous situations make this a real surprise for me. <br /> <br /> While the original cast is just gone except for one, I find this movie really fun. Let yourself get too excited, you have to marry a teen comedy that it is, but for what it is, it excels. The characters are sympathetic and fun, the girls are warmer than the hell. Fun and games are funny, with some things I've never seen in comedies, narrowing me, but laughing at the same time. <br /> <br /> So ignore the hate and let it run and see what you mean. Do not wait for a classic American pie, but expect something that should give you laughter and draw attention to your attention for about an hour.
