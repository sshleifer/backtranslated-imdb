If only 10 years later Eddie Murphy was born. Then we would all remember it. But even if it was only 4, If you have not seen them, borrow Dr. Dolittle, Showtime, I Spy, Pluto Nash and all the family comedy films Eddie - then watch it. Hands down, you'll laugh 90% of the time. The remaining 10% wipe tears from your eyes. <br /> <br /> You really need to watch more than once to understand all the jokes. From harsh humor to joke for children (if you've seen it, you'll laugh) - you'll love his stuff. If you can (or are a big fan) try to download clips from Eddie's songs. All the performances are different, as you can imagine, and he has even more funny jokes. But this is like the "best" Eddie Murphy 'X-rated' if you want. > <br /> And all I can say is please do not look at Delirious if you do not like comedy, you do not have a sense of humor or you do not have fun. If you use this great Eddie Murphy classic and probably leave it out. <br /> <br /> If you want to know how Eddie got the Beverly Hills Cop and got it famous - Delirious it is.
