For his first debut, this film has boring and cold moments. In the best film of horror film, the stomach dissection is being dragged into this film. The end is excellent. The filmmakers Blaire Witch apparently watched that film that ended was not the end but the beginning of the end. A great film and just a great Japanese gorgeous factor that can score perfect, thinks and frightens you.
