UC 0079, is a one-year war almost at the end. The neutral colony of page 6 was focused on Cyclops, the Zeon working group. Their goal, a new Gundam built exclusively for Newtypes (probably built for Amuro Ray from the original Gundam saga) inside. When young boy Al Izuruha, a Zeon MS fan, encounters Zaka after the colony battle, a new pilot, MS Benard "Bernie" Wiseman, is spinning. Two become good friends, Al is considered an honorable member of the Cyclops team. Through the show, Bernie acts as the father figure Al (whose real father he always works for) and seems to have been admitted to Federation Christine McKenzie's pilot, but in the end he must meet ... at the battle. Al soon finds out that war is not a child's play, and Bernie must decide to have the ultimate sacrifice to complete her mission. For just 6 episodes, the Gundam 0080 is a great show. Mobile suits are extremely well designed and animations can look dated but really show emotions in characters. If you liked 0083, then check this number, or if you're new to the Gundam world, it's a good start. If you look at introductions about dramatic and personal development, it is for you what focuses more on that of mobile combat suits. I think it's more drama than action. <br /> <br /> Mobile suit Gundam 0080, War in your pocket. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you have to win.
