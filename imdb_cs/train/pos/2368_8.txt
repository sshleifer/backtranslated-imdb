The story: Kurt Harris (Jeff Wincott), a bitter ex-cop, goes under a secret relationship in "Peacemakers" after his friend kills their leader. While she finds out that a woman wants to run as a mayor and does anything to achieve that goal, even murder. Cast is good (Jeff Wincott is a good martial artist and a good actor) ... Brigitte Nielsen plays sexy with another bad guy playing Matthias Hues also a good martial artist. The direction is good (even combat scenes). The rest is fine, Tony Burton, who plays friend Kurt of Nilsen, and Cyndi Pass plays a bad girl. Good action action from the producers of action / martial arts (Bounty Tracker and Lorenzo Lamas). Best Martial Law Movie.
