She's such an extraordinary singer who cares about something !!!! This final scene is one of the best moments in any show biz - bar none! I'm glad she left the camera for ten minutes - it deserves an iconic state - that's the power of the voice. <br /> <br /> I first saw this movie when I was five and it has had a huge impact on me. I see it today, and yes, I see some mistakes (like Esther wanting to leave Grammy right while her prize is announced). But some of the other user comments are simply false - I mean, where is free nudity - maybe we have seen different movies ??? <br /> <br /> Streisand's singing ability is monumental and if he has a great ego - it's fine! <br /> <br /> She got it.
