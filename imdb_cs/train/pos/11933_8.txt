I think it's a beautiful family movie. Throughout the movie there are lots of fun scenes and heart warming. The actors are great and the effects are well done all over. Danny Glover plays George Knox, who runs the terrible baseball team 'The Angels' and is great in the whole movie. Also fantastic are young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is good as Al 'The Angel, and the effects are great in this top-of-the-line Disney movie. Touch and heart-warming film that everyone should enjoy.
