This typical Mamet film brings a serene, even look at what makes man's trust (Joe Mantegna) good. Investigated as a psychological study by a well-known psychologist (Lindsay Crouse), she slowly pulls her into her world with the usual unpleasant consequences. The cast includes a number of players who will find several movies from Mamet (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Allen Soule, William H. Macy) and do their usual good work. I liked Lindsay Crouse in this film and often wondered why she did not become a more marked player than she did. Maybe I'm not looking for the right places! The film continues at a slow pace, with a flat dialogue, yet maintains the level of tension that logically leads to the bang-up end. You expect to end in the end, but I found it uplifting and satisfying. I love this movie!
