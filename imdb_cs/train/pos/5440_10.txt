A trio of buddies, sergeants all in the British Army, carouse & brawl a journey through imperial India. Intentively faithful to each other, they encounter their greatest and most deadly challenges when they encounter the revival of the evil cult and its demented, inexorable guru. Now he has to rely on the poorer regiment servant, the water carrier GUNGU DIN to save dozens of Queen soldiers before a certain massacre. Based on more information about Three Musketeers than Kipling 's classic poems, this wonderful adventurous epic entry into the Hollywood Golden Age of 1939. Exhausted with tension and humor while maintaining romantic interludes at the smallest minimum, he captures the audience' s interest and holds him up to (sentimental) conclusion. <br /> <br /> It is virtually insignificant to discuss the three-star power of the stars, Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen & Douglas Fairbanks Jr., because they are really all thirds of a single organism - inseparable and with all intents and purposes indistinguishable. However, this does not change the fact that it's just great to watch how they have a glorious time. <br /> <br /> (Interestingly, McLaglen boasted a prominent military career in the First World War, Fairbanks would have been mostly in secret affairs, and after the end of the conflict, he won less than four honorable knights, while Grant allegedly worked secretly for British intelligence service and watched Hollywood Nazi sympathizers.) <br /> <br /> Really acting laurels should go to Sam Jaffe, heartbreaking in the lead role. This humble man is attracted by brilliant dignity and tremendous courage, so the last line of Kipling's poem is true. It's unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Montague Love is as courageous as Colonel, while Eduardo Ciannelli is an evil incarnate as Thuggee guru. The rest of the cast, Joan Fontaine, Robert Coote, Lumsden Hare, are effective, but they have nothing to do. The filmmakers will recognize Cecil Kellaway in the tiny role of Miss Fontaine's father. The film selects its villains well. The demonic culture of Thuggee, believing in the hideous, blood-soaked Kali, the Hindu goddess of destruction, has been a proletarian of Indian life for six centuries, ceremoniously strangles up to 30,000 victims annually. In 1840, the British Army, in cooperation with a number of princely states, managed to suppress religion in the end. From then on it would remain a matter of novels and nightmares.
