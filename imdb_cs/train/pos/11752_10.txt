For all the films Has-Beens or Never Was or for the curious is this movie for you .... Have you played any sport or wonder how it was after the lights collapsed and the crowd left ... this movie examines it and others. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams (Jack Dundee) is a small assistant banker at Taft CA, whose life was plagued by a bad rival in a major competitive high school football game 13 years ago when he dropped a pass that would have won over Bakersfield, their Arch-rival, who is pleased to enjoy Taft Rockets, season after season. Kurt Russell (Reno Hightower) was in this famous Quarterback game and is a local legend now a repair specialist for a van whose life is lost in lethargy such as the city itself Taft. <br /> <br /> Williams gets an idea to make history by playing the game! He encounters skeptic resistance, so he runs in a horror of terror, literally painting the city, orange, yellow, and black to pick up the anger of the people to recreate the game. After success, players from that 1972 team reunited and tried to get a form to practice, which is hysterical. The game is on, Bakesfield is packed with all the high-tech gadgets, gaming strategies and sophisticated training routines. Taft draws games in mud, with sticks, stones and caps on lids, what a revolt! Taft has to overcome the chances, makes Robin Willians the demons out of his guts, makes Kurt Russell of lethargy, watching "The Best of Times" for one of the best watching experiences ever! <br /> <br /> One of Robin Williams's best tracks, chemistry between Robin and Russell is magical. And who is Kid Lester ??? Holly Palance and Pamela Reed remembers performances as Williams and Russell. Succes at many levels. A 10!
