One word can describe this movie and it is weird. One day I recorded this movie because it was Japanese animation and it was old, so I thought it would be interesting. So it was, the movie is about a young boy who travels around the universe to get a metal body to look for vengeance. On the way, he meets very varied characters and must decide whether or not he wants a body. Very strange, if you are a fan of animation / science fiction, you can check it out.
