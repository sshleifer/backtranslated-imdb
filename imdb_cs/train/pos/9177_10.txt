I have to say that this miniseries were the best interpretation of the beloved novel "Jane Eyre". Both Dalton and Clarke are very credible like Rochester and Jane. I've seen other versions, but no one can compare it. Best for me. I can never imagine anyone else playing these characters again. The last I saw in 1984, when I was only 13. At the time, I was a bookworm and I just read Charlotte Bronte's novel. I was totally enchanted by this ministry, and I remember not losing any episode. I'd like to see it again because it's so good. :-)
