Paulie is a girl's fantasy or perhaps her memory of what her youth is like growing up. Tony Shaloub performs flawless performance as a Russian scientist (PhD) who can not find a decent job in America. He became friends with an isolated parrot in fulfilling the meager duties of a guardian in a behavioral behavioral laboratory. The chief doctor is a bitter man, as Paulie, who can talk and fully understand his language and learn, surprises the doctor who later throws him into the lower levels of the building where Mikail (Tony S.) finds him. Paulie recalls her life with Mary and how they lost each other. Quest begins to reconnect Paulie with Mary, just been gone for over 20 years. The film ends, some will say predictably, with Mikail connecting Paulie and Marie. The story ends with three Marie's home admissions, where you can make the final by your own choice. <br /> <br /> A great family movie!
