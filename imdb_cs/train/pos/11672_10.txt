Outstanding pirate entertainment! He has a bunch of good ingredients to keep his attention - an engaging story of intrigues, a fiery pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara), attracted to the irresistible Mr. Hawk (Errol Flynn) who is on his own secret mission. They make a great romantic couple on the screen - Sigh! Anthony Quinn is an evil, bad pirate woven to his divine network to divide and conquer. I noticed the well-known face of Mildred Natwick, who plays a supportive role as Mrs. MacGregor, the protector of young Princess Patma (Alice Kelley). It is a beautifully landscaped scenery of coast, boat and bay. Lots of sword combat actions, ship battles, daring jumps of Errol Flynn (Robin Hood aboard the ship!). From the burning mirror myself, in an interview with Maureen O'Hara, I heard that he boasted the great bullwhip command and that at this point Flynn could overcome the sword, but he would not have to try. <br /> <br /> Very nice movie.
