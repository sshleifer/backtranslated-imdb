I was dragged to this movie about four years ago by my French star friend. During the first half hour I sat in my uncomfortable place at the New Beverly Theater in Hollywood and hated this film, hating myself and even hating a French actress. And then ... <br /> <br /> I do not know what happened but I was filmed so I was not in years. And despite the fact that one projector broke and had to make every change manually. I've been in the theater for almost four hours, but it was worth it. <br /> <br /> I believe that great movies attract you to the world, make a part of it, and then let you go to talk with your friends about coffee or drinking. This movie did it. It was one of the best movie experiences I ever had. <br /> <br /> <br />
