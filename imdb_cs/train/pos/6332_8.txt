This movie is suitable for television. I like it because I'm a huge fan of catastrophic films, even though it's a family movie. Accuracy on the film from the book is half and a half. They had the names of the characters correctly, but there was no storm in the book, a car scene involving the Hatch family fleeing from the tornado was not in the book instead involved by Dan Squad and his friend riding with the police on their way to the police station for security. and in the book Dan and his friend are both 12-year old. That's all I can think of. Overall, it was a good movie, though it could be a bit more accurate for the book. Did you know the book was based on a real story about a series of tornados that destroyed the small town of Nebraska in 1980?
