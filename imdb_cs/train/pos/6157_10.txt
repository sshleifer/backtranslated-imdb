It's a movie I never thought I'd see until my 3-year-old boy saw a video store and grabbed it after he liked the cover picture of the animals on Nabooboo Island. We've got it and since then we have been watching it repeatedly; we actually rented it several times. There are very few uninvited films my son will watch and pay attention to; what a nice change from Dumbo and Little Mermaid. The acting is excellent, the songs are convincing, they get deep into the head and you can not help, but you sing. The story, though specifically about WW2, is timeless and there is something new that can be seen every time you look. I have heard it compared to Mary Poppins, but I think they are two very different films, both of them great, but my son has no interest in Mary Poppins at all. This is one of the films that kids will want to watch over and over and that their parents will not have the intention of following. There are days when we look at sleep and sleep, and I do not feel the moans come to repeat another movie.
