After an anonymous phone call about a spacecraft that could crash in a frozen forest, two police officers will find evidence that the event actually happened and seemingly that one Martian left the place. They drive to the nearby Hi-Way caf√© and find the bus stopped, and seven passengers are waiting to reopen the snowy bridge. The driver, however, says that he only had six passengers to park the bus. During the questioning of passengers, they do strange things in the dining room, switching on and off the lights, and switching on and off the fifth wheel. When passengers are released and the bus continues on the way, one passenger returns to the dining room and discovers the land of the invasion on Earth. "Will he be a real martian, please get up?" is one of the best episodes of this great series. An interesting story has ironic and humorous dialogues, funny characters and situations, and a surprising and utterly unexpected plot at the very end. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "O Marciano" ("Martian")
