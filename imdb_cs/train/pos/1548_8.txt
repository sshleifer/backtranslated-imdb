Fortunately, when I did not know anything about this movie, I was curious enough to record it from TV. And then the band ran out just five minutes before the end! But I'm glad I managed to get the majority because it's really a great spy movie. There are regular toy submarines and a little hazy land, but also very cold and even bold moments. Due to the 1969 production year, some light lesbian subtexts had to raise several eyebrows. Naturally, it will not surprise anyone, and these scenes are really far from beautifully done. And it's not just about George's two actresses. It seems that the gas attack hit every audience very strongly, no wonder, and it certainly hit me. Very effective. Also, the views of both sides of the opponents give the whole story a greater depth alongside the usual tension and action. It is not just a heroic war story about one winning side, but it shows what lies behind the victory in good and bad. Well, to be a case of war, mostly bad. For fans of Ennio Morricone, it's also necessary. His work is always excellent, touching, but never on top. And I think I'm trying to capture other movies with Suzy Kendall. Talk about Fr√§ulein! We hope they will soon get to the DVD so I can have the whole movie in my collection and more people get acquainted with this very little known gems.
