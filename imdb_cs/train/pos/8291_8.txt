"The Lady in the Question (1999)," in which Gene Wilder plays, is a dramatic mysterious drama that reminds me of the old black-and-white series Raymond Burr Perry Mason. Both Perry and "Cash" let me guess until the end. There were many suspects with the motive of the murder, but I had no idea what that character would be like. Gene Wilder has a strange charming joke about him, even in his face expressions and vocal niches that make perfect for this part. The parts of the film that portrayed actresses were very successful. I'm sure this is another challenge to get the cast. I'm not surprised to see that he made a movie for the movie. Even his singing was joyful. I like him in this role more than his former "stronger" roles like "Young Frankenstein" and "Willy Wonka". I hope that A & E will continue this series. They have to say something like "A & E Gene Wilder Mysteries." Music fits into a period. I really enjoyed a great live combo and swing melody. In the beginning, I was a bit unclear whether we saw a memory or whether the action took place at this time. And I do not agree that involvement of vulgarity is essential to the flow of the scenario. It always drives it for me. Overall, with my wife and I, I was very pleased with the other at a great start in what we hope will be many others - just like one of our other favorites: Raymond Burr Perry Mason.
