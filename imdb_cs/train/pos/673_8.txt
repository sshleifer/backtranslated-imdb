There is still a great deal across the great division that we call understanding, and we do not know what the older elder tribes explained. In any case, there is a lot in terms of the danger of too much knowledge. On the contrary, there are those who warn us before they are preparing for what they are saying, "the final time". In this movie, "The Last Wave", the native was originally murdered for no apparent reason. When the responsible people are arrested, they remain silent less because they disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays advocate advocate advocate. Although Burton pursues prophetic paintings from his own childhood and warns him of the modern symptoms given to him by a sympathetic native named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton continues his defense as the Tribal Law and is therefore not subject to standard justice. The film is full of mysterious, dark prejudices about apocalyptic catastrophic catastrophic disasters and warns of the future tsunami and wreck of the island. Black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film a terrific glamor and therefore is not for the weak heart, in fact, the simplest damnation of the apparition may last for years in the nightmares of innocent filmmakers. Good silent drama. ****
