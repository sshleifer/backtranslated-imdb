I did not read the book that it was based / inspired. These are some of the (other film roles) John Ritter's latest work (RIP), we hope it's funny. And it is. Almost every time she is present, in fact. Most cast as well as regular perform well with each other and the material tends to be great. He plays Paul Hennessy, the father of three teens: Rory, a typical guy of that time, Kerry, a depressed middle child fighting for causes and awareness, and Bridget, a loving fashion, a popular ditz. Sagal returns to the female role in sit-com and her character is far from Peggy Bundy. The show changed somewhat after the company had stepped in, and for a moment they seemed unable to decide whether they wanted to laugh or for being insulting and making sure they were respectable. One can wonder how and why it took so long: It could still be quite good, some of the increments were happy (if you like David Spade, most of his part consists of doing his schtick) and he has things to say . My favorite episode is in the last season. Humor is a pleasant mixture of jokes of "stupid people" (mainly related to undergraduates), stupidity, dark comedy, and raw material. This involved sex and other adult themes, but never in graphic design. The language is mild and occasionally slightly strong. I recommend it to every fan of those who did it. 8/10
