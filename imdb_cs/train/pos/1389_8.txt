The Williams family lives on a ranch in the middle of the distant desert. They are in considerable danger when the place suddenly falls into a whirlwind, where past, present and future collide wildly in a chaotic and unpredictable way. Director John "Bud" Cardos begins the film on an overwhelmingly mysterious remark, and gradually makes it possible for things to become strange, crazier and more exciting as the story unfolds. Additionally, Cardos fills the screen with lots of glamorous visual effects and does a nice job that creates a sense of respect and wonder. The admirable honest acting of the cast is qualified as another significant plus: Jim Davis as the hearty patriarch Grant Williams, Dorothy Malone as his cheerful wife Ana, Christopher Mitchum as Richard, Marcy Lafferty as his beautiful wife Beth, Natasha Ryan Jenny and Scott C Kolden as courageous Steve. Funky special effects offer an inspired mix of gnarly miniatures, pure stop-motion animated monsters (these include a small sparrow-free guy, a large, lump animal animal, and a sharp lizard) and smart matte paintings. Richard's crazy orchestral experience will actually interfere with mixing. John Arthur Morrillo's Elephant Blood Sun Cinema also makes a trick. Fun film.
