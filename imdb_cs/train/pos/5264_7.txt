A funny miniature film, a musical short film based on three songs by Colera Porter in Broadway. The first film Bob Hope is delighted! He plays the American playboy millionaire in Paris. The film opens with him and sits at a coffee table outside, telling his friends about this beauty that he exhale. Suddenly she will see her a few yards away. is so his friends are irritating and suggesting, "show her her bank book." But Hope claims he can win her in less than 30 days with "no" money! They pony ponies over the problem and take all their money and ID. I hope her hope, and when they're alone, she scares a proposal that she does not believe she's honest while singing "You Do Something For Me" by Cole Porter. But she has to leave, and he's trying to make money as a wizard to watch her. But when she sees she's showing him another girl around the city, she disappoints her to let him go. She is still haunting her and capturing her and her family on the racetrack, where she relies on her modest income from the last race and hopes to win so much to impress her. Through a series of events and large synchronized dance figures, he loses the winning ticket and decides to take it rich or poor. So she wins the girl, the race and the bet and sings two more songs!
