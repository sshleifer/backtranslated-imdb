The film has a distinct (though brutal and harsh) humankind for all its frontier damage - zippy / lyrical scores point to the comic side of their bad events and even when they are in their most stupid (such as terrorizing a woman on the train), the semi-vulnerable vulnerability never lurks away (Dewaere sucks on her breast as a baby). Blier is cut off from a scene where Depardieu may be planning to rape Dewaere, so we're never sure how to clearly read the homoerotic aspect of their relationship - whether it's an incident, is the beginning of their relative humanization (so the movie could certainly read as a pro- homosexual, though it might be probably read as for whatever you want). The film has many inappropriate scenes and points of sexual politics, and is probably best considered a general cartoon in a blind alley of both sexes, which mocks the whole concept of sensitivity and sincerity and interferes with many points of possible depth on the basis that if you shoot enough shots, some of them will have to intervene.
