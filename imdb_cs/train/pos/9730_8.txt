It seems that British newspaper reviews have focused on the fact that reviewers tend to know Toby Young, a journalist whose real experience is based on this film. The keyword here is "based". How To Lose Friends is a fictitious romcom. Sidney Young is joining the prestigious New York gossip magazine, where he goes after gaffe and gaffe before finally getting to the right position and doing it. This includes his shedding and the movie has some serious points about journalistic integrity. However, they are not exaggerated: the main ingredient remains a comedy that focuses on Sidney's bad incidents. The script has its own cake, and it feels that Sidney is a stupid, well-meaning jester at the same time as a clever, slightly annoying, experienced writer. This contradiction is never such a big problem, as Simon Pegg (like Sidney) shows the enthusiast too well. Jeff Bridges is a little too effective for Sidney's editor, and Kirsten Dunst is more anonymous than the conflict case of Sidney's sentiment. And when it comes to Megan Fox (starring bimbo airhead), I can say just this: just say the word Miss Fox and I leave my wife, all my stuff and I'll buy a ticket to take my place on your side like your wife. Of course, since I am a fat 56-year English accountant, you do not have to find your offer too tempting, but it's still on the table. Given how short her career is so far, we may think it's too early for Megan Fox to take on a role that mercilessly testifies to this acting acting acting acting acting acting act: it does it sweetly, with some skills and extreme sexual orientation. This girl will go far. <br /> <br /> There is genuine support from various experienced artists - Miriam Margolyes and Bill Paterson from Great Britain, Gillian Anderson and Danny Huston from the United States. <br /> <br /> There are several moments of laughter and I mostly smiled. As always, F-word does perform when it does not really have to, although at least a few are very fun.
