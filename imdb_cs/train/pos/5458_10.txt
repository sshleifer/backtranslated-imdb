I enjoyed this movie very much. I thought the story of the film was realistic and relevant to anytime in American history. There is always the woman who does what she needs to climb the class system. I have the feeling that Lilly's figure has been properly rendered and could not be better. I loved the most when she realized what was really love. Throughout the movie, all the men who fell for her were in love with her, gave her everything and even lost her career. Until she met Cortland, she did not understand why these men surrendered everything for happiness. The way her life ended was not far from what she expected. I would recommend this movie to all mature audiences, so you are able to understand the content and underlying importance of the film and the plot.
