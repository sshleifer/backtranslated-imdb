Jack Frost is a really cool movie. I mean ... It's funny. It's violent. and very pleasant. Most people say it's B, but it can not be further from the truth. It has great special effects and good dealings. The only weird things are, of course, The Killer Snowman. I think this film was actually one of the best films of the late 1990s. Most movies these days do not have the Clive Barker Masterpiece criteria. That means: Be original and give the audience what they do not expect. Jack Frost is very cool. 10 of 10. Step: A +. Ed also recommends Sam's Uncle Sam to Jack Frost.
