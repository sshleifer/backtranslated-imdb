I just saw this movie on a sudden tour and all I can say is ... "What I just watched ????" And I think well and wrong. The plot is really easy. Stiller and Black play friends / neighbors. Stiller is focused, hard working, while Black is a dreamer. Black will develop this idea to create a spray that erases the poo. The idea becomes very popular and black becomes very rich. The extravagant lifestyle that Black gets, and the fact that Stiller is still trying to be best friends causes Stiller to go crazy. As I said, it's easy. Everything else is just weird. The direction is odd, with a strange rotating opening that has fallen into furious sequences. Dialouge and acting are very special; in a special way. And the soundtrack is the most common in the movie, from the strange "Envy" song that still appears on the scene where you think you will hear a classic 80 song, but it's all in Japanese. <br /> <br /> So, the real question is ... is that funny? This depends entirely on the individual. I wandered through the sordid uncertainty of the strange film. After the screening, I heard people say he was terribly unhappy and glad he was free. Especially I understood their point. There are no jokes, so if you do not depend on the uniqueness of everyone, you hate this movie. She absolutely hates it. The film is designed to lose a lot of money in the box office and become a classic DVD. If you can laugh in a movie without real jokes such as Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love, I recommend you to see it. If it is not, run away from this movie. It will be crazy.
