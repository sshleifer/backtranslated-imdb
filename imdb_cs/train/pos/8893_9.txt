The 60s is a well-balanced mini-series between historical facts and a good conspiracy. In four deliveries we follow a North American family with 3 members. But we are not only seeing them. We also watch the story of several figures, such as a black reverend, an extremist student leader and a soldier in Vietnam. Filmography is simply exceptional. In the first chapters, we see a few scenes from the Vietnam War between the scenes. The next chapter does not begin where the last one ends, it starts some time, and gives us some secrets about what happened. In general, the 60th miniseries are to be seen, not only for hippies fanatics, but also for those who have little curiosity about the subject.
