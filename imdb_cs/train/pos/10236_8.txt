Hello, Dave Burning Paradise is a movie for anyone who likes Jackie Chan and Indiana Jones. The film's main protagonist is the most bastard son of these two strange fathers. As far as the other characters are concerned, they are known to transform similar action film stereotypes. Where this film is original, it blends the traditional Hong Kong movie style with action adventure in Hollywood. Unfortunately, it was not true about the movies he made in Hollywood.
