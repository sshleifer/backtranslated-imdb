It happened to me that he saw this film twice and more and found it well made! The Second World War was freshly finished and the so-called Cold War was about to begin. This film could be defined as one of the best "propaganda", patriotic films preparing Americans, and secondly people from the so-called "Western Block of NATO" that have been created so far to face the next threat of threat. For centuries, the film has celebrated the power of the United States as it has been shown until the war that has just ended. Nice and entertaining is a way to describe the discovery of the American continent by Columbus and the "episode" of the new Amsterdam and the purchase of Manhattan from the drunken local Indian. It must be seen (at least once, due to the curiosity of fashion propaganda over time)! :)
