My friend borrowed this DVD that I have from the director at the festival. I came to warn that some technical aspects of the film were a little restless and that the writing was good but not great. So maybe that's my colorful judgment, but I have to admit that I liked this movie. The characters where actors played. Youssef Kerkor was really good, like Ernie, the main character, some kind of pathetic way. Adam Jones (also director) and Justin Lane were great as roommates who run Ernie's fool. Bill's character (Justin Lane), who spends a lot of panda-dressed film, was by far my favorite; it seemed at least one dimensional and reminded my old colleague that I called the boy after watching the DVD. Really kind and very fun. Some other actors were good, some were so-so, but none of it was bad. I also really liked the duel vigilante. It's sad and fun. I'm giving these high marks, even though it has some problems, because you can tell when you look at them and they decided that their film would be on their way. Good work with Adam Jones and the crew.
