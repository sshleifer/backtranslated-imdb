It was a bit bizarre and bad, and I liked it very much, the characters in the show were great too, and they were pleased with each other. I was sorry to see it cut off. I would love to see where it would go. You found yourself leaning toward Sheriff Lucas Buck, who had more secrets than anyone else. Lucas was frightening and appealing. And I'd like to see him more and how his character happened. But I will buy a show just to enjoy it, it was great that there was something different on TV. And Paige Turrco, who was Caleb's cousin, was a great secret where and what to think about Lucas. It's a shame that it's not always ... or never finished, I'd like to see what happened.
