I got a chance at "Hardcastle and McCormick" by buying Amazon's first season worth (Canadian Edition). When I did, I started with a pilot and after that I was instantly addicted. I rated her 5 stars on Amazon and I rated her 10 stars. It's so good. What I liked was the opening and closing motifs and, of course, the Stephen J. Cannelle logo at the end of each episode, but especially the relationship between the judge and Mark when working together on each case. I was so addicted that I bought a second season as a companion, and I enjoyed it as well. If you do not have this great series on the disk, I think you should buy it and put it in your collection.
