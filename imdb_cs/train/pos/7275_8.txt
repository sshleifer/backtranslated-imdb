No strings attached Features Carlos Mencia makes a stand-up that makes us both laugh and think. Not only is he attempting racial affairs (as many hate say), but also talking about how best to get illegal immigrants from this country ... what women think when they say they want to treat the same ... why are the Americans more crazy than Arab terrorists ... why no one need to pray for the pope - and what he hopes to do in heaven ... the theory of how Easter (aka Big Ups to Jesus Day) began the tradition ... his view of the film Passion of Christ-and his subsequent arguments with the woman about whether Jesus is affected or not, how society should heal the physically disabled ... and even if you have the right to say a joke or not. <br /> <br /> It also never stops reminding us that each of us has a voice. So we should use it to speak the truth, to say what we think, and do not be afraid if someone is offended. Carlos is a bomb.
