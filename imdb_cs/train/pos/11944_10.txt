I was going to give her eight, but because you had made 6.5 of much better votes, I had to contribute. The Styx River was purely brilliant. Sure, Woody was his perennials, but at least his role was reasonable. The first half hour was really cheerful and then watched the rest of the film. The dialogue was pretty smart, and Woody's party trick, along with the top bark reaction, was fun to watch. It was much better than the journalists did. And plus, a little disciple of the sorcerer who joined him. And of course you noticed that Johansen is a little frantic? Charles Dance is always fun as well as Hugh Jackman.
