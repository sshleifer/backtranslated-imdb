The Deathtrap turns you every turn, every turn, in fact its biggest problem is that there are so many twists and turns that you never really get to know the movie and often makes no sense, although they usually capture a surprise. The story is very good, except that it has so many twists. The script is very good and has a great dialogue and characters, but you can not take the whole of the development due to twists. The performance of Caine in particular is amazing. The directive is very good, Sidney Lumet can drive. Visual effects are fair, but most of them are actually in play and are fake. It shortens the path to many, but it still works and is worth watching.
