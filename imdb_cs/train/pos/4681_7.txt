Overall, I enjoyed this film and I would encourage him to love Indians. <br /> <br /> However, I really want to note the similarities between the parts of this film and Nichols' Closer. One scene, especially where Adrian Grenier's character casts doubt on Rosario Dawson's sexual life when he was gone, is remarkably similar to the scene in Closer, where Clive Owen's character casts doubt on Julia Roberts, although she is less harsh and more intense in "love." Also note that "Anna" is the name of both Dawson and Roberts. It can not be a coincidence. Now Closer is based on Patrick Marber's play, and probably this movie is loosely based on "Reigen" Arthur Schnitzlera, so I'm not sure how this connection happened. Anyone with an idea?
