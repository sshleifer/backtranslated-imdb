I like this movie as a child when it's out and still does it. A simple story involving searching for a kidnapped girl and an adventurer literally straight from paper traditions. He has actors who were more recognizable today. This should not prevent the viewer from giving him faith. Wayne Crawford stars as the main character of Jake Speed. Sure, it could bite some of the elements they call Stone and Indiana Jones. But this movie is so well shot to keep it from the cellar. I am surprised that too many people know about it. It had to be overshadowed by other movies in theaters in '86. I was looking at cable TV. It can be hard to find because it is out of print on VHS and DVD. I managed to get DVD from eBay for less than $ 8! Cool movement.
