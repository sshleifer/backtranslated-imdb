I do not understand the low 5.7 rating of this movie. It's a pleasure for people who like a strong thrilling plot and a dark atmosphere. The tone recalls midnight in the garden of good and evil, to the local environment (Savannah). The game is strong and I was overwhelmed by the accuracy of the Southern accent Kenneth Branagh. Famke Jansen is great, Robert Duval is effective in a small part, and Embeth Davitz's BOMB. A great full bore scene from her. <br /> <br /> The plot is fairly standard but effectively done.
