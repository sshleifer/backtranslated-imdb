This movie grabbed me with an incredible initial sequence that tricked me into a complete reversal of perspective, so I was addicted to the time the title appeared. The theme of this film is that everyone is acting, trying to figure out again, but not as complex as the identity or the usual suspects, but in the way we all try to do any trivial life, we find ourselves somewhat more interesting. Scenes in chicken stores are spectacular. At one point Jorgen (who owns a chicken farm) attends a laughing seminar where the worst student is. His inconvenience will allow you to see the depth of his desire to change himself. The film was thinking about the mysterious mysteries that lie behind the most common people I see every day. There is not a lot of plot here. Guessing old man's secrets is quite easy, but fascination lies in trying to guess what other characters will do when he finds out. I liked this movie in the same way as Sideways, although the characters could not be more different.
