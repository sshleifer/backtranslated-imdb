Does anyone know where or how can I get a copy of this movie ?! I've been looking too long for someone to help! In 1997, I was a girlfriend and I on this Long Island-based film, and we've never seen each other. :( I was hoping to find a copy so I could finally see it and share it with those girls! Is there anyone who knows where to get a copy of this so I can stop driving myself crazy? (And also does not matter, if it's in the VHS format, I'm still in the ice age alone.) If you or someone you know has a copy of this movie please help, I would be willing to pay for a good copy!
