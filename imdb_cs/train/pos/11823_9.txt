I really enjoyed this real form to get Dick Tracy a personality. It is a well-made product that uses advanced comic-era imagery imaging technology. If you are a fan or recently watched some old Dick Tracy movies black and white, then you are sure you will win from this release. Pastel colors and characters larger than the life-style that took place in a carefully authentic concept are fun as it should be. I personally consider Madonna to be a musical element that is the main piece of this film - the CD with her music from this film is one I've listened to over the years, it's so well-done and musically interpreted and tuned for that time. In my opinion, Madonna is the finest moment on the screen, but above all musically. This will surely make you a "child".
