Pushing Daisies is really a landmark on television as an art form. It seems like everything reminds Amelie and Tim Burton, but what's in a world where fresh ideas are clearly rare, this show will guarantee that you do not care whether it's fresh or not. It's just brilliant. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was fascinated from the beginning, intelligent writing, backstage and dialogue to show an incredible masterpiece from The Shield and The Wire comparison, but the beauty of Pushing Daisies is that there is no comparison on TV) . <br /> <br /> Really addictive and absolute pleasure. Maybe as one of the Piemakers cakes that we mention so dark.
