Carmen is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's hard to say which performances are best: Antonio Gades, Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol are excellent. They give off their souls. It is a beautiful story of the inseparability of life and myth; the myth penetrates into everyday life. Dance becomes life and life is exhausted. Real people live their own lives at the same time and become something else, they are part of old lovers. The spell continues.
