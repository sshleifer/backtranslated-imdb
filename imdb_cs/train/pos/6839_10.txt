In what must be one of the most blood-frozen films ever, the transvestite is murdering people in New York, and the answer to everything may not be what people suspect. One can see Brian DePalma taking some influence from Hitchcock with camera angles and the like. Michael Caine plays the most sophisticated character, while Angie Dickinson is basically a boring, rich woman with a bad hairstyle. Keith Gordon (who later starred in "Christine") is probably the most interesting figure in the movie. But you can not understand this movie without seeing it. And after you've seen it, you may never know who you can trust. Also played by Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz.
