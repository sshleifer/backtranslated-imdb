Jana Porter's former loving interest Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) and his friend Martin (Paul Cavanagh) came to Tarzan's hidden jungle that was looking for the Elephant's Graveyard Elephant's Graveyard for the first time in TARZANA, APE MAN ... we'll soon find out that both men have hidden intentions ... namely, Jane. Will Tarzan be worth it? It is unlikely (in fact, Tarzan does not even look at any disturbing influences on Elephant's Graveyard) and the realization that Martin is trying to take Tarzan out of the picture until he later finds himself in a world of trouble later he and his party (including Jane, after believing that Tarzan had died) is captured by an indigenous tribe who wanted to feed the lions ... and Tarzan will be willing and able to reach them in time? This movie is an adventure full of many scenes that include Tarzan and other faces down wild animals and culminations that capture the audience's interest and do not allow. The cruelty exposed to animals and the display of indigenous people can sometimes be disturbed, but everyone should remember that it is essentially adventure fantasy fun and should not be taken so seriously.
