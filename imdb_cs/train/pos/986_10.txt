If you like Jamie Foxx (Alvin Sanders), "Date From Hell", "01, you will love his acting as a person who never achieves a uniform break in life and rewrites a lot of gold bars along with the Jumbo Size. Sanders has a lot of FBI eyes watching him and the wind gets hit by jaws in the jaw, and David Morse (Edgar Clenteen), the television series "Hack" '02, decides to reset the poor Alvin and use it as a Fish Hook to and there are lots of laughter, drama, cold bloodshed and excellent movie locations and lots of expensive cars that are being sent to the Junk Yard, Jamie Foxx and David Morse being great actors in this movie, and it was great fun in the whole picture.
