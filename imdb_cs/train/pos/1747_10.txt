This movie was one of the best movies I've seen this year. I have not seen movies in the movie but it's still pretty good. Like Anchorman in humor, but I think it's a better movie. It really makes sense. If you see the whole T & A group, you will be disappointed. Just a good movie together !!!! If you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor, you will find it a really good movie. I certainly think that Ebert and Roeper's review of this movie is fine. I mean, I do not like Ebert on most of the movies, but it's the movie I agree on. The film contains such a good story that it is truly plausible that these types of people are out there. Certainly we can say something about how they treat the doll in this film. Yeah, sure, you'll be laughing when you hear about it, but it still suggests you wait. Steve did a terrific job showing the person he did in this movie, and yet it's still funny.
