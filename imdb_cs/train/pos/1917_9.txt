It was a great comedy with a great cast. John Ritter and Katey Sagal were perfectly occupied as parents, and the children were also great. Kaley Cuoco was a good choice for playing Bridget, which was a kind of weakened version of Kelly Bundy from Marriage to Children. Writing and performing were both first. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, John Ritter died during the series, and put a muffler on things. They had to scramble to change the show and bring other members of the cast, and it was probably an unpleasant situation, but they did it well. James Garner was a good add-on. It could take longer if Ritter lived. He loved me very much when they brought Ed O'Neill to the guest room. It was great. <br /> <br />
