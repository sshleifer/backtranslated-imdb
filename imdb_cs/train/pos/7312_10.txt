It took me time to really appreciate John Carpenter Halloween. As a child, I remember that I really liked to go on, especially the Return of Michael Myers, which I still consider to be the best Halloween sequel. But I thought the first was slow and it took too much time to get to the point. I've been looking at it a few times recently, and I know I was wrong. Today I really understand this movie, its meaning, the whole feeling of this horrible work. It's not about blood and gore. It's not about naked chickens and funny jokes. It's the worst night in Laurie Strode's short life. It's about the night that his crazy brother came back home to complete what he started 15 years ago. This movie is supposed to be scary and I think it works very well. It's also one of the first films of slasher, the horror sub-genre I've always loved. Halloween has a very dark atmosphere, scary music and talented young actors such as Jamie Lee Curtis in her first role. Do I need to say more? Anyone who has never seen it, a horror fan or not, should play their homework right now. We highly recommend!
