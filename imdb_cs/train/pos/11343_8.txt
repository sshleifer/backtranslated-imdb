I remember seeing it on TV in the late 1970s - and stayed with me! It's charming, loud, colorful - a great movie for kids. I gave it to a couple of my friends recently - and of course they thought I was upset and I expect the puppeteer to do something wrong to "meet the incompetent." But no - its healthy pure fun. > The wild jack is in fine shape, just like Mom Cass and some attractive witch. <br /> <br /> If you like banana chips and you are at your age of 30, you will again create that surreal childhood on Saturday morning Wind! Though I realized now that Puf himself is a bit of a bitch - because everything he does is capture and run away! Quality TV movie - if you are like me, you are into death metal - you will love him!
