She is a really cute heroine who, in turn, is surprised and scared by tiny fabrics, struggling with mattresses, running completely on a closed door ... just a few moments reminding me of the memory of Naked Truth. I loved what I captured from this show: nice colorful drawings and some good supporting characters provided settings for the diamond show - Tea Leoni like 'Nora Wilde'; cute, clownish and incredibly prone to an accident - How refreshing actor can see a clown - no wonder Hollywood does not know how to throw it. But where-oh-KDE are DVD releases? The amount (squeeze) they release is incredible that this little jewel still remains buried. (Somebody fix me if I'm wrong.)
