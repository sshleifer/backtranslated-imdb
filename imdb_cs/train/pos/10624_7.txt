I thought I should qualify my position after my other reviews. The film is not great, but it has a lot of great elements. The lighting and scenes along with the camera are great. The story is slow and weak, but fun. The game is bad, but it is not worse than you can find on the SyFy channel. The music is pretty good and the gore is good. He has a great leather face in the movie and produces Bruce Campbell. I was looking at the whole movie and although it was mostly predictable, it was still nice. Women are so attractive and leading actor does a good job of being embarrassed and scary. The film was remarkably pure for modern film and violence suitable for children 13 and older. There were no sexual scenes. I gave her 7 out of 10 and I think it's fair. I would look again if I had nothing better. The gay angel was the most annoying aspect of the movie, the devil is pretty scary.
