I simply liked this movie. The reason for my interest and experience was connected with nothing but the subject itself. I have heard stories from my mother and grandmother about how old lives and attitudes of northern England were being used (as they are experiencing them), and that is an interesting display that seems to faithfully represent what they have told me. Especially a paternalist but hopeful father who "knows" what is best for his family, along with his stubbornness when this paradigm is questioned. (There was not much change at that time!) People who saw the game are likely to be disappointed with the film because the story does not go through the media. In a sense, however, the film is a historical document and I personally liked it, just because it caused a social phenomenon.
