"Days" is a typical family-run drama with a small catch - you have to be involved with the character's emotions in every way so you can really appreciate the show. [Possible spoilers for those who are unfamiliar with the show] The story, of course, for all the people who watched the show is the World of Cooper Day, the middle child of the family. He records his days with his family and hopes to one day become a rich and famous writer for his observation. His family includes mother, father, perfect sister, and brilliant little brother. The first episode will sound a little foolish since John Scott Shepard has created this situation - both a sister and a mother pregnant. This is the first situation the writer will hit. Then my father leaves his job at a law firm. The youngest son gets a panic attack. The middle child gets into a fight with a nurse's friend. All this is for daily work. <br /> <br /> [/ Spoilers] <br /> <br /> I admire this show. I do not know. It's a bit miserable, but I like it. At first I thought cameraman's work was a riff, but then I got used to it and liked it. I liked quiet conversations under the dark light. I liked the intimate feeling of the show. I liked the low-budget style. I liked acting. I admire the story. Then it seems to me that I need a second season of Days. I slowly became a fan because the 6-episode broadcast on ABC was over. It's a really good show and it's nothing like an OC. They both have nothing in common. So I hope the fans stop comparing. And if you can join with either Abby, Jack, Natalie, Cooper or even Nate, you will enjoy this show. Many.
