One of the most amazing gorgeous animations. Although it makes the most complicated use of the "cut-out" method of animation (a la "South Park"), true talent for "twice a time" is vocal characterization, with Loranzo Music's (Carlton of TV "Rhoda") Woody Allen-ish Ralph -the-All-Purpose-Animal is the focal point. The series of "random nightmares" is undoubtedly one of the best films ever made.
