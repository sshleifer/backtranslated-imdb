"What I like about you" is definitely a show I could not wait to see each day. Amanda Bynes is such a great actress and I grew up and watched her show: "The Amanda Show". He is a very funny person and seems to be on the ground. "Holly" is such a capable person and has an out-there personality. I liked how she always seemed to turn things up and upside down, so she'd say goodbye. But that's what made the show so great. I especially loved the show when the figure of "Vince" appeared. Nick Zano is very hot and entertaining, just like "Gary," Wesley Jonathan. The entire cast was great, each character had its own personality and charm. Jennie Garth, Allison Munn and Leslie Grossman were very interesting. Especially I loved "Lauren"; she is the best! She helped make the show extremely funny and you never know what she will do or say more! Overall, the show is really nice, but the reason why I did not give her 10 was because there are no new episodes, and because the episodes could be longer and deeper.
