At first I was curious that the main character of the TV show could bring the dead back to life, but then I thought I'd give it a shot. Guess what? I like "Pushing Daisies" and I'm looking forward to the evening on Wednesday, just to look at it, then watch for the next week on her DVR several times. Colorful characters, humorous banter, quick dialogue and new unique situations attract me from the start to the end. Ned and Chuck Charles are interesting to watch because they work with their romance on the fact that they can not have physical contact. Even the character of Emerson Coda's detective continued to grow in complexity. A Olive Snook! Jiminy Crispies! He'll get me! The narrator's voice is funny and the listener reminds me that I'm watching the movie instead of the TV show. I recommended my family and friends to turn on "Pushing Daisies" and they are also addicted !!! The show is worth waiting a week for a new episode, and if you did not see "P.D.", I highly recommend watching it!
