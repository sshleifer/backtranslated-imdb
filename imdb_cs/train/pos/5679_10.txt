After the success of the second installment, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder should have a third appearance. This time, instead of Tudor's time or Elizabethan times, Edmund Blackadder (nominated BAFTA Rowan Atkinson) lives during the French Revolution. With the accompaniment of the now stupid but dear Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackadder is the "loyal" comedian of George, Prince of Wales (Hugh Laurie). During this third series to the amazingly written sitcom, Blackadder tries everything he can to become rich and powerful. He tries to vote for a spoiled neighborhood, tries to sell a book, tries to win a bet on The Scarlet Pimpernel, tries to be a highway, and finally sets himself up as a prince. This is a very good installment of popular comedy. Includes performances by Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. She won the BAFTA Award for Best Comedy Series and was nominated for Best Design and Best Makeup. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 in the 50th largest British actors category, was number 24 in a comedic comedian and was number 8 for a popular British comedian. Edmund Blackadder was number 3 on 100 of the biggest TV figures and was number three on The Biggest Comic World Characters, and Blackadder (all four serials) were No. 2 on the UK's Best Sitcom. Excellent!
