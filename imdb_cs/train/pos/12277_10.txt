Perhaps the best book, Isabel Allende, House of Ghosts, describes an alternative Chilean history that is full of spells, mystical veils and some ubiquitous sadness. This movie collects an excellent cast and a great artistic direction with a script that can not contain the quality of this whole book. It is unusual that an almost unknown country, such as Chile, will be as well represented as in this film, whose only sin is to focus too high, leaving the illiterate public a little upset, mostly because they understood very little.
