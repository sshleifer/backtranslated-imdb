The gangster genre is now worn out, which is too often parodied. With retrospection, the series of culminations of the previous clichés that have been used in his genre, fortunately, writers have advanced this flaw by creating realism that has been applied to it. The soprano is an epic sacrifice of crime that proves to be content with a psychological depth characterized by subtle nuance, humor and irreversible violence. The key protagonist of Tony Soprano is perceived as dangerous generals deprived of fear and moral values ​​by his crew, however Tony is a two-member who is bestial while the other is inconsistent with guilt and intolerance. Without any hindrance or contradictions, I am still persistently convinced that Soprano has the best occupied cast of recent memory. Everything I thought I could make a complex statement about the series, but I will not. If there is ever a visual glossary in global consumerism, searching for these definitions is crucial, ambiguous, inscrutable, epic, uncompromising, and sopranos that have broken apart, they smile directly at you.
