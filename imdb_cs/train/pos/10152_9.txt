I was looking forward to seeing it since I first saw her in her work. He finally found it yesterday 2/13/02 on the film Lifetime Film. Jim Larson's comment that it was "the sweet funny story of two people walking through the paths" was dead. Writers should probably not get a bonus, all the other SROs for filming a movie. Everyone who appreciates the romantic film should have seen it. Natasha's presence on the screen is so warm and her smile so electric, not to tell her the beauty that everything she's in goes to my favorite list. Her TV and press talks I've seen are just as refreshing and worth looking for. God bless her, her family and her future efforts. <br /> <br /> It seems to be available on DVD or video yet, but I would be the first to buy and I think the others would too.
