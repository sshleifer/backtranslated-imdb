This and her "Pilgrim Soul" are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of the Twilight Zone. As I mentioned in my commentary on the new series, there is something missing in this new series. Maybe they emphasize too much the lesson to be learned. It's a little mawkish and sentimental than the Serling version. However, this episode may be considered to be completely sentimental. I think this challenge is that no matter what they do, lovers can never get together. I remember I was not surprised by the Korean film "Il Mare" (later returned to "The Lake House"). I think it was because I first saw this episode and so destroyed the impact of the later film.
