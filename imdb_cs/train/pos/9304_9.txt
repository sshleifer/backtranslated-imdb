This movie is great. Simply. It's rare to find a comedy with levels, and that's a bloody good example. When I first saw this movie when we crouched, with a friend we looked at each other and asked ... "You caught it?" For those who doubt you look at the levels. Look at the comparison between Vick and the people in the club, DNA! Look at the various characters, each character rises, and if you see nothing else, look at the connection between Vicka and the film. It's all in Vick's head! Opening line on Vick's world. A final scene with a camera that goes into Vick's head and inside, the whole universe! Carefully quoted, beautiful cartoon gangsters, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
