This is by far the most incredible film I've ever seen. The actors gave beautiful portraits of characters in the film. The story was precisely rendered. The story begins with a young woman from the British Isles and her father traveling a steamer to Nauvoo, Illinois. She became a member of the LDS church and did not. She thinks she's ridiculous for the trip and is discouraging. He asks him to read about the Prophet Joseph Smith. This is where the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith begins. The film accurately portrays his life and some of the history of the LDS church at the same time. Sometimes it was occasional, but it was needed. The emotional expression was very believable, causing my emotions to pour out. Shooting was amazing. The way the story was presented touched on. After the movie, we just sat and could not move. I was amazed. For people who know very little about Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet, I would like to encourage you to see it. If there is nothing else but to gain some understanding of his life. For those who are members of the Church, I would like you to see it. Increase your testimony of this most incredible person. This is to be seen.
