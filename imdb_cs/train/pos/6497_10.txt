I had to see it a dozen times over the years. I was about fifteen when I first saw her at B & W at the local PBS station. I bought a DVD set to see them, and I watch them. They do not learn history at school, which explains the most critical 20th-century event. It extends its critical thinking. <br /> <br /> Unconcerned when participants from all sides explain with words what they did and why, they detail what led to war and real war. <br /> <br /> Buy it for your children along with Alistair Cook America. Watch with them and let them understand. You will be glad you did.
