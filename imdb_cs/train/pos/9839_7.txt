Hmmm, this episode is extremely underestimated. Although there is a lot of bad writing and playing in parts. I think good wins bad. <br /> <br /> I like origami parts and a big 'twist' at the end. I love the scene when Michelle confronts Tony. It's actually one of my favorite scenes for season 1. For some reason, people have always hated episodes of reincarnation, but I have always liked them. They are not the best when it comes to writing. but the topic really interests me, I will do THREE stars, but if the writing was a bit more consistent, it could be FOUR.
