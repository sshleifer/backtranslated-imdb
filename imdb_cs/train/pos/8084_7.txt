<br /> <br /> I bought this movie on DVD and watched it for the first time in the night. I've been a fan of Tolkien's work for about four years since I left high school. I did not grow up on this movie ... maybe my mother turned away from it. It is certainly not for children. Not that it was bad in the graphic sense, but that the themes would go overhead for most 10 years. Overall, the animation was excellent because it was done in 1978/1979. I thought this story was working pretty well. But I bothered that Bashki did not add another 40 minutes and knocked on the Return of the King. That would make it the final movie. I was concerned that it was a sudden ending, and then, when I heard the return of the soaked king, I was still bothered. Pity it was not a great animated movie. Maybe I would get a higher voice. I give it to 7. I can only hope that Peter Jackson will make books with the new LOTR live action.
