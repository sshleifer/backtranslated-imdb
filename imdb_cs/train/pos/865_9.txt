Vincent Cassel plays the role of Paul, a former horse who is assigned to work in the office where he meets Carla, a secretary who is "completely deaf" when he has hearing aids in "very deaf" when not (played by Emmanuelle Devos). Together they help each other to evolve as people. <br /> <br /> What was particularly interesting about this film was the complexity of the characters? does not fit into obvious stereotypes. Paul looks uncomfortable in the office environment, is it just that he can not work? This belief is scattered when he gets a job in the bar and shines. The film has a certain amount of amorality that I consider to be refreshing and showed how easy it is to act criminally, even though we think it is innocuous. Eventually it's a movie full of great moments, both touching and funny. One of them is when Carla looks after her and tries to calm her baby. She continues to cuddle it? but he will take the hearing aids at his own convenience.
