When I saw the trailers, I had to see the movie. And when I had it, I felt I was unhappy. It was a great movie, do not make me sick, but I think great parts where already in the trailer if you catch me drift. It was very fast and started composing, so I was never bored and I enjoyed it. Humor was great. My first contact with lanes (or something similar).
