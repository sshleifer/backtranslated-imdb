This is a kind of film that the US does not create. That's why people hired foreign movies. It's a great story about how one person, even if slow, can find a reason in the empty life. Everyone can learn from Georges. It also shows how people who are mentally handicapped suffer in their lives and show them in a very realistic way (I think). As a classic in foreign films, this film has a hot-and-cold end, but it only makes a better film.
