I loved this movie, it was one of the best portions that I remembered that I was watching him for old or some crazy thing, but it was great. I saw only half of it and I reached it and all I can say is that I loved every minute of what I saw. I did not want to sleep for a few weeks after seeing this movie (although I was very tired.)
