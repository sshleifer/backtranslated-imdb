SOLDIER is not as bad as many have done. I found the film to have some sakristic, cynical humor like the one in the patrol boats of Peter Verhoven. Lack of dialogue and top event is deliberate and contributes to the comic atmosphere. <br /> <br /> One particular trivia-bit stands out for me - Todd has the names of several space tattoo campaigns on his chest and one of these battles is TANNHAUSER GATE. For those unknown, Tannhauser Gate is mentioned in the last line of Roy Batty's Elegy in Blade Runner. Imagine Todd could fight beside the android soldiers as if Roy thought he was the smallest. Perhaps writer David Peoples was nostalgic? <br /> <br /> I'll give this 3 of 5.
