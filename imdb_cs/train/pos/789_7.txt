Crush provides a combination of drama, humor and such irony that I think is very good when it comes to heart issues. Mostly known for directing John McKay, he wrote this wonderful script of about three forty-four-year-old friends in a small town in England. All three professional women who were lucky with men created a ritual ladies' night-time gathering with gin, cheese, and sweets, which contained the infinite vibration of their data of misconduct or the need for their libido. Andie MacDowell, who has re-emerged around the British (which is where she seems to be the most radiant), is absolutely charming as the lady of the prestigious school that meets with a younger man. Little city gossip and disagreeable jealous buddies (large supportive cast) interfere with her relationship. Develop a series of brutal unfortunate events and show us many difficulties when one is looking for real happiness. Keep in mind that friendship is the main prerequisite for this film, and the end shows us exactly. This is a type of movie that you love or hate, so I think a lot of mix reviews and not the greatest success came out when this movie was released. I'm sure most of them are discovering a movie right now. I really liked this movie and I highly recommend to those who love such movies as "Love True" and "Three Weddings and Funeral". Not to mention soundtrack is to perfectly capture those important moments.
