I love newer episodes with CJ and my grandfather - I also liked the story with Kate falling for the head. I want to find out what happens to Rory and Kerry and Bridget and the family another. I think CJ is very fun and I love his scenes with my grandfather. I have always loved James Garner in everything he does, and it's his act that I never think of him as James Garner or Rockford in this series, and I absolutely believe him as Kate's father. This family is so real and fun. It was terribly sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessey died, but as in real life, these things happened and the way he was written in the series and solved was both funny and sad and always very sensitive and merciful. But in general a very fun show with lots of laughter and fun.
