The man in a white suit is one of those wonderful comedies that Ealingu did in the 40s and 50s so well. The story of this man follows a man who invented a substance that is neither dirty nor harmless. Of course this is a huge breakthrough in the textile world. Things are not that easy, however, as the canvas threatens the way of life of many people, including fabricists, fabric workers, and even an old lady who saves clothes every week. A man in a white suit is a film about scientific progress and the way it does not always help; as the old woman says at one point in the movie, "Why can not scientists just leave things alone?" Like many comedies, Ealing stars Sir Alec Guinness. Alec Guinness is a fantastic actor; he has the ability to illuminate the screen with his presence (and he does in this film, literally), but he can also portray his characters down into the ground and a credible way. In this film he is so scary and captures only the right atmosphere for his character; intelligent and ambitious but slightly naive scientist. Together with Guinness, the man in a white suit also features Joan Greenwood, a deep voice actress who played with Guinness in the simple "Kind Hearts and Coronets" and Michael Gough, a man who would continue to play Alfred in Batman movies. The film in the movie is not always great, but it's always decent and it's a movie. <br /> <br /> A man in a white suit is intelligent, thought provoking and funny comedy with moral. Comedy is not always obvious, and it always does not work, but the film is not intended as a movie that raises the belly of laughter, so it is forgiveness. I recommend this film, essentially for anyone who is a fan of movies.
