The most anticipated film of 2002. After three and a half years of hibernation, Rajini worked in this film. The mood for this movie was too high .. <br /> <br /> It's not a typical Rajini movie, it also gives some spiritual news in this movie. But it also includes typical Rajini action, style, songs, etc. It's a good fun movie and it gives good news as well. <br /> <br /> Rate this movie as a good place Excellent due to the script. It is necessary to watch the film. Do not overlook!
