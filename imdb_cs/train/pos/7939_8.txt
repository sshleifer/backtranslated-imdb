How nice to have a movie that the whole family can watch together. Josie Bissett and Rob Estes (who are married in real life) play a couple who marry in Las Vegas for a whim and then not only have to share messages with their children but then have to try to connect their homes (each with two boys and two girls) into a coherent family unit. What happens when a group that includes four teenagers, two daughters and two younger children initially exasperates whether Carrie and Jim can be real lucky. Fighting children (and one small love affair between two of them) causes someone to wonder if they can ever get. More interesting than Brady Bunch, what a really nice way to spend a few hours. Recommended as a good film for all ages.
