There is no way to confront "Zabriskie Point" with a rational viewpoint or try to describe it using words and conventions that you would use for other movies. It's because it's not a movie. It is the thought and feeling that filmmakers have some form that has become subject to secular as a film. What we see is not a plot of conspiracy, but rather a sequence of events that we do not see every day in movies, but we just imagine it happens as the background we pass on when we learn about a tragic event in news or friends. We see that it is our imagination of people who are abstraction for us - no one we know, but of course we have heard of them in books, television or somewhere. So what do we see? Events. We see people who are guessing, driving, and inevitably escaping. Only the escape is from something intangible - it is the collective situation and cruelty that the mass civilization allowed to exist even if laziness or ... human nature. Meanwhile, in the late 1960s Los Angeles, our players are acting against and responding to the self-injured suffering of modern existence. These creatures are really empty slate that can show any property that we can imagine if we wish. Although these steps could be considered criminal or irresponsible, the characters are not in themselves criminals. They are human beings who seek to return to a well-known, non-produced existence that is out of the ordinary they experience every day. Not that they would ever be happy or sad, but have achieved their own self-actualization as they move for the suicide of modern life. They only achieve real life in the natural world, even though it is another victim of modern existence. At the end, Zabriski Point is a pious story of humanist ties to the natural world. Because even the worst parts of the country are subject to our ideas of progress, we are losing our souls on the path to the death of the human spirit.
