Generally, it was a good film with an ideal ending; acting was spectacular and the characters did not get rid of their people. I liked it very much, even if you knew what was going on, it still gave the element of surprise throughout the movie. But I think it could be a bit longer (possibly spread) to the end - it seemed to be a bit hurt; as if the writer had tried to change the canvas before the rain fell. For example - What happened to Tristan's brother, Hayden? From what we know, he died in the hospital. Maybe he was the one who set the whole thing up! Who knows! Maybe the sequel? Maybe? If he's there ... I can not wait to see it.
