sammo must have 10 out of 10 for this movie because it has everything. great story, great fighting, great characters and great portraits. <br /> <br /> This movie sees that Dick Wei takes the billy chow and chong fat. sammo is back in the casino lau kar leung, sammo loses the fight, but what he is fighting is full of the high pace of actions and comedies he threw. Some great and touching moments in the movie, lam ching ying appear in a friend and kill - gutted. The final sequence draws you to rewind the button, as one of the best fights I've ever seen. Sammo picked up a bunch of boys and eventually ran to beating.
