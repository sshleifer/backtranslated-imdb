I think this movie is the best film about Mike Hammer, with the performance of Biffa Elliott's ultimate Mike Hammer. Harry Essex's screenplay is excellent and contains many improvements to the novel by Mickey Spillan. Its direction is strong and imaginative and gently uses light and shadow. Cameraman John Alton is top-notch, just like Franz Waxman. Cast includes many veterans as well as Peggie Castle in her unforgettable performance as Charlotte Manning. Overall, it's one of the best private eye films ever shot. Biff Elliott and Haary Essex had more opportunities. I have always appreciated this film.
