This film is like an allegory of the Gospel. It has such a direct sincerity and innocence that we can not believe it happened after the war when Italy was devastated and devastated and filled with a huge homeless and poor population. It is a monument of the best qualities of the human spirit, as well as the endless creative resources of this country of inspiration. <br /> <br /> This is a character like "Idiot" Doesthetic, the modern Christ, who finds himself in a big city. He is goodness and purity fortified by love, and his deeds change the people he meets, as well as the miraculous laborious dove. The story is narrated in a natural way and in a simple style, yet a little magical, which is almost a prelude to Fellini's surreal fantasies. It is one of the most inspirational, uplifting films ever made.
