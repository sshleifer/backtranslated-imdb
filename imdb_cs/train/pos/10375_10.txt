Country-boy Aussie-Rules (Mat) goes to the city at night before all important AFL test matches to be picked up by his cousin. And then things go wrong. His cousin, who is not threatening, has become a laugh in a drug deal that touched a local Trinity drug dealer (who looks like any gangster anywhere but is finally Australian). Needless to say that Mat is involved in chaos and it is not long before the thoughts of tomorrow's struggle shake on the back of his mind as the nightly furious events dissolve. Achieved Western Western professional Shakespearean actor Toby Malone promises to perform as a young naive country-boy Mat and successfully plays his role under his age. The best support comes from John Batchelor as Tiny and the funny role of David Ngoombujarry as one of the policemen who followed the events. Roll is a fast, often fun and very useful use of the clock.
