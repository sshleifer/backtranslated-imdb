"Albums of songs so old think they are new." This film has an unbeatable combination of tempo and mood that separated moments from the beginning. And why not? The rising talent of Lady Judith Dench as a widow who plays a saxophone with a street musician to help him get the songs right, Olympia Dukakis as a cheerful widow living in a Scottish mansion for many marriages, to Ian Holm as a drummer who loved all members of the Second World War all girls (more or less) swing bands. But wait, there's more. Add Leslie Caron to bass and unparalleled Clio Laine on vocal leader and finally Blonde Bombshells are the hottest band in the Beatles England. Okay, OK, not really, but this movie is the winner. Elizabeth (Dench) spends the whole movie and tries to connect Blonde Bombshells to play her granddaughter's school granddaughter. And before you start wiping your eyes, imagine how difficult and courageous it would be for a group of female sex marriages to stand on stage before the Britney Spears generation after an act called The Open Wound. the age when the actress's career ends when they are 30, the second album of the second band is the biggest compilation hits and the music older than a month has almost no chance to play, it's great to see real talent, real music and a really good movie coming from where else , BBC. I love this movie, and I know I will follow it many times, and enjoy it more every time.
