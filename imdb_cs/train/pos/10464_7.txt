For all those who do not speak Swedish: the Swedish [original] title of this film; "Rånarna" translates into something in a row of "robbers". This is the main problem I have with this movie because they are not rabbits at all. It's about a young woman working for the Swedish police who is investigating the robbery. You would think this would be a normal job, but the girl will soon take her to the field and take things into her own hands because the story goes, even shooting one of the robbers ... Exactly: We've seen it before. The fact that the soil is a rather interesting dessert really does not help because the end is the same as the cliché as the first two thirds of the film. What will save her from being just another mainstream movie is the fact that it is masterfully performed in all directions that the actors are so great they are and do not restrict and that the director really can keep it as exciting exciting as it is for most story. /> <br /> One thing I really loved about this movie is the fact that music sets the right mood if it is needed but is missing for the rest of the time, which gives a sense of reality to the shots and the persecution of cars has spread throughout the movie. Nice touch! The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the few Swedish actors who often come to the forefront suffers from the film because you know he will not play a hero boyfriend and that he is in the background, but it's something I have to neglect. Overall, it's a fun movie that steals more money than his time in your plot. 7/10
