****** WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ************** <br /> <br /> So who are these "Mysterious Men?" Simply put, Mystery Men is a group of sub-heroes who desperately try to live their teenage fantasy life while they are exposing both their true identity and their super identity. Shoveller (Bill Macy) works on the building during the day and leaves his wife and children at home as he travels across the street looking for crimes to deal with his unique and unique style of fighting against the shoulder blades. Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silver items to newlyweds daily and brings dinnerware at Villian plumbers at night if his mother does not keep up with the last snooping. Mr. Furious works at the junkyard to get a reward, then pulls his frustration at night and throws down poorly disguised friends of friends and enemies and threatens to really get angry. ?). Ben Stiller breathes such a life into this character, you can not help him but love him. These three spend their nights trying to capture the "moment of glory" they were dreaming of ... they become real Super Heroes. Obviously, this can happen. Champion City has Captain Amazing, after all ... a flying, super-fighting cop with enough business logos on the costume to stop another bullet or two. Greg Kinnear turns into stellar performance as a middle-aged salesman, trying to capture the attention of fans at the twilight of his career. <br /> <br /> To bring back this extra spell, which could get confirmation again, C.A. liberates Casanova Frankenstein, which is WAAAAAY over the pinnacle of the threat he played on the perishable perfection of Goeffrey Rush. This crazy genius created a "psychopractor" that freed Champion City from reflecting his own madness ... and eventually captured C.A. within hours after being released from prison. It leaves only the Mystery Men to stop Frankenstein's bad plan, but with such followers as Disco Boys, who protects Frankenstein, the trio will need little help. Recruitment begins and after a painful recruiting team, the team meets The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who initially has the only real talent in a team whose mystical sphere seems to be animated by the revengeful spirit of her dead father; An invisible boy (Kel Mitchell), who is seen as invisible when he looks at him ABSOLUTELY NOT; The spleen (Paul Reubens) gave the angry gypsy a mystical fluidity; and a very unused sphinx (Wes Studi), which is able to shoot weapons in half with his mind, then spends much of the rest of the movie cuddle the enemy puzzles and acts over-wise. <br /> <br /> This movie is really genre beyond the genre. Anyone who wants to play pigeon movies in narrow categories is fighting the loss of battle. It is a spoof / parody of the superhero genre - from pseudo-Burton sets that are infinitely recycled (and occasionally decorated with more spoof material) to meaningless costumes, the genre of comic books gets pretty good sending. But at the same time, he's a serious superhero. Both at once. While this is not necessarily a unique idea in itself (for example, this film is in some respects a reflection of D.C. Comic's Inferior Five short-term work), it is relatively innovative for a large screen. It offers a comic world that requires breaking the mistrust to accept it, and then throws into the inevitable taste - and we all know if superheroes are real, so these guys would be real. If Big Guy took off around New York, you'd see half a dozen news reports about idiots in linen that they should kick regularly. Sure, Shoveller is fighting pretty well, and Blue Raja hurls the fork with great precision - all parts of the super hero of the world. But what makes them real superheroes? Just in their minds. The film is also a comedy, although it is dark. It's inevitable when you try to point out the patent ridiculous nature of superheroes. Single-lady fly as comic geniuses on the stage throw away the numerous pieces from which they play. Particularly amazing is Janeane Garofalo's dialogue with his bowling corner / father. Yet it is not a comedy in the sense of laughing hips or eternally unforgettable jokes. It blends in a batch of drama, discovery, and romance, but never comes back to it. In fact, what the Mystery Men really do is finally a good movie that it's very engaging. Weak / poor poor boys are ultimately justifying, and in one glowing moment they really become superheroes; justice is served; and the movie ends with a scene that cracks realism (as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make a perfect disguise). If a viewer stops trying to mark a movie, the movie can be great. <br /> <br /> Of course, no movie is perfect. Claire Forlani looks bored and baffled as an interest in Mr Furious's love, even though she plays a key role as her conscience. Tom Waits seems to be somewhat confused by his own lines as the mad inventor of Dr. Heller, although his opening scenes, which are selected by the retired in a nursing home, are worth watching alone. And villians are never more than street shooters (the point that is created in the film). Cinematography is torn and disjointed (as is the case in the average comic book, so it's exciting), music sometimes overcomes scenery, and special effects are never quite well integrated with others. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is incredible. Probably you have to be a comedian fan and a superhero genre to really appreciate this movie, but it's a fun story and a good way to kill a few hours and let your brain rest. <br /> <br /> 8/10 in my opinion.
