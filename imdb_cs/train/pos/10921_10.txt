After reading a lot of good reviews about this movie, I decided to take it (I bought it on a DVD, hence the "spin" game ... I'm a dork). The beginning was everything I was hoping for, the perfect setting (along with some of the quotes I heard about the various Wu-Tang albums) about what a good movie should be. But the plot I heard was so great that it was so predictable. Every time I see the character (except the lizard), I think which Venom was. In addition, the only cold character is lost in the center of the film. Ok, so the plot was not very good, but at least there was some good kung-fu? Poorly. The fight was very short and far and away. Since the different styles were pretty nice, I wish the matches were longer. I was still hoping to see Lizard running and doing some crazy ish on the walls, but it never happened. I was hoping to see a centipede to make a quick towel, but it never happened. I was hoping to see the Scorpion in the movie in more than 7 minutes, but it never happened. In short, there will not be much. The fight is quite routine. Do not be fooled just because this movie has a conspiracy does not mean it's good.
