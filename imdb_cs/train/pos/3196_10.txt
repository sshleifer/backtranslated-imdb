This movie is amazing for several reasons. Harris received an extremely unpleasant document and turned it into a relevant social commentary. Groovin 'Gary is a small bourgeois boy who is (supposedly) very popular for his many pretentious ideas. When he decides to play Olivia Newton John in a local talent show (for which he is very passionate), Gary's actions show that he is inconsistent with the conservative social environment in which he lives. This leads to different justifications for their actions, so people will not think that they are in fact a transvestite or other such social excluded. In the second installment Harris uses the fight between Gary and Beaver in a modern attempt to provoke the narrative from the original document. The third and final installment of the trilogy is really amazing for Harris's extreme sensitivity on the subject. Unlike the second installment, "The Orkly Kid" shows that Gary is really a wanderer. He tries to get in his own community without success. His secret passion for dressing, like Olivia Newton John, separates him from the people who consider him socially excluded. The film is so realistic that it is subject to many reactions, just like reality. Surely Gary is seen as a ridiculously pathetic nature, but he can also identify himself as outcast.
