Sentinel I hoped it would be a good movie and a boy that I was right. A big story, especially from the novel, and I thought it was an original story, but I think it was not and it was a very smart story. Michael Douglas in this movie is very good and Keither Sutherland is too, but it's hard to shake him off Jack Bauer's role at the age of 24, but in the end you do it, and he's very different in The Sentinel than he is in 24.Also another guy was trying to lose his television role, but failed. Eva Longeria. She was not that good in the movie and had a backseat in the whole thing. After watching the movie, I had constant dreams of Sentinel and could not sleep. Overal Sentinel is a good movie and I would recommend it.
