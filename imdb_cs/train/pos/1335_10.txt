After the story of love triangle in Har Dil Jo Pyaar Karega, these 3 stars were re-elected in this controversial film. The film would be considered a hit if there was no dispute over production value from the Bharat Shah. Here director duo Abbas-Mustan has made a very different and unique work compared to their previous and overhead projects. They are considered a thriller producer Bollywood. But in this CCCC they have proved they can recognize the romantic family drama. As soon as there was only one action scene when Salom's knee was raped in the apartment, Salman hit him. The film has almost all the standards and ingredients, such as song, story, casting, performances, etc. that are necessary for filming a movie. But of course, for Salman's fanfare, it was something of a surprising gift from him. Why? Because he played a role for so long, where he had the scene to show his open body and dance la la la laugh all around. His role as a wealthy young entrepreneur who has a senseless character and a normal attitude is really impressive. After all, Madhubale is a prostitute played by Preity, amazing. Later, when they are aware of their lives, they deserve the proper attention. Her facial expressions and body language become more attractive and focus mainly on her. Her previous role as a pregnant woman in Kya Kehna was not as harsh as she is here. Of course, this can be described as an improvement. Then Priya, the very innocent and powerless wife of Raj, who only cares for a better result. It has no effect in the story, because the main ingredients are in the hands of Preity. Finally, the main story is rare and unique in itself. In the real world of this age, it is not entirely impossible to find a substitute mother. Maybe, many are happening in this great world where these are secret. In this way, the screenwriter CCCC revealed the hidden truth that takes place in other everyday lives. But it's still a doubt.
