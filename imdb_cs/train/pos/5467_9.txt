In my opinion, it must be one of Barbara Stanwyck's best performances. It was one of the few heroes, then and now, who could say more with a single glance than with the whole of the dialogue. And I was lucky to see the original and unencented film with another 4 minutes of other shots. It's a shame that the movie is so short. Lily is a young woman who barely holds her and works for her father in his illicit recognition. Her only link is her good friend, Chico, played great by Theresa Harris. Although Chico is an African American (and having a white woman who is the best friend with a black woman in the 1930s was as controversial as the subject of this film) and Lily is not, they have a special bond. And that's not sexual. Only two women were stuck or pushed into a situation beyond their control. After Lily dies and she does not know what to do, she tells her she has the power to get out and get what she wants. Yes, it's immoral, but that's the whole point of this movie. Then "they" had to go and destroy the last few minutes. So, until the last few minutes of the movie, it's a great movie and it's worth watching. The "Hour" of the film is as valid today as I am, and I'm sure it will be 100 years. Women, it's terrible what Lily does to get what she wants, but it works. Men, note.
