Then I watched the movies ... I thought, "Why the hell was this movie such a big success in Korean boxing?" He even thought the film had a clever / unusual script that the acting was not so good and the characters were not very interesting. For Korean film ... I liked battle scenes. If you want to watch the movie without thinking, it's the movie for you. But I have to admit that the film was a little childish ... 6/10
