MELTING MAN ... tragic victim of a space race, he died MELTING ... he never understood that the race was long! ... <br /> <br /> The man (Burr DeBenning) burns his kitchen cook. But instead of something shouting something normal, it will scream something that says "AAAAATCH-KAH !!" This movie you've discovered ... is not a normal movie. You've just made your first move to THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN, the famous late 70's film that features the great makeup effects of Rika Baker. Baker was just on the edge when he became superstar and did it at the same time as his famous "Cantina Extraterrestrials" in STAR WARS. For some special reason, STAR WARS became a household name and INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN did not. <br /> <br /> It might have something to do with the fact that this movie is just terribly haunted. From the initial credits ("Alexa Rebara plays as INVESTMENT MELTING MAN" ... This is what he says!), Crazy sister passing through the glass door, to the fishing head passing over the waterfall and broken graphically separated on some stones, this film provides many , many moments of utter incomprehension. "Why ... but how can it be ... why are they ...?" After a while, you are wasting your thoughts about why and watching how it is - it's a very fun piece of garbage. The astronaut returns to Earth in a molten, radioactive state; he escapes, and his mind disintegrating just like his body, starts a mad melting killing explosion. The authorities quickly decide that the melting man must be stopped but (he probably does not want to "panic") wants to be captured in the quietest way. So they send him a guy with a geiger counter. Wow. <br /> <br /> Storywise, surprisingly little will happen during the movie. The melting fellow is pulling around killing people. The doctor looks for it with a geiger counter. Introducing different characters, asking questions and leaving. The doctor will eventually grab a melting man but under no circumstances will the security guard shoot after explaining that he is "Dr. Ted Nelson." The melting man stretches and eventually dissolves into a large pool. End. <br /> <br /> It's so helpless that it will end with a lot of fun, despite a rather endless ending. It is assumed that a widescreen DVD release is planned. Very special movie.
