Indian Summer is a warm, multi-character movie that would be a fine afternoon movie (with a little editing). The film begins with a group of children who have turned out to be a lot of people who, before completing the cuts to the present, perfectly set the tone when a group of adults from the "golden age" of the camp is invited back to spend weeks of leave at the camp head, Uncle Lou. The film then lets the viewer spend time with these characters because they remember their times in the camp and create new memories in their latest stay. The film deals in a great way with its characters in this amazing environment and allows them to develop without having to worry about the plot. Watching these people remembers, and their relationship to each other is what the film is about and what it works for. Never exceeds the peak and melodrama, always maintaining its warmth, charm and realism. I have never seen a movie where nostalgia is captured so well, and I found myself attracted, although I was never in one of these camps as a child myself. <br /> <br /> For a warm, nostalgic character movie, I sincerely recommend.
