I was surprised that "The Secret Fury" was a nice good movie ...... Probably because I had no hope for this movie ..... Though the movie has holes ..... I would say that you could not guess who was behind the whole scheme until the very end of the film .... First I thought it was Robert Ryan, who uses the same method as '' Gaslight '' where his husband tries to mad his wife crazy, but I was wrong ...... The main problem with the film is that it is heading in a completely different direction, which did not notice any traces in the beginning. ..... I thought Robert Ryan & Claudette Colbert wore his parts well ...... Plus, Vivian Vance, a fine figure actress who steals scenes in this ...... Those who like movies that guess you, you will like it ......
