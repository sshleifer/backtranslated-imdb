WHITE FIRE was recommended by a guy who owns him on two separate DVD releases and VHS. He claimed to be one of the most entertaining and the best low-budget shareholders he ever did. Generally, I'm not looking at movies that know it's going to be bad, but for this action I've made an exception ... and I was very happy to have done it. with the action (mostly surprisingly, graphically with horror) modestly (isolated to naked with a key female character, but it is so much in one scene that it becomes jolly) and a horribly unpleasant dialogue that all adds laughter - (Gunty), unusual Star EXTERMINATOR (and countless other low-budget action tournaments) is fun at the head and gives the best performance he can collect. Williamson is better than usual, he can handle it with unparalleled joy (and will not come in half). The rest of the cast is also fun to watch, especially villains, one of which is a sadistic sexpot that speaks with an accent that looks like a mish-slur in Spanish and Italian. It's invaluable. <br /> <br /> I can not emphasize enough how horrible it is. It's not so bloody that it's a nausea, but it's unusually violent in parts with some mass bumps that emerge in the shootout and has an exhausting, agonizing sequence that no one will soon forget. Also, when Ginty is shrouded by a bunch of bad guys, he gets comfortably in the chain saw and the splash moments that follow will have any and all action fans encouraging and spilling their beer. Do not miss WHITE FIRE. It's a swing - if it's silly stupid - action classics.
