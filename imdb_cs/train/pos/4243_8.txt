Gordon Parks, the fertile black photographer of Life magazine, has created a truly silent film bomb time that is not here! Based on the real story of two NYC policemen - later called Batman and Robin - who once used radical tactics to clean up their drug ranks, it's a film friend before this term became a repeating pattern. He has come close, there is no unimportant scene. <br /> <br /> Man in the early 1970s had to be a NYC terrible place to be a policeman, like movies like "Serpico". These two cops begin as newcomers who divide security and hand out dealers in casual clothing in their spare time. But instead of being applauded by the City Police Department, they have nothing to do with resentment and contradiction from their peers. They have to go through a dump of field and legal corruption, mischievous tasks to prevent their work on the streets, merciless drug kings, and an unfortunate ghetto. David Selby and Ron Leibman are fantastic leaders; part of the entertainment follows Leibman's eyes, spreading crazy in every scene in what is a flawless comic show, and Selby's acting is low-level and smart. These two do all the comedic aspects of storytelling - showing tangible frustration mixed with courageous determination. Director Parks, who was already known for covering his controversial themes in his photo, did not shy away from the roughness of the story. The film is rather uncompromising in showing the toughness of police and street criminals that these two men inhabit. Adding this realism is the fact that real Hantz and Greenberg acted as technical film advisers and even appear in surrealistic roles like two college officers who mock the protagonists. It's a true homage to the effectiveness of the park's direction that it can perfectly balance this depressing milo with a clear comedy. Why is MGM / UA like sitting on the shelf for 30 years - hardly giving it a home video or DVD release in the US? It's a small masterpiece of the 1970s.
