I loved it very much, because it was the same, the girl who is on her sixteenth birthday, finds out she is a witch and she lives with her aunt in the house and they are both witches. It took her a couple of weeks to get used to it. When she first used her powers she was so funny because she turned her enemy into a pineapple. He has to return time and repeat the day. This series is really cool and it's a typical teenage series, but she was thin when she moved from her house and into the apartment with her fellow buddies and then it was bored and I stopped watching. I loved her aunt's been so fun and the other was really ditzy. I loved Valerie and I hated Sabrina's enemy Libby for being ugly.
