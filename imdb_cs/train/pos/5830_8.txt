Boys work outside the recording studio when they hear the "voice of an angel". That would be Miss Van Doren if she appeared in a tender and was under the name of Miss Andrews because her father does not approve of being a "singer". However, she hopes that a big wig, Mrs. Bixby, her father's friend, will hire her and then have to give her consent. She leaves, but in a few minutes the boys are running amok in the studio causing confusion and other musicians to kill them after they destroy the recording. Eventually things will calm down. "If we avoided them," says Moe. "Yeah, we got out too," Curly said. The boys then spooked in the studio and put Miss Van Doren in the record, and Curly puts on a woman's dress and pretends to sing. Mrs. Bixby enters, is stunned and hires "Seniorita Cucacha" on site! For another $ 500 she asked her to come and sing at a high party party. The rest, as they say, is history because Curly pretends to be an opera singer with some funny results. By the way, it is accompanied by "Senior Mucho" and "Senior Gusto." What's going on at the party is that the truth wins, but before a couple of bastards come along. Overall, it's a pretty good episode. I liked it, but I would not have liked it as something special.
