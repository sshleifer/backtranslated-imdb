"Mother" tells of a recently widowed mother of two adult children (Reid), who at the end of her husband's death wakes up from a life of sleepy life because she has a relationship with a young carpenter who is also her daughter's married lover. The film deals with the silence of a passive mother, her clumsy relationship with a sophisticated son and daughter, silent needs that she tries to calm down in bed with her young lover and the consequences that come from her. Somewhat antiseptic drama with disruptive psychodramatics underwear, "Mother", does a great job in realistically dealing with uncomfortable issues, while avoiding unimaginable sensation. It will play best with a mature audience, or with women who can better get to the central position, their needs and questions. (B +)
