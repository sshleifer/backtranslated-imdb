Film designed for the current audience. The masses see what they want to see. Action, comedy, drama and, of course, also sensual scenes. This is not a movie that would feel comfortable with the whole family. It's not for children's eyes. I had to move a lot of scenes quickly. If it's just the fun you're looking for, then this movie has everything. Tracks are catchy. Rich production, I have to deliver. <br /> <br /> The film's message is not universal. Emphasizes the idea of ​​karma. This means that if you do good, you will get well. And when you do evil, you get evil. The fruit of good deeds is good, while the fruit of evil is evil. <br /> <br /> In real life it's not always true. It is well known that most people do not have justice in this world. While it is true that some evil people meet a bad end, there are many who escape. And then there are plenty of people who do good, and yet in return they meet a frosty end. If you do not care about the message and all you want is a leak from world reality, this movie is a funner.
