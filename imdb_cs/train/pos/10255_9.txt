This film is the first of six infamous guitar films and is one of the best. At the same time it looks realistic and unrealistic, just to know that the movie is fake. The story concerns a woman who was captured and tortured in many different ways. The man at the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address and contains a manga video showing torture. The men who capture it test human borders before they die. Some scenes are shocking like the eye scene and the others are not shocking as a girl that is punched 100 times because you can see blows in almost every movie. This movie has a lot of gore, so I would recommend it to people 17 or older. <br /> <br /> 9/10
