The fact that this movie was filmed on DVD is still formatted - on television and with fuzzy picture it really bothered a lot of movie purists ... and right. It deserves much better treatment. The story is about a street artist who needs a son to hand over his craft (the rules of the day) and welcomes a place with a little girl (not a conventional ...) and the problems that arise next. The old man bought the child in the slave auction and soon find out that the boy is not a boy, which of course he thought was the case. The old man "Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu) is a bit funny look with a missing front tooth and an infectious smile Little girl" Doggie "(Zhou Renying) is a cat, the rest of the story is how it can do two a bit kidnapped in the last 15 minutes. br /> <br /> Overall, this is a story full of drama, tension, humor, and sadness, DVDs until it wakes up on a wide screen.
