Wow! All I can say is that if Elizabeth Montgomery is an enemy (speaks Russian), then I give up right now. In her short skirt, high-heeled boots and distinctive bust lines, she's a real babe, even though she's something like a zombie like an eye shadow. These 30 minutes are undoubtedly the seamless of the series. Notice a realistic and revealing match match with Bronson, until it is irritating to his chin, destroying all the fun. Well, I should probably leave my hormonal response. This is a very well-produced half-hour of this undervalued power behind the success of Buck Houghton. Of course, producers want to take the third season with an above-average entry. It's post nuclear nuclear holocaust America (we know it's part of the invasion force) and only the American Bronson and Soviet Montgomery are left with about twenty tons of realistic wrecks. They are going through destruction in alternating moods, and we are thinking how long it will take for biology to become a political one, which of course does (happiness Bronson). And that's about it. No real talk, except what Bronson has to say, which is quite exaggerated. However, the screenplay is still fun and somewhat courageous for its time, and even suggests that not all Russian women look like lorry drivers (the popular cold war stereotype of that time). rather curious that the very Slavic Bronson (Buchin) will be occupied as an American and shiny search engineer for Montgomery as a Slovan. Appearance should be the opposite. My guess is that the producers did not want to throw the American into the physically weaker role of a woman, regardless of the circumstances. However, it may be, is little of the usual fear or atmosphere of the TZ, the episode remains very, very observable for 30 minutes.
