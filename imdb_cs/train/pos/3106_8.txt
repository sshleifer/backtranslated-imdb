I have not seen movies before (and was unable to build up Matt Damon), I was reluctant to visit The Bourne Ultimatum when they asked us to see it for AS Film Studies. <br /> <br /> But I was pleasantly surprised that a movie with Damon might be nice. <br /> <br /> Fast combat scenes, crazy biking and BIG blasts were what threw you out of your seat at TBU. Close outages between the CIA and Bourne have kept you busy. But a few things really cut me off. <br /> <br /> First, the fact that the movie was just the series Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence was repeated and eventually it was boring. Although Damon kept us entertained, and seemed to be one step ahead of the CIA, I got a bit of annoyed Bournema's constant existence. He crashed the car and jumped as if he knocked him or something! Very unrealistic. And secondly (inevitably) - SHAKY CAMERA. It was so awful that it was quite noticeable and it made me and everyone who went to see it in my classroom (even the teachers) of the sea. The creators told us that if we ever used it in a movie we did in the classroom, it would be a bad thing and we would be told to use a tripod. It's good enough if Greengrass wanted it to look like we were there when we were looking at Damon and Stiles who had an interview, but we would not have sinned our heads, but everything at TBU is a nice movie and worth watching . But I did not think it was the best film of the year, even if it's a fun cinematic film. 8/10.
