I recently bought a very underestimated Dreamcast and went to town to find some games that will use them. I bought Soul Calibur (classic) and then I crossed the Resident Evil Code Veronica area. I have Resident Evil 1 & 2 and played Res Evil 3 numerous occasions and I was moved by all of them, especially No.1, which has to go down in history has a classic. <br /> <br /> But none of them will ever come close to trying out the dream movie Brilliant Gory Gameplay. If it's just about buying a dream for this game, it's worth every moment of my time and effort, I've never been so enchanted in the computer game as it's been fascinated by me. , the story continues from the second story in which Claire Redfield is looking for his brother (Chris - from the first story) who is considered to be missing under the auspices of a dreaded umbrella company. You do not like this company, except you've destroyed it three times in previous reports. So, helping Claire, with the assistant super brother Steve, has to unlock the truth of your brother's real placement. The second CD lets you control Chris, that is, if you manage to get that far without exhausting the fear of the room. Control is very neat and the movement of the characters is very realistic when the character points to the danger, it stands in the direction from which it comes. PURE GENIUS !! <br /> <br /> Overall, I gave this game 10/10 as it is simply a game of the year, the game of decades and the best game in the world. Please purchase this game as soon as possible.
