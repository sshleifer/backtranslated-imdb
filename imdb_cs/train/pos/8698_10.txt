He has seen this film on its release and has since appreciated it. What a wonderful group of actors (I always think casting is one of the most exciting aspects of the film). He really enjoyed acting actress Jacqueline Bisset in this role, and Wallace Shawn is always a horn. The script is smart, cunning and frantic on the face, jumping almost to everything "Beverley Hills". He loved "the doctor" Paul Bartel and the servant Ray Sharkey. It was nasty and crude, but thank God! If you are not proud, I cordially recommend this movie. FYI for anyone who likes to play Kevin Bacon, Mary Woron and Paul Bartel in six degrees was at Rock & Roll High School. Mary Woronov and Robert Beltran were comet nights together. All three were in "Eat Raoul".
