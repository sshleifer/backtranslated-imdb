This film chronicles the life and times of William Castle. During the fifties and sixties of the last century, he made a number of low-budget horror films he sold with tricks. In the movie "13 Spirits" you need viewers to see spirits (they were in color, the movie was black and white). "The Tingler" had theater seats equipped with a buzzer that shook the audience when the monster fell into the cinema. "Marabre" gave life insurance to all members if they were scared to death! The movies themselves were pretty bad, but the tricks had people rushing to see them. In this documentary are interviews with directors inspired by the castle, actors in the movies and his daughter. He also gets into his own home life and the kind of person he was (he was probably a great man). The documentary is loving, very entertaining and totally boring. It's very short (in 90 minutes) and it's never boring. It must be seen for the fans of castles and fans of horror films. My only complaint - only a few sequences were visible from his pictures. That's great.
