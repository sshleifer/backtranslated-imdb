Despite the patronage of George Lucas, this captivating and totally original fantasy in "Lumage" (a combination of animation via live action slots) is so far away from the usual child fare as something Ralph Bakshi did in his bloom. Brilliantly conceived characters, such as Ralph (one of the duel of smelly, rejected heroes), Synonamess Botch and Rod Rescueman (a pompous novice superhero) breathe life into a uniquely clever concept: Frivoli vs. Murkwood or an eternal struggle between dreams and nightmares. In this context, the melodic tracks on the soundtrack should not work, but somehow they do it. Is it really a pity that I had to watch over the really bad looking boots (reversed from television screening) unencrypted versions? there is also a milder variant that tones the language for its release of VHS? because the movie is otherwise inaccessible to DVD. Interestingly, both Henry Selick and David Fincher are working on this picture in subordinate abilities.
