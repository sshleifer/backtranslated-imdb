I saw this movie the first second T.R. took me on a journey - well, I did not like at the beginning of large glued inches, but the absurd humor and look stupid blind both actors - do not know who she played the young - but it was great and so was uma !!! - the other two people who were in the cinema appeared in about half an hour, I was with a friend - and it's always a test to watch a movie that I like one of my friends - and we both enjoyed the most - laughter - sadness "realistic police standards". both fans of the books T.Robbinse ... I found it well - I thought that Robbins also approve, although I have no idea whether the film like it or not ... <br /> <br /> I'd like to see it what was cut - I heard that sand Gus v. had to pull a bunch of scenes for audience for the first time (or producers), and yet it's an art film. but too short ... it's one of my favorite times - and I am aware that most people can not stand in this film, and assumes that people who use these movies are what you think .... ...what a shame. I hope the day will come when the full DVD material - I hope you will see more crispy, Keane - expect to see her child and all <br /> <br /> if you see it, think twice and enjoy it if you decide to follow ... m
