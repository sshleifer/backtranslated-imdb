I have to say, seventeen and missing is much better than I expected. The perception I made from the thumbnails was that it would be just funny, but I was pleasantly surprised by this impressive mystery. Dedee Pfeiffer is Emilie, mother insisting on her daughter Lori (Tegan Moss) does not take part in the so-called promo conference one night a week, but Lori ignores her mother's wishes and goes out to party. When Lori does not return home, Emily knows there is something wrong with her daughter's visions and the events that led to her disappearance. Seventeen and missing are better than so many other television films of this type because it is not so predictable. Pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie, and most of it is believable. This LMN Original movie premiered last night. 10/10
