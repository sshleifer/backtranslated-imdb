College friends Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel declare war for their classmates and plan a terrible attack on high school. Once the deadly countdown begins to the last vengeance, they both begin a video clip to explain their feelings and crown their mission. There is another similar movie called "Elephant". Why will I bring it? Compare two movies of course. I have to say that even though I liked "Elephant," it's a much better movie. What's the difference, you ask? Well, for beginners, it's shot differently, like "Cloverfield", "Blair Witch Project" and "The Diary of the Dead". It makes the movie better, because it is much more painfully realistic. But what won me was how the film was willing to show "the other side of the story". You know these two shooters, unlike the "Elephant". Actually, I took care of one of the shooters and understood their actions and why they did what they did. This movie really feels sympathetic to these people, and that's a good thing because it's not always black and white. To be honest, that's why I almost screamed in this movie. Characters are real human beings with logic and reason for their actions. You understand them. It's not like they want to kill people for attention. Overall, this film is emotionally gripping and very scary and much better than the "Elephant".
