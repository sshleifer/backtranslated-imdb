As I said above, four stars are simply not enough. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen in almost 17 years of life. For people who do not really like or do not understand it, you may not have a real appreciation for art, or you may have a short attention. Even though I did not see all his films, I would have to say that this is Spielberg at its peak. It's quite sad to see movies as big as "Purple Color" do not come too often because I think we're all in dire need of first-rate movie entertainment in these difficult times. <br /> <b> Movies like this are more than just movies; they are works of art that need to be appreciated more. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​being nominated for 11 Oscars (even the best picture of the year) and not getting one trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid Hollywood can ever be. Spielberg has not even been nominated for Best Director! It should be considered that they won the Oscars this year. The film clearly shows how unfair life is for some people.
