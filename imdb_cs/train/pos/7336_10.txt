This is another popular fantasy by Ralph Bakshi; after watching on YouTube it is. Built in a distant past after the Ice Age, it is a prehistoric sword-and-witch search between good and evil. Nekron, Lord of the Empire of Led and his mother, Queen Julian, focused on the conquest of the known world. When their glaciers destroy the village of a man named Larn, he (Larn) promises to avenge his people and kill the Ice Lord. Meanwhile, the Necron and Julian underworld guides capture the sad daughter of King Jarol's Princess Teegra; but he can escape and eventually meet Larn, who promises to escort her back to Firekeep; if people did not reach it first. <br /> <br /> This movie made a very small cash register (like most Ralph Bakshi films), but it became classical culture, partly due to the quality of art, collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and the famous fantastic artist Frank Frazett. I also heard that the script was written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas, the two men who made Conan's comic stories, and the painters in the background included James Gurney, the illustrator of the Dinotopia novels; although I have never read Conan or Dinotopia. And also the painter Thomas Kinkade, known for his figurative drawings, the music boxes for The Bradford Exchange Company next to the painting. And like Bakshi's films Lord of the Rings and American Pop, this film was roto-skosen, but this process works better in this movie than in the first. <br /> <br /> So, overall, I think it's one of the best animated fantasy movies ever made and the amazing collaboration of two big brains - Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazett. With lots of fantasy, sexual cues and exciting adventures.
