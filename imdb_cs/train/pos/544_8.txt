I loved this movie. It was almost the same as the first (cabin near the lake), but killing women also kills men. And the scenes are much more interesting, 2 of my favorite scenes are mainly when Stanley and Allison are in a dance club and describe Kimberly's last minute before being thrown into the water. And secondly, when Stanley visits Allison in his basement, just before they set out for a set when he kisses him. Those scenes, for me, were very intense and riveting. I gave the film a rating of 8/10, not because the film was bad, but because filming was bad, I think there were times when you notice that nothing is wrong, as if it was filmed the way the film is usually shot, you do not see the "live" camera shooting, but then, very little, you would notice film mistakes. what's wrong?
