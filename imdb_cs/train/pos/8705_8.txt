Despite the title, the sword wearer and the DVD cover (The Sword Bearer) is not a superhero. (Minor Spoilers) Follows the story of Sasha, The Sword The Bearer, who is cursed with a retractable sword in his forearm. You say cool, but no, that's real life. If you had this power as a child, you could control it when you say it's a crazy man or when your crazy boyfriend beats her. And if you do not control it, how do you deal with being a killer at the age of 12? Basically, that's where Sasha is when we meet him. After another killing, he walks painlessly (like A Bout de Souffl√©). Then she meets Katya and the couple immediately falls in love and gives Saso a real reason to live and try to change his ways. However, his past is still chasing him in the form of two policemen. This is basically a story, and there is practically no action on the screen, though a lot if suggested. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Unlike many "super heroes" in Hollywood, we have a very small story, there is no bad guy (unless you count the swordsman himself), there is plenty of heart and good character development. <br /> <br /> It's worth it if you find it.
