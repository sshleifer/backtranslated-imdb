This is a very dark, hard, even brutal, film about the break of death that is going wrong. It's black and white photographs that keep her from dating. Mickey Rooney is excellent as a twisted, yet oddly appealing head start. One of the first films to represent a psychological devastation of death. This is also quite irritating.
