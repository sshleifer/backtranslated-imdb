This film is not just about school shooting, he has never really seen it. But it only contributes to the strength that this film has. It's about people and how they deal with the tragedy. I know it was shown to students who survived the Columbine shoot and it gave a sense of closure to many of them. The game is great. All three major actors (Busy Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) are excellent in their roles ... I highly recommend this movie to anyone. It's one of those movies that will tell you about it when you see it. It challenges not only school shootings, but also human emotions and responses to all forms of tragedy. It's a tear, but it's worth it and I'll watch once again and again
