As a community theater actor who works hard but does not take too seriously, I am always amused by those who consider it a great art. This film trades mercilessly "the actor craft" while many good laughs are melting. The hammer actor in place for the movie has a similarity to the dictator. When a dictator dies of heart attacks from too many beverages and food, the actor is abducted and forced to play a "part of life" by a neo-Nazi secret service chief. He plays it on the handle, gets a girlfriend of the dictator to fall in love with him and vice versa, and turns the tables to his kidnappers. Lots of great pike leaders, a lot of good work by some unknown supporting actors, especially housekeepers and two palace guard members, and many fun little portraits. Sammy Davis Jr. gives light to himself, Jonathan Winters plays an American merchant with an unpleasant effect, and something else is happening, and Raul Julia, Sonia Braga and Richard Dreyfuss in particular are exceptional. <br /> <br /> But he has a lot of beautiful places (in Brazil), humorous screenplay and good actors do their thing and they look like they really have fun and do not go through the usual existential desire for what plays only playing!
