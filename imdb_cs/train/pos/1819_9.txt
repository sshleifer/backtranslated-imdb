When I first watched it, a year ago we borrowed it from the local library and watched her three times. We just watched it and I liked it more than I did the last time I watched it! :) :() The film is mostly about two dogs called Charlie and Itchy (expressed Dom DeLuise and I love Dom DeLuise!). Charlie is half the gangster and a half good, which I like. Heart is his helper. Charlie is killed by his friend (NOT) and sent to heaven. When Charlie returns to life, it's the beginning of a wonderful adventure. The five main reasons why I am absolutely CRAZY about this movie: One: I like characters (except Carface). My favorite three are Charlie, Heart, and a little girl named Anne-Marie, who comes a little later. Two: I love the period of history in which this film is set. It is set during a ban in the United States. Three: Animation Don Bluth (as usual) is excellent. Backgrounds are also good. Four: This movie is a strange excitement that holds me on the edge of my seat. Five: The songs in this are beautiful. My favorite song begins with "I need Brazil, crazy, excitement" ... <br /> <br /> So watch this beautiful movie when you can, you will not be disappointed! :);) :()
