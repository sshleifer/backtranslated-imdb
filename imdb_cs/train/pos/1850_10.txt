This is my favorite movie EVER. I've seen it at least ten times and cry every time. My family begs me not to look at it, so I'm not crying. I think I like it to be a true story written by Antwon himself, just like the movie. Actor acting is top performing and actors are perfect for their role. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But this is my favorite movie he has done so far. I took care of a little boy who was also born in jail. He was the dearest boy I've ever met. He was now adopted by an amazing family who fought for him for nearly two years. I saw this movie as the fight continued and its future was uncertain and I was so happy to be safe and beloved. And I'm so happy Antwone is happy and found his family. I'd like to know more about him and how it was since meeting his family. I just can not say enough good things about it!
