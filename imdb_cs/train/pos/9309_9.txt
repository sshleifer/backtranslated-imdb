Dear God, where I start. this is not a bar the best movie I've ever seen. cameras are amazing, but in my opinion, acting was the best. why scriptwriters for this film are not writing big budget films that I never understand. another is cast. that's great. that's best now that the film is there. I know some of you are probably thinking "in no way has a lot better" but your bad ones. raptor island is a work of art. I hope he should have the best movie of the year best, instead of this crash film Crash with a lot of names and no predators. I believe this movie is really the most beautiful thing EVER.
