Big actors, oscar nominated actress, stunning scenery, good strong story line and more laughter before you can into my new handbag (and that's quite big). This movie was great. It was a beautiful act in more serious scenes and funny moments. .well, side splitting. I have never heard the viewer's laugh so laughing, and tears flowing down my cheeks during the scene of "stoned teas in the tea room." Good work by the British film industry and Craig Ferguson, whose magical ingredients make sure it's one of my favorite movies of the year, if not always.
