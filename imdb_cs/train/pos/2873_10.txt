This is, in my opinion, one of Disney's top five animated features. Cinderella was the perfect return to the feature-length animation film (as opposed to compilation films of the 1940s) and the dear depth through the multi-level camera returns to the film differently. Although Disney adapts the story a little liberally, you gather the idea of ​​the era through the dress and set the stylization - the clear time the story unfolds. Cinderella is more advanced than Snow White and a multi-dimensional character. In fact, all the characters are somewhat well developed, with the exception of the prince - the farthest left - we know he has a sense of humor and a great smile, but it's all. Like Snow White, Disney has some lasting impact on the story of popular culture --- in most versions Cinderella are passionate appetizers, they are just not as pretty as Cinderella and their character is diverted from their otherwise handsome appearance. > <br /> Favorite Disney Accessories: Mouse! She also realized continuity - Cinderella is still losing the shoe in the whole movie. Adding homemade dresses, as well as violent attacks from the stepists, was always terrifying as a baby - I remember View Master showing it with a black background and a big red light on it! Broken slippers show Lady Tremaine's unwillingness to surrender to Cinderella and admit defeat - Audley would go on to characterize the most wicked of all Disney, Satan's witch Maleficent, in Sleeping Beauty.
