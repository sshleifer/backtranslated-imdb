Hey, guys, what's up. I'm a man, one and only Mike "Sonny Sakura KIller" Kelly. You know that ... you can not really write a review of the Sakura scenario because we did not have it. As far as I know, the story was just made when we went together. I had the best time of my life shooting a movie and I got so much afraid that I had escaped from Jism ... fun times. I'm glad you all loved the movie. I did not really make the matches I imagined. Every time I set some moves, the fighter is still altering. Still, I had a blast and met some really great people. A particularly purple female Ninja who seems to have fallen on a movie scene.
