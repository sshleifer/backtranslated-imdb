I grew up in southwest Virginia; I'm about the same age (or perhaps a year older than) Homer Hickam, author of "The Rocket Boys," a book that is the true story of this heart-warming film. <br /> <br /> And so I was closely related to the coal mining issue in West Virginia and the amazing effect that Sputnik had at that time (October 4, 1957) on us all. Rocket Boys continued to do great lives for himself. I started my diploma in physics and computer engineering. All this because Sputnik awakened a lot of young people to the "Science gap" that USSR had in the US in those days of the Cold War ... <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful film for all, of all ages. But if you grew up in West Virginia in the late 1950s, it touches the core of your being. <br /> <br /> Everyone: Get it; Bach; recommend it to your friends ... who will thank you many times.
