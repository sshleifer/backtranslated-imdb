Sure it was well shot and made, very well shot and made! But the story was so weak. And the display of Lincoln was even weaker. Not that Henry Fonda was not good, but the character he played was nothing but sadness. You tell me that Lincoln is a wicked asshole, regardless of law or court. I mean, who the hell should it be? Cousin Vinnie? I mean, come on, "I'll call you Jackass" ???? I understand that Ford is going for a great hero, but I did not like this guy anyway. He cheats in the sport, talking like a really sweet simpleton and does not seem to know he is sitting in the courtroom. How should I take it seriously? <br /> <br /> The turn was even weaker. I mean, come on! It was just stupid. The whole story looked like it was about five years old in its dreams. I said I liked it so much that it was very funny and laughing a few times, so I can not say it's a bad movie. In fact, I have to say that I have to say it's good enough, nothing I enjoy and laughs at may be bad But this lively and stupid story was so ridiculous I can not understand how somebody thinks great. > <br /> I have no idea how this movie was historically accurate, but if it were true, I would have to shake my head.
