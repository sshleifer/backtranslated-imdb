Usually, when we use the word "escapist", we think it negative; Warren Beatty's big screen version of "Dick Tracy" proves that "leakage" can be good. This is really a fun movie. As an unnamed, yellow dressed, fearless title character, Beatty creates a detective that we can all focus on: ready for action, but not without its weaknesses. From there, the rest of the characters are almost a world for themselves. Tess Truehart (Glenne Headly) is as charming as one might expect, Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) is perhaps the most confused person you can imagine; Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is an average villain: merciless, but cold. Other characters include Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman), the 88-man superman (Mandy Patinkin) and Kid (Charlie Korsmo). Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O'Hara, Seymour Cassel, Paul Sorvino and Kathy Bates are also stars. Oh, wait a minute. I did not even say it! The plot includes that Tracy tries - and yet fails - to find some way to get Big Boy. At the same time, there are some very bizarre events in the city, the answer of which may or may not be closer than everyone thinks. <br /> <br /> Of course, the main thing about this movie is that it's fun to watch. If Warren Beatty had trouble with his age, he used it here. "Dick Tracy" is one great movie.
