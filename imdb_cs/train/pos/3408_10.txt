I give this movie A + clean camp! As Dietrich's daughter Maria Riva wrote in her mother's book: "If you see the garden of Allah in the context of a high camp, it can be very fun." And how! I laughed with delight at the crossed score and the amazing, ridiculous, fantastically melodramatic interview. Viewers who have read Boper's toupee accounts (still appearing in heat) will try each time they appear. Dietrich and Boyer rarely look at each other as they put their lines - instead, they follow dreams in the distance, probably so that their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the best light (if you play in Turkey, it may look good!). Dietrich's costumes are out of this world. As Riva notes in his book, Dietrich managed to steal Travis Banton of Paramounty and have him design some of the most difficult clothes, such as chiffon beige dresses and cloaks. I warmly agree with other reviewers who are raving about Technicolor. It is really hard to believe that the film was shot in 1936 - the color is fantastic. In short, if you look at the garden of Allah with an indulgent attitude and accept his stupidity, you can not help, but enjoy it.
