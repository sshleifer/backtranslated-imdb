It's one of the best movie comedies / musicals "B" I've seen (and since I've seen at the age of 40 I'm not an expert but I've seen all the famous movies). When there are a number of actors who get into the lead for a few minutes at a time, usually comedies interfere with musical pieces and very often musical compositions interrupt comic flow. Call me in a crazy mood, but when I saw it at TCM Europe I was so happy to laugh! So who gave me laughter? Undoubtedly Mischa Auer gave me horrible intestinal busts, even stole the end, it was great! When we talk about it, I think why this movie works, because even though L & H is a sales point (and why I was watching this (Hal and Roach), I love them in their early affairs, Hal Roach). it is minimal and will remain immediately on the ADULT tariff (according to the 1930 standard and not so far from today's standards if you read between the lines). Jack Haley is also great to watch, I confess that we know him only from W O OZ and I loved him there, and I also laughed loudly at the waiter in the show. Patsy Kelly is the only "ugly" femme in the films of the 1930s that really turn me (something tells me it's a real spitfire); and the musical numbers have real professional production (Busby Berkley'ish), which has fired me away from what I'm used to in this genre. I could go on, but I'm sure I really enjoyed this movie. 8 of 10 I saw it at TCM Europe and upload it to see my wife again at TCM USA. Good things!
