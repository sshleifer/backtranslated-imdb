The problem with the version of this 1985 film is simple; Indiana Jones was so closely modeled after Alan Quartermain (or at least Alan Quartermain of TYPE character) that the director '85 made a mistake in having produced IJ's films for dialogue and the story too deep. What you got as a finished product was a confused mess called Alan Quartermain, in the uneven smell of cheaply imitated saga IJ (with the Austin Powers-esquire cheese here and there). <br /> <br /> He has been criticized for "great parody" or "unintentional comedy". Unintentional is the word. This film should never be humorous; funny, yes, but not humorous. Unfortunately, it's more than witty. <br /> <br /> With this new mini-series M4TV you get a lot more story, the nature of your lead development, solid portraits and a gentle, balanced and fun mix. This story is a bit long; much longer than its predecessors, but deserved, so this version carries a real story and not just action and eye candy. While it is an action and eye candy, it also corrects an error made in the 1985 version by forgetting IJ together and returning to the source materials for AQ, which means a fine, well thought out plot and some nice complementary charts. <br /> <br /> Now this attempt is not all the extraordinary action of Indiana Jones. This is not a bad attempt to be so. This vehicle is conspicuous and nature-driven and is a beautiful performance of AQ / KSM saga. Filmed on the spot in South Africa, the audience is given beautiful (if abandoned) views, indigenous cultures of SA and some beautiful wildlife experiences that blend seamlessly with performances and stories. <br /> <br /> Steve Boyum was totally surprised with this because I had never been to sign up for my vision. In fact, I did not like most of my work as a director until this attempt. I hope this is a new thing of talent and less fluke that seems to be. <br /> <br /> This version is 9.8 / 10 on the "TV" scale since ... <br /> <br />
