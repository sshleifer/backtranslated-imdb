One of the best love stories I've ever seen. It's a bit like watching the wreck of the train in slow motion but still beautiful ... Great Edie and Little Edie look a little like family members after watching this movie repeatedly and infinitely quote: "It's a damn beautiful day, now you're just silent Little Edie promises to live forever, and Big Edie will be "World Famous Singer" and Little Edie "World Famous Dancer".
