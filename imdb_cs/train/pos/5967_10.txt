Sam, Curr the metal rock god, trying to stop him, trying to forbid him, trying to censor his music! (like the real life of Dee Snider, Twisted Sister, [Tipper Gore] or Ozzy Osborne) In a fire, Sammy Cure was pretending to play Halloween at his old high school for dancing .. Now Eddie Weinbauer, his # 1 fan and the only one who knew how he was alone and what he felt (or?) Nuke, dj at the local radio station (Gene Simmons) has and gives a single copy of Sammy Eddie's last record. But when Eddie tries to play the records back, she finds Sammy talking to him from the dead and telling him what to do, back to the bullies in his school who hate him and his music .. Everything works until Sam gets started kill! A great movie and must see for fans of heavy metal hair with a great soundtrack of Fastway and only if you do not know what the song is, or you know it's Fastway and they do not like it, they changed their voice a bit, and there's also a style that sounds like a famous Cinderella or Ratt .. Is the movie a true horror movie? Well, it depends on what you say horror movie. For me, a true horror movie is slasher, with a lot of killing or just scary. This film is not a lack of death, but it can not be called action, comedy, drama, tension or thriller, so I should guess that it must be horror. So if you want "Rock N 'Roll, Rockin' in the middle of the night steel your soul!" So Sammy Curr and Trick or Treat is for you .. I mean, "what are you afraid of? It's just Rock 'N' Roll!
