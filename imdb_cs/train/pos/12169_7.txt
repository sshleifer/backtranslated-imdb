In the night of his bachelor party, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) meets the beautiful dancer Becky (Julia Stiles) in the bar, drinks a lot together and wakes up the next morning with her on the bed. His future mistress calls him and informs that his fianc√© Karen (Selma Blair) may come to his apartment and desperately asks Becky to leave his place in a hurry. Later he finds that he has crabs, and later, when preparing a wedding dinner, he realizes that Becky is cousin Karen. This is the beginning of a very fun comedy, with funny situations. The first attraction of this film is certainly the central trio of actresses and actor. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair, who are great actresses and extremely gorgeous, and Jason Lee, who is incredibly entertaining, have good performances. I laughed a lot, but there are some scenes that are really funny. For example, when Paul finds Becky in bed; when he finds her colors; his imagination in many situations; in the drugstore, trying to buy and get an explanation about the treatment of crabs; most of the scenes of his neighbor, the minister; when Karen calls a department store; or when the police find a suspect in an attack on Paul. I could count many other scenes, but better borrow a reader or buy this movie and you have a lot of fun. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Crazy For Them" "Louco Por Elas"
