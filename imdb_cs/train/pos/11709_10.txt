Now, for all the cinematic fans out there, this movie does not have to be much on the list of your things to see. But if you know anything about the plot, the deep truth and the intentions that this movie (serial) would have, you would understand my reputation that the film's specificities are the rendering of a writer who can not be expected to know what will eventually happen. The film, however, is biblically accurate and rightly "scares" the audience to think about what can be. I am a Christian, not because of this film but because of my personal decision to accept Jesus as my Savior. The film and the potential that something similar to the circumstances contained in it can make people terrible to think about their activities and decisions. It's not a cheap attempt to scare people to believe in God, but rather a means of getting your attention. As a Christian, I know I will not stay behind, and thanks to movies, I can look beyond the surfaces of entertainment, acting and film budgeting to appreciate the depth the film offers. This is a movie that you should not only see but feel with your heart and soul.
