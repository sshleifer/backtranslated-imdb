I watch a lot of movies, good, bad and indifferent; there is usually something that interests, even if it's only design or reliable work of a good character actor, or the random laugh that emerges from the observation of the misconception captured forever. I was quite pleasantly surprised by this movie I had never seen before. Graham Greene has many times been translated into film, masterpieces such as "Thin Man" and smaller cars. The "Confidential Agent" is one of the smaller vehicles, yet I managed to get somewhere, despite the utterly insignificant direction, the inconsistency of Bacal and Boyer's images as British and Spaniards, and the almost complete absence of any chemistry between the two conductors. In some respects, this last "problem" actually begins to work in favor of the film, how can love actually flourish in the killing atmosphere of fascism and capitalism that meet the tragedy of one person? The most urgent aspect of the film arises directly from the complex psychology of Greene's perception that penetrates the film. I know some see intentional stimulation as boring and I understand it. Yet I have found that fertilization is more emphasized than to lose itself from what is the claustrophobic world. I was forced to watch, not to some great acting (though Boyer is amazing as usual, he managed to give him a rich mixture of conscience, tragedy, hope and inflammation with his wonderful voice and longing eyes), but the spiral of a rush of thin men who hoping against the world of oppression and money. What is a thief? What is good love in the face of death? Where does the end of profits and exploitation begin? The film does not grow to the level of art, and therefore can not hope to answer such questions, but it is much more than mere fun, and its murders and guilt are very painstakingly drawn. The lack of glitches, "bubbles", the narrative "bounces" will help make this film very much. <br /> <br /> And it's not a happy end because history has ended.
