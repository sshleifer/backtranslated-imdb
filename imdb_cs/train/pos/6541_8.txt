As an adult in the mid-1940s, I'm not so close to any of the key demographic themes of Nancy Drew, but this afternoon I was pleasantly surprised by the film; so I did it, it was a pair of sixty silver ladies who collapsed with me. The elderly man who left the theater in front of him expressly praised the film of a 20-year-old woman (who said she had seen the movie before and liked it). point: But nine in front of me were nine - counting them, nine-ten-year-old girls standing side by side, popcorn and hot dogs and sweets going back and forth and giggling with thumbnails. <br /> <br /> As soon as the movie started, they immediately settled down to watch ... ... and did not have as much peep as they started spinning until the final credits. <br /> <br /> It's not a perfect movie; it's not quite to pay off your high school subplots, it's not quite sure enough of your own tone, and its criminals are just hair too far over to critically incomprehensible at times. The adaptation of the starting material is, however, basically respectable, the story rests relatively well and moves deeply between excess cheese and excessive modernization. Last but not least, Emma Roberts carries the film with a surprising grace - despite the excellent timing of Josh Flitter, it's Roberts' film and she will be pulling it away beautifully. Her Nancy Drew is a very direct ancestor of Veronica Mars in Kristen Bell, and the film is also a straight-forward child of Jodie Foster who became Candleshoe. a family film that respects the intelligence of the audience. As such, it will not have the will of everyone - but what it is is the best film of its kind for decades.
