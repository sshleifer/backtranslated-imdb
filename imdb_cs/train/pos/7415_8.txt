How powerful and fascinating simple quality film processing can be. This film says it's a story with everyday scenes that can reveal the horror inside. It is true, as others have said, how this film really makes clear how Hollywood has lost its special effects, exaggerated emotionality and top climatic extremes, and forgot the essence of a meaningful story narrated with simple realism. So much of what these characters go through is more a scenario than a rather spoken word conversation. One of the aspects I really enjoyed on the film was the contrast of two brothers, one so very openly expressing her childlike way and the other completely stoic, but both could evoke deep emotions. The older brother had to say little, as he usually did, it was all in his deadly face! Beautiful cinematography, amazing acting, great direction! Do not forget!
