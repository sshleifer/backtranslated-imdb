Prisons are often not called up during the interviews about the best eighty horror movies and it's a good reason because it's not one of the best ... but when you dive into the classic films that decades have to offer, it's certainly among the best less known / smaller movies. The film has some connection with the barracks; for the beginning, it's an early directing effort for Renny Harlin; capable director for a number of action films including Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea; and second, we have an early role for Vigg Mortensen's Star Lord of the Rings. The film is not entirely original, but the line is interesting. We are focusing on a prison that was reopened after several years. It was a jail where a man named Charles Forsyth was sent to an electric chair after being ruined by a prison governor. Of course, the spirit of the dead is not at rest; and when the old execution room opens again, the spirit of the dead convict escapes revenge. The film is not exactly the redemption of Shawshank, but it's about building up its various characters, and while the movie's main point is always horror, the prison drama behind all this is an interesting base. This is also a good job because, other than a basic premise, the film does not really have a "conspiracy" from which we could go, and we rely only on the interaction between characters to make it interesting. Horror in the movie is sometimes grotesque, but it's never above the top, which might be the reason why this movie rarely remembers and is released in a decade of surplus. The murders themselves are rather good and imaginative and provide some significant events. As the film continues, we start to dive more into the back story of the spirit of a vengeful convict, and while it's quite interesting, some things make no sense about it, and it pulls the film down a bit. Still, everything falls to an exciting climax, and overall, I have to say that prison is a movie that's worth watching.
