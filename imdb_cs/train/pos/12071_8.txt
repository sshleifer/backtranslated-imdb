Nicolas Roeg's projects are variable, at least, but never interesting. "Inconsequential" is apparently primarily adapted to the scenario: it is cheerful and quite "bound in peace". But this film is more than once: the basic themes are not openly presented, and it takes a while for them to adapt to the opposites and the roles of four protagonists: Einstein, McCarthy, Munroe and DiMaggio. <br /> <br /> Einstein is overwhelmed with guilt over Hiroshima, yet he guesses the simplicity of sexual intercourse with Munro; Munro is sick that he is seen as a bimbo and longs for intellectual belief; Senator McCarthy is at the top of his witch hunting force, but he's impotent sleazebag; DiMaggio is uncertain about his personality, self-clarified and vulnerable to violence. Each of them contains the seeds of their own destruction. Each character has a problem, an abusive / abusive past and a controversial future. We gradually see that obsession itself is a central theme. American obsession with its post-war cultural icons and morals; obsessions of protagonists for something that no one can have: peace and / or happiness. Compared to the theory of relativity, the proposed single field theory, and indeed the cosmos itself, all the desires and interactions of Roeg's protagonists seem to be insignificant. Yet these aspects of the physical universe (that's all quantum, believe me!) Influence us when they are applied to the development of the means to destroy us. Monroe's reference to the principle of a neutron bomb (without marking it as such) is not an anachronism in itself, but can only be understood by the contemporary audience. In fact, all of the links in the script are accessible only to a knowledgeable audience: one has encountered 50 incidents / personality cults and how they affect us in the 21st century. This film and its script are either very, very clever, or extremely opaque and demanding. Ultimately, however, it is likely to be negligible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
