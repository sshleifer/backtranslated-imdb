I grew up and watched Scooby and I was a fan of forever. This cartoon moves from the same old routine that can bore the audience. The routine Steps in the Mask will become old and This cartoon is a change from that. It's not about replacing Scooby's gang, it's just a break from the same old crime scene for both the audience and the writer. I am sure. The cartoon focuses on Scooby and Shaggy, who inherit a large amount of money, and use this money to curb plans to conquer the world from the crazy scientist and his boys. Small gang honors and gang itself appear from time to time. If you are a Scooby-Doo fan, you can still remember the relationship between the boy and the dog, along with the jokes that come with him. Just look forward to Cartoon and encourage creators / writers and producers to be the last Scooby Cartoon.
