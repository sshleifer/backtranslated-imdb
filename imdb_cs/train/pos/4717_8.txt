How can anyone love this movie? I think it's a funny spoof of all old gangster movies; if you've never seen them, watch it instead. Michael Keaton plays the ball in this role as something else. One guy can handle English every time he speaks, and Griffin Dunn plays an insignificant D.A., but my most favorite role is Joe Piscopo. It has all the best lines. Danny DeVito, Alan Hale, and Ray Walston are staring in a movie that suggests that gangsters are much more fun than a "mafia" for a criminal metro.
