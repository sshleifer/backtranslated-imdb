The Good Times was a pioneering comedy about the first nuclear black family living in Chicago. Regardless of whether you live in inner cities, ghettos, suburbs or the countryside, this show is still a treasure and observing that the family is more of a family than a show about a poor black family. But they are not interested in it. They find humor and have strong family values ​​and morals. Despite the story behind the scenes, this show was paid in the air, except I did not like to kill my father, which I agreed with Ester Rolle, who struggled hard to keep the family together. But despite all the backstage struggles, the Good Times was a show about the family. We all loved JJ's dynamite and his inclinations. We watched Penny grow up a little on Janet Jackson. This show was pioneering to show despair in drugs, gangs and alcoholism. Without preaching, Evans has always tried to do the right thing rather than something wrong to get out of the ghetto.
