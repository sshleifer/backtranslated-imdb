First of all let me say that I wanted to see this movie for about a year because I knew Angelina Jolie was in her and I love her. But my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the film. Anyway, no video rentals carried her, but low and she saw the local library. I looked at it and absolutely loved it. Yes, there were Italian stereotypes, but it was good and fun. It was nothing in any way. <br /> <br /> Every actor and actress worked great. I was very laughing at the sexual humor. Overall, I think this movie is worth seeing if you find it. It's adorable and just fun to watch. I rarely list movies like 10, but I'm giving this 10! <br /> <br /> Go on and watch it!
