OK, where do you start? ... This movie changed my life! The plot was seamless. James Cahill did it himself. At first, after the first look, I was disappointed that I had not seen the silver screen. However it was before exploring many DVD features !!!! Oh, the commentary on the movie from his god Jakes Cahill was almost flawless as his acting. he said about the industrial secrets used in the movie that you only get experience. <br /> <br /> I was so overwhelmed by other actors. The scene where the guard speaks with a girl in the hall reminds me of some of my favorite blue (pornographic) movies. I'm sure with Gangsta when he expresses his disappointment without going on. I'm still bleeding away with every view of martial arts skills that corresponds only to a sign that indicates the location of a library at school ... and maybe that guy playing a retarder! Overall, it is a timeless classic and the best film that has come out of Europe for years! where my Oscar at dawn !!!!!!!!!!!
