I've heard some very good stuff about this movie, and I've probably seen a low score in IMDb, so I've avoided it. Today they saw Vanilla Sky on TV and because I had nothing better to do ... and as it turned out I would have had to find something better. Vanilla Sky is a terrifying, sad and moving film, in fact, one of the best I've ever seen. I was surprised at how it affected me. It's hard to explain, but during the movie, your feelings about the characters and your perception of what's going on change and it's quite an emotional way. Vanilla Sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for the film or for the media. <br /> <br /> I really recommend everyone to watch this movie. No matter what you heard about it.
