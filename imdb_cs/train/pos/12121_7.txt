Somerset Maugham's characters are revived in RKO "Of Human Bondage"; but the film is a skeleton-like version of the novel, with Bette Davis's stellar creation of sucking all the energy. Otherwise, it's the story of Leslie Howard (Philip Carey); dreams of becoming a painter, but is said to have no art for art. As the film progresses, Mr. Howard fights instead of becoming a Doctor. His efforts seem to indicate some bad advice about art; though successful in medicine, his painting looked simpler - also notice the symbols of his disability, "club legs" (explained in the film). <br /> <br /> On the way (right in this version), Howard becomes in love with waitress Davis (like Mildred Rogers). Davis's characteristic "Mildred" is exceptional and culminates in spectacular speeches when she tells Howard, among other things, that they "MOVE MOVE!" after his kiss. Howard also works well, but the story can not explain his long-lasting fascination and love for Davis; so their performances are useless. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is a movie that will watch acting, including some good supporting players. Bette Davis's characterization was renowned for inspiring the "write" campaign at the 1934 Best Actress Award. The results were: <br /> <br /> 1. Claudette Colbert - "It Happened One Night" <br /> <br /> 2. Shearer Norma - "Barretts of Wimpole Street" <br /> <br /> 3. Bette Davis - "Human Pain" <br /> <br /> 4. Grace Moore - "One Night of Love" <br /> <br /> ******* Human Disasters (6/28/34 ) John Cromwell ~ Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, Reginald Denny
