This film was made in 1948, but it's still true. Very, very funny. It starts with a family who wants to buy a small place in the country and "builds" it from there. Anyone who ever built a house finds this movie very cute. Great cast. Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are wonderful in this movie. This is a classic black and white film that reflects the spectacular style of the fortieth ... clothes, architecture and family life. Many references are related to the cost of things and the comparison with today's costs are quite amazing. I can not imagine the film did not like it. I was surprised by the number of middle-aged people who had never heard of it. True Classic.
