Dana Andrews's movie noir cycle Otto Preminger is one of the (mostly) unnecessary genres of the genre. Because of their lack of paranoia, misogyny or hysteria, at that time seemed to be in place, but clear eyes, complex play with identity, masculinity and representation, subversion of traditional psychological principles, austere, geometric style look today surprisingly modern and very similar to Melville. The clear irony of this film is so busy, brutal and ironic that the "happy" end is one of the cruelest in Hollywood history. Brilliant also at the level of entertaining thriller, tense and wrapped in double dialoge.
