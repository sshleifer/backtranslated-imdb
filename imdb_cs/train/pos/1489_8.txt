Overall, the movie is fine. I think it's better than the Sepet and much better than Gubra in terms of his story, sentimental value. There are several scenes that will catch me. Yes, I agree that the guy (Mukhsin) played very well. Brilliant. I can say that his acting is almost natural. The song "No Me Quitte Pas" by Nina Simone is really "menaikkan" my 'bulu' 'roma' ". <br /> <br /> I love the song. Both songs. "No Me Quitte Pas" and "Hujan". I just downloaded the song. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> And say hello to Yasmin. The final film credit touched me again. We can see Yasmin appreciating his parents in a unique way. I think the film deserves the Grand Prix of the International Jury at the Berlin Film Festival. I'm 8.5 out of 1 stars.
