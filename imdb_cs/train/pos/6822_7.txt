"Opening Night," which was released in 1977, is trying to be an ambitious production. It only succeeds in the truly stunning Genie Rowlands performance. Her character, theater actress Myrtle, is not necessarily a person we love in real life. She is self-confessed, often unpleasant, and makes life miserable for those around her-in other words, not unlike some actresses! Myrta is also a woman on the brink of collapse - we are not quite sure whether the demons she is fighting with, real or imagined, even though we soon left a secret. Rowlands is clearly well-focused with love by her gifted husband, actor / director John Cassavettes, who also plays a role in the film. This movie is not buggy - it's too long, and the last part of the movie, where Myrtle goes on stage while being very drunk, looks almost cruel. "Improving" in one of the dialogues - at least on stage - is going on for too long. Some of the supportive characters are performing well, especially from Ben Gazarry, playing Myrtle's fearless producer. Joan Blondell's character is never fully developed, and I've never been able to figure out why she was in the movie except to reassure Myrtle. Check out this movie for Rowland itself - it's fascinating around the world - and it's hard to get rid of it even if you want it sometimes.
