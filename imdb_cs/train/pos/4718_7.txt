This film was created in Hungary. the landscape is beautiful, the people who play the farmers were absolutely fascinating. their riding is amazing. I got more into the indigenous people, the farmer's life, and the hero as they tried to hide Brady from the evil Nazis looking for these paratroopers. They even sacrificed their lives in several cases. the young orphan boy that Brady was spinning was a sweet kid. you'll be amazed at the riding I think, and the action is trying to escape the Nazis. is fun and comic in some places and very tragic in others. Ladies have hankies handy because you will be destroyed at the end. I own it and followed it several times. in other words, not just one step. its manager ....
