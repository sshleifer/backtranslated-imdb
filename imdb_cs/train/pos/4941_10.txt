I believe a lot of people rated the movie, not because of the lack of quality. But he did not keep the standard Hollywood formula. Some conflicts are not resolved. The end is a bit too real for others, but the journey of rich characters and a long list of supporters is both thoughtful and fun. Even cinematography is excellent for the urban environment, the direction is also excellent and innovative. <br /> <br /> These are 10 books, this movie will bring you places where the normal and expected Hollywood script will not be. They took certain risks and did a few things differently. I think it worked well, I'm trying to avoid direct links to the movie, because that's the best answer because I do not recognize another interpretation.
