This is a very entertaining film that follows NY Macbeth's trial of production. Although it has something to say about power, jealousy and ambition (Macbeth themes) in our modern world, the movie works best when it's not too serious about it. Main actors include John Glover, Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury, but the most important scene for me is the "Banque" murder (John Elsen). Probably more fun for those involved in the theater, but anyone who has Shakespeare's charm should enjoy this movie.
