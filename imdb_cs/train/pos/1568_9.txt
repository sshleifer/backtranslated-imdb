Catscratch is the best of Nickeloden, including Wayne Knight. This show is not just about Maoris and PI. some people love her and they are all aussies. At first glance, I admit that it looks a bit rough, but you are growing enormously. Also to fix something that one of the other critics said, In_Correct (Tv.com) does not say "does it mean you're gay now?" says, "Does that mean you're gay, owww?" This is his expression in the show. Mr Blik is, in my opinion, the most entertaining of all, such as Peww-Weww's theater <br /> <br /> First, I admit that the early episode was a bit good. But after a while the episodes became great! And just as the series found it to be unreal, whacky ... Nickelodeon will cancel it! I know Nick is designed for kids, but every moment there is a great show that can be enjoyed by teenagers and adults. These shows include Bean Animated Series, Charlie Brown, Pelswick, Rocko's Modern Life (occasionally) and Invader Zim. Everything had to be considered too good, except for CatDog, because Nick felt it necessary to cancel them. What I like is the famous last episode where Gordon is fighting the duck. /> <br /> I would also like to see a DVD with a lot of audio comments and backstage, including the latest episode. But, of course, what I definitely like to bring the show back to the air. Wake up to NICK! I wish there was a list somewhere on the internet with all gag closing-loans. It would be great.
