I love it when they really do the sporty story well. So many people were so hockey in the past that it was annoying to watch. This one is not. It's a really nice movie, an old-fashioned story - and comes from a real guy who did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this movie. He plays a school coach who talks about how he is sporting in the late life to become a professional baseball jug. Eventually, he will achieve his goal of getting into the big leagues, even if it was a very short period. All the characters here are nice people you anchored from Quaid to (Angus T. Jones, now somewhat star on TV.) Quaid is faithful in Jim Morris, because unlike actors in the past in sports movies, he knows how to throw baseball. Looks like a pitcher, a guy who could burn 90 kilometers per hour. And most of this movie is true as it testifies to a real pitcher in one of the DVD's. So if you're looking for a nice, inspirational film about real sports, you can not be wrong with this.
