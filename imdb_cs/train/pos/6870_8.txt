From the beginning to the end, I really laughed at the movie. It's amazing that "The Groove Tube" is probably a grandfather, yet the most important of all comedy sketches. That's the way I like to watch TV without bothering me to twist the channels just to suffer from insomnia! Within 73 minutes, weird, strange humor never stops! Just think about how this nonsense of laughter can help you to make life easier! It's so, WAY better than Comedy Central or some major show of time! Make a favor and remove all the gentle, lame romantic comedy films into the trash can! Better yet, tell the box manager that you want "The Groove Tube" back on the big screen!
