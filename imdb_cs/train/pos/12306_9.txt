The Chinese Star Story is played by the later great Leslie Cheung as Ling Choi Sin, who decided to spend the night in a deserted temple where he meets and falls on a beautiful woman called Tsing (Joey Wang). When Ling finds out that Tsing is really a ghost who has been forced to sacrifice the evil spirit of a tree who feeds "chi" (life force), he decides to try to free the girl by giving her the remnants of a proper funeral. Catching the help of Shera Yin (Wu ma), a crazy Taoist monk, Ling successfully defeats the spirit of the tree, but also has to fight in hell against the evil Lord Black, who is to be Tsing for the wedding. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The first film in Hong Kong I saw, which was not a purely martial art, The Chinese spirit story opened its eyes to the incredible world of Asian fantasy horror, a magical empire inhabited by beautiful female spirituals, sinking innocent heroes, the Taoist monks, spirit and dark gentlemen from the underworld; I immediately fell in love with exuberance, energy, humor, inventiveness and visual perfection. Two decades later, and this amazing film still remains one of the best examples of my genre I've seen? - a wonderful, breathtaking masterpiece that brilliantly presents horror, comedy, fantasy, and romance. With an excellent direction from Siu-Tung Ching, a superb adaptation of David Wu, stunning cinematography and a host of imaginative special effects (including humongous killer language, many tentacle monsters and several flying heads!), The story of the Chinese spirit is a completely unforgettable and thoroughly enjoyable experience start to finish.
