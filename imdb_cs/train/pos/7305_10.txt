In 1978, the phenomenon began. The release of John Halloween "Halloween" got people waiting around the block to witness the evil that is Michael Meyers. The critics loved it, the world loved it, was imitated and descended as one of the greatest films in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy: 15 years after the assassination, four female friends) are babysitting (and having with their girlfriends) on Halloween night. After departing from the hospital at night, Michael Myers returns to his hometown to let them go. He murders three of them softly and gently. He does not speak. He's walking slowly. <br /> <br /> There is one reason why Halloween works so well. Simplicity. We do not know where Michael is, we do not know why he's killing, and he scares us. These are the only reasons why we are afraid. John Carpenter wrote the film and directed. Throughout the story, it puts an unbearable strain, and fears that we sometimes fail to look. And the climax is really stunning. <br /> <br /> As a horror it is necessary. It's scary and well acting. It's also mysterious. Michael is a force, not a person. A force that can not be denied. <br /> <br /> The sequel focused too much on Michael and his "history." This film focuses on the fear of the unknown. Maybe that's why this is a masterpiece.
