That's what I say growth film. Every character is different and better at the end and it's all because one woman knows that the place they choose is a "bath of love". Josie Lawrence, who is best known as comedy, really shines like a woman who brings all these changes. Even the men in this film come from being focused on better men. The book has remained very true to the novel, which is in my book plus because I am a librarian. Scenery breathtaking and the message of love right.
