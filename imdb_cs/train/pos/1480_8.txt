I'm right in front of the shape and I'm looking at Casomai. It's changing, evolving or better ... transforming. It begins with the quaint wedding of two protagonists, where their love story is told. Then everything changes, the baby is born and the rest usually takes place in a couple. It's not a special film because it's about normal pairing and the normality is at the heart of this movie. He does not want to show us something special, it's nothing new, it's just a normal story of love, the story of a couple, and it's normal to be different from the others. It's also a flashing movie, everything is short, each scene is only a few seconds long. It is a reported story, many things are known because friends and parents talk about it and their opinion is central, opinions make a story and destroy it. It's a simple story of a couple, as I said, but it's not boring, it only shows a couple, it should be all known, it's, but I'm sure each of you will want to know what's going on, so do not forget the end!
