While not as famous as some of their other collaborators (such as BLACK CAT and THE BODY SNATCHER), it is a dandy little horror film, although casting decisions are a little weird. Boris Karloff plays Dr. Jan Rukha, a strange scientist living in the Carpathians - near where Dracula's hometown is a character. Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Benet - whose nationality has never been debated, though the name certainly sounds French. I really think it would make sense to have two switching roles because the Carpathian role seems to be adapted to Lug - especially with his accent. However, despite this unusual twist, these two still worked great. Karloff plays the lead role, but Lugosi has freed himself from a fairly normal person - something he did not play very often in the movies! Dr. Rukh seems to be a little pariah, as other scientists (especially Benet) think his theories are bizarre and pointless. However, during the film, Rukh made sure he was right, and Benet was particularly generous in his new vagina for Rukh. But unfortunately, the beautiful new feature that Rukh has discovered has a damaging side effect that turns him into a crazy murder machine (do not you mind if it happens?). While it could have been a pretty scientist, it became a mad story, the plot was well built, the characters nicely developed, and the mad Rukh is NOT a one-dimensional killer, but complicated and interesting. <br /> <br /> The film is bound to enjoy anyone except those who hate old horror films. You can really say that Universal Pictures pulled all the stops and created a bigger budget movie instead of cheap tenants as Lugosi and Karloff unfortunately gravitated in later years. Good things.
