This is not exactly a great movie, but I admire the writer and director that I tried something a little different. The main theme of the film is fate and small, seemingly insignificant things that can dramatically change the future. In some ways, it reminds me of SLIDING DOORS, but instead of concentrating on a random event, the seemingly random thing is repeated and each one helps build a cute conclusion. Moreover, he seems to understand everything and talks about this in one short scene - as if he were a ubiquitous man, but there is absolutely no explanation in the movie (just like the two guys fighting each other). hour tower in HUDSUCKER PROXY). <br /> <br /> The jacket DVD shows only Audrey Tautou. This is beneficial for her success in AMELIE, though she is only one of many actors in the film and no one has a major role to play. The pace is sharp, it plays well and the conclusion is not bad at all. The only reason I did not notice it is that some characters were a little uninteresting and I think the movie might have been tightened by a few subplots.
