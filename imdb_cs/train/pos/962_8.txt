I just watched this movie and I must say that I was so impressed. Everything was great about it. He plays characters, a story. An incredible child who has become brave, always willing to help others. His mother must be proud. I could not take my eyes off this film for fear I would not want something. It's a precious fable / story with morality, cute and spooky sprites and "monsters", but still hearty people. The child was spoiled and dressed at school and became a hero. He chose the horseman at the local village festival and the trip to the Goblin Mountain, where they will discover Yokai, which are stunning creations that Brian Froud would be proud of. And the evil Kato and his away, who definitely needed a hug. These evil people capture Yokai and throw them into a red pit along with unwanted items like motorcycles and other mechanical things, and they join in one horribly violent robotic monster whose only task is to kill them. Takashi the young boy is the one who becomes their savior next to the red man / the turtle dragon and the river princess, as well as the cute little creature that if it were America could turn it into a plush toy and sell it good in all toy stores. Lines are good, especially Do not try it at home kids and other gems that bring a smile to your lips. Stop the faith and watch it with your child or yourself and enjoy yourself! Still, I must admit that the end was a little sad. And not necessarily so. Healthy Furdion
