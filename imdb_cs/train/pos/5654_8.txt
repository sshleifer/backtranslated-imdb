I watched 10 years ago and loved it! Now I'm in the possession of a DVD and watched the series and I was waiting for the scenes I knew were in the show (when Lucas confronted Gail in his house) and realized he was missing - all of a sudden I watched the seduction without going upstairs. Then I went to the show to look at all the BIOS of the stars and came across comments that the show is not right. Thank you!!!!! However, there seems to be some conflict. Some comments state "Strangler Number 19, then Triangle 20 when another was in the opposite direction." And also the boys 5, and the dead in the world 6, were reversed as well.
