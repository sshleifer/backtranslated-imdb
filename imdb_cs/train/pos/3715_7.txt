Well, it was a pretty sensitive small number, but I can not help thinking that I saw it before. It reminds me of another VCA movie I've seen in Poitier called "NEXT DAYS OF RUBE RAE". His executions were also "Welcome to the Mansion" and "Ratcatcher" and Lynne Ramsay. Which does not mean they are not tasteful links ... just that they feel very modern and very fashionable ... which admits that it is approaching advertising (in style and story) than the work of an original and authentic author. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is simply ... perfectly perfect for my desire. Too coral filter (or charcoal) to my liking ... too archil-framed 12mm. The whole impression left me a little far away - beware of the art that is claimed too easily! The Frenchman (a conservative band) seemed to buy it, just like the jury, however ... but the selection of short films in Cannes is notoriously conservative compared to the selection of features, although I wonder what has been happening in the last few years.
