It's a bit easy. That's about it. Graphics are pure and realistic, except that some of the fences are 2d, but it is forgiven. The rest of the graphics are cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sound is spectacular. Everything from a call to SFX is nice and realistic. The angle of the camera is sometimes a bit frustrating, but it's the same for every board game like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. <br /> <br /> I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997 and since then I obediently has earned 120 stars more than 10 times.
