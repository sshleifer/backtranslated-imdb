They put together some characters that would normally not be seen together (not to mention saving the human child and bringing him back to his father). They start as enemies and end up as the best girlfriend. If this sounds like a Disney movie, it's (it's just over 20th Century Fox). The movie trailer was one of the best I've ever seen, but the movie does not dwell on expecting the trailer to be set. The problem is that filmmakers have not realized who is the target audience of the film. Yes, there are some jokes in the movie that only adults can understand, but the film is mostly aimed at children. Parents enjoy the fact that in 90 minutes. the attention of their children is aimed at someone other than them. The background is excellent and the voice is good, but it's nothing but a nice movie. Children will love this movie, adults will enjoy it.
