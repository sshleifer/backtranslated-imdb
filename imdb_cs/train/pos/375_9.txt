it was one of the most moving movies I've ever seen. I was about 12 years old when I watched them for the first time, and whenever it's on TV, my eyes are glued. acting and plotting are amazing. it looks so true to reality and touches so many controversial themes. I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in a good career.
