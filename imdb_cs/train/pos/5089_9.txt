It's true that the book does not really match, but it's still a very fun story. Swayze was much better in the role than I expected. And Doody avoided a "stupid woman from her depth in the wild" that most of us probably expected (Kate Capshaw in "Indiana Jones & Temple of Doom"). <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's surprisingly better than Richard Chamberlain's terrible pair of Quatermain flicks. It is very much like the West in many ways. The only thing I did not care about was all mysticism, but I think it's an integral part of this genre. Just like "how can you have an African adventure story without witchcraft doctrines and predatory wise travelers?" Hey.
