He used this film in 1936 with a number of classic actors veterans, and especially William Powell (Dr. Lawrence Bradford), "Mr. Roberts," who played the role of a doctor and a detective. Dr. Bradford was once married to Jean Arthur (Paula Bradford), "Shane," and was given a divorce, and they still managed to live together and fight all the time. Paula wanted her husband to investigate the murder and did all he could to convince him that it was very important. Jean Arthur plays a nutty type and there's a lot of 1936 comedy and the method of murder is something you'll never believe, especially with the California Race Track jockey. Robert Armstrong (Nick Martel) "King Kong" has provided a great support role as a bookmaker along with James Gleason, a detective who needs the help of Dr. Bradford to resolve this very strange mystery of murder. If you see this movie, remember that it was produced and directed in 1936 and people in the audience these days thought it was great fun and it really was these days!
