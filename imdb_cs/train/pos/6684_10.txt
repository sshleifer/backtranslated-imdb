That's a great movie. I love it more when I look. Most comedies can happen nicely because you know all gags, but mysterious men have so much honesty in writing and characterization that they look again - as Ben Stiller tears on limousine ornament or Hank Azaria says goodbye to Louise Lasser or Geoffrey Rush flashes his Fuhrer choreography , or Tom Waits mumbles while watching the news report, or Janeane Garofalo rejects a kiss from Paul Reubens - it's a pleasure. It's the perfect composer of acting. The story develops directly and consistently, the action sequences are creative and not too dominant, all payout sets to the end. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, watch it again, and if you did not start. You can not watch her until you see her for the first time. (Wes Studios, William H. Macy, test scene, too many good things!)
