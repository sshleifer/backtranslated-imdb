I looked at this film with children's eyes and I was not disappointed. The story is known, some abandoned orphans must bring an unlikely trio to their parents (a dark brown tiger and a lazy animal) ... And I do not forget to mention an incredible animal with the little fury of his hazenut. This really made me laugh all the time. In a nutshell: it works, it's fun and it's with kids "must-see" (they'll like it).
