First of all, this movie did not take place in theaters (TESTED POORLY THEY SAY), I say they thought the story of criminal police officers, politicians and reserved journalists was done to death, just send DVDs and cable TV & money and run. <br /> <br /> It is said that I usually like this type of movie, especially with this named actor. Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, LLCool J, Cary Elways, John Heard and Distaff, Piper Perabo & Roslyn Sanchez. <br /> <br /> They have been made to die, but the amount of casting brings life to this violent movie and it's actually observable. Justin Timberlake It's good as a devoted young reporter to throw away newspaper edited by Morgan Freeman, Others are either Criminal Police and Politicians or somewhat decent guys. Two ladies are girlfriends LL COOL J & JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE & doing what's needed. It is quite violent, many killings, etc., not for children. In no case is a great movie but what it is and cast It's definitely good, rating *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 of 10)
