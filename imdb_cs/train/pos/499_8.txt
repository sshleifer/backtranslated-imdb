Pilot Enterprise has one thing that is missing from the original Star Trek: a dose of realistic, flawed personalities. Utopian characters of the next generation were lost, they were so sublime that they were incredible. I also like a partial plot that people are bitter about the volcanoes. It's funny to think of them as demanding snobs. It awaits me when I see when people become the dominant race between the two, even though I do not think it will work within the timeframe of the performance. The only negatives that popped up to me were "a quick cut for 2 hours," which is common to many Trek exhibitions. The second was a ruthless trench for the evaluation of two nonsensically sexy scenes. It was in place, a good sci-fi show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pack some skin before puberty. But it's not my job to make the show look good, so good. <br /> <br /> Let's see how the next episode is doing.
