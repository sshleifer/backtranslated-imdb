********* Ten of the ten stars ********* <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe it was made for a television movie. Only the phrase "made from television" shakes me. Production values ​​for television films are almost always remarkably lower than production values ​​for professional film studios. That said, this version of "Christmas Carolina" was supposed to be released in theaters because it's good. He is my personal favorite of all the films "Christmas Carolina" because all aspects of this production are of the highest quality. Yes, there are some minor glitches on the screen with two of the ghosts that visit Scrooge, but there is no movie that would not have made at least a few mistakes. <br /> <br /> Scott turns his stellar performance as Scrooge, and is pleased to watch. In fact, I can not think of a single performance in this movie that should not be applauded. Costume, location in place and winter background are fascinating. The musical score is cute and warming the heart. Add solid directories, flawless cinematography, and faithful scripting; we have here what will one day be considered a holiday class. It really was not long enough for me to be a classic, but to mark my words, one day it will be soon. This movie has changed in my household every year into a Christmas tradition because it embodies the real meaning of Christmas: Love, selflessness and giving. As a selfish, greedy world, my family and I can be lost in "Christmas Carols," starring George C. Scott.
