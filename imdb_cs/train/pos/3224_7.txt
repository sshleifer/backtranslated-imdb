I watched this movie expecting what I got: a good science fiction cowboy. What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did such a great job with an extremely limited role. Imagine that you are trying to act under these two constraints: you have no dialogue at all, and because you are playing a hard, military robot, you are not allowed to show emotions using face expressions! Howzat? Something like asking a diva to make a great aria when she was jagged and captured. Although Russell is verbally and remarkably engaging, he pulls out an incredible characterization. His robot becomes a man despite limitations. Good job! <br /> <br /> As usual, Jason Isaacs will make history as a great portrayer of the perfect villain - the one you would like to see drawn and fragmented. Connie Nielsen was sweet, soft, maternal and beautiful. I'm not sure how much of my opinion is based on her actions and how much on her physical beauty, but it was hard to take her out of sight. Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role was too small and limited. <br /> <br /> Much of the conspiracy is fairly standard, with lots of weaknesses, but because it has a science fiction comic book, I do not see what's wrong with a few weak spots. At the end of the story, a good guy wins, and the audience's appreciation receives great emotional satisfaction. Yes, what he thinks Russell did not do a good job is the same kind of feeb who missed the whole point.
