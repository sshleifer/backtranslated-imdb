Her face is in beautiful English landscape, Emma is a delicious candy that you can enjoy in dreams. <br /> <br /> Emma (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a charming, intelligent young woman who has just been married by her governess - and a confidant - to the marriage that Emma will take on merit in sight. Desiring to use her talent in arranging things for people around her, she decides to adapt to Vicar Elton (Alan Cummings) and her beautiful young girlfriend Harriet (Toni Collette). The result is a series of mixed signals and erroneous interpretations, which eventually resolve, Emma learns she does not have such control over events as she thought. The film is full of humorous and poor characterization. Gwyneth Paltrow is in her best form, showing this girl a restrained, polite society with joy and ease. Her growing novel with the unusual Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam) is the heart of this film. Mr. Knightley is one of the greatest romantic men in the movies. It is an incredibly handsome, modest, relaxed way that is irresistible. Gwyneth Paltrow is certainly well appreciated. Their charming friendship, which began at the age of sixteen, and she was a child, flourished while he, a family friend, agreed with her in an older brotherly fashion that is spreading into something more. With an unobtrusive look or an undervalued strike at Emma, ​​Northam's Knightley is delighted to watch. Other wonderful characters include comedic Juliet Stevenson, Greta Scacchi, Ewan McGregor, Polly Walker and girlfriend Miss Bates, who is very funny. It seems shorter and flowing than most adaptations by Jane Austin, and Emma has a comic rhythm that promises true enjoyment.
