Trick or Treat, Quickie Review This boring movie film revolves around the 80s of Heavy Metal culture and horror films - two things I love dearly. So, as you can imagine, I liked this movie very easily. In addition, Ozzy Osbourne plays preacher for obvious reasons. This film is about an unpopular youth college, which like all the losers ended up exhausted in the world of "bad" Heavy Metal. His favorite Metaldude dies and, of course, is miraculously resurrected - by playing his last unreleased album back. This allows the seductive singer to walk around killing demons and helping. <br /> <br /> Well, it's silky sometimes, but you know what? It has a surprising number of good features. Dignified acting (including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), pretty good special effects, very short nudity, decent atmosphere ... Overall, this is a really decent horror movie. But what's really upset is music. Ironically, what? Well, this metal fellow "uber-evil" is one of the most unpleasant, supernatural, sly Motley Crue rejects on the planet - and "Metal" is little more than cracked pop / hair from the 1980s. He hits all clich√©s here, from the storm as a cheerful fairy tale, looking for evil, screaming "Rock and Roll !!!" at a height that is too high for King Diamond to get into the bar. Besides, deep musical expression is really good. 7/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
