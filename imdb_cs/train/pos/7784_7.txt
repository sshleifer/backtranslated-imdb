It was wonderful! Photography, filming, cinematography, music connected with transport us to the dangerous side of a tourist destination. It was a pleasure to "sink" without going through danger. We were there! The snake sequences and flash sequences were fresh. He talked to me. Continue the good work! Another of this genre is the city of God. Also - do not laugh! - Comedy, desperately looking for Susan. Nice assembly types with excellent performance by all. I'm sorry, I think Training Day is also good for this genre, with fantastic performances of cast cast. I had to switch channel to some of the tiny sequences, but all, great movie!
