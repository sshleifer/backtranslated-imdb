... or was Honorable Iago really grumpy at the end when he died? He loved how Bard's jambic pentamer had just mingled with Fishburne's tongue with excellent brightness and emotion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And as Branagh has done Honorable Iago, he seems to celebrate his own evil ... <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie. I often thought that Shakespeare is not inherently friendly: He uses words to create images in our minds, creating a permanent battle with the camera that can only show us what we have to think and feel. Every effort to make Shakespeare should be truly celebrated. It's not an easy thing.
