You have to see to believe it! Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have done something really great, it's 10 out of 10, so I can not believe another user of this site rated them poor if they did not expect to see just a normal movie, people, love scenes, and so on. I am also convinced that such documents are an excellent way to awaken us to save our beautiful planet. In the end, it has nothing to do with Al Gore's documentary "Inconvenient Truth," which consists mainly of long monologues, pain and "truth" is not always accurate, as many scientists have shown. <br /> <br /> The best thing you can do on Earth is not Miss Earth.
