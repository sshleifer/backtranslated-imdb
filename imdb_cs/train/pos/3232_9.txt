I came to see this Finnish film and I must say that it's one of the better movies I've seen this year. Intriky consists of 5-6 different stories that take place on the same day in a small Finnish city. The stories end up very well, reminding perhaps a bit of the way Tarantino films are made. Most actors played very well, which is certainly needed in realistic dramas of this type. I really liked the acting of Sanna Hietala, the main actress and Juha Kukkonen. I noticed that IMDB has bad information about Sanna. Her name, as you may have noticed in the review, is not HEIKKILA but Hietala.
