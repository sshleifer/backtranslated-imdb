I came to this low-expectation film, but was very pleasantly surprised. It is very well done and overcomes the dance hall of dance films of recent years, especially "Strictly Ballroom". While music is pretty and dances colorful, the film is not about dancing for me. It is a very Japanese institution that gives male officers long commuting and leisure time after work for entertainment that does not involve their families. Here we have a man with a whole family, a big mortgage and a lively taste. She is attracted to the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio that goes through her commute and it leads him to try the dance hall. Also Japanese is the fact that the fragile motives that initiated his new passion are clear, but at least eventually accepted by the family and the audience. Attitudes to social dance as shown in the film are definitely non-Western, although discipline and music are clearly cultural imports into Japan. Cultural contrasts are so interesting. Even without cultural views, color, dance, and enthusiastic players makes this movie a fun movie.
