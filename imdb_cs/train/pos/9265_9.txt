Various film directors from different countries have contributed a lot to the film medium according to their ideas. As a result, we have recorded different genres in terms of media. Jafar Panahi, unlike J.L. Godard or F. Truffault, believe in a simple narrative of stories; Schematic narration is one of the main features of his directorial work. He has confidence in both the automatic and critical intelligence of the viewer; they feel no need to go to the Alienation or such things as to get to the audience. It is as effective as it is normal. Offside (2006) is another schematic work from him, where gender subordination Asia in the Middle East is gradually becoming clear to everyone, as a simple but catchy story of the film. Now that we all scream about the issue of women's rights, this film is very peaceful in our minds and eventually becomes a hub for our critical intelligence by sending out a message that Equality of Human Rights is nothing but an illusive good, utopia. Fatherhood never leaves much to women. An important soccer match involving a nation, a teenage girl who understands the game well, loves that her nation has no right to enter the stadium to get upset in the country. It is only allowed to listen to live comments. Her alias could not work for her. As a result, she had to go through several humiliating situations. From the very beginning, her daughter was worried about her. At the end of the day came the celebration when the nation won a match that the girl could not see because she was detained on the outside of the stadium during the match. However, the celebration can not suppress the question of the rights of women who remain in different parts of the world. Jafar Panahi has made the most of this issue of sex abuse in the context of conventional film and patriarchy. The global tragedy was solved lightly and sometimes with humor, which in turn irritates our being constantly.
