Intruder (L'Intrus), a film directed by French director Claire Denis, is the release of the film. He follows his own spirit in time, space and character. It may be a plot, but what I understand, I picked up from the description on the Netflix DVD case. Frankly, it is likely that we would not know about the movie before we look at it because the viewer can postpone all expectations. The film requires the viewer to think, but he also absorbs the fact that he or she will not fully understand. The human heart is the mystery of the film. Each image casts doubt on its role, its nature and its form. The heart is the intruder, the viewer and Louise. Louis's character plays Michel Subor with the peace and mystery that such a character requires. Honestly, someone could play Louis's character if he owned a wandering, willing and comfortable heart. Nevertheless, there is one Subor; it becomes a movie, its identity is inseparable from it. Many of the film images that persist in my mind revolve around his expressions, vocal, but mainly physical. The intruder is poetic able to capture the tranquility and fullness of movement, but more fluid than any literary form that refuses to take. "Surrealistic" is the term used to describe this film, but perhaps "quasirealistic" is a more appropriate term. Nothing in the movie exists beyond the possibilities of reality; a simple ubiquitous score confirms that by putting in the music a connection between heartbeat and dampened light. <br /> <br /> Watch the trailer several times if you are attracted to visual shots; see the film to see the consequences of the combination of verse and grasp for freedom.
