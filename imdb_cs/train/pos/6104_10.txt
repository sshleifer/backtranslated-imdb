I have to admit that the EROS MOVIE COLLECTION collection must be the one I have the most, as well as one that I have also reviewed. The story is something that really keeps you. Many EROS films have a conspiracy that looks like a hammer that smashed it into pieces before production when you watch it. Everything focuses on sex and who can get along with how many different people come to the end of the movie. And dear God, never look for one of these movies when someone pulls a gun. It does not work that it almost laughs, but you do not want to lose energy. <br /> <br /> "Loss of control" is exactly as his name appears. Hero, the main character (beautiful and gorgeous Kira Reed). Control is the control that man has over his senses, body and feelings. And one person has changed everything for her, almost another woman. But the mirror is broken at the same time. It makes a great movie that I wish I came first! <br /> <br />
