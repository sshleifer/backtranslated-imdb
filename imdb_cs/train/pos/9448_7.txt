It was undoubtedly the most unfavorable film I've ever seen. The first part of the movie, though strange, has a light and entertaining quality. The journey starts with such a peaceful note detailing and emphasizing the beauty of the Appalachian hills. But it is misleading belief. Apparent social problems (inbreeding) and deformation of rural residents are only the first disturbing aspects of the film. I can still hear Bobby's pain, and I shuddered. Lewis's leg persuaded me. Still, while the film was generally very disturbing and worrying, it was some interesting questions. When is it moral or the right to enjoy the life of another? What can we possibly do to morality in some cases or not? And dignity and moral integrity are more important than life itself? Regardless of the conclusions that can be drawn from the film, it is in itself a success (despite some aspects that were cool and terrible).
