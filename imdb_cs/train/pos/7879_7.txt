Like most of the films by Eleanor Powell, it's played along the smartest plots. For some reason - this is explained! - is selected to transport a magnetic mine to Cuba. Good guys and bad boys compete for the mine and who is the one who is confusing. But as always, Powell's dance is excellent and worth the input. And in this Lahr he plays his cowardly lion, stirring warm memories of the 1939 Technicolor film. It is a remarkable advantage to hear a young Frank with that beautiful voice and lean vulnerability he later left for his wise man. The great drummer, Buddy Rich, also has great time with his virtuosity. Take a look at his unique duet with Dorsey Tube Man, Ziggy Elman. I say "unique" perhaps in ignorance, but I do not know any other sequence of drums / trumpets like this on film or recordings. This movie is fun. Even Skelton's hideous man is rather restrained. Powell again shows that he is the greatest film dancer ever.
