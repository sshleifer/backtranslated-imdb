The movie was fine, quite fun. The cast was pretty good, and I'll look at what I'm going to mention - Glenn Quinn was great, and he's the reason why he's watching this movie. He played a selfish "evil" friend and band manager great! <br /> <br /> There are plenty of songs in this movie to make "Beyond Gravity", but it's not really a surprise movie to make VH1. However, if soft rock / pop music is not for someone who likes it, it could also get behind the scenes. The scene of a band that is trying to get to LA in LA but has to overcome many obstacles on the way is not quite original, but quite fun, with some surprising land being alternating here and there.
