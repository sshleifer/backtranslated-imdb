One thing I've always liked about Robert Ludlum's thrillers is just when you think you've figured it out is totally different. In this movie, there are so many twists and turns that I have a sore throat. "One thing I like director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that he can rely on direct and in this case he writes (with his brother Rick) a good story. Now add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper , Lara Flynn Boyle and JT Walsh are cast and you have a story that keeps you interested, even if they play characters that all of them are perfect, Dahl seems to bring the best of the people, and it keeps you and interests you all the way end.
