I must say that the events of September 11 did not hit me until I saw this document. It took me a year to deal with this devastation. I was the one who changed the station on the radio and the channel on the television if the tower talked. I was sick when I heard about it. When it was broadcast on TV a year and a day later, I lifted my eyes. It was the first time I'd cried from the attack. I highly recommend this document. I'm watching it now on TV, 5 years later, and still crying for tragedies. The fact that this contains one of the only videos of the first aircraft that hit the tower is amazing. It was an accident, and he looked where he got it. These two brothers wanted me to be there to help them.
