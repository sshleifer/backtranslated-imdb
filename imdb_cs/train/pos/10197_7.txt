Well, it's been a long year and I went back to reviewing the final movie for 2004. Panaghoy Sa Suba (Call of the River) ranks second in the recent Metro Manila Film Festival. As expected, it did not work so well in the box because it was too admirable for ordinary audiences, especially because the MMFF is the season when many families go out to watch movies. quite fascinating to see a movie that was not in Filipino or English playing on the screen. I thought Cesar Montano did a good job as a star as well as a director. His great vision and creativity really helped this film. He was also very effective as the main star and was able to express the wide range of emotions that were required for the film. Rebecca Lusterio, a young actress, was also powerful. She did a great job portraying Bikay, the younger sister Duroy. I hope to see her in many other film projects in the future, perhaps dare to other genres. I think that the fact that this film was in its local dialect really helped her. Some camera shots in the movie were very good. The scenery was breathtaking, even though I thought that if less effort looked different. As for the story, I feel that writers could get even more involved in the life of those smaller characters of the film. I'm sure I will not spoil the story of this movie.
