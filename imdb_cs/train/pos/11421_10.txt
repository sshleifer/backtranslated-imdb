I do not know what the previous reviewer was watching, but I think they are reviews, personal tastes. The loss in this film was depth, a very deep film, many layers of emotion, affecting. The affairs of detained love because of subordinate social beliefs, taboos of time and class, racial relations are not in a very good state of equality, guilt, suffering, hate, confusion, very dark emotional I thought that under the skin you have to showcase the film, which is moving, is not slow, as mentioned earlier, it releases into the flow of the film, the emotions are reflected, the figures uncover their defects, their ugly inner, excellent and really very cruel!
