Microphones are classic Stooge short. Boys are real repairers working on a radio station, and in a few horses in the transmitting cabin, Curly's perfect imitation of the recording of "Voice of the Spring" is confused with the real thing, which leads to a radio contract and a horrific music party. The trio is a funny rendition of the quintet from "Lucia de L'Amamore" is especially fun. There is no doubt that this is a vital consideration for the Stooge fans. Although the evidence of Curly's health failure is visible in his face and voice, his performance is amazing and is probably the last look of old Curly. Some fans think that "Bird in the Hand" is the last big Curly Short, but his rough voice and slow motion are too difficult to watch.
