Suraj Barjatya is the best in marriage movies. And here it is; back to its foundations on Vivaah. As the story goes, it's a story of getting married. A movie that you can watch with your entire family around you. A film that you will not hate, you watch yourself. The story is simple, but the music is good, the cinematography is excellent, the direction is best, everything about the movie has its own class. There are plenty of scenes that scream at you and I'm sure you are watching a movie with your sweetheart, and you will definitely keep your second hand until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Shahid & Amrita Iodi gave us earlier hits movies like Ishq Vishq and Shikhar. Though Shikhar was a good movie, it was not well received by the public. It's really Shahid & Amrita.
