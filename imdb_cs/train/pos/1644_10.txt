I saw the other half of this movie about a year ago and was very happy to finally find it on DVD. I recently watched several serials about realism on PBS about ranch, etc. None of them were so close to telling the story of how this movie is doing. Based on reality REAL, without any strikes, bleak, happy, tragic and instructive, it is a film that should be shown to students or anyone interested in morning life. Take a gentle action on the both Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell side to a well-done script. The initial loan states that this was a grant provided through the National Humanities Foundation. If it's a product, we could pay taxes, I'd like to see more. I strongly recommend and encourage people to a friend if you saw them and enjoyed the movie.
