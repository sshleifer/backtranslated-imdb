I think the creators of this film concept deserve much more appreciation than they ever received. It is not, of course, a good Oscar movie, but at least for me this film has left a lasting impression since I first spotted it in 1984 (in the theater). <br /> <br /> I do not think this is (and I hope it is not) a spoiler, but: Imagine that you will act according to your impulses. Make the first thought that appears in your head and says the first words in your mouth ... No restraint, no consciousness, nothing returns you from saying or doing things that as intelligent adults we know we should not actually say or do. If anything, this film just scratches the surface - it's not as far as it could go. <br /> <br /> At a time when Hollywood seems to be obsessed with the remake of older "classics" to try to make money today, it would not be nice to see that it is a remake of an older film of modest success, due to the transfer to next level? To go a step further, or even explore what the original crew did not do, could not or could not deal with 20 years ago? <br /> <br /> This is just my opinion. :O)
