A really sweet film that has some similarities to the hit "My Sassy Girl" in 2001, but is able to enchant most of the time. The biggest applause should be attended by two potential customers. Ha-Neul Kim is sweet and weird, Sang-woo Kwon is both attractive and rebellious. Chemistry between the two is very good. Director Kyeong-hyeong Kim uses some CG-inserts to illustrate the paintings and also offers impressive combat scenes in which Sang-woo Kwon can shine. Here I liked him much better than in the highly overvalued "Volcano High". And that boy has a future - those looks, techniques of fighting and romantic leadership. That's not bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I can shorten it: Nice movie. My rating: 7/10
