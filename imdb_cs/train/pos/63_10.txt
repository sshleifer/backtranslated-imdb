This movie is so incomprehensible that it is not funny. If you think this is going to be a shot, stay calm. This deals with the effects and trauma that survivors must survive. Even detectives are looking for answers ... why? Fantastic acting from two leading ladies, as we see that those we ignore are affected by the same things that affect us. Yes, the tongue is sometimes rough, but the characters are well suited. Some free ends are left or unanswered, but all movies have these. The main issues are addressed, and this film is a major statement about how all adults feel after such major events. Highly recommended for teens and adults.
