I love all the films by Michael Landon Jr. And Michael Landon Jr, who had taken Dale Midkiff as "Clark Davis," could not have been better. Dale Midkiff has a way to pull that figure. <br /> <br /> This movie kept me charming from start to finish. The death of the Missie & Willies little girl with Clarks' timing visit was only the timing of the gods. How they dealt with death and how Clark helped them, it was from Father's love. Although there are 3 films in front of this [Love Comes Softly, Loves Enduring Promise & Loves Long Journey] I feel that you can see and understand this movie. Still, leave and you want to see the previous 3 movies due to the history of all the characters behind them. <br /> <br /> Michael Landon Jr. is an excellent director I look forward to many more films from him in the future.
