Batman: The Secret of Batwoman is the latest animated Batman directly to the video / DVD movie being released. (Minor Spoilers Ahead) The plot turns around a new criminal, Batwoman, who appears to be personally involved for any reason in stopping large weapons. <br /> <br /> While the movie is interesting, it's not as good as "Mask of Phantasm," "Sub-Zero," or "Return of the Joker". The main reason is that it does not give the emotional attraction of other films. At the end of this movie, we really do not like someone like the others, especially "Sub-Zero." There is no real tragedy that would make other animated films here. Even Batwoman is not really a "tragic" figure (like Mr Freeze or Phantasm). Not only that, but Batter's alter ego looks so incredibly "stiff" and boring that the viewer really does not care what happened to her that caused her to put her on the mask or what happened at the end and lying there the main reason we do not have this particular emotional attraction. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I made the movie nice. He has his moments, for example when the audience finds out who is really a Batwoman, and sees the old return of the villain, which was last seen in the original "Batman: The Animated Series". Activity is also very pleasant with several exciting moments. <br /> <br /> If the Batwoman background was more interesting, this movie would be better in "My Jump" than in "The Return of the Joker", but as it is now, it is in 4th (4th). As far as animation is concerned, it's the same as the New Batman Adventures cartoon from the mid-to the late nineties. Score is not as unforgettable as the previous 3 animated Batman movies, but it's still good. <br /> <br /> I recommend buying this DVD because, despite its mistakes, it's nice. But remember, it's not as good as other animated movies Batman. <br /> <br /> 7/10
