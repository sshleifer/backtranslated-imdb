Well, this movie is really hard. In order to be equal to you, this movie does not contain a very boring story, nore makes it 'want' to know how it will end ... but I will tell you something now ... I've never been so tense and jumped before in my life! This movie certainly adds jump and excitement! To be fair, I watched it almost midnight, so I was also sleepy, so maybe it explains why I was nervous ... or perhaps because this movie is in this aspect! Basically it's a couple who lose their child in a tragic event. They decide to move in the mountains and rent huts in the mountains ... everyone looks calm and calm until they have their first visitors (I think she is a sister of the main character and she brings her husband) ... at night husband speaks noise ... it checks and when things start really bad ... they will not stay the next day and tell the couple they should leave as quickly as something is wrong ... shorten the long short story ... eventually find out what has taken place in this house over the last few years and decides to take care of it. It's not a Hollywood blockbuster, it has a huge budget, but please do not let it separate you. It's scary, tense and very unbearable! Just try :)
