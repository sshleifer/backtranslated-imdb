This is what a movie should be when trying to capture the essence of what is very unreal. It has this brown tone, which is rarely captured in the movie, feels like a sequence of dreams, and really moves you into a dark memory. The children were incredibly trustworthy and I expect they will have some things in the future. A very natural act for these young people, I do not know if Bill is out of them, or it's so good, but not less excellent. Bill scored as far as I was concerned, and to KevNJeff's commentary on Mr. Paxton, who was acting wrong, what he could do in this role. In my opinion, he played quite well. It comes from someone who said Hamlet was good (Ethan Hawke Version?) Wow ......... Do not listen to his comments. Great movement to make you feel uncomfortable, if that's what you want? Cinematography also gets an average rating.
