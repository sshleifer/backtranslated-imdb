This is My Bush is a live action project created by South Park developers Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The show was canceled after one season, not because of bad reviews (actually good reviews), but because it was very expensive. That's my bush is quite funny spoof of the average network TV sitcom. It's also a political satire. Now it's not as close as South Park, but it's a very fun spoof of sitcoms and quite good political satire. the boy who plays in my bushi looks a lot like him! If you find a show, check out this. You have a lot of laughter! <br /> <br /> 9/10
