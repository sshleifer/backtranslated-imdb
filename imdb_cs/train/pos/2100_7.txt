Before going to politics or public service, Glenda Jackson was one of the best British film actresses. This film shows her talent even though she has a supportive role in a star cast that includes Julie Christie as Kitty, the wife of the British royal captain who has lost her last 20 years, and Jenny played the American Ann-Margret almost unrecognizable as a silly sister. Alan Bates plays a captain who suffers a shock-induced loss of memory during World War I. Sir Ian Holm has a smaller role as a doctor treating him. You see familiar faces like Sheila Keith, Patsy Byrne and Frank Finlay. You can not help, but watch how Glenda plays a charming woman in the house and the first true love of the captain but come from different classes. It's not the biggest movie, but it's good to see the incredible talent of Glendy. She is still a fantastic actress, comedy or drama. Makes Margaret Gray a fairy-tale figure and you know why the royal captain fell in love with her.
