My family watched as Arthur Bach stumbled and stammered from the moment the movie first came out. We have most of the lines memorable. I looked at it two weeks ago, and yet I'm used to a simple humor and a look at the life Dudley Moore renders. Liza Minelli did a great job as a side kick - even though I'm not her biggest fan. This movie just allows me to watch movies. My favorite scene is when Arthur visits the house of his fiancee. His conversation with the valet and Susan's father is crazy. The line from the butler: "Would you wait in the library?", Followed by Arthur's answer: "Yes, I would, the bathroom is out of the question", it's my NEWMAIL notification on my computer. "Arthur is really" fun stuff "!
