This movie is a pitfalls of punk rock fun from beginning to end. Ramones, government princes of the late 70's Punk Rock, look like themselves. PJ Soles plays as Riff Randle, a rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock'n roll. Riff is obsessed with writing songs for Ramones, her favorite rock band. She keeps Rockin 'school, and encourages her college students to join her in her jubilee antics. Meanwhile, the school that Riff attends has just hired a brand new director named Ms. Togar. It's a tall, intimidating Amazon woman. And she promises to students "toe-line". She even has several students who act as monitors who report dirt with her other classmates. Ms. Togar is particularly determined to get Riffa and stop Riff's anarchist shenanigans. But Riff has clever ways to Togar, every step. Kudos to the outstanding performance of Mary Woron, in her role as Togaro. Mary is a legendary B movie actress. And in this film, Fascist Mrs. Togar, with a happy enjoyment. PJ Soles as Riff, converts electrifying performance. Clint Howard as a duplicate Eaglebauer has a lot of fun with his role. Ramones are playing many of their hits in this movie. And so the viewer sees why Ramones were so influential in the 1970s punk rock scene. Sure, it's a good film of the Ramones fans. But even if you are not in Ramones or Punk Rock, this movie is an amazing explosion (literally) of energy entertainment.
