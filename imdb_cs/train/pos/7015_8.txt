Ben Thomas (Smith) plays an IRS agent who practically gives the store all the surprises. What is an IRS agent? <br /> <br /> Most of us have heard the IRS agent say, "Hello, I'm from the IRS, I'm here to help you." Our smile then spreads to laughter, which says, "Yeah, well." As you get further and further into this story, you can not think of this guy. He goes easily to those who are audited. What is his motive? Is he from another planet, an angel, a rich man who wants to do good? It helps so much that we want our auditor to learn, of course. Hey, IRS, are you listening? (you are kidding, just joking) The pace of the movie is perfect and so much that the tracks have been ignored to tell me what's really going on. An intense, repetitive intense focus was on Ben and stays there. The whole movie works just because of Ben when we try to find him, and I have not seen any traces (which tracks are you talking about, Willis?). It was not reading the box before watching the movie on DVD was a better way to go here. By the end of the movie I finally put it together. Well, that was clear. And yes, it's over the top, but still a great story, mostly due to Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Will Smith was nominated for Best Actor Award. The rest of the cast was also very good. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's over the top and in spite of great acting, and when you finally get all the answers, you have to realize that the movie's message is not right. What's the message? Believe me, you will not need too many tracks to find out. I did not do it. <br /> <br /> Violence: No. Sex: Yes, but nothing to excite you. Bland. Nudity: No. Language: No
