Surprisingly, she is not awful and well animated for one of Disney's straight videos. Just like the previous one (The Lion King 2), I was glad that Disney brought most of the original voice actors, making a big difference and maintaining a good level of traditional animation. The conspiracy will go a little after a while, but we are scattered by an endless series of jokes from joyful to dull. To divide up the details and jokes, they gave us some stupid musical sequences that resemble jokes, from entertainment to a fast journey into the fridge. Most of the moments, like the MST3K, are unimpressive and full of untapped potential, and do not really add anything to the movie to become vehicles for an hour of long flash. New characters are at least sympathetic and old characters are beyond their history, so I can not let them. Overall, this film is not bad and makes a nice frivolous fill between the more serious Lion King titles.
