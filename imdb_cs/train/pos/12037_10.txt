The woman in black was British for a television film that was first screened at the BBC on Christmave Eve in 1989 and again in 1992. I believe American TV was held in A & E. It was released on VHS in Britain in the early 1990s, but it was out of print. The US company later released it on DVD, but this version was also sold out. According to the book's author's website, movie rights are now owned by someone else and will not be released again and unofficial bootlegs will be sold on eBay. <br /> <br /> For the first time I heard about the movie and I had to look. I found a copy on eBay for about $ 28. It is certain that it is fake from the seller in the Far East, although the DVD says: "made in Canada," ha ha. But it's a good copy, and you can not really break labels with a bootleg to release things that are rare, printed and lost in legal disputes. I like the movie. This is a period that was in the 1920s with all the very authentic and quaint British settings of that time. The woman in black is very atmospheric and dark. For the most part, the film is very low, but effective and frightening. There is no self-proclaimed gore, violence, or even no special effects, but The Woman In Black is still able to create absolutely cool moments. It's a cool classic style ghost movie. The film itself looks like it was made in the 1930s, except for color. Without the glimpse of all modern horror films, I'm afraid this movie will always be a lost jewel. For me it is one of my favorite times.
