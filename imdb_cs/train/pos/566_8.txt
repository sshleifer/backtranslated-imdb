Surprisingly interesting western from the director, who had only a few peers in the genre. Like the other photos from Anthony Mann, The Far Country combines a powerful story about cooking with torn knowledge of influential sceneries. They both play among some of Mann's peccadilles as honor, integrity, betrayal and, of course, death! The story is seen by lucky luck partners Jeff Webster {James Stewart} and Ben Tatum {Walter Brennan} traveling to Oregon territory with cattle herds. Realizing the flourishing golden boom, they want to make a net profit selling cattle in Klondike. When they arrive at Skagway, they will find a self-appointed judge Mr. John McIntire prepared to administer justice to the Webstore because Webster has broken the law, whether it be an honorable cause. In Gannon's sentence, he takes a partner from the herd, but steals them back and heads across the Canadian border to Dawson - with Gannon and his men in hot pursuit. Here the beautiful women and the humble and lawless city will fill the fates of all those involved. Interesting from the beginning to the end, Far County has a great benefit from James Stewart's bubbling {anti} hero in the waiting portrait, and Mann is the smooth direction of the tight Borden Chase script. Cinematography by William H. Daniels is superlative that he does not make any hints of current DVD prints, and the film has some surprises and "will it be used?" the core of reeling. Paying dividends for the show for the hot genres of fans, it still remains something of an important watch for the first timers to embark on the gorgeous but dark Western world of Anthony Mann and James Stewart. 8/10
