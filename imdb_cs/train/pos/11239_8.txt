The hidden border is remarkable for being the longest running Star Trek fans on the Internet. While the quality of production is not at the same level as the production of fans like Starship Exeter or New Voyages, the hidden boundary focuses predominantly on the story, and in this respect it really is going to be. Hidden Frontier has no physical sets; Instead, the actors shoot against the green screen and the background is digitally inserted. One of the greatest successes of the Hidden Frontier is the total amount of work they have created. One way to do this is to insert virtual files at the time of filming, not in postproduction. While it saves a lot of time, it is also worth noting that the quality of the final shot is not as high as if it were produced in postproduction, although it still serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> While it does not have to be every cup of tea, Hidden Frontier is worth the shot, though you might be best when you start watching the third season, because that's where manufacturers really start to step in.
