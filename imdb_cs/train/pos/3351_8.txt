Very good western. It was the first time that writer Richard Wilson shot the film, and it was the first time for Samuel Goldwyn Junior as a producer. It is a pleasure to see the very young and pretty Angie Dickinson as a saloon girl. Robert Mitchum is coming to this city where the criminals rule and hired him as a city dweller, but people are afraid they will go too far, even for the damage he has done to city companies. In the story there are some similarities with "Warlock", which was made in 1959. This film keeps a very fast and exciting pace, it really keeps you on the edge.
