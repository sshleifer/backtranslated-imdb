"Yokai Daisenso" is a children's film by Takashi Miike, but as you can expect, it's probably a bit dark and scary for the younger. However, older children can eat well, that is, when playing dubbed in English. The story is about a young boy who moved to his mother and lived with his grandfather after divorce. During the village festival, the boy is chosen as "Kirin's rider", great honor, but with this honor comes a lot of danger and adventure, of course. <br /> <br /> There are women in the white mini skirt, go-go boots and horned hair, joining the evil Yokai to turn to the displeasure of people and throwing objects against them. And this evil has manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster that heads to the city of rage itself, Tokyo. One pretty funny scene has two remnants that track a monster over the city ... one says: "Oh, that's just Gamer." The young boy associated with Yokai, a monster of his kind, mostly benign, isolated from the people, and all of Yokai in Japan joined together to fight evil. <br /> <br /> In many ways, Miike & Crew took over the Yokai movies from the late 1960s and 1970s and transformed them into a modern adventure film for older children, which also combines some special mechanical monsters who were thinking about "Transformers ". The look and feel of the movie are great, the effects are fun and some of the humor just floats directly over the children's heads, but the older ones can enjoy it. As for adults, there is not much to be disliked, if you are a fan of Japanese monstrous movies, you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Cool & fun things, sometimes dark but maybe it's just Miike ... and what a wild ride. 8 out of 10.
