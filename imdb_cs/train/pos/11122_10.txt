When we started watching this series on the cable, I did not know how it would be addictive. Even if you hate the character, you keep it because they are so well-developed, you can almost understand why they react to frustration, fear, greed or temptation as they do it. It's almost like a viewer who experiences one of Krivork's curves. I can not understand why Adriana will use Kristopher verbally, physically and emotionally, but I just have to read the newspaper to see how many women can and can tolerate such behavior. Carmella has a dream house, an infinite supply of expensive things, but I'm sure she gives up a loving and loyal husband - or maybe not. That's why I'm watching. No matter how many times you look at an episode, you can find something you missed the first five times. We even watched episodes out of order (watch Season 1 late at night with ads, but the whole language, A & E with censored language, repeat on the movie network) - whenever they are, we are there. We were completely spoiled. <br /> <br /> I also like Malaprop. "Albacore around my neck" is my favorite Johnny Boy. When these gems have entered our vocabulary, it is a sign that I should get my life. I will, when the series ends, and gather all the DVDs and I'll put the collection into my will.
