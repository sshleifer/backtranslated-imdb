One of my favorite movies I first saw when I was about ten, which is probably a lot of humor. Although humor certainly has a spell. Expect the usual Askey & Murdoch banter so popular in its time, with lots of interesting, unpredictable co-characters. Mistress with a parrot, a couple to marry and having trouble with her, and my favorite station director, 'No one knows where it comes from ... No one knows where it goes ...' Interestingly, the ghost train was written by Arnold Ridley of Dads Army of Glory (Private Godfrey Doctor) Watch it on a rainy Sunday afternoon after lunch and smile.
