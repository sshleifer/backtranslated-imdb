Last night, he watched this French horror film, and he liked it a lot. The whole movie takes place in a prison cell with three prisoners who find a handwritten wall journal from a serial killer who escaped jail 20 years ago without leaving his cell. When they look at the diary, they find themselves immersed in black art and commands that could be their way out of cell and freedom. What he finds out is something completely different, and he scares the least. I like low-budget horror films that deliver goods in a fairly high quality way and tell a good story. This movie does just that, despite the fact that it takes a while to go. The result and the horror they relieve is very interesting for me and I enjoyed the ride. It's not a lot of gore, but that would not suit the story, though gore is pretty good.
