I admit I was a little afraid when I first saw the previews of this film. Was the VH-1 on the hollow ground? I mean, Harris and Quinn do not really look or even sound like John or Paul. But I have to admit that this film really surprised me. It's far from the exploitation I expected. Instead, it is a study of attitudes, a low key, a moody, and finally a warm-blooded view of friendship and the ultimate lesson we all teach: it is hard, if not impossible, to capture what once before, and what has experienced us.
