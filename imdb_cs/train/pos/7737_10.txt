If you are such a huge fan of an author, as I am from Jim Thompson, it can be quite daring when their work is turned into a movie. This is not the case when Scott Foley published after DARK MY SWEET. A thrilling, sexually charged noir classics that closely monitors and makes great justice in the original text. Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward may well represent their career. And always the phenomenal Bruce Dern could even learn with this. Like Thompson's book, this film creates a dark and surrealist world where passion overcomes logic, and the double cross is never far away. He has to see for all the fans a great movie noir. **** !!!
