Omigosh, that's really the worst movie I've ever seen. Let's say I love horror movies, it's underestimate and I've seen piles (due to limited access to New Zealand, that's quite a lot) but I never had to sleep with the light ... until I saw The Grudge. Some may say it's the tear-off of The Ring (both based on Japanese horror films), both similar (yet other) storylines, but Grudge has his own as a frightening film - to see in the cinema, even screaming at a certain place in the movie. Acting is great, especially from supportive characters - KaDee Strickland is a fantastic and stealing show, he is such an enthusiastic person. Jason Behr is really hottie and William Mapother seems to have fun. However, while I'm normally a fan of Cleo DuVallo, it does not seem to look really good in this movie. It is likely that the supporting characters have gained the deepest story, but it does not seem to be there everywhere. As for Sarah Michelle Gellar, well, it remains the same in all of my films and roles, is not it? The ghosts were really scary, the music and sound effects were cool (especially the noise that was caused when KaDee Strickland's character responded by phone in her apartment), the end was also cool. Super highly recommended. 9/10
