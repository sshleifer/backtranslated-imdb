I do not know why people think it's such a bad movie. Her good plot, some good action and change of location for Harry will not hurt. Make sure some of his offensive and free, but it's not the only movie like this. Eastwood is in good shape like Dirty Harry, and in this movie I liked Pat Hingle as a policeman. If you like DIRTY HARRY, then you should see this, its much better than THE DEAD POOL. 4/5
