Okay, here's Jack Frost. I looked at the morphing box for the VHS cassette, and I thought it looked interesting. I'll rent her and take her home. The boy was right, it's interesting. They give serial killers to ghosts in dreams, dead bodies and all day machines. But it must be the most unique place to give the spirit of a serial killer. In the body of the snowman. I liked all the friendly snowmen that were driving through the countryside, the pot holder, the snowball, etc. I like an actress who played Jack, having fun with the killer who did not really see FREDDY KRUGGER. That's true, I said. FREDDY KRUGGER. It's a "cool" level. I wish some of the puppet effects were better, the movements in the mouth could be better adjusted. But I do not have a wing except for a small budget. Casting does a great job, there are some great single inserts and fear to make some hardcore horror fan jump. Everyone and everyone, great story, good effects, great dialogue and great cast. I give JACK FROST ... 9 stars
