I thought it was a pretty good movie and should be released to theaters first. It would not be a big blockade, but it would be good money. The movie has tension and makes you wonder how much is happening in the real world. Justin Timberlake did a good job. I did not expect Justin Timberlake to do such a good job. Since he is his first film, he did a good job. It's a movie that's good for you to pick and watch out for when you just do not know what you want to rent that night. It should work quite well. The cast was great. So I strongly recommend everyone to check this movie!
