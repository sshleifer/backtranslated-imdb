Yes, Giorgio, it's a good movie. Little romance, great music, beautiful scenery, comedy (a great fight with food) and a little hot-tempered flavor are ingredients Yes, Giorgio. Every movie fan would enjoy this movie. Those who require massive special effects should look elsewhere. Most of us now and there need a little escape and how to do it better than a pleasure for the eyes, ears and hearts? You must see!
