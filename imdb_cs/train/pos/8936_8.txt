After "Beau travail" everyone is waiting for Claire Denis to make a subsequent masterpiece that never happened. Now he has it. Denis in this film moves a quantum leap, orgy of gorgeous cinematography, elliptical adaptations, and deliberately hidden story events that make them feel strange and even strange. There is a nominal plot (derived partly from the book of the same name by Jean-Luc Nancy) about a mature man who needs a heart transplant and who is looking for a Tahitian son he has long since left; but it is mainly the study of the idea of ​​personal and cultural intrusion. It takes a few insights to fully understand, and the pacing problems are coming to an end, but it is even more advanced and more gripping than anything I've seen this year. Leave it at your own risk.
