This movie is an extremely entertaining and lively story about an orphanage who has financial difficulties. When the director goes on holiday, his father agrees to temporarily go into service. <br /> <br /> This is positively the best job ever done by Leslie Nielson. His idea in the movie for renting children is instantly innovative and his selling techniques will surely make you laugh. The little girl in this movie is so nice and charming that I know I will never forget it. Just make sure you do not miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> Such a great family fun is so rare today. If you go to slightly corroded pictures with happy endings, go to this! I could watch it again and again, and I often do it! My only complaint about this movie is that it's hard to find a copy.
