The real story of the murder (in Kansas in 1959) (Perry and Dick, two former criminals who farewell to a distant house on a rainy evening to steal and kill anyone they've met). Richard Brooks directed the cool and disturbing book Capote about the reasons that led these children to commit a crime (Are they natural born killers?). Crime scenes are very brutal and scary because of the lack of senses and the reasons why we were witnesses. Amazing black and white cinematography by Conande Hall, an excellent country-road music score by Quincy Jones, an amazing performance in two major roles by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, and for the first time in the movie a sad comment on the death penalty in the last moments before their death. Jones, Hall and Brooks (as a director and writer for the adapted screenplay) are nominated for an Oscar. Grip, superbly controlled and frightening, one of the best films of this decade
