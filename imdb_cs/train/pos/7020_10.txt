* Marking where spoilers are! Overall comments: If you can take a serious movie, check out this. You have an open mind and you will enjoy it. Do not leave the theater because you're confused about what's going on! The film fits well in the second half. I will take my mother to see her again when the film opens officially. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to see it a few weeks ago when Will went to show the movie. He was great - he spent a lot of time with the fans. Thank you for the photo of Will! About Will's Performance: Many times when you see a movie with an actor who is really famous for some other movie / show, you always think about them in their current performances just like you think about their past performances. This is not the case of Will Smith in this movie. I did not see Fresh Prince (lol) when I watched this movie. In this very, very serious role he was absolutely convincing. He became enormously like an actor. I think that Oscar will at least attract this performance. <br /> <br /> About his character: Ben is very confrontational and tormented. It's sad ... guilty ... very determined, but very frightened. Very true to yourself. His character has a lot of depth ... and somehow Will managed to bring it to life. About Emily (Rosario): Rosario has done a pretty job portraying Emily, a woman who is very tax-free. Perhaps it's not the bright star Will in this movie, but she was very convincing. I think her character just did not work as much as Will did. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy (without spoilers): I admit that I do not like the film until the second half. I did not know that nothing was going on in the movie and nothing made sense until the second part or so. But when things eventually come together, wow. Surprisingly well written and well thought out. It's an extremely intense movie that really keeps you. <br /> <br /> In fact, a lot of you are watching. In the theater I was in, most people cried to the end - even the grown men. When you realize what Ben does and why it's a very strong moment ... ******* Smaller SPOILERS ***** It's hard to talk about the plot without putting the main things off. I feel like you know too much about this movie is really destroying. In the movie I was having fun, there was a lot of symbolism. I will mention it here (without trying to put a lot off). <br /> <br /> - The fish that Ben kept in his hotel room. It does not make sense at first. There were lots of huts in the movie when people realized the reality of the fish. <br /> <br /> - I hated Ben at the beginning of the movie. By the end of that I loved him and hated him. That's convincing Will. I thought Ben was Ezra a huge blockbuster, a blind man who was just trying to make his way around the world. Why he treated Ezra like that, he also explained a lot later in the film. But wait. Everything in this movie: wait. <br /> <br /> -Ben is basically a good guy who made a big mistake to forgive him. I still do not know if he is doing what he does because he's trying to get rid of his own guilt or if he really wanted to help people. I think it's a little bit ... I think he wanted to help people, but he also got rid of his past. I love his character. You love him and you hate him because you realize that what he does is not amazing. You hate him for what he does for himself (as a very good person), both physically and emotionally. Nice work.
