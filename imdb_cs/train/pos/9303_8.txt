When you see this movie, you should notice that it's not a normal movie. He has no real story of just the characters, a group of gangster characters who are gathered in perfect harmony. Dialogue is amazing, you can just lay back and listen. The film excels in why it is difficult to find the right way to describe it. <br /> <br /> That's why the user comments on this movie is so mixed. <br /> <br /> Love the movie and recommend it to everyone who likes the lines and things that differ from the "normal". You can not really put a finger on what's so amazing that it's just a comic world where gangsters rule. Instead of love and danger. A movie that you can see more than once.
