Wow I liked this movie, William H. Macy is great as a silent hit-man Alex. <br /> <br /> All the performances are really good, the plot is interesting and fun. <br /> <br /> Alex, a married hit-man (like his father) with a young son, is going through a middle-aged crisis and wants to end family business, and he will go to the psychiatrist for help and meet young freelancers will be the spirit of Sarah, which she falls in love with. One day Alex does not know what to do when he gets a job to kill the guy he knows. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching it if you like mature interesting movies. <br /> <br /> 8 stars = very good
