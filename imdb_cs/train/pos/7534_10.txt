I totally disagree with other reviews. All basically negative. I got a chance on this movie and was glad I did it. Glad really. I did not find anything wrong with it. Nothing period. The script is original. The actors are all sympathetic and convincing .Dee Smart reminded me of Marcia Brady of Brady Bunch.But this gal really can act.The setting in the Australian outback is perfect.Unknown scenery.Great soundtrack, ie Paul Kelly.God bless Paul Kelly.The Cranberries are here.I saw this movie twice in less than 24 hours. I'll probably watch it again. It's interesting. It makes you think. It is (probably) better than the nine tenths of the so-called Hollywood burgers that were also during this time. Back Of Beyond is sympathetic. Somebody photographed the movie. I could not find anything wrong with it. Check it out! My first review!
