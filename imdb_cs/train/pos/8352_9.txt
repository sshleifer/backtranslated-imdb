This film is a stunning piece that convinces even the most popular viewer that Gerard Depardieu is one of the best film actors of the last 50 years. His performance is shocked, entertained, disgusting, and spells you while he leaves you breathless. This film was filmed in the early days of his film career and is very brutal but still able to show off the Depardieu Championship. If he has to see for every fan of Depardieu and far from his best start work.
