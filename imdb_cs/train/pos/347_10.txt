Valentine's Day is now one of my favorite slasher films. Death scenes are complicated and most acting is good. Marley Shelton has taken great pride in female leadership (much better than Jennifer Love Hewitt in "I Know ..."). David Boreanaz, who is the main reason why I saw this movie, played a very small role but played well. An exception to the list of good actors is Denise Richards. It was terrible. The only scene I wanted to see was * SPOILER * her death scene. Overall, it's a good movie you can watch. You should definitely watch it before looking back at "Scream" or "I Know ...".
