Costumes and makeup were great, there were some extraordinarily funny lines and roles for Jim Carrey. Carrey did the kind of work that could be done because of the rather unsatisfactory writing of scripts. Sure, it was mostly a movie for kids, but if you are going to spend so much money making a movie, you really should at least get the story to get enough body to go beyond that Dr. Seuss. I was expecting more from Ron Howard. It is worth seeing, but it lacks the necessary qualities to become a major classic, by any measure.
