A true dark noir movie and a very graphic film, the nice story of a man who was trying to redeem it may have left too late. Visually, there are some really nice scenes artistically amazing what can be done with a minimum budget. Full marks for Gareth Maxwell Roberts and I'm looking forward to another project with new ideas, though I hope other British actors will be great. Lisa Ray looked beautiful that she had not seen her before and hoped she would see her again in the future. They're all sex, drugs, and violence. Bring it. I would definitely say that you are hiring him and checking that you are in the mood for the hemisphere.
