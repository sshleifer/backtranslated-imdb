Johnny and June Carter Cash funded this film, which is a traditional rendering of gospel stories. The music is great, you have a real sense of how the world of Jesus looked (even I was there), and June weighs in Mary Magdalene. Money story is also good. <br /> <br /> But .... <br /> <br /> 1. The actor who played Jesus was a miscastast. 2. There is no story like a Cash story that contains some of his faith-based music. 3. Since it is insurmountable, I doubt we will see this distribution again. <br /> <br /> I would like to buy a CD. <br /> <br /> Tom Paine Texas, USA
