"My Left Foot" is a pretty impressive film that tells the story of Christy Brown, an artist who was pollinated by the cerebral palsy and learned to draw with his left foot, the only end of his body over which he had control. Daniel Day-Lewis won his first Oscar as the best actor for this film, which I'm not quite sure I deserve but is still remarkable. Day-Lewis gives Brown a realistic and sometimes almost funny touch. Brenda Fricker, like Brown's devoted mother, also won the Oscar for a credible and touching role. My problem with this movie is that it's sometimes too real. When Brown is desperate and has to help someone and do everything his left foot, the film can be difficult to watch. This often gives him a depressing feeling that can turn off some viewers for a while. However, if you look beyond that, you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have trouble and other difficulties to overcome. Those of us who are not crippled and are still considered to be problems are inspired by this film, because if something worse than we can deal with their difficulties, we can certainly do the same. Well done, sometimes pleasant but hard to look at. It does not have to be for all but bad. <br /> <br />
