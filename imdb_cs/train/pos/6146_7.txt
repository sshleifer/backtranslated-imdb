Perhaps Disney was hoping for another Mary Poppins, but that's a very different story, and Angela is stunning that she was a very different actress from great Julie Andrews. He said Lansbury is perfectly occupied and provides magical performance. There is something delicately dotted about her character and she is endowed with the wonderful support of David Tomlinson. Tomilinson can wear a melody, but she's not like a singer. It does not matter that he was such a talented actor you hardly notice. There are some great cameras from a lot of beloved stars of another time like Roddy McDowel who gives the winning performance and much loved Tessie OShea who does very little but his nice to see the old gal again. It is also beautiful to see Sam Jaffe and King of English television Bruce Forsythe in small roles. The scores include several beautiful songs, especially "The briny sea" and "The Age of Not Believing". The large Portabello Road is stretched to the limit, but has a lot of theatricality. The effects look a little clich√© today, but the scene with the German invaders that attack the wildest army in the film is quite impressive. Children are not as uncomfortable as other films, but one tries to understand what the youngest boy says. I loved the marching song of the home army. The home guard was very important for Great Britain and it is a warm tribute. The animation is beautiful, much better than Pixar, which I consider grotesque. A hot happy movie and its wonder that it did not happen on the stage.
