There is often a loud, sometimes sad, story about the two divorced boys - Lemmon, a pure "house husband", and Matthau and a slob sportswriter - who decide to live together to cut spending. <br /> <br /> Nicely photographed and directed. The scenario is very spiny - that means there are always more than one side on almost every line. A particularly funny scene involves 2 British sisters (Evans and Shelley) who seem amused by what someone says, but when Lemmon forsakes his children from children and yes, the former wife has girls sobbed along with him Matthau boasts promising drinks! <br /> <br /> Very fun.
