This is very short. I think every voice is done by Jason Steele. (you can barely tell if you have heard his normal voice though, so do not worry it was the same, not that.) about 15 minutes. the spatula fights against the spoon war and meets some weird people. in fact it seems that everyone he knows is pretty crazy. <br /> <br /> "Edward!" "General Peterson, we have to get you to the medical unit!" "No, I will not." "Do not say that, I'm sure you'll be fine." "I'm doing it, and you know, before I go ..." "Yes?" "can I just ... a kiss?" "Umm, no." "come on, just one, little, kneeling on his lips?" "I'm going away now." <br /> <br /> It will soon be a movie. the date for this is in September, but it is likely to be released.
