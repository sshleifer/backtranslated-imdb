I liked the movie. Some action scenes were very interesting, tense and well done. I really liked the introductory scene, which had half-preparation in her. A very tense action scene that seemed well done. Some of the transition scenes were shot in interesting ways such as time photography, unusual colors, or interesting angles. Also, the movie is funny in several parts. I also liked the bad guy like that. I'm giving the film 8 out of 10.
