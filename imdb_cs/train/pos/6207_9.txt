I just saw this movie @ TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Fans of Hal Hartley will not be disappointed !! And if you are not familiar with this director ... it does not matter. This film can certainly stand alone. I have to go to the second screening ... it was amazing, I have to see it again - and quickly! <br /> <br /> This movie is very funny. It's a very clever dialogue and Parker Posey's performance is excellent when playing the title role of Fay Grim. Fay Grim is the latest feature of the revitalizing world and characters featured in Henry Fool (2000). The visually most used stylistic feature uses the customary (or Dutch) angle that is often seen in previous Hartley pieces appearing in various shorts that are available in possible films: Hal Hartley's short works from 1994-2004, and The Girl from Monday (2005). <br /> <br /> I saw the film best on September 11th. Textly, the adventure of Faye Grim in this story is after September 11, 2001, machined against the altered world. Without seeing the big spoilers, I see this work and the story world as a brave political and original portrait of geopolitical politics, if ever preceded by a common fictional film after 911 (see Syrianna: Mark Cuban Exec, these films ... the most interesting, the least). <br /> <br /> Finally, for those who are closely associated with the characters of Henry Foole, Simon, Faye and Henry, this movie is cheerful self-confident and self-referential. Fay Grimm starts in the movie exactly where she was when Henry Fool finished, but until the end of the movie ... Fay's knowledge and experience have changed and expanded throughout the story. What can be planned for the future of Fay and crazy family ... ?? I can not wait for the third part of this story!
