Sure, this movie is noble and sweet and full of clich√©, but it's fun and that's what I'm watching movies on. Have fun. Natasha Henstridge is amazing, even with short hair. Her smile is radiant and her beauty can not be masked. As for Michael Vartan, I'm sure women love him. Two of them really liked this movie like everyone else. I do not understand the notes that there is no chemistry between them. I think we see what we want to see. Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli watched, even though the British accent d'Abo sank into her anticipated Bronx speech. To tell you the truth, I did not notice it until I read these notes but returned to the DVD, and now its dialogue sounds far more British for me than the Americans, but it was perfect for my role, except for that. <br /> <br /> It's a story of two dear people who have married important men but find their classmates in one soul. It may be an unlikely story, but who says all movies should play as documents? It's no more than realistic than any of the dramas that are projected every hour on a tube. That's why we look at them to break out of everyday life and enter the world of characters on the screen. I thought these actors were doing good, but hey, I'm a sentimental guy who can easily break up. Do not get me wrong, it must be a sentimental scene and this movie has a lot of them. <br /> <br /> I'm giving it 9/10 only because I'm saving my 10/10 for that but an invisible super wonderful movie that I know will come some day. If you see it advertised as a movie that comes to film or lifetime movies or whatever, make a note. I think you will like it.
