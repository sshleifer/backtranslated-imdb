Four macho rough guys and three sexy girls get to the remote forest area to chase the bear. A group of cute cartoons runs hopelessly after the crazy Vietnam veteran Jesse (effectively scary display of Alberto Mejia Baron), who is not surprised that he does not care about any strangers who would be pursuing on their terrain. Director / co-founder Pedro Galindo III combines a gripping story with a steady pace, creating a great deal of nervous vibration, and bringing quite a number of graphic ghosts with brutal murderous pieces (broken neck and hand-blown shotgun as it outstrips some terrible spill). All able to represent full performances, especially Pedro Fernandez as nice human Nacho, Edith Gonzalez as feudal Alejandra, Charly Valentino as friendly Charly and Tono Mauri as antagonist, Mauricio. Better is the wonderful blonde woman Marisol Santacruz and the beautiful brunette Adriana Vega deliver some tasty eye candy by wearing modest bathing suits. Quiet and agile cinema Antonia de Andy, the breathtaking Sylvan scene, robust, aggressive, aggressive Pedro Plascencia scores, well-developed characters and a pleasant 76-minute duration increase the overall sound quality of this bang-up horror / action hybrid winner.
