When I first watched this movie, it was a recorded copy and the title was Caged Terror. She still owns a tape and admit I've been watching her more than once from start to finish! The movie is an extremely low budget and the dialogue is often inadvertently fun! I got a few of my friends to notice, and we were smiling from the terrible scenario. The film is about a couple (remember it's like the early 1970s, so they're just too hip!) Who goes for a week-trip to the camp in what I believe NY should be. They have some funny dialogue after catching and eating fish, and the girl hates the death of the fish and they eat it! The guy returns with something proud as they eat fish, and now it's their part, and he's going; "And that's a beautiful man!" Heavy man, really hard! LOL! By the way, I believe two vets come from Vietnam, one of them playing the flute. (In any case, they are musicals!) The boys are clearly attracted to the girl and when the couple turn out to be hostile, they eventually terrorize them during the night. The guy ends up in cages in a chicken cup and has to watch his boyfriend disappear. In fact, until the end of the night, it seems to be enough, and when it comes in the morning, the boys leave and the girl and the guy can leave freely. It is supposed that the guy has learned a lesson about how to deal with people, and the girl has a smile on her face! :) Anyway, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for damn good laughter! It will never hurt me! If I could find it on DVD and replace my old tape copy, I'd really buy it again, it's a classic camp! You have to love these things!
