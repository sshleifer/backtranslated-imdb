when I started watching them, it became one of my favorite concerts. Melissa Joan Hart is very entertaining and talented to have been aunt and other characters and star show Salem Cat, was extremely fun. the first couple of the season, in my opinion, was the best when Sabrina teenager in high school adapted to the life of witches. they were funniest, most fun and most ... good. I'm not a fan when they started to pose Brad and Dreamer, because I liked Valerie pretty, but they were okay, the problem was that they were just for one season. if you have at least new people. I did not like Josh that he was twice, he preferred, but then he disappeared. and get rid of Libby! it would be amazing if you guessed at these seven years. and the gentlemen of the craft, had they taken with Zelda that it would be gold! then Sabrina moves from her aunt's house to the Roxie / Miles / Morgan House. I did not like the fact that they liked it. Sabrina seemed to have lost her spell and things, and it seemed that her aunt had disappeared from her life and that her own stupid stories. I had a little time to stop watching and the old re-runs were back and I was like a kid! LOL. I have to say that the last few seasons were totally terrible. They avoided their aunts that spilled out because they were a big part of the show. then suddenly will allow the two returning people to move to a nice house when treated as dirt. and now works at a magazine for magazines, so the show brings starred star stars, if they are in every episode, it will destroy it. the program really went down and lost its shine. I've seen the last episode. had her aunts in her (Zelda was reduced to a candle) and she is about to marry, but she runs away with Harvey. I would like to know what happened after. well this is my review and the only thing I can say is the only thing that remained that it's an appealing me during seven years was a Salem cat.
