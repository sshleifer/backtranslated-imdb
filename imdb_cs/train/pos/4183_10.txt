I have seen this movie long ago, but it was amazing and has never stopped me today. An amazing film that describes the group of Australian Commanders who attempted to sink Japanese ships at the port of Singapore during the Second World War. <br /> <br /> These commandos are caught in plain clothes and are considered as spies by Japanese hijackers. But something happened that was not explored much in any Hollywood WW2 movie I've seen. A close and friendly relationship develops between prisoners and prisoners. They begin to respect each other while the captain of the captured Australian soldiers becomes the best friend with an older Japanese prison guard. This is the most amazing part of the whole movie and it really suffers from your heart. Soon, one day as two friends are interviewed, Captain Aussie learns that some other prisoners will be judged and executed for the sinking of Japanese ships in the port of Singapore. He mentioned that it was his team and not some others who sank the ships to his Japanese friend, and when he heard it, the Japanese guard said to keep quiet because it could lead to his whole group being executed. But the captain remains distrustful when it confesses to the Japanese authorities. Finally, the Japanese authorities are punished by their most respectable rules. This is the highest honor given to captured warriors in Japan. This is the most amazing part of the film, where Czech soldiers are waiting for immediate death and the tense indecision of a friendly Japanese guard who is still not ready to believe why his friend Aussie admitted he was guilty. I'm not breaking the end here. But it's much worse than one can imagine and can easily move around for tears. Overall, this is a great undervalued film that may have not been recognized as worthwhile on the international stage. Get one copy today and be fascinating.
