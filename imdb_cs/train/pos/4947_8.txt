One can only hope that there are many times when someone as strong as Morgan Freeman can devote time to helping someone who needs help. Everything comes to loving people. As Will Rogers says, "I've never met a man I did not like." Of course, when you meet Paz Vega, what do you dislike? Her smile can melt diamonds. It's so fantastic that I can watch everything she's in. The same applies to Freeman. he is just magic on the screen. Two of them gave us a movie that was entertaining from start to finish. From Mexican supermarket to Lorraine & Bobby to Packy. It was tender, charming and just fun. You have to check it out.
