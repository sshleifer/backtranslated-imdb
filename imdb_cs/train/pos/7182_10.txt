I thought for the first episode of the first series it really worked. It was really fun and I thought the actors were great. I think it's a crime for someone to say it's bad because it looked right. it's really unpleasant when people say it's not historically correct because it's supposed to be a Saturday night show that is not boring documentary history, so I think the costumes and settings were right. A brilliant start and I'll love what's coming! I talked with many people at school and love the show! we all think it's great fun and has great stories that we can do with it.
