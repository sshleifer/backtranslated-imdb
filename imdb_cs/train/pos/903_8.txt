I can honestly say that I never expected this movie to be good. I do not like family movies. I'm far from a Shahid Kapoor fan. The last director of the film (MPKDH was a total stupidity, and the music was very dull and clumsy, but Amrita Rao, who became my favorite after Hoon Na, was also Seema Biswas, Alok Nath and Anupam Kher, So a few more points. <br /> <br /> <br /> I finally saw the movie and I was very impressed, bringing us the young MPK lovers with the wedding sign of HAHK and we have the winner.the story of the outline is similar to HAHK, a light heart at the beginning of a serious regime at the end.Redord also made a character that you could relate to The thing I did not like about HAHK was that the characters were too eccentric Shahid Kapoor surprised me with good performance, which is a significant improvement, and it is most important that she suits this role, best is Amrita Rao, in fact it's her the best performance, her presence on the screen is so electrifying, you are bound to love her performance. Sameer Soni, Amrutha Prakash, An Kear, Alok Nath and Seema Biswas are sk </ p> <p> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> </ p> <p> The pisces were quite disappointed, but they will sound better after watching them. Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane Ajnabi are nice ballads. Milan Abhi Aada Adhura Hai is also enjoyable while watching. The songs are not colorful and dance, and they are more like ballads. An exception is Hamari Shaadi Mein, who alerts you to HSSH and HAHK. So what was the error in the movie? The film is relatively slow and the end is quite stretched. But the movie is still in good shape, so it's a perfect family film.
