Cute idea ... salesgirl Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) will inherit a tiny little Lampidor region. This country, which was not even in North America, became the 49th state ... (of course there were only 48 states at the time because it was done in 1952 ...) Linda travels to the land, hereditary, and we we watch when trying to find out what to do with this strange country and its even the most fun people. At one point she sings a song that she claims to be from her Navajo people, and from there she grows stronger ... though the heavy lipstick Yolande Donlan and the ubiquitous smile never get hold of. There are other songs scattered over-like residents singing to accept their new princess. Filmed in the famous British version of technicolor, or some equivalent, the only big name here is Dirk Bogarde as a British subject, Tony Craig, a cheesemaker. Bogarde made a great splash in the film of British film after serving in the war, and was even a knight of QE II. Craig and the "New Princess" bang each other and their adventures become more interconnected as the financial problems of Lampidorra get worse ... Funny little farce ... according to the movie Marx Brothers. Also remember that Donlan later married Val Guest, the writer and director of our small project, and was 50 years married! The guest was better known for writing and directing his science fiction films both in the UK and the US.
