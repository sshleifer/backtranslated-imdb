My personal opinion is that this movie did not have a real story about the first vampire carpenter vampires, but I do not care that I loved it. Jon Bon Jovi (Derek) was great in this movie. In fact, he fool me when I believed he was a man you would never dream of being a famous ROCKSTAR. There were some bad things on this movie. Just like the story line, it should be more. The film should be a continuation of the film that followed the story of the film and should have the same main characters in all three vampires. I really liked the clothes that people wore and the environment they choose in Mexico. I liked how old Mexico was and not New Mexico. with clay houses and old fashioned churches. I was a little confused with the vampires and how they were able to go to the churches, but it was great not to observe the rules of Vampire Dracula.
