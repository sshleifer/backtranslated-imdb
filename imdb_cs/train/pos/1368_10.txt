Good. It's been a favorite since I was 14. I told him that I can not see him any more than a year, but ... This is not an older generation movie that wants deeper meaning or some great message. This movie is FUN. It's pretty late, almost a passage, but Parker Posey is so great that it's incredible. To be enchanted by the 90th year of Tiffany's, attending the 90th anniversary, or loving Parker, this movie is for you. Otherwise do not bother.
