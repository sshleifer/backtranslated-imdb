The kids I loved loved (four children aged from 9 to 12, who would give them 10 stars). Emma Roberts was adorable in the title role. (We expect to look at the next generation of Roberts in the future.) After being exposed as Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, it was refreshing to see a girl who did not look like she was working on the streets. They also enjoyed performances including Tate Donovan, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barry Bostwick and Monica Parker (Bruce Willis). Final Takeaway: Cute Movie. <br /> <br /> (Note: I have not read a series of books so my commentary is based on the movie itself.)
