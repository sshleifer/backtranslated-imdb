I just saw this movie today with my children (son, 10 and daughter, 4.5) at the 3rd annual Roger Ebert Overleded Film. After the film, children had the opportunity to ask questions to Tian-Ming Wu. He (through a translator) told several stories about his life and filmmaking. All touching aside, both of my children really enjoyed this movie. Of course, I had to paraphrase many subtitles for my daughter, but most of the film is visually a matter of course. I'm not going to give anything, but the end is that this movie is so much better than 95% of Hollywood cache (especially children's films). <br /> <br /> Hey. <br /> <br /> There is a "real" / original mask king who can / could make 12 masks at once. The actor trained in the film and learned to make up to 4 masks at once (then they would cut and change to 4 new masks).
