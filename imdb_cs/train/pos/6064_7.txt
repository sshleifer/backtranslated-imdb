I have to start by telling you how I came across this movie. It was winter time in Alaska around 1990. My friend from Australia stayed with me and my girlfriend in the boxing boot of the apartment. The Alaska winemakers can be a bit brutal, and most people stay inside, drinking hard and watching everything that's coming on TV. I found this film out of the smile shop, which is in the snow bank and the new one was a treasure. the best worst film. We spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like a fish. We have seen it so many times that in fact we would sometimes turn the TV on its side or upside down for fuller fulfillment. a real jewel. Laughter will be uninterrupted, and memories will last forever. If you see this movie for rental in a video rental shop, steal it. You will not regret!
