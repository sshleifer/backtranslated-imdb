ZP is deeply associated with this youth dream, which represents the hippie movement. The debates at the university at the beginning of the film highlight the cultural situation that gives birth to this movement. The explosion that Daria introduces represents the fall of all social structures and, therefore, the development of all the massive transformations that society suffers and eventually Mark's death awaits the end A sees for the movement itself. The film will be easier to understand if we return back to life. During the 1960s and 1970s, young people were the driving force behind a deep exploration of change. One of the major changes was to bring sexuality out of the closet, and I think scenes in the desert are not orgies, but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would do in a hypothetical situation does not hide. I was looking at a scene where the pairs fit each other to the sand and appreciate the magnificent way in which A revealed the impossibility of continuing to conceal this basic human instinct. Pressure was a way to "drive" social fumes at the time, and that is the method, the police are trying to stop students. This company suffers from hippocrates, and it is clear when students get access to weapons and skip all false controls. The dialogue between a police officer and a university professor who is held in for any reason indicates that part of the society that is interested in this young feeling and part is totally uninteresting. Representing flying as a more accurate symbol of freedom, the theft of an airplane represents his inner wish, but his (return or return or segun) points to the difficulty of getting rid of these bonds and as he said, And describes the death of a dream with these difficulties winning the game. in my view I remember the film.
