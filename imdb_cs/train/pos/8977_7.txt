As a film it barely scores 4, but for movie fans the period of the 1940s, it's almost must-see and rated 9 as a varied show! I was attracted to follow up with the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webba, who plays the Colonel responsible for this event. What surprised me was the stunning performance of Doris Day. Outside of "Calamity Jane" I've never seen her have more than a song better than here. Randolph Scott is also unforgettable even though he does not see much time on the screen. It's been a while since I saw the movie, but I was pretty sure Humphrey Bogart appeared. With so many familiar faces, it's hard to watch. If you ever appear on a television station near you, make sure to capture the Doris Day sequence if nothing else! <br /> <br />
