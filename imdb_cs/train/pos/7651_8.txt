An interesting television movie based on a true story, betrayed by the description of one of the leading figures, a prison. Giovanni Ribisi plays his younger brother, who has a fine mission to decide whether to appeal to court for his brother's death sentence. But when he visits him and joins Elias Koteas, the problem begins. It has nothing to do with Kota's acting ability. It just looks like a version of proletarian root prisoner according to "G.Q." a magazine that is too sophisticated for someone who has spent most of his life behind bars. This realization came to me after an encounter with an old friend I have not seen for almost 15 years, who spent several Panamanian prisons. The young man I knew is gone, not only because he is older but because of long-term exposure to the criminal system. There are prisons and there are prisons, one must say, but the prisoner in "Shot in the Heart" is definitely out of this world.
