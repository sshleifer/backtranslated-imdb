Fabulous costumes from Edith Head, who painted Liz Taylor in her most beautiful! SFX are very good for the film of their age, and the stunt doubles really looked like actors, even on the type of body, the rarity in the films of this year. <br /> <br /> A cozy movie with beautiful panoramic images - even if it is chopped into a glass and scanned.
