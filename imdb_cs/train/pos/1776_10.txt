In 1999, I hated the first episode of this show ("Protesting hippies") that I was left. However, when he came to "The Paramount Comedy Channel," I watched it in full, and to my surprise, I felt totally cheerful (Motto: never compromise a series of comedies in the first week)! <br /> <br /> Set in 1969, Hippies' stars Simon Pegg as' Ray Purbbs, 'editor of the underground magazine' Oz 'as' Mouth'. His friends are feminist Jill, Alex's calm and Hugo. At the end of the 1960s, there was a feeling of incredible optimism among young people that they could change the world by printing magazines that no one had read. Instead of rocking on the hippies of the hryvnia, "Hippies" is loving to do so. The scripts of Arthur Mathews parody the parody of a series of icons of that time - "Hair", "Woodstock", "The Graduate", even the most famous attempt to obscure "Oz" from the early 1970s. Excellent cast performance; Julian Rhind-Tutt 'Alex' reminded me of the characters Richard O'Sullivan of 'The Man About The House'. It's a shame that it's never been the second series, maybe for people like me. If you missed 'Hippies', try it out. Once you get around the poisonous opener, you're gourmand!
