I thought this movie was very good, Heath Leger was very convincing and his Irish accent was flawless. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were also really good and credible. As it is true, what has happened, I have no idea, but it turned out why people sometimes become what they do. Maybe those in power have always been corrupted, and it was interesting to me that more than 30,000 signed a request for Ned Kelly not to be hanged, so maybe this movie was more true than he thought for the first time? In many respects I was reminded of Cold Mountain, another good historical film. Overall, I would highly recommend this movie and I'm a little confused why it was not better in cinemas.
