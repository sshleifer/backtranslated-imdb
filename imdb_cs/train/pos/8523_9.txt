I was a fan of a third year book, so of course I watched the movie, read the sequel, and then watched the TV show. It was a good show in itself, and now as an adult I'm still looking forward to the show. My only real problem was that he did not keep the book. The first time I saw it, I was so disappointed I turned it off. But it comes from the girl who owns the first book supplement. But after a while I decided to try again and ignore the book (something like what you have to do with Harry Potter movies). I found a great series! It was a clean cutting and something everyone could enjoy, just the right comedy for everyone to go. It's really nice! Clean and beautiful!
