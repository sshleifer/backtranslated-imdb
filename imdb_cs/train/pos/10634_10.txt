In order for her homosexual friend Albert (Perry King) to cease to deport to Belgium, Stella (Meg Foster) decides to marry him. The only other problem is that Stella herself is a lesbian. Both have their separate lives when one night after the birthday celebration of Alberta falls into bed and then into love. Later in the movie after falling in love Stella suspects Albert about cheating and appears in her work one night later after closing. What he finds will leave the viewer amazed. It's a great movie, very original. Perry King and Meg Foster are so good in their roles that it's amazing that they were not better appreciated here. Very controversial after its release in 1978, the movie "R" is now "PG" in this much more liberal time. Recently released on DVD, the disc contains the "Making" segment on special features, and it states that the film was based on a real story, so viewers who say the movie is not "real" are wrong. Everyone is individual and different people fall in love for various reasons - these are the questions explored in this wonderful movie for anyone who ever loved!
