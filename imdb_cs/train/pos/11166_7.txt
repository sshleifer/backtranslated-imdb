George Raft as Steve Brodie, a carefree and dance player who can never refuse courage, is set against a crude, sentimental, Chuck Connors (Wallace Beery). A soft touch for every person, Connors impulsively accepts waifs and fears, especially fugitive orphans "Swipes" (Jackie Cooper, complete with kittens!) And homeless Lucy Calhoun, out of town innocent with the ambition to become a writer. <br /> <br /> In this man-made culture, communication takes place mostly in the form of violence (one sees why BOWERY is a favorite Martin Scors). Exploding cigars provide a running gag. "Swipes" likes to throw rocks at the windows in the Chinatown, on one occasion when they light the laundry. (The current arrival of both Brodie and Beery's volunteer firefighters leads to the battle during which the building is burned to the ground.) Beery reluctantly crushes an unpleasant girl and hits someone who disagrees with him, including Brodie, who beats a night fist fight on an anchored boat , regain control of his salon, lost at stake, that Brodie would not have the courage to jump off Brooklyn Bridge. (Brodie makes a jump, but only because the attacker and the manikin will fail at the last moment.) <br /> <br /> As usual, Walsh fills in a detail box to illustrate the everyday life of a sirloin; singers, barman singers, Suicide Hall skirts who have met with Black Mary, tailors who are out of the street to unhappy hooks and forcing them to buy suits they do not want. A small but admirable little movie.
