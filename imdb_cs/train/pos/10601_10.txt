This very entertaining British comedy shows what could happen if part of London, in this case Pimlico, declared itself independent of other parts of the UK and its laws, taxes, and post-war restrictions. Cosmic chaos is what happens. The explosion of a war bomb leads to the discovery of ancient documents showing that Pimlico was ceded to the Duchy of Burgundy centuries ago, a small historical remark that has long since been forgotten. For the new Burgundians, however, it is an unexpected opportunity to live at will without any interference from Whitehall. Stanley Holloway is excellent as a smaller urban politician who suddenly finds himself at the head of one of the smallest countries in the world. Margaret Rutherford is delighted to be a professor of history who, aside from Pimlico. Other players include Hermione Baddeley, Paul Duplis, Naughton Wayne, Basil Radford, and Sir Michael Hordern. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Burgundy!
