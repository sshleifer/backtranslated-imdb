I saw this film while under a limited relaxation, mainly due to the novelty of seeing Pierce Brosnan with a mustache, but it turned out to be one of the most funny movies I've seen all year. It begins almost like a thriller, but gradually advances into a merry work full of one-shot lines and great comedy between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. Also, when I say that this film is a comedy, it does not forget that it has a heart at times and can be very moving when it has to be. When I went to the theater, I did not know what to expect more than a mustache, but what I got was one of the best movies I've seen a long time ago. When I left the theater, I felt very happy with the film and planned to see it again in a broad edition. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy with a well-written script and a big mustache.
