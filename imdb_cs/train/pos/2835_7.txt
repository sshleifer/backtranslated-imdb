Thank you to all VCD / DVD distributors in Hong Kong for having paid only $ 1.4 and I could have such a surprisingly wonderful experience. Adultery? As usual in our day. Eve grabbed her two children and took Nick to Luis and Charlotte to Italy. She wants to avenge her, but she finally did the same crime Luis: She had sex with Nick. In this small indie production, Vivian Naefe has dealt with the awakening of problems in a modern light-hearted marriage. How can one dare marry seriously at this time of fast food, where people with higher mobility in physical, mental and technological areas are now? A marriage commitment calls for a too high price that most people would choose to subordinate to. Nick once trusted Charlotte, but after the abduction he fell on Eve, which forced him to experience great growth. Most viewers may feel happy because Eva and Nick are gathered, it should be the biggest reward for their husbands' unfaithful act. However, I want to continue, I want to see how four will develop after this exchange. Maybe they can swap back as one can be so sure it's a fearless love affair. Good acting and good scenery. Two young child actors should not be neglected, especially a boy when weeping at the hotel reception in Venezuela. And, of course, how can we forget the "belle, belle" of the scenery of the city.
