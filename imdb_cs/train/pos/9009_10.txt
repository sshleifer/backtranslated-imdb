This film really captures the feeling of freedom ....... and the freedom of your own integrity ... in the most beautiful and most famous way. It is not a serious but merry adventure. The story mirrors life. We do not always get what we want right now, but we will find that we get what we need to understand why we have not got what we wanted ... which leads us to get more than we thought we will get! You will get it when the movie is displayed. <br /> <br /> And this movie is really about finding love and knowing about it and that it has completely changed life. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorite times ..... is not easy to find, but it's worth hunting ......... I guarantee you'll watch it more than once!
