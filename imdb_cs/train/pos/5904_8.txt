I was expecting this film to be seen for a long time. It's a good thing that gave a pretty good overview of the content, and when I finally saw it, I really found that it was pretty well done. Most conventional romantic films end up with the fact that lovers eventually get married or started a happy life after marriage, but for this transition from old life to a new relationship and life is really a big deal. This movie is about a time when the newly married couple Fardeen and Esha married through an agreed marriage and started their lives with honeymoons. Acting is really magically binding, even though I think Esha was a bit calm and she could have some lines for herself. The story was well knit and dialogues were more or less appropriate. Editing and direction were also good, Meghna Gulzar really did a good job. To sum it up, I think it's a good dramatic romance, a real combination of what Bollywood can offer to a clean bum.
