First, there is no way a remake could be just as good, because Japanese society is completely different from ours and plays such a big role in this film, as explained in the introductory narrative. It adds to the humor the warmth of this film. There are many different supporting characters and personalities. Each participates in the fact that this movie is amazing. This film is full of comedy that is not as vulgar as most of today's "rough comedies." Still, you can still laugh. The reality is that you have no choice in real life with whom you work or go to school with ... etc. This film really highlights and shows that the natural good of people can overcome minor differences. Not to mention that it makes a large subgroup and a lot of humor. This is a story about a dance that actually has a story and a good story. There are several stories that are not out of place, but actually support the main story. A really well-written film. Dance is also great. I become a fan of a movie with any dance for that aspect. However, this film goes beyond others with the dance, in fact, it is the first story and just writes about dances in Japanese society. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10.
