Yes, real classic! This is what British drama is, realism and the minimal use of special effects (and over charged budgets). Last time I saw this track when it was last screened on British Territorial Television in 1994. It really should be seen by anyone who likes scary plot, no big names but no less noble acting. So the copywrite is now owned by someone unknown, and as such it is unlikely that this major track will be broadcast in the near future. I recently got The VHS in Black, so now I can enjoy a really great British track. You should also look forward to it! <br /> <br /> Mark R. Horobin
