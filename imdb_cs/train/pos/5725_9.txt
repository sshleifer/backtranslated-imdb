That's what I've written to some of my friends before: <br /> <br /> The VERY CRAP, The Grudge is, Honest to God, one of the most awesome movies I've ever seen! I'm either very mild in my age, or Sam Raimi and Ghost Pictures have done KICK A ** work! (I can not wait for Boogeyman!) <br /> <br /> I was very scared and I sat in the dark theater and wished to have someone sitting next to me (except for the protagonist in Grudge myself.) I swear there were many jump scenes that are NOT awaited! I felt crazy but I did not care! I was on the edge of the movie, from the initial credits and the music was fantastically frightening. I mean that sound, though, and I do not like it! <br /> <br /> I lingered aloud several times and cried, "oh" on one scene! Oh, yeah, I even covered my eyes several times! The Word of the Wise: I thought some scenes were a bit psychotic. My DH hated Event Horizon and thought the one who wrote it was sick and psycho, but I do not remember the movie so it can not be compared. I can not say I enjoyed this movie b / c I was scared but it was very good and scary. The final scene, too ... boy! Because I am a 32-year-old mum, I think I can have nightmares from this movie, especially because of the sound. Please come out of the head) <br /> <br /> In summary this is not a slasher as I grew up (Jason, Freddy). This is the most severe time scary movie. Perfect for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Two great trailers for this movie were Boogeyman and The Ring 2 !!
