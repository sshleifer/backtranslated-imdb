She was so lucky to have become extra in this great movie and loved every minute of filming. She went to the London Premier and talked splendidly with Phil, Peter, Martin and Jon, as well as her wife. Then, a few weeks later, we went to the cinema tour with the members of our club by bike. What brilliant film deserves to be there with all the great biker movies. Now we have DVD Sue my wife can not get it, so even children can not. Get some club sticks that seem to me now as a movie star. I think they're just jealous. The only downside of the first part of the shoot was weather, rain, rain and rain, but hey we were in Wales. Hopefully, it will follow, so keep me behind Jon. Danny Beck
