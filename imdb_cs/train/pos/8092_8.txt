I was on this film at the age of 8-10 in the cold, dark November afternoon. I was out on the whole day, sorry, and when I was around sixteen, I had a cup of hot cocoa and sat down in front of a television with a blanket. I was surprised that I was looking at a cartoon that was not all happy and stupid - and in fact it was dark and moralistic. She captured my imagination. I'm sure he lacks the text and is truncated in all the wrong places for the Tolkien bull. But it still captures the spirit of the story, the choice to bear the burden for the good of others, the consequences of selfish decisions, etc. The quality of animation leaves room for complacency. The only place where this film is clearly raised over new films is voice characteristics. John Hurt is great in this. If you do not like drawing a figure, look away and listen to it. His voice is extraordinary. I have seen it many times, many times and always bring me back to the time as a child thirsty for some magical adventure. For this reason, I say "luck", the film is nostalgic for me, so I will overlook its shortcomings. But between John Hurt and Tolkien's fantasy, it still gets to me, and it still happens to me.
