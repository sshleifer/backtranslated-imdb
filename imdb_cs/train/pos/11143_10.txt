He saw it as a young naive punk when he was released for the first time. When I left the theater, I dreamed like a child, trying to let no one see. So when I saw it again in 07, I knew what to expect and the sobs were ready and ready when it was near the moment. Fortunately, this time I was at home. What I did not recall from a young perspective - or perhaps not notice - was the technical brilliance of this film. Use flashbacks that tell so many stories without resorting to dialogue. A camera that apparently placed the viewer along with characters in the scene. Think about opening when Joe walks through the street for dinner, the camera leans on the woman and the child sits on the front bench, framing the street scene. <br /> <br /> The story itself and the characters - tense, sad and brutally real. He is very eager to get into the human race so consistently, as it is with people most of us are likely to turn away. Then again, Joe & Ratso could be one of us. I had to be 70 when I saw it. I remember when I left the theater, I had to find a friendship company. All these years later I'm glad I'm not alone tonight. This is really a great movie.
