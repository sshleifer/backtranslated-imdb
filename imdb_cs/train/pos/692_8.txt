I first saw this movie at the festival. There were many good movies, but few people had long thought about me and the nightmare in insomnia was definitely one of them. Tess is definitely a gifted filmmaker. The shots were great. Casting was perfect. Dominic was surprised by the role she had created. He did not know much about his character but wrote the story in such a way that we were interested. And Ellen ... I can not wait to see where it ends! He shows a lot of talent and I hope he will make several more films. With all millions of dollar budgets trying to get cheap excitement, Tess shows that all this is not needed until a good story and actor. Kudos to all who deal with this film. And thanks to Tessa and what. for DVD distribution!
