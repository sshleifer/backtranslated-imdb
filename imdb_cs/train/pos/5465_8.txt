This is a hardcore Warner Brothers movie that plays a very young Barbara Stanwyck. An accomplished master in the Machiavellian cool performance, which was eleven years later in Billy Wilder's "Double Compensation", plays Stanley Lily Powers, a well-worn daughter of a violent speakeas owner in a choking steel city. She has been misappropriated and abused for years by offering her sexual preference to her father's customers. When her father dies in a distillery, a freight train goes to New York City and literally sleeps on the bank's corporate chart. It could be absurd if Stanwyck's blame was not working here. With her deadly views of methods of view and amoral seduction, it is easy to understand why men become dependent on her aggressive carnalities. One of the young men who endures along the way is John Wayne with a fresh face, accountant Jimmy McCoy. In the last third of the film, Melodrama returns to a heavy-handed murder-suicide murder service in Paris to keep Lily in peace and a new bank president who is so addictive to Lily that she is taking the money to maintain her luxury. The ending is somewhat disappointing, but not before Stanwyck absorbs the screen. The film has curious touches like Lily's bonding friendship with an African-American woman named Chico and a German immigrant who teaches Lily about the philosophy of Nietzsche about the importance of avoiding sentimentality.
