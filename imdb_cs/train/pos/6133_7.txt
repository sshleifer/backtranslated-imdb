Easily the largest low-budget horror film of all time. I first saw this movie when I was about nine years old, and I must say that I was terrified. Now, when I grew up, I see this movie as what it really is ... the work of the genius. Everyone, or at least everyone with any taste, dreamed of seeing a snowman who killed people even if they did not admit it. I've always found something really horrible about snowmen, so naturally, for a horror narrator like me, this fashion was a fulfillment. Some people say this movie is stupid or otherwise invalid for every intelligence ... it's a movie about a serial murdering snowman, what the hell were you expecting? Anyone who did this low-score shot is obviously too threatened to sit down and have a good laugh at stupid, one-time and cheap gore. I love this movie for what it is, comedy, and as long as the film industry does not disappear and does not understand the serious horror of a murderous snowman (which seems impossible, unfortunately), I will forever hold this great piece of indie terror near my heart.
