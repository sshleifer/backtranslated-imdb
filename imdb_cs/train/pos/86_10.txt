I remember seeing it at the Salem cinema (where I went to "Kiddie Matin√©e" almost every Saturday) in Dayton, Ohio, when I was a little boy and never forgot. I was just amazed and my friends. I would like there to be some way to see it again! I tried to find some shorts compilation or something like that without success. Only recently did I find that it was Cousteau, which made me even more excited. How the hell he got, it's out of my understanding. The fish is really in cats at one point if I remember correctly! If someone helped find a way to see it again, I would be extremely grateful!
