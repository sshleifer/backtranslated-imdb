This disturbing Western rotation tells the story of the famous early western rifle, which was sought after by one and all. James Stewart is a cowboy who won the award Winchester in a shootout just to get him lost in a robbery. The story details Stewart's rifle and a man's effort in the film. The gun changes hands from time to time, as if the owner was fatal to lose it through violence. The picture has a lot of action and tension when Stewart closes in his quarry. Stewart, starring Stephen McNally, Dan Durye, Millard Mitchell, John McIntire, and Jay C. Flippen, supports Stewart. Shelley Winters seems to be nasty and her role is somewhat unclear. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, teen hearts in later years, have short but good roles.
