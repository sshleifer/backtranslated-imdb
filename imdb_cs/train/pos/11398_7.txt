I like this movie. She was cheerful, beautiful and very varied. You see that MGM is out of Technicolor. There's almost no color in this movie. Every scene is full. The choreography was great. Gene Kelly is amazed. He is so talented. The dance figures of this film are perfectly executed and perfectly designed. He understands that dances can tell the story just like anything else. The last part of the movie, the great dance sequence, is very impressive. What makes this film very special is Gershwin's music. Several American composers had a better melody gift. I really like Gershwin's music. It's charming. Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the greatest songwriters. It's so funny and charming. It was a very funny movie.
