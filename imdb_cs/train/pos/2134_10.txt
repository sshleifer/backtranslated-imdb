Ernst Lubitsch's contribution to American cinematography is enormous. His legacy is an excellent group of films to live forever, as is the case with Shop The Corner. This film has been transformed into other less important films and musical games, without the magic or elegance of Mrs. Lubitsche own and definitive versions. Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart worked in several films together. Their characters in this film stand out as an example of how to be in the movie without almost seeming to be acting at all. Both stars are beautiful as friends who do not know about themselves, but who is fate had to cooperate in the same shop in Budapest. The reason these classic movies worked so well is the amazing support that casts the studio set into post-image imagery. Here's the great Frank Morgan who plays the store owner. We also see Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith among other things doing impressive work by believing that they are in Budapest. That's why these movies will live forever!
