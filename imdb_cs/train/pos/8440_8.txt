This is the last episode we deserve. At the end of the last season, things stayed in the mood of "life goes on," which was hardly a matter that this realistic series deserved. While the show is not a happy show, this series has always been the one that has been thinking about you (a rare thing on TV), and that is no exception. "Is death justified?" "Are morals to reflect society, or is society shaped by morals that a few people choose?" "What is righteous death, and can it exist?" All these questions, and more, are the writers of this exhibition every week, and that is their final work. Fine acting, great writing, amazing camera work, brilliant editing, clean direction. If you saw a series and you missed this at the first run, then hold a copy in some way. If you've never seen a series when it runs out, then it's going to be in itself, but it can be hard to try to keep up with who's all the characters and what they say in their colorful past. For those of us who have been in the last two seasons of spectators, this is a very satisfactory tracking.
