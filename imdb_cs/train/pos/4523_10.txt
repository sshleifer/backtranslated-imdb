When I heard that Adrian Pasdar was stretched in this film, my expectation that I watched the whole film was low. The only reasons I gave him a chance was the wonderful Julie Walters and the friend's recommendation. What I thought was a broad, "Mrs. Doubtfire" farce, proved to be a gentle and inspiring comedy. Pasdar is absolutely credible and empathetic as an ambitious businessman who needs to free the woman part of her being on occasional occasions. These needs are transmitted to the audience in a credible way. Julie Walters is magnificent, it's her custom, like a lady who teaches him unconditional love.
