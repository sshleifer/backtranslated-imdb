Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr., Hal Holbrook and all the other actors and actresses in the "Honorable Men" category joined together to make this movie a great movie. Mark Isham has written movies so you know the music is really fine. But: After he noticed a lot of hooves, loopholes and dramatic strings from the heart. he had to ignore the promise and sit back to enjoy the film. If you can do it, it's really good. The story of Carlo Brasher, the real hero, is inspiring enough to last her life. Look at the internet ... The whole story is far more amazing than the movie, as the director admitted in his comments. In World War II, there were only three African-American divers from the US Navy. However, none has achieved the status of the US Navy Master Diver. Carl Brashear was the first African American Navy Master Diver. And he was the first diver ever to be certified or recertified as a US diver. (Crashing Applause). <br /> <br /> On the negative side of the movie is a book: Do I have to tell you just one of the many "gaps"? Yeah, I mark this note as containing "spoilers" and you will do it ... The initial, crucial scene where the helicopter hits the radio pole and sinks into the sea: They never have time to meet the full Mark V diver even if he was a legendary boss Billy's boss Sunday, he was just "a few minutes late" when he saved the pilot. <br /> <br /> So for gaps, goofs and over-dramatization I've eliminated "Honorable Men" from the perfect 10th to the 7th. Hollywood EVER realizes that unlegated truth is much better than their over-dramatic approach to narrative stories? I doubt it. Very bad!
