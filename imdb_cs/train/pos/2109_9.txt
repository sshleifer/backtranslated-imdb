I've watched it several times because I thought it was some stupid, dirty, dated romantic comedy. Well, it's a romantic comedy and maybe a little too late. But it is not very sentimental, it affects the subject of office politics, adultery and loneliness. Do you think you know exactly where things are going, but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interest, and not everything is the way you expected. But there is enough joke and spell to touch the most unbearable cynic. If you meet someone who does not like this movie, seriously consider how well you want them to know.
