I really enjoyed this movie ... it was cute. I liked it, but if not, it's your fault. Emma Roberts played good Nancy Drew, though it's not like books. Old fashionable clothes are strange when you see them in modern times but look good on them. For me, rich girls did not wear clothes that could look rich. I think it looks like they have all the clothes-wrapped-in the garage sale and they just decided to get together. All the clothes were tiny, especially when they wore fashion and penny with their regular clothes. I do not want the movie to look bad because it was not! Just go to the theater and watch it! You'll enjoy it!
