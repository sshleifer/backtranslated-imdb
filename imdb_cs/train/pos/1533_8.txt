What was the network, the diagnosis of murder? I thought it was CBS. Am i right ?? Also back, these days, actual production of H.Q. was near Van Nuys. I'm sure I remember because I've practically done almost two episodes in those griefs. More. I remember the beginnings. I found an article in Reader's Digest that tells this actor / writer of a stunning episode. So just because I suggested it was granted to me. Honored or not, unfortunately I did not develop and was excluded because of my poor publicity. So as a justification I have learned, as I always, the hard way ... Roll Cubes .. Pieces !!! Just a side bar to Mr. Van Dyck. He had a house in Brentwood on Chalon Road and it was an incredible party. Dick had a wonderful sense of modernism when he built the house.
