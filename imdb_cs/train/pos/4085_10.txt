If you were born when this movie was completed and had a liberal / open home I was in, I am sure that in the early 1980s you will be introduced for the first time how your parents look at dirty movies or extremely dirty movies. You know, not a 100% pornographic but rather alchemy mix of real drama and pornography, or you could get into your collection and pop in a plastic rectangular display of such a movie in a big machine called DoC. You had to be very quiet and ninja like, but still have less heart failure when huge pop sounds were made when pressing tablet-like buttons from fear of discovery. Notwithstanding, such films have been sent to the back of your mind, waiting and waiting to reconnect with such a visual "art." Needless to say, this movie fits into the above description to "T". Many people will comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film, but perhaps because I'm annoyed, I'm more concerned about the subtleties. He was the creator to talk to us about the deeper levels of a human being or what could be considered a real abomination, interpersonal relationships, masturbation in bed, voyeurism, or it could be despair for social status at the place of murder, pedophilia / homosexuality or suppressed the sexual nature of social elitist women in the 18th century France? Who can say, but although Borowcyz's taste for lively and raw sexuality is a "norm" for his works, I say that this film really talks with the audience at a deeper level as regards bestial inclinations. Once I learned it, the story became more interesting for the dizzying shock value, so it's good to go out.
