This complicated Western was a milestone in JAMES STEWART's career after his return from the war service that he wanted to change his image by doing the West, which is to a large extent considered the reason for the tide of the Westerns in the 1950s because it is very impressive. Pity she was not photographed in Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Stewart won the first prize for the 'weapon that won the West' but then he must spend the rest of the movie trying to get back when he's stolen. SHELLEY WINTERS is a shy girl with bad luck, and STEPHEN McNALLY is a local villain in Dodge City. GEER is Wyatt Earp and DAN DURYEA is Shelley's bad boyfriend. And you did not know it was the Universal-International movie, TONY CURTIS and ROCK HUDSON (both up to now unknown) have a little role. An interesting sequel is the first Indian attack, revealing CHARLES DRAKE as a coward who leaves and leaves Shelley alone in a horse car. Later, it is redeemed, but it's just one of the twists that have a gun from one disruptive hand to another - but eventually ends up with a legitimate owner. STEPHEN McNALLY and JAMES STEWART have a pretty final shootout that is almost as melodramatic (but not quite) as the DUEL IN THE SUN final. McNally is the perfect villain, and DAN DURYEA is equally treacherous in the form of a dirty role he played for years as a small weapon. <br /> <br /> The tight story is extremely well managed by Anthony Mann and it's fun to see ROCK HUDSON (credited as Young Bull) who wears the Indian War color and TONY CURTIS as a young soldier who casts long glance at the thin and attractive Shelley Winters. an above-average story.
