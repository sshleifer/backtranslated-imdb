The story of "A Woman From Anywhere" is fairly simple and quite adapted from Eastwood Spaghetti Western: A mysterious alien comes to an inexperienced city where the King is headed and starts shooting space. Even the initial credits and music have spaghetti feeling: Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone would be proud. Interestingly, the stranger is a beautiful (!) Woman, Saki (Ryoko Yonekura) at Harley, and his location is in the city somewhere in Japan. There are a lot of weapons in this shareholder, some of them good, some predictable, and some other spots somewhat hokey, but it's a lot of fun. Ryoko sees her credibility with their weapons, and realizes they owe them to the debtors. It was not a big challenge for her, because it was a physical challenge, but she did things very well. She shows her acting skills much more like Otsu in the NHK drama, "Musashi." I would recommend a movie if you are a fan of Ryoko Yonekura (which I adoringly I am) and / or "Girls with a Gun" fan of the film and hold it for repeated viewing. For me, there is something extraordinary and inexplicably appealing to "girls with weapons", such as "La Femme Nikita" and "The Long Kiss Goodnight". And having a gorgeous gall as Ryoko plays in it too, it's just pieces of cake frosting.
