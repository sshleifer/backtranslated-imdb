Tsui Hark is a visual art in his view in this film. Unfortunately, the awful acting of Ekin Chenge and especially Cecilia Cheung (I felt the desire to strangle her while watching this, it's so bad :) at times it was difficult. <br /> <br /> This film is a true breakthrough in the visual department. When I saw it for the first time, my jaw fell repeatedly, and I thought I had never seen anything as distant as that, but that is what should be done to make full justice in the mythical world of Chinese historical kung fu novels! Undoubtedly, it's one of the best-looking Chinese historical kung fu epics ever made. But unfortunately, Tsui Hark did not improve in the writing department, and the story and dialogue are rather youthful (his apparent obsession with stupid and too long depictions of evil guys also did not help). To make it even worse, this film is very poorly occupied. They decided that the hot favorite Hong Kong idols would be the main characters, but unfortunately both Ekin Cheng and Cecilia Cheung are completely unsuitable for historical kung-fu dramas because they lack the nobility and secrets to embody such characters. Adam Cheng Siu-Chow and Brigitte Lin in 1983 are infinitely better. I ask that Zhang Yi-Mou and Tsui Hark ever come together to create a film that has Tsui's visual art but with the maturity and reputation of Zhang's poetry ...
