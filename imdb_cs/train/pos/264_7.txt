Hickory Dickory Dock was a good secret of Poirot. I admit I did not read the book, even though I was an enthusiastic fan of Agatha Christie. Adaptation is no problem, there were moments when humor and attempts to make it right were a bit exaggerated, and the events that led to the final solution were rather hasty. I also thought there were some slow moments, so some secrets felt cushioned. I liked how Hickory Dickory Dock was filmed, had a very similar visual style with brilliant ABC murders and really set the atmosphere with dark camera and dark lighting. The dark moments were somewhat creepy, it helped them one of the most impressed musical pieces in Poirot's adaptation, perhaps not as disturbing as the One Two Buckle My Shoe that gave me nightmares. The plot is complicated with all the important ingredients, though it's not as intricate as Buckle My Shoe and in some way it's a good thing. Acting was very good, David Suchet is impeccable (I know I can not use this word forever, but I can not think of a better verbal description of his performance in the show) like Poirot and Phillip Jackson and Pauline Moran make justice to their integral characters brilliantly. And the students had great personalities and well-developed, especially Damian Lewis as Leonard. Overall, fixed mysteries, but not the best. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
