I saw this movie yesterday at Turner, and I could not stop watching until it disappears, even if I could guess what would happen. Farrell played a great role and everyone else had a great job. Some of them seemed to go beyond limits, but I loved everyone! If you can see, please! Actually, I cried out on several scenes, but then I think if you were the mother you wanted. Loretta is beautiful and I was just surprised to think that there are nasty mothers, it seemed to be some time ago. I will say that if you succeed, do not read it and listen to criticism. As I say, I laughed, I cried! I enjoyed it!
