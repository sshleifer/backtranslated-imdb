I did not hear about Brashear before. This is the story of him and the man who trained him and helped him become the first African American Navy Diver. A story of will-power. The plot is well written and develops nicely throughout. This is what seems to be a typical thing that is inferior and does not have much surprise. It's also quite Hollywood, but hey, I do not know a real man, maybe it's approaching how it actually happened. Still, it does so with dramatic scenes and has no impact on the way, and it is inspiring for anyone who has ever heard the words "no, you can not" talk about their lifelong dream. All the performances are excellent. DeNiro and Gooding Jr. they both shine when they are on the screen. Rapaport is also wonderful. Characters are well written, credible and consistent. This is well-groomed and has good cinematography. Production values ​​are high, and it brings us quite convincingly back to the 1950s. This is the only film I've seen from this director and writer, though I can now think he's interested in more about who they are responsible for. There is a slight amount of strong language, otherwise no offensive material. I recommend it to anyone who finds an interesting subject and / or fans of those who have done it. 7/10
