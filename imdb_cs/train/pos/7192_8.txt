If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general it is necessary. Directed by William Witney and John English, and playing Reed Hadley as Don Diego / Zorro, this series delivers! I will not bore you a conspiracy (who cares - less talks, more fighting); what really matters is Hadley's excellent interpretation of the character and stunt work of Dale van Sickel and Yakima Canutt. <br /> <br /> *** STUNT SPOILERS FOLLOW <br /> <br /> You can see the effect of this movie on Lucas and Spielberg - Zorro is captured in the original version of the Star Wars waste compactor in one chapter, imprisoned on the rope bridge, and the Temple of Doom in another, will make the horses ride and even pass through the tunnel while the baddies knock on a huge water tank and flood the tunnel behind him, exactly as Mola Ram does Indy in the Temple of Doom. Besides, the flogging action is great because Zorro disarms villains, swings to safety, etc. With his loyal whip. Most sword work is fake, except for the first chapter, which contains an amazing sword battle in the canteen choreographed by the legend of the sword Ralph Faulkner, which rarely makes the screen look like the evil of Rodriguez. This was the first show I've ever seen on Matin√©e in Bijou when I was a child and since then I've been addicted to them. <br /> <br /> The Zorrova Combat Legion supplies "Z" goods!
