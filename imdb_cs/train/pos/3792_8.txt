I saw this movie today, and I was amazed at how accurate the dialogue is for the main characters. It did not feel like a movie - it was more a document (the part I liked best). The ladies in this film seemed real to me like all the fifteen-year-old girls I know. Overall, this is a very nice movie for those who like independent films.
