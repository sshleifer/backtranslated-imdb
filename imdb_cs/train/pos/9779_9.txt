Three horror stories based on members of the transgressional Hindu cult that returns home, but somehow changed. In the first story, our former cult member is now in mad assault and visits him who wants to find out what's happening in the cult. A relatively slow arrival, as the story tells in back walks while the two sit on the chairs and face each other. The reporter is particularly interested in what led to the death of the participants. It seemed to be somewhat boring, suddenly creating an exciting surprise shot in the story. Things are pretty bloody. The second story has a violent young criminal who visits a psychiatrist for compulsory therapy. The patient seems to have some kind of agenda, but the psychiatrist is in charge of this task. Again things slow down a little and do strange things. The story, which is very well written and surprising, is a strange story. The final story deals with a spiritual healer who claims to be able to remove from his illness a person with his hands. One patient is a former member of the culture, so successful healing is complicated. Again we are surprised by the twist. It has a pretty decent scene. For some reason, there is a pretty woman full of frontal nudity, just like a male full frontal nudity. I found the stories very well written and the director succeeded in solving each story with its surprising twist and cruel consequences. <br /> <br /> Note: German DVD reviews.
