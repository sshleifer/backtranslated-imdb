A young lawyer sent to a remote area to pack the property of a recent deceased client. When he arrives, he finds out that local villagers are not welcome and that his deceased client did not like it. In order to speed things up, she decides to move from a local inn to settle in her house, a house that is usually fuzzy and approaching only a pass that is blocked by the sea most of the day. As soon as she sees the woman's vision in black, she is real or fictitious, she is also exposed to bloody shrill screamings of anger and children apparently drowning in swamps, these events are choosing him, and he soon becomes quite terrified. Atmospheric television adaptation of the famous game Susan Hill, which spends the first third of building its characters before moving into a haunted country house, its poor color contrast delivers its TV roots instantly, it should be really black and white but yet like a haunted story it has a few disturbing moments, although after a long wait to see it, I must say that I was a little overwhelmed.
