Every weekend I watched Pufnstuf when I was about 10. It was just after Bay City Rollers. I saw that one day I came to the Family Channel and uploaded it for my three-year-old daughter. I forgot all the things I loved like a child, a magical flute, a zoom, a Witcheepoo make-up. This show is definitely not technical. The mayor is certainly the forerunner of Mayor McCheese, and they are all stuffed with poison eyes. But kids love it. They were too, rather looking at the guy who works like a puppet on socks before sitting in front of top computer animation. There is (mild) slapstick, but no adult themes such as sex or people die, and children will accept Jimmy's schemas. Children think it would be neat to wear a bag of smoke and someone to convince them that their house is in the fire, and I loved every time my daughter saw the jet stream in the sky, she thought Witchypoo was flying over his head. Music is old, but you really get used to it and my daughter really loved it. She sang "in silence is different, difficult, others are lonely". My daughter has watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months and is still one of her favorite. I see that the new Pufnstuf 2000 is in the works. I really hope they will try to keep their old taste and do nothing like computer animated characters, etc. I think the whole new generation would love Pufnstuf.
