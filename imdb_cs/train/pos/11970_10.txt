The whole house came to me when I was 9 years old. I remember seeing the American Funniest Home Videos with Bob Saget and one day my mother told me she was also in a performance called Full House. One day I was lucky to visit an episode when visiting the family. It seemed not to be too interesting, but as I watched more and more when I was at 9:00 at night, I would have gotten into it. <br /> <br /> This show really wanted you to be there, talk to the girls, go with them, and maybe join the "singing" of their little family. The thing that I like most about in Full House is that it's a great show for kids and adults of all ages. There will be some parts that are more for adults, then the parts that are designed for the kids to make the whole family like it. No matter how sweet it is, it can be a great show and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br />
