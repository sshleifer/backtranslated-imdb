"Arms and the Man" is one of the most entertaining games of the Shaws if they are treated properly and this produces plenty of work. Helena Bonham-Carterova, the leading movie star, is Raina, a daughter of a military family who has a lord of fiance (Patrick Rycarty) and who protects a soldier from an enemy (Pip Torrens) in a city attack. <br /> <br /> Full color and energy, this production is developing at a good pace, and when Bonham-Carter and Patsy Kensit as a servant are a bit close to the rest of the cast, they still hold their ground floor. Kika Markham and Dinsdale Landen as parents are wonderful and the whole game is generally happy. <br /> <br /> We are highly recommended.
