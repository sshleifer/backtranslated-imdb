back in my high school days at Salina Kansas, they shot a spot called "The Brave Young Men of Weinberg," and the film crew were prominent for weeks. we finally learned that the movie was "Up The Academy" and it was a bit humble, "lower forehead" before we were led to believe. <br /> <br /> I had to see it because I was there, and local audiences seemed less pleased with the performance. I was 17 years old, and I thought it was a rather unrealistic attempt at the "Animal House" type of comedy, to jokes. <br /> <br /> From that moment on, it was looking at me, and my opinion was getting a little smoother. it's stupid, but sometimes it captures a bit of a "crazy" magazine humor, at least like most of the "Mad TV". Ron Liebman could hate it, but he is almost perfect and unforgettable. For me, my favorite moment was a short scene on Santa Fe avenue, where I parked a car while I was buying some guitar strings. The pity that Pinto has a short look seems to be getting on TV. have not seen a new DVD, but if my old pinto is visible, they have a sale.
