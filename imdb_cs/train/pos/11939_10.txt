I always like this great baseball movie! He has good acting, including two huge actors and two favorite favorites Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! Also in this movie are Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Big Tony Longo, Tony Danza and Matthew McConaughey! Also Jay O. Sanders and Dermot Mulroney! The movie has great special effects and works from all film actors! Baseball scenes are all realistic! Randy Edelman's composer's music is very good and fits the film very well! Some actors who remind me of real baseball celebrities. Stoney Jackson's character is Ray Mitchell reminded Me Royce Clayton, McConaughey's character reminded me of Steve Finley, and commentator Jay O. Sanders in my opinion reminded what Al Hrabosky looks like today. This is a fantastic movie for fans who are not and Baseball and I highly recommend this movie!
