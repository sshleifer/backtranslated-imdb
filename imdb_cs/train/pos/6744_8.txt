The police cop accidentally kills a murder suspect and then covers a crime, but has to deal with a guilty conscience while trying to resolve a murder. Andrews and Tierney met with director Preminger in the movie noir, which is as effective as Laura, their earlier collaboration. Andrews is perfectly occupied as a serious cop, a good guy, interested in unfortunate circumstances. It's all right, including Malden as a hard police captain, and Tully as the protective father of Tierney. The script, Hetet, a great and prolific screenwriter, is tense and excited, and Preminger creates a great atmosphere.
