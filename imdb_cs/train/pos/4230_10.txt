For Columbo fans like me, this is an episode episode that made the case why Columbo was so popular and how good it really was. Ruth Gordon has played intelligent crime writer Abigail Mitchell in the field (as always). It seems that Abigail calls her nephew to sign some documents that make him a heir. She never reached the death of her niece and is convinced that her husband, the dead niece (Charles Frank), has done a dirty act. To say more would be unthinkable. Mariette Hartley has a clever role as a personal assistant to Abigail. This episode of Columba is in the class itself. It's really great TV movie. I recommend it the most.
