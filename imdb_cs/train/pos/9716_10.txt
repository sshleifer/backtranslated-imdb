Do you like this film most of all you have to be a) strongly in love (no marriage) b) recognize English humor that is admired by gallant and funny life situations and not just gaggies running c) being quite intelligent because the authors gave the opportunity to laugh and cry each minute of this movie and only if you meet the requirements of "b" and "c" you can recognize and enjoy the entry of the authors. d) The full use of the film must love women like Kirsted Dunst, which is so natural, sweet and irresistible. e) You must admire creative, slightly melancholy people with great and remarkable personalities <br /> <br /> If you meet all these requirements, you will probably rate this movie around 10 points. <br /> <br /> I never smiled half (!) Just like watching this masterpiece. And I even managed to cry in a few moments when I laughed (I'm always more sensitive whenever Kirsten Dunst did something good)
