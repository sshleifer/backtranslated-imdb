"Atlantis" is a new and right step for Disney. It's a good choice to make a movie as mysterious as "Atlantis". I did not have any expectations for this movie, but after watching it, I do not understand why this movie got such bad reviews. Even in my country, the evaluators were not positive. <br /> <br /> "Atlantis" is not a perfect movie, but it's still one of Disney's most popular films, I even doubt that this movie will ever get the reputation of "Disney Classic". Well, that's another case. It's funny to think that this science-fiction film is directed by the same directors as "Beauty and Wildlife" and "Hunchback" (so Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale are trying to escape their reputation for monstrous movies, he just kidding). Well, pretty nonsense. "Atlantis" is an observable, extraordinary and very entertaining movie. Even this movie is a PG-rated action feature, it's also good for kids, in my opinion (parents who mean the opposite, do not kill me when you write, he). <br /> <br /> The story is a bit predictable, but it does not destroy the movie. Comic-inspired animation is good for the movie and the set is a departure from the usual Disney style. It is colorful, dark and detailed. The Deep Canvas sequences are quite impressive. The movie is also sometimes funny, even more giggling than laughing in the movie. (SPOILERS) The characters of this movie are also very sympathetic, but unfortunately there is not enough time for everyone to know, so some characters stay behind (SPOILERS). Newton Howard is absolutely great. It's courageous and exotic. (SPOILER) The most notable of this film is how atmospheric Atlantean language is very natural, ethnic and authentic. It's really awesome (SPOILERS OVER) <br /> <br /> The script is tense and well written, but there are still some questions left unanswered in the story. Fortunately, there are so many of them. <br /> <br /> So you are kind to yourself, do not listen to reviewers and watch "Atlantis" because it awaits you ...
