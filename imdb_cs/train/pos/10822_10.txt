I was lucky to see this movie many years ago in England. Since then, I have seen hundreds of films, but I have never forgotten this. Although Sinatra played an extremely cute figure, she was a great partner. Many people think he really did not get his own until his role in "from there to eternity", but in my opinion he was congenial in Concho. Another role that holds in my mind is William Conrad. She had never seen or heard before. Conrad plays a wonderful role in this film. I remember his deep and graceful voice and used it greatly to improve a few words that speaks with a threat that sets the tone of his character. I also remember the music that they both represent Conrad and they seem to surround them every time they appear. The great movie and the only disappointment was that I never had a chance to see it again. She seemed to have disappeared from the face of the earth. I see in the names that it is written that the film is black and white, but when I saw it was really full of color, I remember Sinatru's blue shirt.
