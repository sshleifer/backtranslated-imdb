This is really great from Hal Roach. This is because of two main reasons: The smallest children in brief are among the saddest that they have ever had a lot of humorous and well-written elements on film and plot. As for the smallest Little Rascals, I honestly do not think it would be better than Spania at the age of four. Even though he was somewhat backy and unattractive boy in later years, he was valuable here. And by placing a small little boy who cared for babysitting, even younger children were not just fun, but again high on the cute fact. After the older kids blackmail Spanky into this terrible job of babysitting, all sorts of funny chaos will be released. Gags are quite effective and well done at that time - with a random click that involves murder and the final scene where Spanky finally gets into the hands of the smallest. I have not seen these shorts in many decades and I'm glad I gave him a chance.
