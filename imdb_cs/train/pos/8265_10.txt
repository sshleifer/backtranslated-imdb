The very name of this movie made me see what it was all about and so I shot this movie in the morning. If you ever wanted to see what miners had to go through during the first few days and actually see a dramatic scene when a mine crashes into a man. This film wants to show clearly that Germany and France can cooperate and be friends after the First World War and how the Germans came to help the French miners much to the disbelief of the French cities. The actors were all excellent, with unusual scenes in the horse mine and the little boy who worked in the mine. There is an old old retired who, after the death of the elevator, collapses down the ladder. If you're a true movie fan, it's a movie that you will not want to miss.
