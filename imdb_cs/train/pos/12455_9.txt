I was looking at this show when I was a little girl. Although I do not remember much, I have to say it was a pretty good show. I also do not think I've seen every episode. If you ask me, it was still a good show. I always remember a theme song. Everyone was ideally busy, the costume design was great. The performances were also top-notch. I just hope some network will bring this series back one day, so I'll be able to see every episode. Before I pack it, I'd like to say that I always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I do not think I've seen every episode. And now, finally, when and if this show ever came back into the air, I hope you're going to have it one day before the air blows out of it.
