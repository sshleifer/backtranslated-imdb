Someone has already mentioned that it is at the right time at the right time. It was so true for this document that I had doubts about the authenticity of the scenes, and I thought that maybe it contained some acting, but it was not. It's all real. The story is nothing new to people in developing and / or poor countries. It illuminates human media manipulation, disinformation, artificial polarization of people by deliberately creating tension in the streets, sometimes to the extent that the military, news service or even government (many believe US leaders) use agents who attack "any "the party to provoke the masses into violence, and therefore justify their coup. It is also mentioned by the naval officer in the film. That they wanted to see people confronted in the streets. All of these scenarios have been taking place in Turkey over the course of its entire history, which has experienced three couples, and recently the secret plans of the Turkish army have been ironically exposed to governmental / conservative media in opposition to the religious doctrines of the army in which a very important mosque bombarded by an army agent that raises people, etc. What makes this film unique is that it was filming from inside, perhaps by accident when the events happened. Obviously, the directors are for Chavez. Whether this caused directors to filter and manipulate events and information, I would not know. And let Chavez defend the Venezuelan people against the dictatorship of the US and the global economy without suppressing any contradictory thought by force and ultimately becoming a self-made tyrant, history will tell. But at least Chavez is hope, and I believe it is worth a chance.
