It's time to dedicate the horn to the great Christon Heston after his recent walk, but this film is not the one, his other films from the previous generation were BEN HUR, TEN COMMANDENTS, OMEGA MAN and PLANET OF APES were his best work. This film, which in 1973 tried to prophesy the future country, in 2022 that the human race was manipulated by organs to eat a universally produced food product called "Soylent Green", which is produced with the human body. This bizarre and unlikely film was as ridiculous as it is at the time of its release, and supposes that the Indian population, which would be about 2 billion, would have been this stage of eating meat without knowing it. Charlton Heston, this character reflects the secret international plot that the world powers have prepared to meet the nutritional demands of the overpopulation by cannibalism. Unfortunately for the producers of this film, the green message they supply is not the Green Side of today's ethos thanks to God. Cannibalism was practiced by indigenous peoples in New Zealand, Fiji, and Borneo for up to 40 years before the film was made but was long abandoned by human civilization. Another silly prediction in the film is that women have become quasi-sexual slaves who have averted the influx of radical feminism that was on the rise in 1972 when the film was made. The film was stupid and is now stupid, but contains a very unforgettable last performance of late and great Edward G. Robinson, but there is no reason why the film should be returned for reasons other than academic ones. This is a crazy movie and I would not even recommend baby boomers or fans of Charlton Heston. All other reviews of this movie have read that all the sounds agree with a dystopian society whose future centralized theme appears to be only part of the United States that has experienced an ecological disaster. <br /> <br /> Only the merit in the movie is that the country is facing overcrowding.
