This is my fourth Joe McDoakes short, which I've seen and yet the most fun. In this Joe he gets the musical lesson from a recording featuring Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he left for Warner Bros. Studio (outside of this series), asks Jack Carson for instructions that are both confused. He then meets with actor George O'Hanlon (who is also McDoakes), who speaks in a normal voice that is not too far from his later Geroge Jetson and gets into a set where he automatically upsets the director. I'm going to stop there and just say how funny it is to find the whole thing and be fascinated by the movie stars that were delivered at the end. The final scene was especially a horn, so for this note, go to YouTube if you want to watch it so you want to be in Picutres!
