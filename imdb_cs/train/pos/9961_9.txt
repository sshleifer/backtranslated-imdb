I have to give it how it moves with an almost perfect rating, because the content is really great. As the previous reviewer commented, I have no idea how this movie was in the IMDB 100 down! That's totally absurd! Other movies - especially those that share a dance theme - can not hold a candle when it comes to combining top-notch, credible games and amazing dance routines. <br /> <br /> Complete the basic story (it's not just about winning the competition), it's very easy to dive into, and surprisingly realistic. None of the main characters in this case are in any case two-dimensional and it's very easy to feel emotionally embedded in the end of the movie. (And although you are not crying, you can get a little overwhelmed before it comes to credits.) I definitely recommend this movie to lovers of dance and even more to those who can appreciate the horrifying and well-performing storyline. How She Move is not perfect, of course (what movie is it?) But it's definitely a cut over movies that use pretty faces to hide half-baked conspiracies and / or characters that do not matter. Actors and settings in this movie lead to a very realistic ride that is equally breathtaking due to the amazing talent of dancers!
