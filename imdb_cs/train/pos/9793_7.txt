I give this movie 7 out of 10 because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting game "guess who". But the film needs more Robin. He appeared in the movie at the beginning and sporadically for the rest. I always thought that the new animated series did little justice to the pure new Robin, let alone Knightwing. This film simply continues this bad tradition. The film spends too much time on Bruce Wayne and his romance, which would not be so bad in one movie if romance was not so incredible. It's still a good movie if you're a Batman fan and I'd recommend watching it.
