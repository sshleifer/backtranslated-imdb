Yeah, I remember this! I've been watching for many years. The story was totally unreal, but great! What should someone who evaluates movies and movie reviews be what the film is about. It's the same with the first guy who follows a similar pattern. Some movies - like this here - focus on simple and comical nonsense. Such films can not be evaluated from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer. Of course, these films are lacking in quality, lacking a sophisticated storyline, very often lacking first-class acting, but if they fulfill their basic premise - that's fine. I do not have this movie on my list of all my favorite favorites, but I still thought it was funny, had some very nice sequences and made a good story. Brian Bonsall is a clever actor as well.
