Los Angeles TV reporter Jennifer (beautiful Barbara Bach of glory "The Spy Who Loved Me") and her two assistants Karen (Karen Lamm) and Vicki (pretty Lois Young, who first kills first, but also reveals her wonderful spot in a tasteless naked naked bathing scene) go to Solvang, California to cover the annual Danish festival. Since all local hotels are reserved, three beautiful ladies are forced to look for room and food at the gorgeous but anticipating remote manor house owned by the strange Ernest Keller (deliciously playfully decorated with perfect perfection from the late, great Sydney Lassicka) sister of Virginia (solid Lelia Goldoni). Unfortunately, Keller has one very ugly and deadly dark family secret that resides in his basement base: a crazy, pathetic, blatant, grumpy man-child Mongoloid named Junior (the alternate and scary portrait of Stephen Furst, Flounder in the Animal House) is probably released by director Danny Steinmann, with a fairly gentle cast of acting from a robust cast, a convincingly perverse plot, Craig Reard's great make-up, a pretty scary atmosphere, a wonderful wild climax, a slow but steady pace, reminiscent of well-drawn characters, and surprisingly a heart-breaking final chilling frame (an incest subplot pack unexpectedly strong and tangible punch), this unjustly overlooked early 80's psycho sleep is well worth checking.
