"The first war was 100% outsourced." Dan Ackroyda says everything. This is hard to describe a movie; comedy, satire, action, screwball. This once or twice reminds Dr. Strangelove, especially in the scenes with Ben Kingsley (who thought I had a remarkable job). I had no particular expectation from this movie, even though I'm a big fan of John Cusack, so I let the film wash over me. And as a result, I enjoyed it. Political satire is painfully accurate and quite destructive of the US military-trading complex. Sub-parcels were somewhat predictable, but the ultimate intertwining of the stories made them all worthwhile. I understand why this film was not very popular in the United States, but it is a timely story for the rest of the world.
