Other commentators have described the conspiracy and social parable and comments (or better) that I could, but I would like to join the admiration of this little jewel of the film. In all categories it is much more than 50 years later - scenario, acting, photography, stage designer, sound design ... it's really a classic of species. This was my first appearance on "young" Alec Guinness, and the first pictures make it clear what made him so special that he eventually won knighthood. <br /> <br /> I only have "8" because it is a fairly light parable that examines human nature, and because the plot rests on the ultimate climax rather than actually solving the conflict between the inventor and the workers and industrialists who haunted him all over the city. Also, a few minutes of thought reveals a basic error in the logic of the script - wear is not a critical factor in purchasing new clothes (especially clothing); children grow up, people change size, gain and lose weight and go with the latest fashion all the time and have as long as tissue tissue woven. And if nothing else, the manufacturer would have the wealth to provide indestructible material for military uniforms (especially BDU). <br /> <br /> Nevertheless it is a great movie. If you can see it on a classic movie channel, you should.
