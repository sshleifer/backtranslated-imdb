PUT CAMERA ON ME is a deceptively cute movie. In fact, it is a comprehensive view of children's psychology and offers an interesting look at the development of adults and artists. On the surface, it is a nostalgic look at some home movies created in the 1980s by a group of high class children. One of the directors of Darren Stein had access to the video camera and quickly became the artistic leader of all the movies. Sure, these are just some cute kids having fun. But it's a lot more. It's a moment-by-moment view of the time when children are confronted with a series of confusing questions that we all encounter in our lives - fear, sexual awakening, unrequited love, loneliness, and a sense of an adult world that seems to explode around us. As we get older, we forget about how exaggerated the reality of life was when we were little. <br /> <br /> What makes this film even more important is to watch how young Darren Stein has become a young general of a filmmaker. It is clear that Darren is running this show and these small films are his vision, but they are all informed by their friends, their problems, their interpersonal dynamics, and the general confusion about the horrors of adult life. Many children make home movies, but I have never heard of children and have not seen children who would create "small" films about holocaust, homosexuality, nuclear war and inability to enter and create friends. These children are confronted and dealing with some difficult things! <br /> <br /> The power of this film is the way Stein and Shell pull the different scenes along with the regular interviews with kids --- all adults and all friends. This adds a new angle to the movie. How many of us remain in contact with children? These guys have it. And many of the issues they are dealing with are still going on between them two decades later. <br /> <br /> Conflicts - the confession of fury reveals the heart that is still interrupted, the very normal childhood sexual experiences continue to be a "sticky object" between two men, some constant indignation over the dynamics of relationships, and is still a member of this team , which remains very responsible and at the center of attention! Which makes sense when we look at these home movies over the years. Darren Stein is a director. There is no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> Stein and Shell are talking to each other occasionally, and one can not imagine it's an inconvenience that allows us to look into the young lives of these people. This is particularly true for Stein, who has successfully continued his entertainment career as a producer, writer and director. From the very first moment PUT CAMERA ON ME we see the emergence of a gay boy trying to solve everything. We also see parties of artistic minds and personalities who are not always "nice" or "caring" --- and it is a courageous step for every artist to share with the audience. <br /> <br /> There are so many revealed moments, but the most disturbing and complex moments include a movie in which we see that the victim of a Jewish concentration camp is tortured and killed by the Nazis. We discover through interviews and narratives that the Nazis are playing a Jewish child, and a part of the victim plays a funeral child. It is a painfully disturbing moment that sees the darker side of fear and the way children make the horrors of an adult world that are far less than a child's adult understanding. <br /> <br /> This is far more than some home movies. This documentary depicts pain, beauty, joy and sadness of adolescence. Powerful things - and it's worth seeing! <br /> <br />
