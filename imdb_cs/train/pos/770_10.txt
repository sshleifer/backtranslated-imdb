I like Tudor Chiril and maybe that's why I enjoyed the movie. Two days before the film premiere, I went to see his concert. I saw the trailer and video "kite" in front of the movie and I thought I made it all up. I was wrong: instead of a good movie I helped great! I brought the film. it was sad .. it was funny .. but above all it looked LOVE .. I can not even begin to describe the soundtrack .. so i will not :) I'm not a film critic .. I can not describe it in more words .. My somewhat vague description is all because, I thank Tudor Giurgiu, thank you Maria Popistasu, thank you Ioana Barbu and WELCOME TUDOR CHIRILA.
