I recently saw I.Q. and although I'm not a romantic comedy of the gal type, I think it was just a nice and sweet movie to watch. So many films, in my opinion, are lacking in sincerity. Do you know that feeling when you look at the film and you feel robbed because some of the story has some fun and it was like a director just throwing it together as if it were waste? The story among scientists is sweet and fun. How they got together and tried to help Tim Robbins to become smarter. I like a love story between Tim and Meg because it was simple and brought a good point in terms of love, "there is nothing that seems". I recommend this for Sunday morning. <br /> <br /> 7/10
