I have loved this movie since I first saw him in 1979. I am still amazed at how precisely Kurt Russell portrays Elvisa, moving and expressions on his face. Sometimes he's scary as he looks, he acts and talks like a real Elvis. Fortunately, it's released on DVD, so everyone we've been waiting for can finally have a quality version of the whole movie. I hear the attackers say there are some inaccuracies or some things left out, but I think when I remember that John Carpenter had only about two and a half hours to work with it, and it was on television (just two years after Elvis death!) that he does a great job with this. In fact, I have not seen another Elvis movie that is even close to this. Highly recommended.
