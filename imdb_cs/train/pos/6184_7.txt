Since it is a month of black history and in chronological order I'm studying the success of many African-Americans in the film, I got this film from the VHS from the library because it was Duke Ellington and his orchestra. Their jazz version of "Rhapsody" by Franz List was the culmination of this overly murderous mystery-musical comedy mix. Many other numbers I liked were "Sweet Marijuana" from Carty Brisson, "Cocktails for Two" Carl Brisson, as well as his duet with Carlisle about it earlier, and those Gertrude Michael is great as a woman you love hate. Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen are likely to go too long with their love / hate as a producer and detective, but they grow on you. And Toby Wing is sexy silly teasing like Nancy, trying to tell Oakie something, but she always gets "no now" from him. While many of the characters have a motive for the murders that have happened, I was not surprised by the revelation of who did it. And lift up how naked the women are (although, of course, they are covered with either their hands or a toe). This was a very obvious pre-code. It is worth seeing a movie enthusiast who is interested in such things. P.S. As a long-ordinary Louisiana resident, I like to notice when someone was born here as Carlisle was New Orleans native.
