"Citizen X" is a famed narrative story about hunting one of the worst serial killers in history. What makes this story even more convincing is where and when it has taken place; Soviet Union in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> ** Mild Spoilers ** Viktor Burakov (played impressively by Stephen Rea) is a newly-supported forensic investigator for a million Rostov region. Discovering past and present unresolved murders, seemingly the same person. The murders are not resolved, because no one has ever had trouble investigating the evidence properly. He is led to find and stop the killer. His only instrument is his devotion, skill and sincerity. Its obstacles are the corrupt and political ideology of the Soviet system that discourages the search for truth. His naivet would lead to failure if he was not his boss, Colonel Michael Fetis (Donald Sutherland). Fetisov is a politically frantic cynic who understands the game and knows how to deal with the Soviet bureaucracy. However, he also shares Burakov's desire to bring the killer to justice, even though the official party line is "There are no serial killers in the Soviet Union!" The cast is excellent. Location and set-ups are the perfect recreation of today's Soviet life. Randy Edelman's score is especially good. <br /> <br /> More importantly, this film shows a dark and disturbing criminal phenomenon with intensity and sense. It was a video made by HBO Films and became a great source of films that would otherwise have never been made.
