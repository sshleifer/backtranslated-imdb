What is all the negative comments? After seeing this movie for the first time tonight, I can only say that it's a good comedy that will surely illuminate every day a lonely person. When I saw that Drew (Ben Affleck) could end up on holiday alone, I wanted to cry. You will have to see the movie if you want to know why. Although after a while I liked Tom (James Gandolfini) and Alicia (Christina Applegate) if you asked me, they were real snobs. But this movie made me smile and felt good inside. Before I pack it, I'd like to say that Mike Mitchell recorded a clean holiday hit. Now, in the end, I highly recommend this good comedy that will surely illuminate every single day a lone person to a fan Ben Affleck or Christine Applegate who did not see him.
