Roman Polanski plays Trelkovsky, who rents an apartment in France. The previous tenant is in the hospital after a suicide attempt. Comes where she also meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani), a friend of Simone. . Later Simone died. TÅ™ekovsky begins to think that the landlord and his neighbors are trying to change him to Simone, and he eventually jumps out of the window. Le Locataire from 1976 is the last film of the Polanski trilogy. The previous ones were Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby. Roman Polanski does not do a good job just as a director, but his acting is also excellent. Isabelle Adjani with her big glasses is beautiful. The landlord Monsieur Zy plays great Melvyn Douglas.Jo Van Fleet plays Madame Dioz. Fantastic Shelley Winters is The Concierge. The tenant is very scary from time to time. It gives a lot of psychic fear. This movie is not the easiest to understand or explain, but it's so fascinating.
