The call to this romantic comedy is accurate, but today it is misleading. The genre was sadly worsened in cliché, too focused on the main couple meeting together and very little space for the atmosphere and other stories, which is formal and too predictable. The shop around the corner does not suffer from these diseases: it can create a recognizably central / eastern European atmosphere and has strong occupancy besides strong nominal potential; I avoid using the words "to support cast", such as Mr Matuschek (Frank Morgan), for the film, and the story is just as important as romantic. The 1998 Film You Got Mail borrowed the idea of ​​an "anonymous pen" from this movie and was therefore billed as a remake. This is not right and in fact unfair to the new film - it shares the genre and borrows the fence element, but that's all.
