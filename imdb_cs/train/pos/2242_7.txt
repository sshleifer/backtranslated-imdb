Part of the perceived need, one feels, to include a conventional love story in a conspiracy to make the film more marketable for the 1950 movie audience. The film begins with some mischievous characterizations of the top bureaucrats running the British Foreign Office they are pardoned so that only British offenders can complain. But after that, the film is losing its way into a conventional fake conspiracy. Terry-Thomas will look as usual, but great talent in casting (Peter Sellers, et al) is largely unnecessary. A deviant but not a great movie.
