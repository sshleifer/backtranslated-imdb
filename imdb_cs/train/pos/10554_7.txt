NEVER (3+ out of 5 stars) Another strange assumption from the director of "Cube". This time there are two main characters who have come to their home in a mysterious white emptiness. There is literally NEVER outside their small two-storey house. I was wondering, but I think the comedic tone that was made for the movie from the beginning was extremely badly conceived. There must be a certain humor, certainly ... and I do not have a humor problem that eventually came from the misfortunes of our two heroes (their last "showdown" was definitely a horn) ... but I really think the film would be much better if at the beginning, did not change in reality. After watching the movie, I watched the Making feature on DVD and the short trailer at the end is almost totally lacking "stronger" comedic aspects ... making it look like a completely different (and slightly better) movie. The last half hour of the movie is when things really start to gather ... just like in the recent Primer movie. Actors are fine when they do not overcome comedy. They are actually quite credible in their "normal" moments. I was probably prepared to release this movie as an unsuccessful experiment in the middle of the trip ... but it won me to the end. (And watch the credits for the last scene carefully ... just do not ask me to explain it.)
