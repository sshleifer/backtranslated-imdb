I too enjoyed this series when I was a child. In 1952, I was 5 years old and my family always watched this show. My favorite character was the one Marion Lorne played as a somewhat obscured, humble, and very kind aunt. I can still remember her "ubba bubba um um" notes because she would try to say something important. And then, when she returned and played Aunt Clara in Bewitched, it was a great casting! <br /> <br /> It was the first time I remembered Walter Matthaus, whose career I followed as a fan for many years. <br /> <br /> I have a question if anyone can verify: was the title or ending attributed to the music "Swedish Rhapsody" by Hugo Alfveno? Every time I hear it playing on my classic radio station in Southern California, it brings back memories of Mrs. Peepers' image, pulling her back to the camera. I'm not sure if this image is in my eyes correct.
