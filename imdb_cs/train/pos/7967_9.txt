This is definitely one of the biggest Disney films ever made. It's really a joy for everyone. It will make you laugh, it will cry you, and it will put you in a strain. Basically, what Homeward Bound is about three pets are sent to live on a farm while their owners are on holiday. They do not know what is going on, and desperately want to go home, escape the farm and try to find their way through the desert. <br /> <br /> This is one of the last films Don Ameche played. He gave the voice of Shadow, an old, wise and friendly golden retriever. Also playing in this movie was the Sally Field to give voice to Sassy, ​​a Himalayan cat. But seriously, it's just Chance! Michael J. Fox (my most popular actor), Chance, is basically everything he expected from a dog, kind, playful, energetic and frantic, and every time he breaks the movie, it's because of Chance; It's like a comedy never ends! <br /> <br /> This movie is also very sad sometimes. Sometimes it reminds people that they are alone or when they lose their pets. One scene that always slows down is the scene where the trio tries to escape the pound; Especially I feel shocked in the part where Chance gets a collar caught in a fence and almost can not. The film had other exciting moments, but none of me seem more thrilled than this one. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a wonderful family film. If you like this movie, you'll probably have a sequel. I give this movie a solid 9 out of 10!
