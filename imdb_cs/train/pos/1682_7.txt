After casting his fingers into the giallo pool with the masterful film "Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh" (1971), director Sergio Martino followed that same year with what appeared to be another twisty thrilling thriller "The Case of the Scorpio's Occas." Like his earlier efforts, this actor portrays a handsome macho brother, George Hilton, who will star in the hit Martino Satanic / giallo hybrid "All the Darkness" the following year. "Scorpio's tail" includes actors Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg, who would introduce an unfortunate couple in 1972 (to put it mildly!) "Your Vice is Locked Room and I Have Only The Key" (1972). (I just love that title!) I suppose Edwige Fenech was busy with the moon in which they shot it! Anyway, this film boasts a stylish direction that Martino fans would expect, as well as a twisted conspiracy, some finely made murderous pieces and the beautiful filming of the Athenian site. The story this time concerns an insurance investigator (Hilton) and a journalist (Strindberg, who looks like the beautiful and smartest sister Farrah Fawcett) who are involved in a series of frantic murders after an air crash and a $ 1 million heritage of a beautiful widow. I really thought I had this shot halfway, but I was wrong. Although this story has perfect sense in this giallo, maybe I have to look back at the film again to fully appreciate all its subtleties. The most important events for me were Anita Cat and Mouse fighting with the killer at the end, especially a thrilling house of intrusion and a smart fight on the roof with tiles; a lot of good events burst in this movie! Excellent people from No Shame need to thank for another great-looking DVD with nice subtitles and interesting accessories. Whotta's great suit that turned out to be, in his ongoing quest to put these lost Italian gems back out of oblivion.
