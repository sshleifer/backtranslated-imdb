Rune Run Through It is one of those films that deserves to be seen in the theater so that its spectacular cinematography can be truly appreciated. The game is gorgeous and compliant, with every gesture and smile and nod of meaning. Brad Pitt gives clear performance and Tom Skerrit is powerful as the father of the preacher. The film moves like a river, you have to be willing to watch it over the streams and streams, but it's finally for it.
