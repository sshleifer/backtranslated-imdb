I saw this film at the International Documentary Film Festival in Amsterdam and had the privilege of meeting the directors and Tobias Schneebaum, all the living and open New Yorkers. The film title in Amsterdam was Keep Your River on Your Right, so the sensational aspect of cannibalism is somewhat less prominent. Equally important was the relationship of loving and homosexual Tobias Schneebaum to the members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist. His reunion at the age of almost 80 years and the inevitable holiday was very motivating. I can highly recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a moving story that is nothing but walking.
