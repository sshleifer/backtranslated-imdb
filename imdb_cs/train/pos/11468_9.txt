I'm genuinely surprised how little was in the movie about the Columbine massacre. There is no significant document that would be very mysterious. Fortunately, we were awarded the talent of Ben Coccio, who ran the ZERO DAY, and Gus Van Sant, who made the equally gentle ELEPHANT. There are two different events in the events that have common ideas that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery that there is something utterly disturbing and unrecognizable about the motivations of both murderers and what actually leads them into fantastic reality. ZERO DAY, allegedly made up of videotapes created by the shooters that appeared after the event, is totally boring. Even if you know where he is going, you still have the hope that he will not "go there" ... and the tension in the last minute of the movie is unbearable. The movie is awesome from top to bottom, from director to screenplay (it's not too improvised, though it seems spontaneous), even with two major actors and supporting players. There is only one aspect of ZERO DAY that worries me. Well, so we can not see why the shooters do what they did, but one of the contributors was their ANGER. But these boys do not really get angry. They can say that some things suggest they are, but in fact they have not convinced me they have something in them that has forced them to kill innocent people. But still it makes sense to me "why?" that director Coccio wants to have. In any case, borrow or buy this movie, it will touch you and stay with you for a long time. People BLAIR WITCH are just translating what success these guys should do in a perfect document.
