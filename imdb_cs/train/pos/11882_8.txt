This movie was for a while in my collection, but was not it before my friend reminded me? until I decided to look at it. Did I not know much about Leo? just that it was supposed to be excellent from the age of the film and deals with a very serious topic? AIDS. <br /> <br /> Although the person who has the tools? is Leo? the script surrounds the path in which Marcel (the youngest brother of Leo) joins with the illness of his relative. At first, everyone tries to hide the truth from Marcel? he is believed to be too young to understand his brother's illness? the fact that Leo is also a homosexual contributes to the unwillingness of parents to discuss with young Marcel. I know from experience that most elderly people, on many occasions, do not want to accept the fact that sometimes, even if someone is young, does not automatically mean that they will not be able to accept reality and act more appropriately than even themselves. Except the fact that the family tried to hide the truth from Marcel, they left me quite impressed? how did they support their son? even though he has learned the truth about his sexuality and illness. The fact that they allowed young Marcel to travel with Leo to Paris to meet his friend was enough gestures from them? most families I know will not be reluctant. Are there lots of heat in the scenes in which the brothers spend some time? you can see that they are real friends, worries about themselves. <br /> <br /> Near Leo is an excellent drama I strongly recommend
