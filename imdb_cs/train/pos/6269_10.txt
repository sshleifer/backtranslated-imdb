Pleasant surprise! I expected another decrease along the line: The Rock (9) -> Con Air (7) -> Armaggeddon (4). Especially for such an exaggerated film. Maybe that's why this new type of fare Bruckheimer has so little approved. A clever dialogue instead of elegant unicorns, a decent background / motivation instead of shake-n-baking stereotypes and when the pursuit came, you really wanted. Fanboys Expect Armageddon Rollercoaster: Stay Away. This is one for fans of more intelligent action. It did not bother me that Jolie appeared so little.
