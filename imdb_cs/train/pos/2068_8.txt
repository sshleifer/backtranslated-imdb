1958. Sleeping small southern city of Clarksburg. Evil Sheriff Roy Childress (Almighty Viktor Morrow in a top miserable form) fired very strongly on speeders by forcing the offenders off the cliff to their premature deaths on a particularly dangerous stretch of the road. Childress meets his fight when a young young musician Michael McCord (Martin Sheen's marvelously smooth and excited portrait) appears in his turned-car with a specific intention of avenging his brother's death (Sheen's real sibling Joe Estevez in a short story). Director Richard T. Heffron, working on the intriguing and intriguing scenario of Richard Compton (the same guy who has directed the movie gems 70 "Welcome Home, Soldier Boys" and "Macon County Line"), combines the gripping story with a fast pace, neatly creating a delicious 50- it strengthens plenty of tension from the tense joke and play between Childress and McCord. The singularly fine cast helps a lot: Sheen radiates the harsh James Deanesque rebellious atmosphere, Morrow makes the most of her massive dirty part, plus excellent supportive performance by Michelle Phillips as sweet waitress Maggie, Stuart Margolin Nick Nolte as supporter of Buzz Stafford gas station, Gary Morgan as Buzz the extremely ugly younger brother Lyle, Janit Baldwin as the dirty vice president of Sissy, Britt Leach as the slow driver Johnny and Frederic Downs as the rigorous judge JA Å lapka. The key vehicle confrontation between Childress and McCord is a true pulse-bobbing white-knuckle thrilling doze. Sharp cinematographer Terry K. Meade, well-drawn characters (such as Childress was obsessed when his wife and child were killed in a fatal incident and incident), groovy, syncopated scores of Luchi De Jesus and beautiful landscapes that further enhance the overall sound quality of this excellent television winner.
