Oh, my God ... just give me a breath. This movie will make you a great ride and will not let you go until the last morning in your face. This is a movie for fans of Stormriders and others. Legend of Zu was beautifully created, although I did not like a few things, used a lot of stalls. I wanted to see a real person fight, but, oh ... a few small oppressions, and I did not like it until I saw it again when you realized it was kicking A **! I support anyone who has ever wanted to see a real Asian film to see this movie. I give this movie one of my highest ratings. Come and see when it comes out in America !!!
