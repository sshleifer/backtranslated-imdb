A wonderful film directed by some of the best directors in the industry today. The film is also casting some of the great actors of our time, not only from France but from all sides. <br /> <br /> My favorite segments: <br /> <br /> 14. arrondissement: Carol (Margo Martindale), from Denver, comes to Paris to learn French and also to realize her life. Montmartre: Probably not a better way to start this film than with this segment of romantic Paris. </ br /> <br /> Loin du 16ème: a picture of Paris we know from the riots in Cités. Ana (Catalina Sandino Moreno) spends more time caring for someone else's baby (she's a nanny) than her own. <br /> <br /> Quartier Latin: So much fun to see Gérard Depardieu as a "tenancier de bar" with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara discussing their divorce. <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: Do not tell me you do not like these mime! <br /> <br /> Tuilerie: Such treatment can be seen by Steve Buscemi as a tourist who makes a high touch (no-no) with a girl in the subway. Parc Monceau: Nick Nolte is great. Ludivine Sagnier also. <br /> <br /> I spent 3 days in Paris in 2004 and wanted to return this movie! <br /> <br /> You've seen in Barcelona (another big city) on Verdi, March 18, 2007. <br /> <br /> 84/100 (***)
