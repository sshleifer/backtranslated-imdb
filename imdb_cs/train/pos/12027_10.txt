I saw it and I like Melissa playing my role well. It was truly believable. My brother, by law, saw it with my sister and me, and when I mentioned my sister I forgot that it was based on a true story (I saw it a few years ago.) He said only because you think in life that his truth and my two sisters were such that I was wondering if anyone knew what was murder or who was really involved because I wanted to prove it to him. I love lifelong movies, especially those that are true, or those who teach a good lesson. I thought I had seen something about it a week ago, but I can not remember where some help would be appreciated.
