After seeing the Batman Dead End short, I did not know what to expect from World's Finest. Of course, Superman and Batman. All my world's best comics have him as a team. <br /> <br /> After seeing this 3 and a half minute trailer, it forced me to make a serialized fan movie for the world premiere if not a real feature film. Certainly, some of the Superman's things were bizarre, but movie stories in theaters are always examples that give you just certain aspects of the whole product. Looks like he needs a complete product. Apart from the fact that director Sandy Collera played the painfully poor Perry White, most actors were not known. If a real movie was made, actors would be cast to fit in for the film, even though I believe Nina Kaczorowski would do a good Lois Lane, especially if it is closer to the character of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> It is good to see that Clark Bartram wears a Batman costume from the Dead End but should be updated a little bit more and it would not be like 40. Batman with 80s-90s leather jacket and cover. His attitude is similar to Batman, but I still care about the validity of white contact lenses instead of just letting him show the mask. I believe the goal is to get it so close to a comic character than a movie person. Michael O'Hearn can not play Superman, season. It has a facial expression in the face that simply says, "Let me go." And line delivery seems to be a problem with it. Overall, however, I would like to see a complete story and film based on this brilliant work. It was a reputation for the best film in the world that was made, and with the right additions to the script it could be. I hope this happens.
