I never bothered to see this movie in theaters, even though I remember being a name over and over again. Finally I watched this week and what a pleasure. For some reason, I expected it to be too good, so I was absolutely surprised to sit down and get stuck with it and then I was completely pulled in. I read many other user comments and it impressed me how many people talked about fighting in a circle, but what was great about Diana is that he is a real fighter in life. All she needs is to find her where she is, who she is and the ring helps her get there. A very intelligent story, and I am amazed that this is the first time I've ever done for Michelle Rodriguez - that's a great job she has done. Adrian and her coach were also pretty good. <br /> <br /> This movie is a little rough on the edges, but it does not matter at all. The story, will and performance completely outweigh any shortcomings (which usually come with indie filming). The amazing portrait of the girl who found herself and triumphed over her circumstances and K.O. for Michelle Rodriguez!
