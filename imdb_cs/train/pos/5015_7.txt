Hardly a masterpiece. Not so well written. I do not think of beautiful cinematography. This movie was not too awful, but it was not much better than the average. The main story dealing with highly immoral teens should be more focused on banned romance and why this ... really was to get into it instead of destroying the surface basically "because Mom says we can not do it". Some components should be completely discarded or redrafted to be more relevant to the situation of the two main characters. Several times I was wondering if the writer / director was a fan of classic American graffiti George Lucas. Not that it would be bad to be a fan of this movie, but filming your movie sometimes looks like this, I think it will come! The worst part was that Madchen Amick had so little, I think twice! She was the only one, in one or two rows, who had really tried the southern accent. (Listen well, it was there, even though her character comes from California!)! Perhaps if she were a star other people could follow, we should have a really sounding movie. Well, what can you do if you have a director, just a director and not an artist. Very bad. Overall, I'm giving it B - and it's a bit generous because I'm partly Mrs. Amick.
