This Cecil B. DeMille epopee of the Old West contains what may be Jean Arthur's best performance as a hysterical, eccentric, incurably amoral but devotedly dependent Calamity Jane. She really pulled her out! Gary Cooper is in his most silent, but he drives some occasional nasty utterances: "Plains are great, but cross tracks ... sometimes." The story is a trap that ends all trappings. All cowboy heroes of Western tradition seem to be some, except Jesse James. Even Abraham Lincoln opens the story personally (or, at least, DeMille should believe us so). There is no room for something as delicious as softness, it is the story of a "stomp" in the face "for the masses, but the remarkable thing about this film is that it is a very early full frontal assault on what Eisenhower eventually called the" military industrial complex "It's not just a story about common weapons but about arming someone for money, from the heart of Washington But let's get into politics, let's say DeMille, which can be guaranteed to be superficial The most important interest in this film is everything later, George Antheil, who has a lot of work in the autobiography of "Bad Boy of Music." Antheil appears to be from a "big sound" received by all other western countries, with plains singing the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky, celebrating open spaces and link together the melodies, which is why it is not unusual because we heard it a thousand times. was the first to call the combined noise of all sage brushes into this open sky symphony that entered the American mythic tradition and gave him a soundtrack that has never changed, but is undoubtedly appropriate. It's fun to see Anthony Quinn in the early look like Cheyenne Indian. Gabby Hayes is there somewhere, but he's missing him in the crowd. Gary Cooper is all over the big stretch - but when did he become a little?
