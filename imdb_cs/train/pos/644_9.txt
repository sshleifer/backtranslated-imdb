And have a female girlfriend who is currently drawn into a relationship with a SOB who has a long-time friend. Of course SOB is very nice, charming, etc. And my friend is a very intelligent woman. Watching Jean Pierre Leaud's work at work is just like looking at what's going on in real life when the boys have so destroyed the lives of our female friends. It's tragic and you know it's going to end up very hurt, but you can not do anything. Leaud is great. Completely empty. Empty all the time, he pulls his cheeks and tells stories he thinks he gets the reaction he wants. Scene two hours, when Leaud and Lebrun loved, and the next morning he put on the record and very sweet and charming singing and enjoying it brilliantly. "What the hell am I doing here with that idiot," blinking back and forth on her face, will be long in my memory. It's a long movie, but see it in one step, preferably in the cinema. It takes some time before we get, but then the time will disappear.
