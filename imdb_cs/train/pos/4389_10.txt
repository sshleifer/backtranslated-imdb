With the remarkable performance of an extremely impressive cast, intelligently written (and very sensitive) scenario, from rich cinematography to the beautiful musical score of Carter Burwell, Rob Roy offers a rarity in film experiences: it's almost impossible to find a mistake in some area. There were several comparisons with Braveheart, which came out in the same year. With the overall credibility of Mel Gibson, Braveheart attacked me as an overly confident and preposterous epic to compete with Rob Roy as a movie I would like to see more than once. While Braveheart works hard as a serious epic, Rob Roy just catches you and absorbs you into his tightly crafted stories. Not one scene is useless. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy has the perfect balance of dramatic tension, action and even occasional humor. The characters are well-colored, perfectly conveyed by folk people and the ways they are docking in their authentic period. In addition, cartoons are not good and bad, as we have seen too often in modern film. <br /> <br /> For example, if we hope the heroic Rob Roy will win, we realize that his problems are the products of his own pride and sense of honesty. Tim Roth plays one of the most hateful criminals in the history of the film, yet there are times when we can understand how the events of his life shaped him into what he became. Rob Roy employs a level of character development that makes his story even more believable and grasped. Rob Roy is a wonderful treasure, representing one of the greatest sword battles ever choreographed and a climatic end worthy of all tense expectations.
