This is a really nice and sweet film that everyone can enjoy. These are two dogs and cats who are taken to live with someone else for a while, but the animals do not understand and escape and go to find a family on their own. The cat is called Sassy and lives by her name. Chance is a younger dog who knows about life in the inner pound. Shadow is an older and wiser dog that feels things. Put the three of them together for adventure and make it for joy and fun. There are no special effects of mouth movement, so it is not cheese at all. It's the best talking animated movie I've seen so far. It's a really good movie for families.
