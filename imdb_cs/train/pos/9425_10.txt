A series of comedies from the nineties (two series were produced in total) that suffered in British ratings due to poor planning. When you meet established comedies such as Minder, even the best new comedies will try to notice. Fortunately, I captured the series from episode one, and then I fought frantically with him. I mentioned it with my friends and family at the time, but it seemed that everyone was watching something else. Very, very frustrating. Anyway, I loved both series and never forgot. Then I looked at the internet and found out that the ultra-fan tried but both series are now available on DVD. <br /> <br /> http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_S1. htm
