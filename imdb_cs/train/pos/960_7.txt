It's a movie that has a lot of things that only Japanese people can understand. Even well-translated, there are some things that are, of course, private jokes or regional symbolism. My guess is that he was trying to send a message of some kind, but that just left me. <br /> <br /> I felt it was basically an average film with nice special effects. Some child becomes "One" and ultimately has almost no meaning for a war in yokai that makes no sense. It would be nice to understand what the hell he is talking about, but between the Azomic beans that wash yokai and the one that looks like a big umbrella (Rihanna eating your heart out!) I could not distinguish it. br /> <br /> Bottom Line: nice visuals, baby screaming a lot, Princess River is terribly cute and the rest is crap.
