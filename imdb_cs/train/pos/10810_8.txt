Very nice movie. It remains in memory. Better billing like romance than flying or war, other flying parts are realistic and almost flawless. Flying fans like me will enjoy this film, even if they are attracted by aircraft if they have no sensitivity or never like it. <br /> <br /> Fun watching early Crow. He is good and radiates the spell. His reading of "High Flight" is great. <br /> <br /> Hey, Boom
