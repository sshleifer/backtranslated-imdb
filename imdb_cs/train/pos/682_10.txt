This is one of my favorite movies, and although it may move too slowly for some, it is worth seeing. Business lawyer (Richard Chamberlain) is drawn to the case of "indigenous" natives, and that is not a common case. OK, a man died, but it was not a normal killing. There has also been more than average rainfall recently, and the atmosphere of most films is somewhat claustrophobic and oppressive. Natives are hiding secrets and refuse to spill beans. It has a lot to do with the fact that white people create assumptions about "urban" and "tribal" indigenous people and, of course, no Abo in a large city will practice tribal trips. Uh huh. Chamberlain has strange dreams, and it's some key to what's going on, though no matter how many times I've seen it, I can not exactly grasp the exact connection. This is a very insidious and scary film and is a good example of Peter Weir's ability to create tension from nothing. The end is a bit ambiguous, but I took it literally, it's the easiest way and the worst. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended.
