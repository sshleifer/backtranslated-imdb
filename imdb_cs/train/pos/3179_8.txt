Who made this film? I love this movie? Someone has a mad sense of humor ... This Zany, the surreal style of making a movie is appealing, but it's hard to create - or easily forget - that the substances and characters that actually have souls are what give that depth to the film. Without her, comedy would be a lot of ideas. Who cares. He can laugh but passes like a half-empty hamburger ... another ... Crosseyed may not want to change anyone's life, but I appreciate the depth and essence. They will slip on you. I began to think this film: "Oh, I have - indie comedy - from the wall - gonzo ... yeah." And that is - but when you pay attention, the subkey and character moments fill it. In this sense, the film breathes. It creates suggestions that give a pause - if it's available to see them - and then, of course, go on his crazy merry journey. <br /> <br /> You will miss a point if you do not sign a pause agreement at the moment of the movie. The step between reality and surreality is one of the points in this film. <br /> <br /> Crosseyed is not perfect, but intelligent people have done it. I want more. <br /> <br /> Scenes in the dining room are the absolute HOOT. <br /> <br /> Fit the seat belt.
