This movie pleasantly surprised me. It has a moving, slightly central approach that never loses your attention. It's a movie I've never heard of, but if you want a "sleeping", that's it. Great writing, production and acting. I recommend this to viewers who want something thoughtful. Nick Nolte, Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are amazing. Why was not it more of this movie?
