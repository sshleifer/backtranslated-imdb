Cinderella is a beautiful young woman who is cruelly treating her evil mother and sisters. One day the ball will be celebrated in honor of the prince, but Cinderella does not have a chance to go because her stepmother and her stepmothers do not let her. With the help of her fairy tale and her animal friends she is going to the ball, warning her to return home at midnight. On the ball he meets the handsome prince Charming. When he throws the clock at midnight, he runs home and leaves behind one of his glass slippers. With the help of his friends, his real identity is revealed. She and the prince later married and live happily for the rest of their lives. Cinderella, which was released 56 years ago, has been a great success of boxing and continues to attract viewers to date. It has a well-written script. Characters are unforgettable. Pisces, including "The Desire is Wish Your Heart Does", "That's Love," and the Big "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo," help tell the story. It was my favorite movie that grew up and lost no spell. The real work of Disney! Recommended. 10/10 P.S. A recent DVD release is the best way to appreciate this movie, including featurettes, deleted scenes, music videos, vintage radio programs and a restored movie print!
