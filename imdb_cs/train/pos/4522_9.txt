This has surprised me because I was often disappointed in the past by Adrien Pasdar, but in this performance he managed to balance himself perfectly, avoiding both frogs and pathos, and at the same time giving them humor and real emotions. The always awesome Julie Waters is great, and anyone who did not have her, Eduard Rita in 1983, should rent her (a great movie). The remaining supporting characters are playable, many incredibly eccentric without going over the top. This is funny.
