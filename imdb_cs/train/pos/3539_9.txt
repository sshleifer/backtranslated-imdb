Good: Engaging film firefighters, great presentation, vehicles are really entertaining, fairly attractive multiplayer, faithful film and the list goes on. Bad: Major missions are a bit short. /> <br /> This game defines what a "good" third person shooter (not necessarily a spy game). Big martial events carry the story and they do how you want to complete each single mission and unlock all the real bonuses the game offers. The mood that this game has had survived, and I personally think you should buy it and connect with a few friends and play this. Fun of fun. <br /> <br /> The sound in this game is a nasty success from several earlier bond games and a shotgun, you really feel like you shoot a gun. This is related to the fact that you are a deadly and merciless spy. <br /> <br /> All in all, this game excites you and is happy after you've done it, and some multiplayer that can compete with Crafty James Bond's "Nightfire" game for the gamecube.
