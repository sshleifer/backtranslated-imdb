"Convocates" is a very third film. All the dialogues and character interactions that appear in it are based on the long slowdown of the late southern day. And moreover, the life of his main character, Soll (Robert Duvall). This is the first collaboration between director Peter Masterson and writer Horton Foote. Six years ago she worked together on "Trip to Bountiful," a film that seems almost actionable compared to this film action. Masterson is not necessarily a good director. In fact, it is hardly feasible on this page. The slow tempo leaves a lot of room for the cameraman Toyomichi Kurita, who only brings the right feeling of fragile light and heat into the film. Because it is basically a movie game that has little editing or managing education, it all comes to acting. As for me, there are no mistakes here. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, two of the best American actors (both born in January 1931), create characters that are quite real, they are not interested in anything but life. Lukáš Haas, a young actor I know of "Testament" and "witness", plays a character that resembles other early roles. He is calm, staying, slightly frightened and sad. These are the qualities that seem naturally to him. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the name "murderer" is a bad service for this movie. The title, along with the initial scene, seems to create an image of a much more sophisticated Western image. If you are not interested in slow-motion theater productions, you will want to pass on this. Otherwise it could be exactly the movie you want more often. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
