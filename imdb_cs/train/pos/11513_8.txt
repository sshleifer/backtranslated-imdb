One of my most popular shows was held in the 1970s. As I recall, it was Friday (or maybe Saturday) night at Nine Network (?) Here in Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were great. <br /> <br /> Each episode usually culminated and Kolchack had to engage in a hand to fight some supernatural rival. To their esteem, the writers are concentrating their efforts to get away from the usual round of vampires and spirits as much as possible. I remember one episode in which the old Indian's spirit opponent was who returned as a massive electric current that started killing people in the city hospital. The final survey was found by Kolchack, who tried to break the "mighty beast" in the middle of the explosion of sparks and flames. Well ... you had to be there at the time, but that was an interesting idea. McGavin has always packed a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and this was one of his best. </ br /> <br /> Definitely deserves a place in the "Hall of Fame" of the television. Quote Tony Vincenzo .... 'You're on IT' ... or, in the case of Hall of Fame, 'in it'!
