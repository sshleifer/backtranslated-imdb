Barriers appear to be one of those series that have been lost in the fog of time. After its transmission in the early 1980s and after a single repetition, it has since sunk without a trace. It's a shameful disgrace. Originally I watched it when it was broadcast on southern television on Sunday afternoon and it was classical tea time. Although I do not remember much about the program, there are a few things in my mind. The most memorable titles were the most memorable. Permanent flute music accompanied by an escape attempt across the East European border and a subsequent car crash (and this scene left me with love for the "fintail" Mercedes models when using the Merc 200). Although it was not obvious at first, the solution to the mystery series was in these titles. All about a young music student trying to figure out what really happened when he found out that he was adopted had lots of twists and turns, but Barriere was a surprisingly "adult" children's drama. Benedict Taylor was as good as Billy and it was a shame he did not do much more. It was a quality track that was far enough to release the DVD, and I hope I get a chance to get to know it again. <br /> <br /> Funny childhood memories
