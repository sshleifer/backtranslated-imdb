I recently found a copy for $ 5 in the video store and eagerly pulled it out. While music and (of course) graphics are not in line with the standards of my favorite series Window in my view, I was still interested in one segment: Stanley and Stella in "Breaking the Led". Music is great and emotions are real. Unfortunately, the Odyssey clip does not have a story or music.
