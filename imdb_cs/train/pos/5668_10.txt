I came across this series by chance. After half episode, I was closed. The American Gothic was a dark, strange series with Gary Cole as a mysterious, probably evil Sheriff Buck, trying to gain control of his illegitimate son Caleb, played by Lucas Black. I was overwhelmed by the ominous sheriff Gary Cole, and I was even more impressed with Lucas Black. Caleb Lucas Black was able to confront Sheriff Buck, one of the most frightening characters ever created for a TV series. I have rarely seen a child actor with such a strong presence or talent as Lucas Black. If you were not lucky when you saw Lucas in American Gothic, look at him in Slingblade. It was a remarkable show with many ambiguities and secrets that could never be explained in a short time.
