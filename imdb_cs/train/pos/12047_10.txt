The first and only moment when I saw a woman in black I thought it was the only thing I learned she had appeared on television in 1989. It was Christmas Eve and my father and I watched her in the living room shortly before midnight in the service of the village church. I was relatively young at the time, but I'm not sure who is more scared when she walks through the church yard at the entrance to the church at night of me or my father! a film that is so scary, but I think one of them is the fact that there is not much in the soundtrack that plays in the background of almost every Hollywood movie, so every screech, bum and bang is more intense in your head because it's not distraction . Another factor that is different from other stories about the spirit is not any jumping factor that would include things that bend from the cabinet so it's not necessarily what you see but what you hear and what you think is happening . This is a smart medium, because nothing worries you more than your own mind that runs the revolt you think is behind the corner or the door! An excellent story of spirits, I have never seen anything, with all the dross that is repeated over and over again on TV I can not believe that the BBC has removed after (to my knowledge) only one shows!
