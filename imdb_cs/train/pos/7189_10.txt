He has a very popular character in the movies, but almost everyone has the Zorro character as a mask and if the villains can not say who's under that stuff, they're scary. <br /> <br /> But in "Zorro's Fighting Legion," Reed Hadley (Series 1939), the mask fills its entire face, which is the real secret of Zorro really. <br /> <br /> But Zorro is one of the best characters in the movies and it brings it to this day. I think Anthony Hopkins in "The Mask of Zorro" (1998) is a pleasure. My interest in movies is huge, but I really like the serial 30s / 40s .... <br /> <br /> Bond2a
