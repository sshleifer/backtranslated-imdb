I think this movie is well done and realistic. You are accustomed to watching Hollywood action movies and using them as a standard for rating this film, you have to be disappointed. This film is much closer to real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and that's what lifts him above the average action movie. I have no experience with the Swedish Army, and therefore I can not point to any mistakes in the manner of negotiations. But as I have seen "creation" in addition, I am convinced that much has been done to avoid mistakes. This is a movie that I will recommend to others. High quality realistic story and film.
