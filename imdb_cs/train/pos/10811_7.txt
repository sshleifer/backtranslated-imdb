This movie will bring you to another moment when you have taken another step towards your everyday life. We get an idea of ​​how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young men into battle. A very moving look at the past and the remark that war victims were not just at the front. Fortunately, many of us have never had to go through what our grandparents, grandparents or parents have gone through during the war. This movie, I think, is a small thank you. Peter Outerbridge looks amazing as young Peter O'Toole and Russell Crowe is absolutely charming and as Australian as he can be. It's definitely worth listening to reciting "High Flight" and wondering what he could do with Shakespeare.
