A heavy movie to comment, how do you say it's bad? Well it's not, but then it's just as hard to say that's good. What it is is convincing tracking, it's as close as you get to total devastation without you being there. It's a tsunami photo approaching the coast of Thailand brought to life, you know you want to turn away, but you have to look. The Naudet brothers process the comment very well, even in the most tragic circumstances, there is a look at something that is happening in another country, neither panders, or insults. Facts are on cellulose, and a bit is needed to make the viewer understand or understand what's going on. <br /> <br /> You can not change history and you should not want this movie to stand as proof of humanity in the darkest time.
