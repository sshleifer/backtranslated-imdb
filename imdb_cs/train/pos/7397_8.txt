"Xizao" is a story about the collision of modern life and ancient traditions and its influence on the family in China. Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu) is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) makes him believe that his father Liu (Xu Zhu) has died. He found his father still alive, just like his old quarter and an old father's shop, a public bathroom. The film focuses on the Da Minga family and how to learn the importance of his father's job, something he always considered an old tradition that soon died. The film also explores his relationship with Er Ming, who is mentally handicapped and the problems of small communities, and how the bathroom is a place that cleans not only their bodies but also their souls. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Director Yang Zhang narrates his story in a simple way and leaves the characters to work. This is a very simple approach, but it fits perfectly with the movie and I very much doubt that another style would fit so well. Zhang has a tremendous potential because he can tell the story without the help of visual flare or camera tricks. The actor's performance is excellent in its naturalistic approach, all act very naturally, and almost looks like real people have been filmed. The three main characters give remarkable performances and Wu Jiang as Er Ming certainly steals the show. Even if the film could belong to the sponsor's "old day was a much better" message, instead it takes the attitude of balance, saying that progress is good, and we have to go on, but we must not forget where we came from and keep the balance between modern life and the traditions of the old. Amazing and touching the movie. 8/10
