Although this film has some weaknesses, it is worth seeing. I chose it for the cast and I appreciate Bonham Carter and Branagh for choosing roles different from those they've done in the past. Both are very troubled people who are full of warts, but because of their humanity they like it. The story touches, but the performances that are rising. Bonham Carter "Jane" is a remarkable achievement whose search for romance has opened my eyes to aspects of disability I have not previously thought of, but it has also been interesting for other reasons. I felt that the film ended too suddenly, but it was better than just a emotionally manipulative ending (see "Stepmom.") A very real English setting added to my pleasure - it was England in the 1990s, urban and rural without being depressed.
