I have seen this movie on Sky Cinema not so long ago. I have to admit that it was a really good West, which contains 2 big names. On the one hand, Charlton Heston, playing Samuel Burgade's infamous and retiring lawyer. On the other hand .. Late James Coburn plays the vicious Zach Provo .. looking for revenge on the Burgade no matter what it's worth! The good thing about this movie was that there were really good characters. Most of the actors played it really well .. Especially James Coburn, who found that he was really fine in this movie .. But how it was .. Christopher Mitchum, I have seen everywhere in other movies .. Playing Hal Brickman .. I felt, that his character was omitted in the cold, but he managed to return by joining with Burgada to kill Provo's posse! <br /> <br /> Everybody in all, it was a great movie .. Very good to watch .. Great score from the late Jerry Goldsmith .. <br /> <br /> Amazing piece of Western personality ..! 8 out of 10.
