A truly amazing film, the concept as perhaps the prophetic vision of the future is scary. World over-crowded, unbearable heat due to damaged ozone layer and all our natural resources spent. In this haunted degenerate society, we have the great Charlton Heston as a detective film detective film that attempts to understand the truth about murder, compared to legendary film noir Edward G Robinson, who has recently been introduced. One of the paintings that will always stay with me from this film is the number of people who dwell the stairs and the way Thorne (Heston) has to go through them every time they use them. <br /> <br /> The use of music for the movie is also good, even if it does not contain any score in the usual sense. The theme of the opening is good and the subsequent leaks of the music that we have here in Simonson's apartment, and in particular the part of Beethoven in the euthanasia clinic, are excellent atmospheric.
