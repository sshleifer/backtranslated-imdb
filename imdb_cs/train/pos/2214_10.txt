My family returned to New Orleans at the end of the 1600s to the beginning of the 17th century, and while watching the film, I knew it was a story my parents never talked about, but we knew they existed. I have cousins ​​apparently black and afro-americans and others who can "walk" like white and decide not. It's hard to follow history when you realize that it's your family they're talking about, and that the River Cane is part of this history. I want to cry, and I want to kick my grandparents who owned the plantations and wonder how my grandmothers from the African heritage lived under this depressing yet aristocratic existence ... And at that time I did not go from this history, I would probably not be a successful business woman, who I live in a relatively integrated world today. The game was excellent and fair, depending on the actors, but it is a movie that NEEDS to do. Anne Rice is incredible and I ask myself why he "symbolically" writes about my family and I am not. I recommend this film to everyone. Leza
