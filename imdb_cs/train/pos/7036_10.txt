I have to be one of the best political satirists I have ever seen, with excellent performance for Cusak, Tomei and all supporting actors. Excellent plot, very well positioned and very good unexpected twist at the end. The action scenes were well shot and choreographed. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Overall, I give this movie a big thumb up. He is extremely critical of US military intervention in the Middle East and as such can get bad reviews from people who do not share the same political opinion or those who are just too politically unconscious to appreciate dark and drk humor. In local places, comedy was so close to the truth that there was a border between funny and tragic.
