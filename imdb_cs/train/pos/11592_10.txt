My son was seven years old when he saw this movie, he is now on the Russian Fishing Boat and says that the film he was most interested in and that he had resorted to in his mind is all 39 years of the movie The Legend of Boy and Eagle. He asked if it was possible for me to get it for him. I'm sure a lot of things is going through his head because he has only 3 hours of daylight and is on this ship for 3 months and will have another 3 months before the expiration of the contract. Because we have Indian blood, he joins this movie. January 27 will end at 47 years and I would like to get this movie for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a business fisherman for the last 17 years, and as we all know, it is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me get this movie? Thank you in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL
