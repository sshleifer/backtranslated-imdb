When I reflect this film, I can think of two more to help. One quite forgotten, but covering the same geography, is the Coup de Torchon, another thousand kilometers away, and a much larger range is the unforgettable Indochine. Claire Denis produced a film that has some of the main indochina backgrounds, a complex and unspoken relationship between France and its colonial subjects. I was struck by the dignity of Potee with his attempt to maintain his dignity among his peers and white bosses. I was also struck by the relationship of love and hatred between him and Aimee. This is the movie that gives the film its driving force, it is the one that connects this film with Indochina. He is never sure what motivates everyone, although some characters are required by the memory of colonialism. This is the cynical story of the story that connects it to Coup de Torchon. Their scandalous story may be even more interesting, but Denis reminds us of how it was with all the tension and unresolved relationships. American Black, which gives a bigger France, a ride in the beginning and the end of the film, offers another interesting side to the confusion we have in the Western world when we look at Africa. He says when he came, he wanted to call every brother. He came back home, but they just thought he was a bit hideous. France, the character and the girl, grew up in Cameroon, but they do not fully understand what it is, even though they remember how it was. <br /> <br />
