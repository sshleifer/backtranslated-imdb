Viewing "Impulse" is a very satisfying experience. Unpredictable movies are so rare when one comes as "Impulse," it's something to accept. The script is logical and extremely creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronyn and Bill Paxton give a faithful performance. It could come out as a zombie movie, but "Impulse" is much better than any boring "zombie", and originality shines in almost every scene. You feel like this could happen even though the screenplay is purely fiction. From "opening" to counting credits, you will be fascinated. Very fun and definitely recommended. - MERK
