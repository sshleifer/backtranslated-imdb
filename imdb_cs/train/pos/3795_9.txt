After seeing this film at the SF Independent Film Festival, I could not wait to find out how to get a copy. Jim McKay then talked about a film that portrayed his ironic situation: how to get a distribution for a film that portrays minorities (women, skeptics) dealing with issues (teenage pregnancy, teenage girls, racial identity, single mother households) and how to write a faithful script on all these subjects, who are middle-aged men. The long-term adult audience of many sexes has redeemed the fantastic story of the film, detailed characters, and a fantastic display of "real teenage life." Most of the teenagers, however, left the building - which made me think that it is the film that best sees adults with children as a starting point for discussion than how many adults feel "movie teens should see because it is about them. "Distribution issues - how do we get into it? Internet (retail) would be a great way - it's a movie that will be buried, for example, "Puppy" or other radical modern teenage movies - and McKay seemed to react. As for his credits as a writer / director, McKay was sensitive and detailed in his work - he joined the Crown Heights neighborhood in which the film was set up, working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they are supposed to be - the results are disarmingly realistic.
