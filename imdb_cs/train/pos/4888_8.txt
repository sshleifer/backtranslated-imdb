It just aired on BBC and I am absolutely delighted that I saw it. When the credits developed, occupied with itself, sure, I'll do it. After just five minutes, I was completely immersed in this beautiful movie. Yes, it was formulative and predictable, but it somehow added to his spell. Retrospectives forties were well placed and capture the feel balanced in several productions. A real feel-good movie, ubiquitous everywhere with great music. When he's released, I'll buy it!
