I saw this film every opportunity I got in the 1970s when she came out on the cable. It was my introduction to Harlem, who has fascinated me since then (and Bill Clinton). I was still very young and the film made me feel great. It was great to see a movie about other young girls who are developing, trying to decide who they want and making bad and good decisions. I was overwhelmed by the beauty of Lonette McKee, the big dress they finally dressed, and the quick interview. Like someone who was raised only by my mother, I really managed to meet those girls and their lives. It's funny, it seems to me that these characters are really real to me than Beyonce Knowles!
