The Human Tornado (1976) is in many ways a better film than its predecessor. The director knew what he was supposed to do, and he cared about limiting actor Rudy Moore as an actor. It's a fun movie that is technically more sound and working. The leaders are not taking too seriously, and this time everyone seems to be joking and walking with the flow. Rudy Ray Moore looks more relaxed in front of the camera and is not as stiff as if he were in Dolemite. I liked the film and I highly recommend it. Like his first film, he focuses on a particular audience (I very much doubt that Mr. Moore was trying to expand his audience at this point in his career). Look at that! <br /> <br /> We are highly recommended.
