Penny Princess finds the American working girl Yolande Donlon, the heir of a small kingdom lying in a triangle where France, Italy and Switzerland, called Lampidorra, meet. It seems that Lampidorrans owes accounts throughout Europe and the country's main occupation is smuggling because of its geography. An American millionaire buys this place, but he dies before he can get into the title. His closest heir is Donlan. Of course the estate must go through a test in America and what should Lampidorans do? Especially because Donlan, who became a princess, forbade smuggling. <br /> <br /> Enter Dirk Bogarde, who is on a trip to Switzerland to learn about the cheese industry. It seems that Lampidorrans has some sort of cheese that they call playfully as Schmeeze. With some impact on the road, Schmeeze addresses all the financial, geopolitical and romantic issues between Donlan and Bogard. As Schmeeze works, it's a trick for the whole movie. But here's the help. In the movie Lover Come Back, Jack Kruschen could have gotten into the hands of Schmeeze's secret when he was busy trying to invent a VIP for Rock Hudson and his advertising agency. Penny Princess, however, is a wonderful mix of British farce and romantic comedy. Yolande Donlon plays again the role that Marilyn Monroe should be cast if the film becomes this side of the pond. Dirk Bogarde was well occupied in the part that was at the beginning of his career as a romantic heart pulsing before anyone else but suspected of having the acting cats he had. This film was sadly shown at 3am on TCM. But at least I found reason to be grateful for insomnia.
