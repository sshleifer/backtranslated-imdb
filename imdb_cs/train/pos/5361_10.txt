If you have been brought up on a diet game, you will understand that you need more and better repair. Well, in the world of a running man, your needs will be spurred. Because in this game the prisoners compete for freedom and the ultimate price - about their lives. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. It was such a parody of the spooky annoyance we are watching every day. It's not one of Schwarzenegger's best performances, but overall it's a very good movie. The basic idea that television companies will one day be the "true" rulers of the planet is very credible and well-described in this film. Of course, they're Arnie's one-off one, my favorite is when he's about to get into the game zone, and the guest will ask, "Any last words?" Arnie says, "Yeah, I'll be back," but the host will try "re-run only" and press the eject button. I give this film ten for pure originality. I had to watch it for 30 or more times. The only film, apart from the Die Hard series, I watched it often! <br /> <br /> In short, do not think you own a TV for a minute - it's yours .....
