Tony Hawk Underground came in the moment the show really began to lose its shine, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 did not meet the expectations and the series really got into the air on what Neversoft and Activision could do with series that would be different and interesting. Underground introduced the story, which was very cool, because for fans of Tony Hawk Pro Skater he created a whole new world. Another task that the fans were basically talking about and who could get out of the skateboard, which is nice, because now you can actually climb, run and do all sorts of new things. <br /> <br /> They are good, Neversoft has also improved the problem that started with Pro Skater 3 and that was the length of level design. The first two games for PS1, N64 and Dreamcast were great because the levels were nice and long and some hidden features in some. For Skater 3 and 4 they were shortened due to a handful of properties that were added and actually pushed systems as well as their limits. In this version they have shortened these features, not so many people who are interested in the aisles, in fact, they are virtually not in some levels, and graphics and skating physics are a little quiet but not too much. <Br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This game has one horse, the storymode is a bit short, of course it's Neversofts for the first time with Tony Hawk Pro Skater, so it's understandable. However, with that you said, you will definitely finish this game in one day. <br /> <br /> A great addition that was very refreshing.
