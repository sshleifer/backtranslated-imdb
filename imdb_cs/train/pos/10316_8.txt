Remember these two stories kindly and in the first one, which is in the far-away future, we see the young boy who is preparing for the test day, the state test i.q. The boy is a bit confused about his parents' anxiety, as some of his friends have already done it and eventually going out for an exam. Upon arrival he gets an injection and is curious why. The investigator smiles and tells him that it's just to make sure he's telling the truth. The boy then asks again, why not? It is later and the parents sit on the screen cautiously when a message appears and states that the state is sorry but the level of their son i.q exceeded the national quotient and politely asked that they would enjoy a private funeral. Corker Final Scene! The charity report was the story of warming the heart about the psychic connection between the girl from the past and the guy from the present. In the past, he has faded into a strange story about witch charges and has come across historic sites in the present. A nice story with a hearty conclusion.
