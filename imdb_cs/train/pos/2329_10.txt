The "Man on the Moon" is a beautifully realistic view of life through the eyes of a teenager. Director Robert Mulligan remarkably transforms Jenny Wingfield's autobiography from childhood with beautiful cinematography and creepy lyrical music score. This film is one of the most powerful and emotionally impacting films in recent times. This film is unbelievable, everything works first, especially Sam Waterston and the amazing performance of Reese Witherspoon in his debut film. You will feel all the emotions because this life changing in the summer of 1957 at the Trant family farm ends. <br /> <br /> The Man on the Moon was a limited release in 1991 and you will love the fact that most of you are family and friends probably probably never heard of it. Buy this dvd and enjoy 100 minutes of pure poetic art. This film is really the essence of the film at its best.
