It was the first film I've ever seen Ashley Judd and the first movie of Victor Nunez I've ever said and I'm glad I was glad. His "silent tone, his relaxed pace, his realistic depiction of a young woman who is just starting out in life, is a great rendering of the matches he has to live to get his life in life, the decision he makes based on real things, people, it's so close to the movie of magic that I've ever seen outside the Star Wars movie and, given what those movies are, it means that this film really deserves a high rating The effect of Ashley Judd's, Mr. Nunez'writing, and his "great simple story make this story of the story and a wonderful film.
