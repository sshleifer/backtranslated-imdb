Surprisingly interesting meditation about the nature of regret as to the way it relates to paranoia. There is a lot going on in this situation because it has a run time of only 74 minutes, but it works. The creeks are very gentle, not jumps that seem to blend in with the latest Asian horror. The way they set "fears" is similar to the disturbing moments in "The Uninvited" (aka 4 Inyong shiktak, directed by Su-Leon Lee), but it's not nearly the same caliber. The film makes a nice job of balancing the classic spiritual story with something unusual and psychological. It's not perfect, but it does what to do. I recommend that you verify it if you have a chance.
