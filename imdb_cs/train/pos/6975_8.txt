If I had just seen the pilot of this show, I would throw it at the 10th. I had an immediate shot at this beautiful new world. Subsequent episodes have not completely fulfilled the promise, but I will keep track of it and hope it is getting better. Production values ​​are unbelievable and are first class. I do not mind that BSG seems to be completely unresponsive, because I'm so preoccupied and we look, it's two different shows. I'm excited that both Esai Morales and one of my ever-present pictures, Eric Stoltz, are in my life (though only a weekly) because I miss them too. This is a show that requires a little thought from the audience, and that's always a good thing. You have to wrap your head around some aspects of the show; things are not always as it seems, and there are certainly shades of gray, both literally and figuratively, in loops, characters, and of course in different virtual worlds. We all know how it will end, but the path is trying to be quite on the way.
