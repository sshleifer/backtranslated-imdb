He rented the movie as a joke. My friends and I had so much fun that we got there, we found the used copy and bought it for ourselves. Now that all my friends are looking for a fun movie, I'll give them Sasquatch Hunters. It has to be said that there is a rule that happened that the movie was much better. It is not allowed to speak while a movie is playing unless Sasquatch repeatedly appears. I also liked credit at the end of the movie. "Thanks for Jeep, Tom!" Who is Tom, thank you, because without your Jeep, the film does not have to be made. In short, a great movie if you're looking for something to laugh at. If you want a good movie maybe looking for something else, but if you do not mind laugh at the expense of a man in monkey suits, take a copy.
