People enchant no less than brilliant when Steven Spielberg directs the film, and this film is no exception. Some movies I loved are wrong at the box office, but I'm glad that this movie is not one of them (over nine million dollars, which in my opinion was not bad). The characters were fun, the animations were clear and unintentional, and the music was modern, which is unusual for animated films. I did not think Professor Screw Eyes or his "Scary Cirus" was too scary for young children (the target audience for this movie), but I thought what had become a scary professor at the end was a bit too dark, a movie. Overall, this movie is a fun and charming classic that I loved long ago.
