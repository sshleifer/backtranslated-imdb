This highly derived movie will be fun for many people who have not seen some of the more extensive anime movies. I liked it very much, especially after relatively flat minutes in the museum (although the pre-title sequence is very fun and contains some of the better bits of animation). James Garner as Commander, and Leonard Nimoy as King, provide impressive performances.
