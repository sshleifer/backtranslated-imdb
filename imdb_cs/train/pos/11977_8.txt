OK. Who brought the cheese. I love it. During the run it became a phenomenon. Anorexic twins have become popular. Bob Saget began to pay (instead of his really funny stand-up). And people knew who Dave Coulier was. This is the life when he was good and simple. This is one of the great American classics. It was humorous and always brought a good lesson. And that's where I was different from the standard: I liked the last few seasons. Just like Home Improvement, when kids age, there is much more to the screenplay. That's why I'm going to say ... It could have been much later than it was. But anyway. I gave him 8/10 due to his healthy, fun stories and for Bob Saget!
