Does Al Pacino ever have a bad movie? His name appears to be a magazine for the top cinema. It's as good as he ever did. Pacino is an American Olivier. And it's such a political thriller as good as they get. There are no good guys and no bad guys. But this system has an inexorable impact on people who think they are running it. Not only is the performance of Pacino's convincing --- eulogy at the funeral of a dead child is amazingly strong - the film has a quick dark, fragile realism to increase the gentle performances without resorting to tricks. This excellent portrait of city politics can also provide two hours of excellent movie watching without undue violence, overheated sex or tongue tongue. There is a murder. There are bad people. But they hit effectively without crossing the border. Such a movie restores my crazy belief in Hollywood. I do not give many tens. This one deserves it!
