My Super X-Girlfriend is one hell on a roller coaster. The special effects were excellent, and the costumes that Uma Thurman wore were a dull bob. Uma Thurman is an underestimated comedic actress, but she proved that everyone was wrong and took her role as a crazy girlfriend. She was just great! Luke Wilson was also good as average Joe, but he was a brave man who worked with one of the greatest actresses of all time. Supporting acting was also great, especially Anna Faris, which was exceptionally good (much better than in the movie series Scary Movie). Ivan Rietman very well directed this film because if it was not for him and Uma Thurman this film would not do that. This film is definitely 10/10 for cast (Uma Thurman), it's a director, it's a script and its original line. This movie is highly recommended.
