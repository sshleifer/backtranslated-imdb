The characters in this film fall into two categories: intelligent and silly. Simple. <br /> <br /> Jiří Macháček (Standa) plays an unfortunate, furious guy who is arrested for the crime he has committed. When he tries to get financially from his evil, the former boss, the situation gets out of control. While Standa is really (but honestly) stupid, his friend Ondrej is an absolutely stupid idiot, and he can say and do the wrong thing every time. Without Ondrea, Standa would have a chance to live her life with some modest success. Ondrej will never be boring, but he will not be without big headache! <br /> <br /> Ivan Trojan plays Zdenko, the evil genius type that degenerates into a Hitler-esquire vicious tyrant. Zdeněk and his followers are trying to kill Standu to save Zdeněk's secret. <br /> <br /> I am very impressed by the high quality and imagination of Czech films. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic certainly has more than its share of excellent entertainment. The best Czech films I've seen are: 1) Swans and 2) The Dark Blue World. If you see these two films, you've seen absolutely the best Czech cinematography.
