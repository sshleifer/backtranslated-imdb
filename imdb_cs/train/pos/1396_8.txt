Probably one of the best examples of following a thrilling, dramatic episode (in this case, an extraordinary balance of terror) with a lighter subject, Shore Leave is the first real attempt on behalf of Star Trek writers to create a more entertaining piece of sci-fi and while the formula is not right (true triumph is Trouble with Tribbles, in season 2), laughs fairly quickly if the viewer is willing to afford all the stupidity. <br /> <br /> Deviating from the show tradition, Enterprise is not the right mission in this episode. Instead, Kirk found the perfect planet for his crew to spend some time out of service: a deserved break after three months of constant work. A planet similar to Earth (really budget related) is very attractive, but it takes only a few minutes before something special happens: McCoy will have a vision of a white rabbit that seems to come directly from Lewis Carroll's work. Soon similar things begin to appear: a woman meets a character like Don Juan, Sulu has a samurai, and Kirk faces a double encounter with the past in the form of almost love and the guy who used to pick him at the academy. Take a horror-looking tiger and it's easy to understand why Kirk and Spock are determined to find out what's going on before someone hurts. The idea is classic: the idyllic place turns out to be far from the sky. The funny theme of the episode is rather successful, not a dark turn of events that does not fit well with others (of course, everything works well, the end is over) and the general reluctance of the creator to show (most notably and ironically, otherwise, the cheerful William Shatner). And yet, Shore Leave deserves recognition for being another good example of writers trying to find new, unseen things: the definition of Star Trek's success. <br /> <br /> 7,5 / 10
