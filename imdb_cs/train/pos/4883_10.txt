We, as a family, were so delighted with the "Last Blonde Bomb", we bought a copy for our home video library. Acting is A1 and cast contains many favorite actors and singers. The topic is unusual and the font is well written. Music / songs are timeless and take us back to our young days when we sang the songs at the top of our voices. Draw this story that would spoil the "plot", because it is really nice to sit down and enjoy the story of how it is done. Full marks of this most enjoyable and uplifting production and we cordially recommend anyone looking for laughter and a lot of music.
