Most Italian horror lovers apparently hate this movie because it has no connection with the first two demons. And with the title "Demons III" in the title, we would expect it to be. The problem is that this movie was never meant to be a part of the Demons series. Distributors only "Demons III" over their original name "The Ogre" to gain more popularity of the film. The new release of the American DVD of this film has the title "Demons III: Ogre" in the box art, but the film itself is called "The Ogre". I do not know if the previous edition has given the title "Demons III" to the film itself, but this new edition seems to be a bit of a white spoon. If you get the title "Demons III" in the title, you can enjoy the "The Ogre" a little. It starts intro creep and remains quite wide. There is no gore and movie movies slowly but I still dug it. Just do not expect it to be like other Demon movies. I give "The Ogre" 7 out of 10. Italian fans should try it.
