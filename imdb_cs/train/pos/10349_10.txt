It's one of those movies that made me feel strongly about the need to shoot movies at all. In general, I'm a fan of movies based on valuable stories. And this is great! In addition to the performance of Meryl, which has won a lot of recognition and praise, the story's most important contribution to the film is based on. The stinging story of a couple suffering from social and legal torture after having undergone tremendous emotional pain in their child's unexpected and brutal death is a truly enchanting story that reveals the inhuman side of others and reveals barbarism as a highly refined and legitimate society. It is interesting to see how people who consider themselves to be kind and intelligent people (an emotional jury in the film, for example) are in fact nothing but selfish fools who, because of their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices, have shut their brains to arbitrary conduct and contemplation in the light of all the facts that make very clear their views. The other face of the so-called "Civilized" society that the film reveals is apathy toward other people's pains (it does not have to be said that it is very general, though this specific story unfolds in Australia), it is far from real cruelty. You have to find out if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps provocative.
