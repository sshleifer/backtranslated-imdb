As soon as you jump out of your floor when you realize that ... somehow ... it happened together so quickly it was released in the same year when the case ended, you will find that it is not half bad. The task is interest and interest, and speed is fast, which covers many situations, and so often jumps quickly to another after the second or second speech. Where it really is, it's acting. Performance is excellent. Neill and Streep are impeccable. It's also great to hear so many Australians spoken in a Hollywood film and even those who do not naturally come to it at least try to emphasize. Cinematography and editing are pretty nice, but they actually go beyond standard stuff. The story of this film is convincing and the fact that it is authentic, it only makes it worse. While I did not read this novel nor did I hear about what happened outside of this picture, I understand it is quite true. This is a mild to strong language and a disturbing content. It is sometimes a terrible dramatic drama. I recommend it to every well-known fan. 7/10
