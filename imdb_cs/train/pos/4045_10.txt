I'm so glad I had the chance to see this rare little piece of film. I saw it at an independent film festival, so do not expect it to come to your city in the foreseeable future. During the movie, I noticed that about 10 people are getting up and going. Too bad for them (down in the south, people do not like to read the headlines). The film starts slowly, but it is so rich in dialogue that I've never borne. When the action finally comes, I find myself stuck on the screen as if I were on a roller coaster. <br /> <br /> I also got a great advantage of the chapter titles that appeared before the chapters, especially those that represent the characters as they appear on the screen. It reminds me of Zelda (Ocarina of the Time) when you stand before the levels of the bosses. As far as the future of "video games / comic books" is concerned, I welcome this.
