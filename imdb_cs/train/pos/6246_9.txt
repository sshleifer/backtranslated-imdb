It's not a great idea to watch Hundstage unless you're 100% sure of your mental stability because it will be severely tested with this movie no matter how normal you are. I have to say that Hundstage is an artistic film rather than an entertaining film, so most of the audience would not have the level of "maturity" to achieve its beautiful site. Something similar to Tarkovsky's film, but something else. I can not say that I noticed it myself. But it's a great and very exciting experience for those who are just the tricky clich√©s offered by Hollywood. Hundstage holds your finger directly into your brain and scratches your mind everywhere. You can not simply sit down and watch it, you'll use screaming or looking with your eyes wide open all over the movie. The movie, which is similar in style, is Nachtgestalten, but was much better and less violent. For example, this is not intended for children or those who are mentally gentle or ill temperized. Most viewers would probably have either 10 or 1 movie. I give 9 because I saw a phenomenon with several stories in one film in another movie and it was better. But this is an excellent piece by myself. It's worth watching, but get ready to see something worrying.
