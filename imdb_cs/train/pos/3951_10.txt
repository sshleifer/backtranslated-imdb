I saw this film just once, on TV, and it was not repeated. It is strange when you consider waste that is repeated over and over again. Usually, horror films for me are a source of fun, but I really feared that. <br /> <br /> DO NOT READ OUT FOR THE NEXT BIT, ASK THAT THE FILM WAS NOT EXPECTED. <br /> <br /> The worst is when the burghers persecute the preacher, where his wife lies almost dead (they poisoned her). He asks who the hell you are. One after another they give their true identity. A girl who pretends to be deaf to spoil and seduce her says, "I am Lilith, the witch who loved Adam before Eve."
