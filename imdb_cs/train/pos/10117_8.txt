The story of the drifter, the head of the sheep's ranch and the boss's daughter is not for all tastes, but it's still very interesting. It's happening in the beautiful country of New Zealand, amongst the scenery we knew so well with other films in the area. This movie was the first time I've ever seen, excellent Mary Regan, and since then I've been a fan of her. Casting also includes Bruno Lawrence, who is probably best remembered by American viewers from the movie Smash Palace. Terence Cooper returns as a ranch owner who pays too little attention to his daughter (Regan). <br /> <br /> He worked violently, with unforgettably breaking performance from all his leadership. For the first time, I've seen this movie in an extremely modified form on nightly television in America, but trust me that you do not have to miss the unreleased version.
