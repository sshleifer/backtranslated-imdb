This movie is proof that movie noire is a permanent style and is extremely worthy to stay alive. For me, this is the best example of a noire movie from Chinatown. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we will never get the recognition it deserves. At the time she was released for the first time, she was never promoted properly, and she had to build her fan club through places like Vanguard Cinema and oral mouth recommendations. I highly recommend that people looking for something more than meaningful fun rent the film and penetrate into its very complicated conspiracy.
