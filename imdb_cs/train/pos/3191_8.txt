Director Edward Sedgwick, an old hand in a visual comedy, successfully leads this road show, Hal Roach, which offers a fast and skilful screenplay and excellent casting, utilizing a large number of reliable Roach performers. Though the movie was originally portrayed as a vehicle for Patsy Kelly, Sun Jack Haley plays as Joe Jenkins, a young Kansan who sells his car repair business and travels to Hollywood where he tries to play screen shots for the girl he loves, star Cecilia (Rosina Lawrence ). Sedgwick, who prefers to use the entire MGM studio as a band, does this when Cecilia, always ready for audition, treats the future paramour, movie star Rinald Lopez (Mischa Auer) behind the backstage, of course, a musical comedy featuring Broadway head Lydia Roberti. Laurel and Hardy offer several entertaining interludes, including their well-known short-haired skittles, and we look at gentle shakes like Joyce Compton, Russell Hicks and Walter Long. In balance, it is necessary to pass the bays to Misch Auer, who apparently steals the image as an emotional film star, the role he largely creates, and the director for his clever closure for Busby Berkeley's movie glasses.
