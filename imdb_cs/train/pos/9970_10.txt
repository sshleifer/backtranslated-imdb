The brilliant use of exaggerated technical colors illustrates the optimistic extremes of today's Christmas rituals. The Voyeuristic element during the scenes (Santa & Pedro sums up the behavior of a binocular company) is unique (and Jean-Luc Godard, although subtle, seems to have hidden this theme in his film Pierrot le-fou). Highly recommended!
