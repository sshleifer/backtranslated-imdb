I love Ralph Bakshi ("Wizards", "Cool World" and underestimated animated "Lord of the Rings") and I'm a collector and fan of Frank Frazett. I'm also a fan of swords and magicians who love the world Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard. <br /> <br /> I missed the theatrical release of Fire and Ice in 1983 and I look forward to a video or some kind of revival since then. That's why the issue of 2005 has become a dream for me. I bought him with a bit of sorrow because I was hoping he would not just watch it once and then he would stand on the shelves as a "collector" collected dust until the day I die. Fortunately my fears were unjustified and I was pleasantly interested in this film. As with Frazett's art, it is a horror film that has body and sexuality that is hard to find in most fantasy / sword and witch films without being raw or dirty. Art is good and you see Frazette in its best regards. Even my young boys loved him and looked at him again and again. However, my wife has some objections due to the scantily dressed princess (very Frazetta-esquire). I do not mind it because it is credible and there is no sexual scene. <br /> <br /> I'm using roto-scoping, but I personally like roto-scoping. It gives more fluid and realistic character moves that are hard to find in animation. Despite some problems of continuity, I recommend this film to all Bakshi, Frazett, Conan and sword and wizard fans. Enjoy!
