I saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart! No other story has such an unfinished end ... I grew up in many great anime and it was one of my favorites because it was so unusual - a story of unfairness, cruelty, loneliness, life and elections that can not be rescinded and the need for others. Chirin is set up alone when Wolf kills his mother, but Wolf is alone when Chirin watches him on the mountain. The wolf kills the lamb even though she says every night: "Maybe I'll eat you tomorrow." The tape I have is broken and degraded from age and use. I'll fix it and one day I'm looking at the movie again and crying as hard as I am. Such stories with this depth and feelings and the complexity of meaning are very rare. It's a sad story, but I have never seen a cataract that would be more beautiful. I'm glad to see this movie and I'm glad to see it as a child.
