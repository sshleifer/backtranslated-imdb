"Victor does not have much, but it does not stop him in trying to get out with Judy, the prettiest girl in the block, all he has is hope and a one-bedroom apartment he shares with his family, believe him, his brother worship him and his half-sister just declared war, but Victor thinks that love can really win this warm, real and touching romantic comedy about life in a part of town that most people never see. " on DVD synthesis. <br /> <br /> Peter Sollett's "Raising Victor Vargas" raises a "debut" performance by actor Actor Victor Race (like Victor Vargas) and cast. Mr. Rasuk and juicy Judy Marte (like Judy Gonzalez) are sexy and cute as "Lower East Party kids" who discover the joy of sexual attraction. Given how attractive they look at this picture, it's not hard to predict that they have joined - and even if you're wondering how innocent they are, then their characterization is true. Victor's brother "Nino" plays real brother Victor Silvestre Rasuk, who looks at the part played by his older brother. Sometimes it's nice to see movie brothers who really look alike; and hopefully they will work together again. "Cucumber Cucumber" sister Krystal Rodriguez (like Vicki) and old world Altagracia Guzman (like grandmother) close a sexually starved Dominican immigrant family. So the movies that come in hand to the camera are in fashion or what? <br /> <br /> ******* Raising Victor Vargas (5/16/02) Peter Sollett ~ Victor Rasuk, July Marte, Silvestre Rasuk
