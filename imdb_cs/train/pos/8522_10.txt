I found this show really late at night and tried it. It's a refreshing change from other kinds of things that came late at night when you're about to leave. Its simplicity of values ​​and the sweetness of hearts help me to remember how friendship is like children. It's something I'm doing, whenever I find it (which is rare, maybe I should really check out the listings! Haha) ..... and the tension between Joe and Nick is so cute. Just like a good cat, you really get emotionally into the characters. Good ol 'Louisa May Alcott still inspired good stories :) So maybe I have to finish 10 lines of text so my opinion is valid so I think I'll tell you something more. Children play talented actors and actresses, and setting is beautiful and filled with nature - another thing you can not see on TV. I hope everyone will make a shot. I recognize and I am fully aware that it is terrible, but it is a good heart. As I said before, it is refreshing.
