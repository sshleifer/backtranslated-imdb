One of my favorite episodes of the Twilight Zone. And the next day we were in the supermarket at Hollywood Blvd. and La Brea, my father and I, and guess who came to us in the alley! Barney Phillips, but I do not have a hat - at least I do not think he has a hat. We asked him about his third eye and said something like leaving him at home, and everyone he met that day asked him about it. A friendly guy. At that time, we saw all sorts of actors in LA. <br /> <br /> BTW, I was a teenager and it took long before I got over "three hands" on another stranger! <br /> <br /> Robyn Frisch O'Neill <br /> <br /> Hollywood native and resident 1947 - 1963.
