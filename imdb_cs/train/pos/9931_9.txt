I chased the domino on whim, even when I knew it was inspired by a true story, and although it is the least likely and true biopic, you'll probably see it. I found it rather amazing. With Richard Kelly he wrote a lot of heaps of plot and storytelling in two hours of pure entertainment. And once you've seen it more than once, you'll get it and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Domino is a model that has become a favorite hunter who leaves the perfect Hollywood life to make sure it is not so gentle or perfect. It has an exclusive acid excursion style provided by director Tony Scott. And thanks to the rapid playback of music and editing, it provides visual excitement that keeps you alert, with neat performances and unexpected comedy, the film is well-prepared and enjoyable and should reach a wider audience. <br /> <br /> I suggest it to anyone who wants to think and have fun simultaneously for 2 hours.
