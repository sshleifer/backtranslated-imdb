The Cinderella Story is one of my favorite films from Charles Perrault with Sleeping Beauty, which was also filmed in Disney's 1959 film; this movie is a sweet, charming masterpiece from Disney. The movie has a great soundtrack; it's one that I love in the movie is a very good soundtrack and I love songs too; my favorite song is romantic "That's Love". I also love the mice from the movie, they are cute. My favorite scene is a scene after the story, little birds trying to wake Cinderella in the morning; I also love when Cinderella animal friends (mice and birds) fix Cinderella's parental dress so she can go on the ball ... until Drizella & Anastasia have escaped to bits, b **** es!
