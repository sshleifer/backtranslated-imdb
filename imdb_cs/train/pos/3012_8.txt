This is one of the films you want to see before - so you could see "first time" for the first time. Van Dina's books still bring pleasure - but many are labeled excessively floral. This film is by far the best film adaptation of its works. William Powell is William Powell - tell us more. The story is complicated. The story moves too fast because you want it to last. Enjoy.
