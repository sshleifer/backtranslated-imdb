I immediately noticed that this film was not really based on the novel by Dodie Smith. In any case, it was a nice idea that Pongo and Perdita's son now have their puppies. The most prominent Dalmatians were, of course, Little Snowball, which was totally immaculate until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I did not know what I think when Cruella de Vil seems to have completely changed. In fact, I often thought he could become friendly, but now that she has so quickly changed to herself and announced that Cruella is once again, I almost began to worry seriously about Chloe's Dalmatians. > <br /> In fact, the scene where the puppies watched Lady and Tramp while Chloe and Kevin had dinner was much better than I expected. I also liked a parrot who played like a dog, and it was incredible that the dogs on this film learned so many tricks. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was pleased with the Dalmatians being rescued at the end, but I would like to know what happens to Cruella after she has lost all her property. And what on Earth can make a home with such a huge sum of money? Finally, it was quite touching that Snowball also had stains at the very end of the film.
