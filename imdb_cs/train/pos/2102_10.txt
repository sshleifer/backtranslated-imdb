When I sat down and looked at "Largo Winch", I did not expect anything more than action scenes and fascinating cars. When I stood up, I saw both of them; and more. <br /> <br /> Karl Roden was finally not an antagonist in the movie. Kristin Scott Thomas played her role well, but in my opinion the real two stars were Tomer Sisley and Miki Manojloviƒç, they both act great. Radivoje Bukvic told Goran well. Mixed linguistics has brought a nice color to the film, but I understand why people would be bored. <br /> <br /> The country of Hong Kong and the particularly stunning Croatian sea amazed me, and I barely wanted to take my eyes off the screen when Largo entered an incredibly beautiful island. <br /> <br /> Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500 and BMW 7; if someone loves expensive limousine cars; that's their movie. It is also a film for people who love action sequences, good acting, a landscape of extreme beauty, and especially a fast and well-written action movie with a brilliant fight and a thoroughly intertwined inner drama. <br /> <br /> My voice, as it lit up a gloomy day is: 10/10
