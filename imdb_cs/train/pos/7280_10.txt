watch it as a child. Though it would be terribly terrible, it was scary things because I had seven. I also remember working on a Saturday afternoon puzzler watch, so I did not pay much attention. However, the scene of cylindrical boulders has burned in my mind since then. I asked many people if they saw this movie, but without success. Twelve years ago, one person mentioned that he might have seen it, but he considered it a dream; fantastic beer like the wind. It's not a dream, my friend. No dreams now. I have not seen it again since then, but I can not wait to find a copy and insert it into my VCR. Everything that can remain in my mind for 23 years deserves 10 years.
