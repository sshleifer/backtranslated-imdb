Why is this film not in the top 250? This film is still incredibly fresh 56 years after its production, but it could only be done after W.W.II due to the perception of near death. People were more aware that life could be stopped at an unexpected moment. What about life? I loved the scene at the end and all the people of all nations gathered. (Roger Livesey), who defends Peter Carter (David Niven) and June (Kim Hunter) against US Attorney Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey I - an American), a flegmatist judge (Abraham Sofaer, a typical British judge). It's so imaginative! Michael Powell has written, directed and produced this amazing film, which is a true "tour-de-force". The message of the film is clear: in the universe, the law is the most important, but there is nothing beyond the boundaries of love between people. The way this beautiful story is told is much more interesting than if a movie in Hollywood could ever be done.
