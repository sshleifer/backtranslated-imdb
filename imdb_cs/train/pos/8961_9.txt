Bell, Book and Candle were one of the great phenomena of pop culture in the mid-twentieth century, very similar to the phenomena we see today (in the seventies - after more than ten years - there were still endless references to this film). It made a huge star from Novak, made it pretty good for Jack Lemon, gave a new light to Jimmy Stewart, and gave Lancaster and Gingold new ways to explore in their careers (both of whom continued to play witches and other curious "old bats" "in the movie and television). <br /> <br /> Together with the movie of the 1940s, I married a witch (which helped create a Veronica icon), a bell, a book and a candle inspired a great film and television fascination with all the magic things Bewitched and he went on to practice charm, the worst witch and Harry Potter, and I rarely see that the film is also a very interesting alternative to Xmas, the story being held over Christmas and, despite the fact that it is superficially witchcraft, actually embodies many ghostly Christmas , love, family, self-sacrifice, etc.) <br /> <br /> I will always watch this movie (I saw several times since the first observation in the early 1990s), especially if it is displayed around or just after the holiday season. It has style, substance, great cast and amazing production value. Like Adam's Rib, it randomly expresses thoughts that were relatively radical for their time, they are radical even today (in both films the female figure is ruthless and strong), and so it always seems to be ahead of us.
