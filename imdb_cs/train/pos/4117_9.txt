"Dô desu ka den" is the first color film of Master Akira Kurosawa and surprisingly not samurai, ronin, warriors or battlefields. It's inside a very poor community in the slume in Tokyo, where residents are drunk homeless, beggars, tramp, abused women, losers. I do not know why Kurosawa chose this tragic motive and environment to give color, but it really is a very sad story, some of which are heartbreaking. I personally like the story in question about the boy and his father, who sneak up with their own house and build it; the story of a retarded boy who believes he is piloting a train; the story of a man who raises five children as if they were their sons and daughters; and the story of a young woman abused by her stepfather. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Dodecadaden? o Caminho da Vida" ("Dodecaden? cesta života")
