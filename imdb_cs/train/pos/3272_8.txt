It comes from the same director who did "Candyman" and "Immortal Beloved", I'm not surprised that it's a good movie. The irony is that Papierhaus is a movie I have never heard before, yet it must be one of the best films of the late 1980s - partly because the worst film period has taken place in recent decades. (We are not talking about Iranian or Swedish "cinema" ...) The performance is not brilliant, but just solid - as opposed to what some people say (they had a dream of "strange acting" like Anna). The story is an interesting fantasy that does not end in a clever way that connects all the free ends neatly. These unanswered questions are likely to be left out on an individual interpretation, and it is nothing wrong with such a subject. "Pepperhaus" is a somewhat unusual mix of children's film and horror with the effective use of sounds and music. I like the fact that the central character is not your typical film-clich√© ultra-shy but secret-brilliant social-frightened girl but a normal normal boy; very refreshing. I am sick and tired of writers who show their own disordered childhood in their books and on the screen as if someone cared to watch or read about another miserable, lonely childhood as if it were all, the backdrop of the background has a monopoly good potential. The scene with Anne and the boy was "snapped" (for a fairly long stretch) was a bit powerful - it produced feelings of both vague disgust and entertainment - given that it was only eleven, but it was predictable that Burke was 13 years old 14 when it was shot. I have no idea why they did not have a higher age character or a younger actress. It was obvious that Burke was not that young. Why directors always play older children than what they play, and so distract realism, I never know.
