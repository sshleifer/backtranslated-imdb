Myself and my groovadelic 20-something friends just can not get enough of this amazing Parker Posey CLASSIC! I tried to rent it on DVD, but I do not seem to find it - too bad, because I'm sure the features will be "extra special"! :) We all highly recommend this uber-cool flickerino comedy for a date or even just a cozy night house alone! It would also be a type of movie that you could watch at your cat, or even throw a party-based party as in a party party party, as well as in a movie that dear, huggable, expelling Parker Posey at the end. Oh, and be in the sight of grasping and HILARIUS the surprise that ends ... move aside, the sixth sense, you've just overcome a movie! Excuse me, no offense, it sounds like it is! Take it from an old flick fan, the comedy simply does not improve the status of "Party Girl" with Parker P! I feel it! Yours, Ronald Marie MacDougall (aka DJ Cyber-Rap)
