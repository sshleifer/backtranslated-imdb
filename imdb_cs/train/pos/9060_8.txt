I saw it today with my 8 years ago. I thought it was cute. I agree with the second poster that it's not like the book I remember but we still enjoyed it. All the kids are quite nice and they are all fun. Billy is a new child who accepts bullying school to eat ten worms a day. If they lose, they have to walk through the school hallway with worms in their trousers. The beginning of the movie is set to show that Billy has a very weak stomach and fumbles almost everything. Hilarity comes from many different ways of cooking worms. Good news about how to confront bullying and, of course, happy happy ending.
