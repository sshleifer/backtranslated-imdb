I caught this movie on my local film channel and I was watching the movie. She has all the elements of a good adolescent film and others - this film, in addition to dealing with boys and girls and sex, and so on, also deals with the issue of using steroids by young people. <br /> <br /> The film has a real-life experience - no loud music, no special effects and no blatant scene - which was right for this movie. This feeling makes it easier to relate to the characters in the film - of whom we probably know where we live from. Overall good movie, fun watching. <br /> <br /> 8/10
