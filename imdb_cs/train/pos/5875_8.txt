This is one of the movies that do not require any brain or thought, it's a very fun time card that you forgot in the next hour or so. I was really surprised that he played John Abraham, who usually plays with a gangster figure with a helpless face, so he's doing the opposite, and he's succeeding in sparking between comedy genres such as Paresh Rawal and Akshaye Kumar. I was also quite surprised by Akshay's three girls, because they do not require a lot of talent, but they usually run to Akshaye's disapearation (to the other girls), I was surprised to have them set up and really persona, and you could distinguish between them a good thing, most of the songs are good, it's colorful and fun, so the boring Sunday evening will surely make your mood more pleasant.
