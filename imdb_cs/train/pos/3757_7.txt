Like a bunch of people at school, we have to put it up. Even Grim Ripper smiled at us. These two strange things made me laugh, Bill and Ted were the dumbest and the most amazing in the whole movie. It is much better than the first one. And for some reason, I feel something is missing. Something big. Something important. He created a better house and girlfriend. No, I would say they are better villains. Use clones instead of robots. I gave it 7 out of 10 because of these two robots. <br /> <br /> The Grim Ripper, do not be afraid it's funny. When he fell out of the sky, I split the intestines. Splat, I'm not sure about those aliens. What Where Where? Scientists? In any case.
