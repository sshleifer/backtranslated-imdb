He placed it on my TIVO for a rainy day due to occupation, some really hard working people in the industry, and when I finally watched that I was not disappointed. This film has some Altman-like taste (in the final credits it is mentioned as a person "thanks"), using seemingly independent allied ties that intertwine when the film culminates. Macy is pure, clean and sincere like a man who can not seem to escape "his fate," Sutherland plays and portrays few people, Neve delivers splash into a deliberately weak environment, adds Tracy Ullman, Barbara Bain Impossible on TV?), Not to mention about a stable John Ritter and you have all the ingredients for a good movie. The screenplay is clear, the dialogue is clich√© and thoughtful (especially between Mac and David Dorfman). Stop faith and enjoy it, it's a really good time.
