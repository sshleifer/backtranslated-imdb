I have a two-year-old son who suffers from the same condition as Jonny Kennedy. I never had a chance to meet him, but I never heard anyone say a bad word about him. I hope he knows how much this program helped his fellow citizens by raising awareness of this terrible situation. This man touched people in such a way that a million charity leaflets could not. I believe that this should be compulsory monitoring in schools. I also agree with other notes - what do I have to run for? He takes everything that could throw away his life, and yet he managed to keep a sense of humor. God bless. I could not look at the part that showed her dressing changed. I have enough trouble with my son.
