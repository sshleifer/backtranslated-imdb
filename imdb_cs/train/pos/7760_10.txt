Director Douglas Sirk will win again, the grandfather of all dysfunctional family films. This seductive saga is a masterpiece that combines beautifully with all the elements of Sirkeys soap and places them strategically in one movie. "Written on the Wind" clearly influenced the 1980 television series "Dallas" and "Dynasty," because it is basically a feature-length version of those late night soaps. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall, beautiful and gentle, plays Lucy Moore, secretary of New York, who married the oil baron Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson), who is ignorant, is also loved by a quiet but sexy secretary. Everyone returns to Kyle's family residence in Texas, where he meets his white loop, sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone, who was in the Oscar). Yipee! Sparks begin to fly - from novels to battles, this is a camping trip. Mitch must not only fight the feelings she has for her best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to sleep with everyone because she can not have her true love, which is Mitch. Kyle learns to be powerless, but Lucy will definitely end up with pregnancy. It's pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How can you not love it? This film is one of Universal's most popular films and one of Sirka's best films. Some of the dialogues are utterly tiny, and visual metaphors are thrown in every direction - the theme of the wind is great. The cast is great, although Bacall is totally unused, despite receiving the highest Hudson payment. Stack's loss of the Oscar had destroyed him. He considered it his best performance, and he was obviously not too pleased to lose. And he did a fabulous performance like an alcoholic. What a wonderful movie! This film proves what I've been thinking for ages - Sirk is a master of classical melodrama. Where is his Oscar? <br /> <br />
