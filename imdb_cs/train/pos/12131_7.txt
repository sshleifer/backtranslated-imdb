The film deals with Phillipe (Leslie Howard), a serious but physically handicapped physician. It drops fatally in love with the heartless, hungry waitress Mildred (Bette Davis). He leaves it and engages with others (Alan Hale, Reginald Denny). Meanwhile, he is romantic with other suitors (Kay Johnson, Frances Dee), but has returned to a mutually destructive affair. Simply the best and the first of many film versions of Somerset Maugham's novel. Bette Davis, like a cruel waitress rooster who has won another wonderful performance with an attractive and glamorous performance, is absolutely hypnotic in her description of slavery that takes place from start to finish. Davis has become the star of its performance. His role as a hard and crude Dominant woman repeated several times in the posteriori. Leslie Howard, because he is basically a good and decent student finely destroyed, gives an excellent and melancholy performance. He was an amazing actor (windless) besides producer and writer and was dead in an air crash during the Second World War. Both will play again in the "Petrified Forest" (1936). Atmospheric film is entirely convincing in RKO (Radio Picture Inc). Remade in 1946 by Edmund Goulding, Eleanor Parker and Paul Henreid; and in 1964 Ken Hughes with Kim Novak and Laurence Harvey. The film will love the classic fans of the film. Rating: Very good, but a little late.
