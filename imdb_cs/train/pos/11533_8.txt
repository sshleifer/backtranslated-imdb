This movie, which starts with the interesting opening of the two hot blonde, which gets on the back of a motorless, mobile vehicle, has a totally wonderful little personality. Casting seven (though one girl does not look at the bodycount, which is unfortunate because the number of victims is so small that it is) are all super-hot because our story centers around adolescents who spend the evening in the desert (strange but an effective choice of setting) who are hunted by a horrific man in black gloves and jeans who drive a black car. This is preceded by many of the vehicle-inspired slashers to date ("trip," "Joy Ride", "Jeepers Creepers"), where the killer vehicle itself becomes a bad opponent. The killer himself is quite scary and we find comfort in the extremely sympathetic hero Jennifer McAllister (let's look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer on all the blacks while our charitable heroine sports all the white clothes, be). Director Bill Crain makes some really great things with the camera, some clean tricks on the screen and the actors trying their absolute best. There is a lot of gore in a low score to please gore fans and enough T & A from a couple of girls to please T & A fans. Overall, this film is highly underestimated and widely sought after in the movie world of slasher, as it turned out to be quite bad to find on the video. Highly recommended.
