Well, was Morgan Freeman much more unusual than God than George Burns? This movie was certainly better than the one he bored, "Oh, God." I was totally impressed and LMAO all the way. Carrey was perfect when she was such a fearless friend, and Aniston made her part as a frustrated girlfriend in her usual well-played performance. I myself do not consider it ugly or impartial. I think my favorite scene was when Carrey opened a box of opinions that she could never keep her life. Find out if you can find the file in the box that holds the events of his bathroom humor. Well written and even better won, this comedy will go down as one of the best funnymen.
