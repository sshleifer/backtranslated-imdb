I did not want to watch this show. But I'm glad I did. Critics of this simply will not get it! It's one of the most fun and most fun things on T.V today! Yet, when the conversations took place with ordinary people, they seemed unnecessary; but put them in the mouth of animals and insects and it's laughter. So I laughed, I had tears in my eyes. A pig with infants and mother is invaluable. Birds of husband and wife talked about health problems, and the male bird who kept bull after the wife said it was constipation broke me completely! Creature Comforts is the most imaginative show I've ever seen! Hopefully this will be the next summer when this run is over.
