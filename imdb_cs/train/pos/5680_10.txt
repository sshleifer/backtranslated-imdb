It's so hysterical! Why are not American comedies written like this? For anyone who thinks comedy must be stupid - there are more consciousness and intelligence in the six episodes of this series than in the shelves of the novels! Hugh Laurie is a complete horn. I could not believe it was the same guy as House! There are so many great lines and gags in this series that you can watch every show a dozen times and still choose new things every time. Rowan Atkinson is cheerful as a comic and stood at his butler Edmund. This is my favorite of all Blackadder series. And Tony Robinson is gorgeous, just like the somewhat blunt heart of the series, Baldrick's "defeated meal." Some of my favorite lines: "If someone tries Wellington, they'll really put it to their feet," and Baldrick explains how he got his name and cousin Macadder "the top cocker spaniel" and the murderous swordsman from Switzerland.
