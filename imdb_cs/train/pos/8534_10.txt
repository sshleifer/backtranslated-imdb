Eric Stoltz delivers extraordinary performance as Joel Garcia, a successful young romance writer, who breaks up paralyzed and in a special hospital for the recently-affected after breaking a neck in a tourist accident. As he learns to cope with the gravity of his new limited physical condition, Joel flies in with the smooth, fast spokesman Raymond (Wesley Snipes) and the bludgeoned, bold racial biker Bloss (William Forsyth) who feels threatened by a diverse multi-ethnic group of co-workers who is forced to share a room. Joel also gains considerable support from his loyal and loving, but has married his girlfriend Anna (starred Helen Hunt). But he still has to deal with disability. The calm triumph of this remarkable film is its praiseworthy refusal, neither sanitizing nor sentimenting the severity of what these men are going through. Directors Neil Jimenez (who also wrote a sophisticated and plausible screenplay) and Micheal Steinberg combine a story of exceptional taste, joke and warmth, specifically dealing with disarming sincerity and factual facts about how the disability is irreversibly changing lifestyle, including sexual life Strongest in the conspicuous sequence when Joel and Anna try and can not love the motel room). In addition to the expected meaningfulness, the film is another surprising surplus of a miserable raw, earthy humor that is highlighted by Joel and Bloss making a secret night expedition to the strip club. Individually outstanding acting is considered to be another significant addition: Stoltz, Snipes, Forsythe and Hunt are all outstanding and Grace Zabriskie is like a loving mother and Elisabeth Pena and William Allen Young as hospital nurses. Despite the gloomy themes, the film eventually proved to be a very moving, positive and uplifting cinematographic proof of the amazing strength and durability of the human spirit. Simply beautiful little jewel of drama.
