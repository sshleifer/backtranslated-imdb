Another fun, humorous, foamy RKO musician with Astaar and Rogers, FOLLOW THE FLEET is a charming movie. While he misses the excellent song "SWNG TIME" (although the final number "Face the music and dance" is one of the best and most suitable teams), it is extremely enjoyable because these two could not practically do the wrong together in the 1930s. Again, the plot is easy and unforgettable, but watching Fred and Ginger together dance is pure sky. These two have brought more romance and magic to dance than many pairs of movies make in a huge love scene. While there are better Fred and Ginger musicals, it is surely necessary to see.
