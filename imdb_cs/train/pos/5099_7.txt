The only reason I came across this movie was that it was on DVD LITTLE MISS MARKER and I recommend watching it, even if you do not like it, just like a better known movie. We have Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard as con man and his companion. The film starts to be fairly light, but it is becoming more dramatic, as Coop plans to use his daughter first to exhaust a considerable amount of money from his brother-in-law, but when he meets the girl and sees the discipline with which he and his brother-in-law she decides to hold her. However, he has difficulty staying on a straight and narrow path, and so the drama unfolds. <br /> <br /> Cooper and Lombard are good and Shirley can still steal the scenes they are in. There's little music, and Shirley has just one song. However, it's fun and worth watching with LITTLE MISS MARKER.
