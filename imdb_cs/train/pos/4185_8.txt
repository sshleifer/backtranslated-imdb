This movie has everything that makes a bad movie worth watching - a noticeable editing, little to no continuity, insane dialogue, bad (you can even say non-existent) acting, meaningless storylines, shots that go on FAR too long ... it's perfect for MST3K style riffing, not to mention "Corpse Eaters Drinking Game": Scribble on Forms ... take shot - Write your name ... take shot - Catch and Bad Foley edit ... take many, many shots. The only reason why I did not rate more than 8 is that it's not enough of the nudity and because despite the crazy anger it's just an hour - that's how such a movie was 20-30 minutes longer!
