I like stories about the Spirit. Good scary stories about nightfall, voices that can not be explained. Now I've seen many of them. Since special films have an ever-increasing focus on today's films, sometimes finding a real jewel, you have to return hours back to the time when the authors and directors really had to use their heads to create really good stories about the spirit. Now this very rare pilot episode for the Ghost Story TV series called "New House" was one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen. It was once in 1972, ... I was only 9, .. but nothing ever since compared to that. With the entire remake in Hollywood, somebody should do it "as it is" without any special effect than the original. This episode was terrifying at the bottom. I'm lucky I finally found him on DVD today and very rare and hard to find. The only other two stories about the spirit that even approached were ORIGINAL "The Haunting" and George C. Scott in The Changling. He wished somebody to do more stories about the spirit like these.
