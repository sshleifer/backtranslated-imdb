This movie is the best film Jim Carrey ever did. Carrey did not have the usual face in this movie. He was both fun and sad. Carrey played a reporter named Bruce Nolan. Nolan blames God (Morgan Freeman) for everything that goes wrong in her life. God descends from heaven and gives Bruce his strength. As I said, Carrey did a great job. I also thought Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were great as actors and actresses. The conspiracy was good because there were many sub-points at the main point. This movie can be fun (Bruce's dog) as well as a "break-up". The script worked well. I'm glad they shot this movie. The rating of this film is 9/10.
