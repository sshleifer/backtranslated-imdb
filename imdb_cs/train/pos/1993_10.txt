This is Dicken's "Oliver Twist" musical adaptation. For the most part, the original story was preserved, although some subplots were omitted for the film flow (for example, when he spent his recovery and his stepbrother). The biggest difference in film and story lies in the fact that at the end of the book, Fagin is hanging - the end very different from this musical film. It is a unique musical - one whose style and scope have not been met before or since. Not only that songs are often singing and memorable, but the choreography of the film is a view that can be seen. While in most musicals a few people or even a small group choreographed dance, numbers here often come across hundreds or more. It's really the look I saw and I was happy to see it in the theater when it debuted and it's one of my oldest children's memories. When I just saw it a few moments ago, I have to say that the film has improved over time. Great sets, awesome acting and singing - it's a special treat that's hard not to love. <br /> <br /> By the way, when I saw the movie tonight, I was surprised at how tall and feminine Mark Lester sang the movie. Well, according to IMDb, his singing was dubbed a girl, and that would surely match his voice.
