"Gunga Din": One of the greatest adventure stories he ever said! The story of the British Foreign Legion in India in the nineteenth century, and somewhat of a "bearer of water", was named Gung Din, a local resident who strives to be just like his military counterparts; three British sergeants whose loyalty and friendship go beyond the limits of mere patriotism. Their mutual friendship is true and friendly and everyone would be willing to sacrifice their own lives for the good of the other. Gunga Din also longs to be a soldier, especially Bugler, but can never achieve this position because of his subordinate social status. However, the heroes are not produced according to their social mandate, they are willing to sacrifice themselves for the better of others. Gunga Din tries to prove his mercy at every step, but reaches the rank he so passionately seeks? ... "You're better than me, Gung Din"! One of the Hollywood classics and the perfect 10 !!!!
