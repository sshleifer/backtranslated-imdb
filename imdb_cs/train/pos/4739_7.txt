A very good film about martial arts and Jet Li is best by Master Bruce Lee himself. He is great as a librarian / low key cop who rescues again and again. It has a presence and appearance that is riveting and credibility as a kungfu king with whom you have no problems. Francoise Yip is simply beautiful in that mixed race of the original journey, which is unique due to the mixed heritage, has innocence and attraction all at the same time that I found unforgettable. The villain, the man with sunglasses and long hair was also very good, but I can not find his name in credits, can anyone help me with that? Thanks! Enjoy Hak Hap or Black mask, in any language, her good fun!
