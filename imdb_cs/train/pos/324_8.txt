I did not expect to like this movie just like me. I got it simply because I saw it on the list of the 25 most controversial films of all time. It did not look great. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this is one of the most remarkably composed films of recent memory. It's a twenty-year-old woman who wants to know everything. Saves all the information it collects in a huge archive. She experiments with experiences with sex, political activism and human relationships. Meanwhile, the film crew is shown when she filmed the film and look at her reaction to the story and herself. Nudity, explicit sex, and controversial politics led the film in America, while its harassment by customs authorities was revoked. The film is a narrative, yet it is a documentary that tells us during the narration about the behind-the-scenes world of creators, with the fourth wall being broken. This movie is the most direct way to shoot a movie I've ever seen. The movie mostly acts as a time capsule of the 1960s psychedelic goings-on, fighting freedom and sexual liberation. I think I think a lot more than that. I did not think I wanted to waste time on the blue version of this movie, but I really do. This movie is a buried treasure. Try.
