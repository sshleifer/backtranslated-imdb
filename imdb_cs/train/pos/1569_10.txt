I love this show! Mr. Blick, Gordon and Waffle are cats that differ from each other, but they themselves call themselves "brothers". Often I seem to try to imitate the tired, sighing accent of their valet, Hovisa or even the Scottish town of Gordon. More episodes of human Kimberly need to be done. An episode of cats pretending to be pre-school girls to get Kimberly's humane party to get their thirsty feet on their favorite drink, Rootbeer, is a cheerful classic. We can not drink booty in our house without making the voices of Catscratch or Hanson Brothers from Slap Shot. Future classic. Where can I get the first two seasons on DVD?
