Men may be bothered about Lollo if they like it (or her lollos - gave her the slang name for French breasts), but the ladies even have a more delicious bite in the divine Gerard Philipe, who is not only beautiful but can act. Do not be discouraged if your version has no headlines, because this simple, stunning story of love and war in which everything is fair is not needed. All you need to know is that at the beginning of the film, Lollobrigida's Philipe palm reads and tells him that he has married a king's daughter. Subsequently, the story is quite evident from Gallic gestures and running, jumping and swords. On the side of the minus, the obvious nature of the story is somewhat tiring, and it is unpleasant that the French apparently consider themselves too superior to Hollywood to bother and even attempt the credibility of their exciting stuntmen. And, of course, non-French speakers sometimes miss a little ooh-la-la, like: Virtuous girl: I must tell you that my heart belongs to Fanfana. Sedl√°k: My dear, what did you think I was interested in the bag?
