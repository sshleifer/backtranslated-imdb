I'm one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a private show. Pushing Daisies is my exception. I became curious about the program of the advertisements they were broadcasting, which gave an insight into the presumption of the exhibition. At first I was skeptical, especially since the Six Feet Under was still in my head. Here we go again, I thought. I followed the first, the second, the third and all the other episodes. Wow! First of all, I thought that it was about death and presented in a way that was delicious without being sick. The characters were interested and I like the idea that the main character Ned can not literally touch the love of her life, Chuck without the consequences of her dying. Most characters have a desire for things they can not have. Besides Ned and Chuck, Olive longs for Ned. Lily and Vivian long for their niece Chuck, and Emerson always longs for cash rewards from mysterious deaths to resolve. I think the characters are perfect and credible. I like Emerson, who is black, playing from other characters as an African American; I love the delicate cultural humor that sometimes comes from him. Overall, this visual fairy tale is one of the most precious entertainment I've seen since the 2007 season. I think the show has romance enough for romance and a lot of people who did it for mysterious hobbies. I just wish the writers went back to work so the show could continue to evolve.
