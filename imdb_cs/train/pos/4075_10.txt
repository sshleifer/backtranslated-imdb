Laputa: The castle in the sky is a bomb. The report is as strong as its newer work and cleaner, more fantastic and flying pirates, how it can be better! Art is totally amazing and soundtrack, which is repeatedly used (I'm not sure if it was the first time I've heard) and it creates the most emotional sentimental response in any movie soundtrack. Sheeta, the female lead in this movie is absolutely amazing and a boy, Pazu is also a great model - lives alone! A bit is the classic Miyazaki. I will not do it, but the end is really great. I ranked it among the top three Miyazaki with Nausica and Spirited Away. You may also want to look at Howl's Moving Castle when it comes out (sometimes next year I hope) If you love Miyazaki, look at this one as it is readily available in the US. Enjoy, Piper A
