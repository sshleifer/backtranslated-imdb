Who said that this horror is not a genre of educational film, is it? Thanks to this amazing short Hammer movie, I have at least realized that I NEVER offer some strange wine and a slice of bread with salt in my own house, because it could be just a hypnotist and this combination gives him the power to control my thoughts and my mind forever! Thank you Hammer! The tenth episode of House of Horror is another one I was looking forward to, mainly because the guy in the director's chair was Don Sharp; one of the best British filmmakers, but still unfortunately underestimated. Sharp was responsible for some great Hammer films, such as Kiss of the Vampire and Rasputin: The Mad Monk, as well as some overlooked independent productions such as Dark Places and Psychomania. His contribution to The House of Horror is easily one of the best in the series, with a complicated and fascinating drawing and turning to wonderful occult themes. The plot is aimed at two antique dealers who encounter a strange object that resembles a mirror, but in fact it's an old cracked device that can be used to trigger Choronzhon; demonic guardian of the Abyss. The Mirror is strongly demanded by Satan's cult because they need it for his ceremonies, but Michael is reluctant to sell before he discovers the real value of the device. When he picks up a clearly fossilized girl who runs from the cult to avoid being sacrificed, Michael is even deeper into an occult conspiracy. Satanic cultures and the body sacrifice of young women are typical British horror themes, but David Fischer's script is never boring and offers plenty of neat patches, of which it is a highly inventive summit. There is also plenty of tension, admiring, dialogues are a joke, and performances are wonderful (especially John Carson as a cult leader is really mysterious). We recommend!
