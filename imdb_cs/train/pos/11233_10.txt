I consider myself a fan # 1 Hidden Frontier, I see that I am among a rather small group of fans who have actually met most of these guys - of course without counting conventions. I have been following the Hidden Frontier since 2001 and I must say that I am still amazed at what these guys have come to. Hidden Frontier is the brainchild of Rob Caves and his self-made studio, Areakt Pictures, which works from the back of his house. While not as "fantastic" as the TOS-based New Voyages (sometimes some of the original series actors such as Walter Koenig, aka Mr. Chekov), Rob and the actor and HF crew managed to create a line to replace the terrible experiment we called "Enterprise". The most controversial and most successful story arc is the introduction of Star Trek's first gay star, Corey Aster (introduced in the second season), and his search for a soul mate. Sometime later in the series he meets Jorian Zen, an officer of Excelsior's trilogy. In the last story with these two characters (SPECIAL: MAJOR SPOILER! Do not read if you've seen the series up to that point!), Zen is connected to an exile symbiont, causing great changes and conflict in his relationship with Aster. Although the future is uncertain - the last episode, "Beachhead," was just being shown to HF fans in the night during the night - I think this relationship will stand, but it will only be time. <br /> <br /> Gene Roddenberry created Star Trek with the intent that the story was more about his characters than about the merry space battles. Rob's caves have created a hidden border for this reason - and that's what made this series as popular as it is. As stated in the previous note, I wish I could give her more than 10 points, but it will be enough. Although the next season will be the last - it keeps in the tradition of the seven season series Star Trek launched: The Next Generation - I'm willing to bet that after the last episode we'll hear a lot about hidden borders.
