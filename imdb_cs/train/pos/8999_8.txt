These films do not require any effort to hide their true genre - movie B of the film. It will be quite clear that you will define camping in the beginning. It was also meant to give the added meaning of cheese. But the two of you are joining this movie in a way that makes you go: "Hmmmmm ... that's so stupid!" and then laugh. For example, there is a scene back in "16th Century Japan", which shows a couple of samurai walks at the forefront of the temple. In the background of the temple there are several tourists who look in the distance in their slippers and shorts. Hmmmm ... hahahah! I could not stop laughing. And the acting goes from a decent, bearable, to my Lord, but that's what makes it funny. You will see some decent actors and then find others really terrible. I have to divert a bit because I saw Stephanie Sanchez in a few games and it's amazing. Her time in the movie was very short. I also saw Bryan Yamasaki in several games on the islands during his visits and he is also better at theater than in this movie. Anyway, it's a fun movie if you have nothing to do on the evenings.
