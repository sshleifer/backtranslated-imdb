This show was great, it was not just for the kids I thought at first, it's for the whole family. The first season was mostly a father who cares about two daughters and a son, he sadly died in Season 2, I can believe it when I heard it. I'm dressed to continue the show as what really happens in real life and I have to mention The Goodbye Episode it was so good, it had to be so hard to make it, you could say it's real tears in their eyes . I am a 24 year old man and this episode has made me cry because I know how they felt when my father died when I was 13 years old, just like Roy. Season 2 and Season 3 had a great comedy there also season 3 had some of my favorites as Freaky Friday, a secret. I still think the show was strong enough to go on, I was disappointed that it was over, it was one of the best it was not the best Family comedy that had taken place since the beginning of home improvement and it could have been more Friends. <br /> <br /> It should never end but still loves watching repetitions every day.
