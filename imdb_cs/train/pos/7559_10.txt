This movie is so good! Despite Carmen Electra, it must be one of the better movies I've ever seen. Jamie Kennedy is just amazing and Loren Dean plays a very mad movie star. The plot is also great. It's all very real, which is scary. He talks here that it's a drama, but it's one of the most entertaining dramas I've ever seen. Go ahead.
