it is an honest attempt to make a charming sweet love story. an obvious inspiration for the successful TV series Bewitched, this beautiful sweet romcom is a timeless treasure. comparisons are obvious. Jimmy Stewart plays unhappy but steady "straight". kim novac plays a sensual blonde witch capturing it with the magic of love. but when this spell is interrupted by a stronger witch, she begins to pursue her own business and realizes that her beloved pyjacka (her kitten knows) cares about her beloved aunt. you know the aunt of "Murder by Death". this movie is fun and touching sweets, carrying some spectacular joke and a pretty sorcery feeling. worth seeing.
