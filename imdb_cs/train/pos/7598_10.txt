"Lost", "24", "Carnivale", "Desperate Households" ... the list goes on and on. You and lots of other high-quality performances prove that we are in the middle of a golden age in television history. "Lost" is a pure genius. Unbelievable layers of personal and psychologically viable stories that emphasize exquisite cinematography (incredible use of this word in the description of a TV show), killer scores, great performances and edits. Anyone who is not addicted to is sometimes missing one of the most important creative expressions on television. He may have trouble watching one episode weekly, but the DVD format is a really incredible way to watch it. I hope it will keep it (as I'm sure they are doing).
