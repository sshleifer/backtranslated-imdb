I really liked it. The assumption was good, the story fits where the two series left, and here is my favorite part. Mary and Valerie are not bitter! They are not like others who become synonymous with a particular series, and then refuse to talk about it or maybe meet it (The most important example is Susan Dey, "The Partridge Family"). In fact, Valerie said she would be thrilled to make another movie, and then Mary was saying the same thing later, so I'd look for another ... but if it does not work out, then she can run it again.
