At first I have not read the novel yet and I have not heard of the author yet. But as I unhappily saw this movie, I was completely captured by the story. Already as a Jewish watchdog, the mayor said he did not know anyone who had a bad conscience about the war, except Howard W. Campbell Junior, was such an amazing goal and separated from simply moralizing the war. Amazing! And the fictitious story of "the most effective spy for the US in the Second World War," who lost everything that was important to his life, is a beautiful emotional transcript. This is the best story about the duality of humanity that I have ever heard! The questions that this movie presents are, in my view, very important to our society: When does anyone blame you for something? What is the blame? Who is a hero and who is a criminal? What is important in our lives? Can you live regardless of political change? The protagonist is guilty or not? These questions are more current than in the last 60 years. This must be seen for everyone who has to think about taking the war! This movie must be seen for anyone who meditates what matters and what does not matter in life ...
