Christopher Lloyd is entertaining and truly believable as the "Al of the Great Angel". This movie is much better than the first one, but it has great special effects that did not have the first, as well as a much better story and writing. OK - it was written for children, but adults are as entertaining as children do. Tony Danza does a very realistic job in his role - but that's not a Taxi meeting. Danny Glover is actually good and seems to be even very human in his emotions, as well as showing real acting skills for change, a nice change. <br /> <br /> Watch at least once - worth to capture.
