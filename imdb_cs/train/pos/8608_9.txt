It was a great good-quality movie that hit everyone in all the rolls. And when Dianne Keaton is at its best, well, it just is not better. But Tom Everett Scott, always underestimated, was even better. She should be a star. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is with one aspect of the script. None of the characters ever admitted that the dead daughter was not always a good person. Nor did her mother play Keaton. At one point, he stops the promise he made to one person not to show he was asleep. <br /> <br /> One of the other commentators said the film had a "political agenda". This is a surprising thing. There was no politics in this movie.
