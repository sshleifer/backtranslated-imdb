At the beginning of the 1970s, many of us who took the hippie / acid / alternative culture wholeheartedly realized that the major society would not change the way we think it will be. For me, this film defined the tension "what now?" that many of the people I knew at that time felt. Are we going to the community and creating our own vision of utopia, or will we radicalise and promote change? From unnecessary gestures to police, radical rhetoric, Pink Floyd's music, love-making and explosive paintings in the desert-there's so much there. It captures a significant moment.
