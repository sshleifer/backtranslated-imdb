One thing I can say about this movie is very long, very long! Actually, I recently bought this movie a few months ago when I saw a new version appeared. I was happy to find that it was made in 1978 because 70 years (though I never lived in them) is actually one of my favorite decades, especially for music! when I watched this movie, the story was really good at the beginning, but after about 50 minutes it became very boring and repetitive. I admit that the animation made me feel! it was nothing I've ever seen, and it was pretty nice to see. but the film could be a little better, it could have a lot more talk and a story to do than just 15 to 20 minutes of the scene that just fought. then in the last 5 or 10 minutes the movie picked up and got back well, but it ended unexpectedly. in my opinion, I thought it was EXTREMELY long. I know his 13 minutes over 2 hours, and it's still long for the cartoon, but because it was boring for most of the movie, it made it look like it was 4 hours long !!!! but overall it's a good movie, and I think I'll watch it again on one of those "nothing to do days". I will see a new one and I hope it is better!
