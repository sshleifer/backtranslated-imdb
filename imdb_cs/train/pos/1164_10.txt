I saw this movie when it first came out. It was an official selection for the Temecula Valley International Film Festival and voted for the best picture. Justine Priestley is hot as a psychotic but complicated Amanda. This is not your ordinary psychophile. A lot of interesting and original sketches about the genre. Some "Fatal Attraction" for a younger set with some great blues music mixed because the subject of Amanda's affection is married to an emerging blues singer who has less time for her husband when her career goes off. <br /> <br />
