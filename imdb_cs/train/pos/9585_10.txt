Wonderfully put together ... I wish I could follow up on this document, which will follow with the lives of some people and celebrate the lives of the other lost ... part 2 .. real. It was great .. The film was not long enough ... I would like to know why the filmmaker did not keep it! it's so important for the community period .. though you read it, please consider making another document of this kind ... I'm really tired of hearing from naive writers as AIDS and men go together when not. in fact his hetero is that we have to look ... This movie did not even bother to mention HIV or AIDS and I was so glad for it .. I really appreciated the decay and definition as well. Thank you very much for the fact that this movie exists.
