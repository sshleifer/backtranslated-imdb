If it were to be an American serial killer, it is definitely on average. The journalist travels across the country to California to document the most famous killers of America without knowing that one of his white trailer garbage companions [Pitt] is a serial killer himself. Rather predictable throughout, it has its moments of action and Pitt and Lewis show their roles well, but I would not bother to see it again.
