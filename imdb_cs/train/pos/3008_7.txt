Unavailable William Powell. He is a joy to watch on the screen when he goes through unhealthy situations in the world. He always seems to be at the top of his game and takes little care of anyone who doubts him. Murders are projects, barely human beings. I noticed that this is the underlying cause. Other than occasional faulty murder, the victim fulfills the function of being the reason why the film exists. Nothing more. There are plenty of twists and turns to keep things interesting, and Powell is a master. There are a lot of political inaccuracies, especially with regard to Asian artists. That's a little hard. Casting is great, and Curtiz's direction is also a consistent asset.
