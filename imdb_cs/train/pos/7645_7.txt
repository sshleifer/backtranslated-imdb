Belushi in his most encouraging and Courtney Cox before Friends has a small role. I often think Belushi is unused in Hollywood, and this film role is one of his best. For those of you who watch his TV show, this is a very different and sympathetic figure. The film itself is not a country that breaks down, nor is the news new, but rather sweet and cute. Supportive casting of known faces and unknown names is a perfect balance, even though Lovitz's whining can be tedious, and Michael's enchanting spiritual guide, Michael, has a slightly ominous, if not a well known, edge. Hamilton, like Belusini's wife, is unfortunately two-dimensional and one wonders why he married her. Besides, Renee Russo is unnecessary and unbelievably convincing at the "Ball Queen" that has gone away. However, a nice way to spend two hours.
