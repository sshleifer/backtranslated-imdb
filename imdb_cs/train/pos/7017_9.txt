You spent most of this two-hour film and thought "what's the story of a leading figure?" <br /> <br /> Will Smith, like the low-key "Ben Thomas," will guess you. The last 20-25 minutes is when you find out and it's a shock ... but you knew something odd would be revealed. Until then, Smith, it's a mysterious, almost persecution of people. You know, I have a good reason for it, but it's never really explained, again, to let us guess up to the end. Everything, including turning it on / off but touching the romance with Rosario Dawkins ("Emily Posa"), may make some viewers uncomfortable or want to leave this movie ... but not because the ultimate long segment puts together all the pieces of this puzzle. <br /> <br /> It's a two-hour film, not the typical Will Smith action movies. In fact, the most shocking aspect is the sad, sad face of Smith in this story. Almost no longer looks like he's in a series of shots. Looks like he's losing weight and he's sick. Smith does a great job that shows a person who has a lot of sadness. <br /> <br /> Just like with a good movie it's often done, this movie lets you think long after the credits end.
