I certainly recommend reading the book before watching the movie. This book was awarded the National Book Council Award in 1978 and is very gripping (the toy is not intended). It's not too hard to read for those who do not read it often, so do not worry! It seems that the book captures the passion of relationships more than film and the movie will make more sense after reading the book. When I grew up in Melbourne, I can really relate to this book and film. Few Australian female writers have been very poorly documented in the 1970s about how women live in a city in Australia during this era or class. It's a rare piece of Melbourne history. It's a shame that it's documented as some 80-year pornography. It's far from it and as another reviewer mentioned, do not read the DVD jacket, that does not mean what it's all about. Those who rent a movie based on this description will be disappointed. Just remember that this movie was made in 1982, so do not expect Hollywood to dramatize that they seem to incorporate into those days. That's what I like. It's great that you see Noni Hazlehurst in this role, it's just fantastic like Nora and it's great to watch her true acting because if you're close to my age, you'll best remember her stints at Playschool and Better Homes and Gardens. Who knew he was hiding this talent? This movie will give you a completely new impression. Classic Australian Story!
