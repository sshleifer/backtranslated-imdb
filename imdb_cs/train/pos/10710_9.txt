I really have to disagree with the boy-yardley-rees, who (watching the movie) would have seen some absolutely amazing Scots scenery (some of Skye's best films) and found that the movie with a complicated start merged into a really horrible whole. <br /> <br /> It's not a big budget. Rather, it's a movie that has a strong feeling in the community. I can not say how many "standard" movies bored me - extruding the same polished material over and over again. Seachd does not seem to be at all at all. Indeed, he seems to be trying to offer something more authentic and certainly Gaelic than any recent Scottish film. OK, so acting is not in the style of a bumper. That's because actors are seemingly real people. In fact, I thought the key roles of a boy and his grandfather are really convincing - and sometimes unusually beautiful. Seachd really has a second look because there are plenty of threads that all together feed to the end. Overall, the combination of music and (sometimes) awesome visual visuals and social approach to acting and abnormal structure has transformed Seachd into a completely different and unforgettable film. More of them please!
