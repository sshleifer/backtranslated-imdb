Christopher Smith is a distinct horror fan, and this is clear in his debut horror film "Creep". "Creep", though a bit lost in information, proves that it is worthy of the real horror of classics. A bit less shiny than the recent Amityville Horror remake, this dark and horrifying story follows Kate (Frank Potente) through the labyrinth of underground tunnels and unused railways like her and many others on the way, trying to escape from a murderous assailant. Although some movies are bad, I really believe that for a tight budget and British production since the beginning of director Smith, "Creep" really meets his name. It provides a fast pace, more or less from the beginning, sometimes too fast, because the story is unsatisfactory in some areas but with the perfect position and best character of the reaction I've just seen, "Creep" brings some scenes that are definitely nightly moths.
