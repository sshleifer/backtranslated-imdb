It's a simple scary haunted story. I showed it to some of my friends in my movie and they were kept magical to the end! No blood or blood - just good old-fashioned tension. It starts from the beginning and builds and builds. The end is a real procedure that unknowingly captured me. <br /> <br /> Well done and well acting. It is also a "time piece" - which was set in the twenties of the 20th century - which joined the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed that I got Susan Hill from the Amazon. The film is approaching a book. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that it's not easily available on DVD. My copy is VHS. This along with "Haunted" are probably two of the best Ghost Stories I've ever shot. Which only shows that a bit of creativity overcomes "on your face" for a day!
