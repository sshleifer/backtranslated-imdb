Very moderate spoiler <br /> <br /> This movie (even if it's just on TV) is absolutely superb. I really did not pay attention to differences in appearance or accent, so I can not really comment on it. The effect in this was so good that I had to clench and say, "Remember, it's just a movie, that really happened to me." When I was sitting and listening to talk to Harris and Quinn, I knew it was exactly what John and Paul would talk about if they really had this appointment. Endless comments and burns from John were directly in his character (especially in the restaurant!), Just like his depression, while Paul was very easy to go and leave. Both actors did a great job and I was thrilled to see this movie. It's a bad experience for every Beatles fan. And get ready for a few surprises!
