Space Camp is a pretty decent movie. The plot is predictable, but the actors do a good job and the special effects are decent all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie was originally launched at the time of the disaster of the shuttle ship, and it really hindered how popular it was. <br /> <br /> The scene where the shuttle door opens in space is simply spectacular ... on the big screen, it's ... on TV ... it just looks average. I remember this scene in the theater. You wanted to feel like you were really up. <br /> <br /> It will be a good IMAX movie, but I'm sure it will never happen.
