CRY IN THE TARK The aileron in dark weather was a movie that I expected to offer a phenomenal performance from Meryl Streep and a solid, albeit unmatched movie. This assumption stemmed from the fact that, in addition to nominating Streep's best actress, the film did not get into the attention of big price groups. <br /> <br /> I have rarely assumed that CRAY IN THE TARK will be such a boring drama, well-constructed at every level. When you ask me, it's an underestimated classic. The film opens rather slowly and lets the audience settle in Chamberlain's relaxed pace and actually notices that they are basically an incredibly loving, simple family. Fred Schepisi (the director) chooses random moments to capture a family holiday that gives a growing sense of upcoming tragedy while showing the attentive bliss that Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain care for their children. <br /> <br /> While the famous line "Dingo took my baby!" has become somewhat frightening nowadays, the movie can never be laughable. The real death of Azaria is terribly captured. It is soft and realistic, leaving the audience afraid and asking questions. Most of the film takes place in the courthouse and focuses on the constant struggle of Chamberlain, who will prove their innocence to the press and the court that suspects Linda's murder. The fact that it is clear to us that they are innocent from the beginning makes them even more tense. As a listener, I was fully invested in Chamberlain's complications ... and he was really annoying and wounded, and saddened by the filming of such a terrible media. At the same time, however, the media / public opinion is understandable. I loved the way in which the media were in no way sympathetic, but they always had reasons to keep their opinions. The final line of the film is very deep and perfectly captures the central element that makes this film so different from other dramatic dramas. <br /> <br /> As far as performances are concerned, Streep and Neill are the only ones that really care about this movie ... and come in every direction. For me this is one of Meryl Streep's best performances (if not # 1). For all her mastery of various accents (which, of course, are very impressive in themselves), Streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters. It seems to me that this is one of Streep's weakest performances and she hit her out of the park. And Neill, an actor who has never seen me, is charismatic and appealing at JURASSIC PARK, he is a perfect counterpart to Streep's performance. From what I saw, it is undoubtedly the most beautiful work of Neill. It's a shame she was not recognized by the academy with a nomination for a leading actor that would match Streep ... and they both play each other great. <br /> <br /> Another emotional grasp than most movies, and incredibly exciting ... CRY IN THE TARK far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend that people who only know the movie like knocking, where Meryl shouts "Dingo took my baby!" check out the movie and see how much more there is on CRY IN THE TARK then that one line. <br /> <br /> ...
