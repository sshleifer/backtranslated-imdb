A warmer, moving film with fantastic quality. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn is always great. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mathis has given many great performances, but it's just something about this to scare your memory. <br /> <br /> Most of you have to see this amazing 5 years. old, Jodelle Ferland. I was so enchanted by her presence, I had to buy the movie so I could watch it again and again. It is the miracle of God's creation. I'm not the only one who fascinated this young actress in the IMDB rating.
