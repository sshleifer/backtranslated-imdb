This is the best movie I've ever seen. I saw a movie on Dutch television sometime in 1988 (?). That month they showed the Yugoslavian film every Sunday night. Another next week was another great movie (which was about a train, rather than a bus), whose name I do not remember. If you know, please let us know! Anyway, how can I see this movie again ???? DVD of this movie where ?? Please tell me at vannoord@let.rug.nl. Next week was another great movie (which was about a train, rather than a bus), whose name I do not remember.
