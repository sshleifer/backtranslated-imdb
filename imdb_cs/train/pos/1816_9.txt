Lots of reviews on this site indicate that this movie is a bit dark for kids. It depends on that guy. This is not a movie aged 2-6; it's more focused on the 8-year-old and older crowd. I saw the movie when I was 10, I absolutely loved him. At that time, most of the animated films were a little childish for my taste. This film deals with more serious issues and therefore has a little emotional impact. In this movie characters can DIE, and be sent to HELL! It gives a bit of emotional weight to scenes where the characters risk their lives. Good guys are not always nice and nice (just like other cartoons). They have "real" motivations, such as revenge, greed, but also compassion and friendship; shows that things are not always black and white. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie
