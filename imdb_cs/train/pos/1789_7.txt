Anna Ann (Vanessa Redgrave) repeats the name "Harris," recalling her day in the 50s when she was an aspiring singer and traveled from New York as an honorable lady to her wealthy friend Lily Wittenborn (Mamie Gummer) in Newport. Ann Grant (Claire Danes) is welcomed by Lilly's alcoholic and ruthless Buddy (Hughem Dancym) at Wittenborn's seaside cottage and tells her that his sister is really in love with his friend and servant Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson) who fought in the war and graduated in medicine. Later, the bride to be, confesses her true feelings about Harris Anne. However, when Anna meets Harris, he has an endeavor on him, and they have a short affair during one night stand, while the tragedy happens to Buddy. While Ann's daughter, uncertain and unstable Nina Mars (Toni Collette) and happy wife and mother Constance Haverford (Natasha Richardson) fear their mothers and have the differences to be resolved. "Evening" has one of the best female casts I've ever seen in the movie with wonderful performances. The similarity of the stunning Mamie Gummer with her mother Meryl Streep is amazing and has a performance that honors her mother's name. Location, costumes, decorations, cinema and soundtrack are also amazing. Unfortunately, this conspiracy is confused and I clearly did not understand the message of this film. Why maternity is so important in the story? Was Constance developed in the night state of Ann and Harris and would he be her father? Why did Ann and Harris not stay together if he really loved her, as if he admitted in their occasional meeting in New York? What problems Ann Lord solved after visiting Lily Ross? Was Buddy Wittenborn bisexual or his love for Harris brotherly love? Why did Nina Mars eventually change her thoughts about maternity? It seems that script writers or director have failed because they could not make sense and fulfill a beautiful love story. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Ao Entardecer" ("In Eventide")
