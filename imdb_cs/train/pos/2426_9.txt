"Once in a lifetime" is a very good film. However, it is not good for everyone because of the widespread use of vulgar language and the violence of certain situations. The film can present in anecdotal, believable way "life" in the neighborhoods of NYC, where drug issues are important. This view is in turn used as a decor for the most daring and thrilling drama backed by strong dialogues (but I had a hard time understanding some of them because English is not my mother tongue. There is sometimes a bit of a play, but I think it fits a pretty general orientation that Fishburne has given to a film that gives the mass of reflection more than just a good style workout, especially in time / action management. Characters, though not easy, are easy to relate to, and actors do a great job when they act for them. By the way, I enjoyed the soundtrack (B. Marsalis). If you are not too violent, you should enjoy this movie once, twice, three times. I rated the movie 9/10.
