I still remember seeing it on TV. I could not believe TVNZ left it! I had to own it! A lot of humor will be lost to non-NZ'ers, but he can go! <br /> <br /> After finishing Back of the series Y, Matt and Chris went to bigger and better (?) things. NZ is the boldest hairdresser, Randy Campbell has often appeared on the British television series Balls of Steel. Yes, he is still all his stuntman because he's too drunk. Also "house band" Deja Voodoo has since released 2 albums, Brown Sabbath and Back in Brown. The band consists of members of the Back of the Y team and singles like "I would give you one of my beers (but I got only 6)" and "you were not yet born in the 1980s", keep on humor. <br /> <br /> The Southwest Film Festival also presented its feature film "The Devil Made Me Do It", which will be released in early 2008 in the NZ. <br /> <br /> All up, if you do not find these boys funny then you can only F% ^ K off!
