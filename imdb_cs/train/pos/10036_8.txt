Titanic is a long but well crafted tragic adventurous love story that takes place during an unfortunate cruise on an inconvenient ship. Writer / director James Cameron did a great job doing this film about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining it with the real Titanic event that sank after the glacier hit on April 15, 1912 claiming thousands of lives perished in the free Atlantic ice free waters. Both filmmakers are great in their roles including Leonard DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make a good couple on the screen. DiCpario and Winslet also had a common chemistry that eventually blossomed from romance, which is far more plausible. They both showed true talent when this movie came out, and they both showed up in their latest films. The rest of the supporting cast, including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde and Bill Paxton in a small role, are just as impressive as their characters, helping them bring to life in this film. The love story, action, tension and special effects are spectacular, especially for this time. The horror of the situation in which the characters were perceived so truly, because it really happened that you want most of them to survive this life and death. Moving was a bit slow sometimes and it was a bit long, but the rest of the movie developed because it's a little flaw. Titanic makes a great movie that definitely makes some girls cry almost every time they look at her. The fact that this really happened has definitely added to a movie that makes you feel sorry for all the lost lives when Titanic hit the Atlantic when it hit the glacier. Overall, Titanic is a tragic, heartbreaking story about two people who have fallen in love, while on an unfortunate ship that has been brought to life by extraordinary performances from Cast, especially DiCaprio and Winslet, who are definitely making this film for the time to watch.
