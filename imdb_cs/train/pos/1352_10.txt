This movie has never seen him and considered him a great classic with great veterans. By the time this film was shot, people in America were different, there were no televisions or all the modern things we have today, except for radio and the beginning of great movies in Hollywood. Sweet innocent stories of young romance between a young girl or a guy have been seen differently than today. Ann Shirley "Murder My Sweet," 44 played a young orphaned girl who was called a carrot top because of her red hair and found she was taken to the house of two elderly people who were like two owls and watched Ann Shirley. It was a small town, and everyone knew everybody, and if anything happened, the whole town found out in a few minutes. It's a film on earth with nice decent people who try to help each other in a very simple way of life. Today looks very corn balls and stupidity, but believe me, that was the way people were in America during the 1920s. "& 30 and they were a great generation who loved good family movies.
