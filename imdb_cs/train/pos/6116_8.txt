This movie is like marmite. You can either love or hate it. If you go to this film to expect the right film with decent production values, good plot and great characters, you will hate it. If you go to this movie and wait for a low budget, you probably will hate it. If you're waiting for the movie, you expect to see one of the most distracted characters ever filmed in a Harry Russell movie that you will love. John Giancaspro is absolutely brilliant in his over-the-top depiction of the mad, murderous diablo coke. Special effects are the worst, but really who cares? If you are such a person who is ready to watch the film Schizophreniac: The Whore Mangler, you have undoubtedly seen many horror films filled with gorem. With the budget that this movie created, even if they tried it, they would probably be average at best. I would rather laugh in a meaningful way than would be average. <br /> <br /> To summarize, you probably will not hate the movie, but if you are one of the few who decides to see it, it will be best of what slice of bread # 2 I hate marmite.
