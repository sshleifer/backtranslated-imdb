This film, even though it's over 70 years old, is still a very strong film. Bette Davis, like a mad, evil Cockney waitress Mildred, is utterly believable. Monitoring her performance is still charming. It causes the viewer to utterly despise her, and at the same time flies her. Leslie Howard's performance as weak, obsessed with Phillip Carey is not so strong, but I do not see how an actor could stand up against Mrs. Davis's performance. In every scene she is in, she chews the landscape and totally steals the show. It is a movie that sealed her star and deserved to win the Oscar, but she lost it. It was shocking that it was a day in terms of pregnant pregnancies, several sexual partners and the malevolent Mildred language, so it's a rather dated but still excellent movie. Just seeing the scene where Mildred tells Phillipe what he really thinks about ("You fall, you dirty sow ...") is still one of the best performances I've ever seen in the movie.
