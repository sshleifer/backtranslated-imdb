I'm a man who is not dedicated to female films, but it's really a great special story. I do not have personal love for Jane Fonda as a person, but he does one hell of great work, while DeNiro is his usual excellent self. Everything is so great: playing, directing, visual, setting, shooting, casting. If you can enjoy the story of real people and real love - it's the winner.
