The location around the corner is exactly at the beginning of Balta Street in Budapest, but it could be in every place. A small number of reports reflect Central European design, but it may be a trade around each corner. The film does not concern Budapest or the trade in leather products, but about the fluctuations of love that are reflected in most of the main characters. Alfred Kralik and Kl√°ra Novak are sparring partners at work, but their anonymous letters are full of hope and desire and romance and the story unfolds to bring these two aspects together beautifully. Hugo Matuschek, the business owner, has trouble with his wife, she only voice at the end of the phone. Ferencz Vadas has a secret affair. Ilona Novodny has a friend who buys fur. Mr. Pirovitch's life is centered around his wife and children. Pepi Katona "plays Santa Claus" at the Christmas girl. You even feel that the silent Flora Katchuck, while living at home with his mother, is dreaming of someone. The script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama. No effort moves from scene to scene. It's one of those silent films that they pay over and over, plain, but deep. The dialogue reflects a reputation that is not common today. <br /> <br /> All the actors are beautiful. Even small characters like a cafe waiter and street policeman are perfect. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan will win. He really got into his step as an actor and gives a sweet and sharp performance. Margaret Sullavan was a great actor and she was honored today. Some of her other films are worth it. Like Mr. Matuschek, Frank Morgan is amazing. His moment of truth is very moving. The gold stars are everywhere around the artists. <br /> <br /> This is a well-worn phrase that does not make them as if they are accustomed to. (The indefinite re-make 'You Got Mail' was terrible), but in this case it's true. Director Lubitsch is not on a bluff, but he has added a classic film of spirit, magic and warm humankind.
