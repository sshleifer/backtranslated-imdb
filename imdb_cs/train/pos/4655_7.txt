Peter Ustinov plays embezzlement, which is just starting to get out of prison. As soon as the gate goes off, she immediately starts working on the schema to steal the bundle again, though this time she has her opinion quite high. This is actually one of the weaknesses of the film because he probably does not know anything about computers (he only came back in 1968), but he managed to become a computer genius literally overnight! Yeah, right. Anyway, the plan comes to be a computer expert and get a job with a big American corporation to finally lose a dozen money. Because his knowledge of computers is rudimentary, he is amazing how he performs a brilliant plan and can infiltrate the computer system and its defense. But after all, it's a movie, so I was able to break my mistrust. By the end of the movie, he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) can escape millions of pounds. At the very end, however, very, very confusing and Smith's announcement, she has actually been able to accumulate more than two million by investing in the companies that Ustinov has started (even though he did not realize that they were all fictitious companies). This would mean that, in the end, the supplies she bought were worthless. It seems like this (and I can argue badly) is that Ustinov and his new partners quickly drained the stock before it became known, and supplies would become worthless. Either way, the movie looks like it sends a magical end, when no one is injured and everyone is happy - and that just did not make sense. It's a shame, really, because acting and most writing was great. Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were just great. If it seems to me that I have put an end to it, let me know because the movie looked very detailed at the end.
