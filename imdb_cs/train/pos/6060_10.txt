It's a great documentary. Every fan of racing cars should have a copy of this great movie. Director "Stephen Low" did a great job, as were the main stars of the film, Father and Son, Mario and Michael Andretti. The DVD looks and sounds amazing. And the best of all is IMAX! A great home cinema test disk.
