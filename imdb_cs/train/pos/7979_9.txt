Tony Scott can do good and bad films, personally I think he can be a bit crazy and scary and his job, of course, suffers compared to his famous brother, but maybe it's his best film. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so great is that Scott gives Denzel (in a burnt form, better than a day of training) and revealing who Dakota Fanning is about to create a relationship of real warmth and tenderness. The setting is not totally boring, although it takes some time - it involves us and takes us on a small journey into the character - including the great role of Radha Mitchell as a mother. All of this serves to make the action much more effective because we are so invested in the characters because of all their too obvious shortcomings. This film has its entire form on the edge, and it does not expel at the end. Of course, the film would not be without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to have so many Duff roles when he is obviously as good as almost every leading man out there (I can only really think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who now has more power on the screen). This film was supposed to be huge, due to its position and strength of its performance and film quality. Just show that if the studio does not support a movie on the handle, it will end up directly on the video. I wish I could see it on the big screen.
