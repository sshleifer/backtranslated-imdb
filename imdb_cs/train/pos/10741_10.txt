The French Naudet brothers did something that no one else did, had a video camera on the day this tragedy took place. They were in Building No. 2 when they saw the papers that were dragging down, the people who landed on the ground from such jumps. I think it goes so far as the two buildings collapsed, the camera was still running when white dust appeared on it, found the entrance and got inside, but all of these shots are real, and I think they were great for us . <br /> <br /> Ten stars go to the Naudet brothers who made this extraordinary movie, which I watch every 9/11 so I will never forget what this country has gone through. I believe that when I remember well, it shows the first death of a fireman's priest while he was brought to the church and his honorable funeral.
