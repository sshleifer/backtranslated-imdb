At first this is from England, so I had, of course, a 98% chance of being an intelligent and very good cinema. I've never heard of this movie. From the moment I saw Helen Bonham-Carter, I said, Oh! This is the female version of my left leg. I was right, but I was wrong. Wrong, because these two movies are very different. My left foot was John Ford's movie and this is Chaplin's movie alike (not because it's funny, but Chaplin in that great sense of the melodrama that brings tears to your eyes.) I was right because in 1990 Daniel's handsome - Lewis a little nasty by playing a crippled person and doing it with a great sense of reality. Here, the very beautiful Bonham-Carter did exactly the same, but with very feminine emotions. The story is well written and very intelligent. For me, Bonham-Carter is one of the biggest women in the 1990s, with Emily Lloyd at Breaking The Waves. Come on! And look at her eyes! She had the most beautiful eyes of movies by Jobyna Ralston, Louise Brooks, Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner! It's a true talent, as seen in many other films. Look at this, you will not regret it! And also great work from Branagh!
