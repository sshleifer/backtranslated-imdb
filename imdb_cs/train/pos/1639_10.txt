Wonderful actors, beautiful scenery, sharp reality. I will not process all comments from other reviewers because you have a picture! But the film is not for grief. Reality kills pigs and other livestock to survive. I also have Elinore Randall Stewart's book on housing. I read it a few years ago, I have to read it again because I was just watching the newly released, edited DVD of the movie. I tried to buy the video for several years, eventually I bought it from a video store that came out of business. But Yippee! The DVD is now for sale, I bought it at amazon.com. It's not cheap, but it's worth it. This is a movie I will watch until the end of my days!
