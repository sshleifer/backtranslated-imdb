<br /> <br /> There is a STAR TREK canon - a lot of it. We know the history of the future from the cannon. Advances in technology, events, places, first contacts with new beings, names, dates, etc. BUSINESS largely ignores much ST canon. Unfortunate fact for long-time serious fans. As one, I supposed that the producers would at least look at the first episodes of TOS and retro back from there - but not. Phase guns, like most of the technology, look much more modern than in TOS. Starfleet Starfleet Laser Cannon, the slow effect of the Gold Spacer - I expected it. I also did not expect to hear pure sound effects similar to the sound of TNG, but far from TOS sound effects. <br /> <br /> In the earliest view of TOS (the original pilot: THE CAGE), we see a starfleet with a more formal military aspect - a bit old Earth Navy. S ENTERPRISE we see a shocking overlook of rank. The STAR BLAZERS cartoon has more military code than the business. It is good that Captain Archer is not convinced of the needs of the Universe (unlike Kirk, who has never trusted the application of human justice) but within ENTERPRISE everyone seems to be equal. Unprofessional, indefinite, more distant from the sense of formal military service than it does in every ST series - and that says a lot! <br /> <br /> An occasional song about open country music announces the journey of the adventure family of an important large military craft. ENTERPRISE tries to show us the predominantly entertaining, warm-fuzzy exploration of human relationships rather than us at the historic, daring, gravelly, high-rick exploration space. <br /> <br /> I would choose Adrian Paul to play the captain and the older person to be a doctor. I still enjoyed the actors for the most part. Linda Park, an outstanding dancer from Boston College, is certainly developing well. Crew crew seem to be thoughtful. <br /> <br /> ENTERPRISE begins its stronger run than the last three STAR TREK series. Let's hope we have a good future!
