I did not read all the comments but at least one poster said the 30-minute version could be shortened. I'm curious about it myself, because the later parts of the movie simply did not make sense to me, even though I was reworking them. 30 minutes seems to be an abbreviation for the film in 1917 as well. "Poor Little Rich Girl," which was another Tourneur movie, is 65 minutes long and "Pride of the Clan", which was his former character, was 84 minutes long. So I was relieved when I saw that I was not a fool, that part of this film must be missing, and that's why this decision made little sense. <br /> <br /> It's hard to judge or comment on a movie that can see only half ... but I would recommend this movie as well as the really fascinating view of the East Coast East Coast film studio. It is the earliest movie I personally saw is based on the film industry itself. The main character is a movie star starring Robert Warwick, who was later a Hollywood character actor and appeared in almost all of Preston Sturges' films. He plays a Western actor, perhaps vaguely modeled by William S. Hart, who Warwick reminds of. After the really fascinating sequences in the studio we see them at the spot where they discover the girl in the village (Doris Kenyon) and persuade her to come to New Jersey for a screen test that goes very badly. After this moment, it seems that the film is missing the main tracks in the form we have. <br /> <br /> Once again, I would recommend documentary value to anyone interested in film history, but in the form it would not be like a movie and not a particularly good example of the work of Maurice Tourneur.
