In the Netherlands, gay writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) lectures. He stays overnight with the beautiful woman Christine (Renee Soutendijk) and has sex with her (knowing he is a boy). He is expected to leave the next day but looks at the picture of Christine's terrible friend Herman (Thom Hoffman) and decides to stay to try. Then it became strange. The big X-rated art house that was hit in the US in 1983. Why was X rated? We'll see ... it's a stranglehold, full of prominent male and female nakedness, castration, mutilation, simulated sex, a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people, a gay sex scene in the crypt ... and it's all comedy !!! !! Paul Verhoeven did it after "Spetters". "Spetters" were criticized for being extreme sexual sequences and convicted as garbage. So Verhoeven filled this film with a very clear symbolism, because critics thought it was art and praise. He was right! Critics loved the film because they did not realize that Verhoeven was playing a big joke with them. Yet it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> He is beautifully shot down by Jan Bontt (now himself a director) and there is so much a symbol and obvious "hidden" layers in a dialogue that never bore you. All the acting is great - Krabbe plays a thoroughly disdainful temper, but (in some way) rooting for him; Soutendijk is just stunning to look and play her part in perfection - the little smile she gives when Gerard agrees to stay with her is cool; Hoffman is extremely handsome with a big body - he deserves to be a church succession and walks with Krabbe in the crypt. It's not for people who are easily offended or for a weak heart, but if you like extreme movies that are appealing to you (like me), that's for you! And all the way.
