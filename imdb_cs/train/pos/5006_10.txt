I remember seeing this strange trip in 1965, but I never heard of Barbra. When the show ended, I thought, "It's probably the best one on television that I'll ever see in my life." About 42 years later. Still not so awesome, as truly as amazing as the talent shown here. You can talk about all the superstars you want, it's the most superlative of them! <br /> <br /> You name it, she can do it. Comedy, pathos, frantic seduction, ballads, Barbra is really a storyteller. Her ability to pull everything she tries is legendary. But this strange was created at the beginning and helped create a legend that quickly became. In spite of having reached such a short time, she made a promise and revealed more of her talents as she went on. But they are all here from the very beginning. You will not be disappointed when watching this.
