When people ask me why I like movies so much, I usually respond, "Did you see in the De Palma's Dressed to Kill a sequence of art galleries?" This scene itself represents almost what I want to see in the film. If I were a film director, it would be something I wanted to do. "Pure Cinema" is one of the ways to describe this sequence, and it's really amazing to see De Palma's entire film work at the same artistic frequency of that scene. It's a dream film that's as clever as hell and with more creativity and intelligence than twelve films together. I think the film raises an important point that will always be a topic of scattered discussion: can the film rely exclusively on technology and still be considered artistic success? The film does not have any news that is being talked about, the acting is great, but it's in style service and the script is short on logic. De Palma's film is a really good case that the style, when properly treated, can keep a feature film. Sure, Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen, and Keith Gordon give a great performance, but it's the director's film up to fadeout. It's a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of the film medium. I'm not going to tell you what the movie Hitchcock is doing (I do not want to ruin any surprise), but I think De Palma goes beyond the arc of the story and can create a film that pretty much sums up his entire career. Not for the weak heart!
