The movie is not exactly "funny". Well, I admit, there are several HUMOROUS lines, but there is nothing that would be ridiculous - funny. For example: Even before the brilliant sexual scene between Eleniak and one of her men's costumes, the dress is fastened to the shoulder pad and he can not remove the shirt. Before he leaves the room to get the keys, he says, "Okay, he's not going anywhere." See funny but not funny. but Erika Eleniak definitely steals the show. It's hot and sexy and there's a really brown scene with her that one can not come back and come back. There are also some other very sexy scenes and she has some very provocative line. <br /> <br /> Total 5 stars. I would give her only three, if not Erik Eleniak.
