At one level, this film can bring a child in us who just wants to build sandcastle and throw things in the air just to see it fall again. At a deeper level, however, it examines the deep desire to rejoin the country. I trusted the artist when he said, "When I'm not out here for a while, I feel it's not." I thought Andy Goldsworthy was one of the greatest contemporary artists. I'm familiar with his work mainly through books about the caf√© and several installations of art galleries. But seeing his work in motion, perfectly captured by the Riedelsheimer lens, was revelation. Not frozen in time, the Goldsworthy creations come alive, swirl, fly, dissolve, disintegrate and crash. And that's what it is: Time. The process of creation and destruction. Origin and disappearance. Get out of the void and become the universe again. There is shamanic quality that moves in madness. You feel you are looking at the work that his art is a living force for him, that if he did not do it, he would do it and perish. Luckily for us, Goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the communication media of photography. Otherwise, except for a few cavities and walls, there would only be one person.
