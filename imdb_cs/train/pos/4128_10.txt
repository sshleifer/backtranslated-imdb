With all the violence on television and in local news it is refreshing to have a show that does not have violence or language for adults, yet it is still fun. My children are watching us every week. Each of us has a favorite chef and a favorite judge. We all enjoy Elton Brown. We enjoy learning about the background of the main ingredient, unique vegetables and spices. We play together at home to guess who will be the winner. <br /> <br /> It's a great hour of entertainment as well as information. The best of all in our hussle, bus life is the hour the family spends together.
