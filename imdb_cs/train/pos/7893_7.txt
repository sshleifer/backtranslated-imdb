I think I'm part of a quiet minority who liked this movie. Is this one of the best of Nightmare? Maybe not, but I had a lot of fun with it. Freddy Krueger reaches his evil, the potential that is shocked. Since parts 4 and 5 kind of slow down the series down, I felt that this so-called last part ("The New Nightmare" is a real final) brought the series out of her fall. There are some great nightmare sequences, including one where Breckin Meyer plays a stoner who gets trashed, sneezed and stuck in a video game that Freddy controls. It is a very original and cheerful sequence, especially when we see it from a dream, jumping around like Super Mario. And Freddy pulls himself into fun, which has one line: "Great graphics." And since the film was shot about 10 years ago, he recalled memories when Freddy began controlling the game with Powerglove. Everyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers Powerglove. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. Lisa Zane is great side. I did not see Yaphet Kotto from "The Running Man" and I think I last saw the movie about 5 years ago. He's another great, undervalued actor who has a strong presence on the screen. And who can forget about the cameras? The best is Johnny Depp (from the first "Nightmare") to play spokesperson for anti-drug advertising. <br /> <br /> The 3D sequence at the end is really awesome! So for those who want to check this movie - ask to rent or buy on DVD! Hopefully all releases come with 3D glasses, but I'm sure the video release has a 3D element removed. <br /> <br /> I personally did not see much about the movie. He even even worked on Freddy's story. The film is a great combination of humor and fear, and the rough effects are amazing. Could this favor franchise? Of course it could be. But Rachel Talalay did a great job. And finding a perfect conclusion is easier than it was said. Finally, I liked mounting the initial credits. Fans of the series will be delighted and will look at them as a favorite of the beloved Freddy. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
