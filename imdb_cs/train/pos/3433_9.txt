I first saw it at a foreign film festival. It's a splendid nail idea of ​​a conspiracy to relieve the Estonian treasury of billions of gold. It's all shot in grainy, grainy style that Hollywood rarely uses - but captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic States beautifully (note: Tallinn actually looked much less bleak in 2003 when I was there) <br /> There's plenty humor and some romance. I do not want to ruin a number of surprising and yet logical surprises, so let me just say that this heist movie starts from a big screenplay and the direction and performance are top-notch. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the fastest and most nervous example of my genre - I set it against RAFIFI, TOPKAPI and it is before the new OCEAN 11, though (intentionally) not so shiny. RENT OR BUY NOW.
