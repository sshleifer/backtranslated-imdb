I've just managed to handle the Heavenly Region 3 DVDs of Five Venoms and what a great job they've created. Fantastic digitally transformed transmission and the need to have for every Kung Fu fan. The story is quite straightforward and has been mentioned so I will not come back to it. Needless to say, these are the battle scenes that many movies will buy and will not disappoint. The only problem is that they are little and far between them and they seem to be trying. Bruce Lee could take so much and drink a cup of tea at the same time! All the kicks and strokes come with all the important "writer" and airy "boys" clicks, which is a great effect, though it's quite fun! I give this movie B +. Good, but not great. I feel it could be a bit better. The Golden Swallow, from the same director ten years ago, had a good story and a better action.
