Simple comment ... <br /> <br /> What can I say ... is a wonderful movie I can watch over and over again. It's definitely one of the top ten comedies. With great cast, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau wrote the perfect script from Neil Simon, based on his play. <br /> <br /> It really is a real life situation really great. If you have a digital cable, you get a menu at the bottom of the screen to get what it is. It usually gives this movie *** stars, but in reality it deserves **** stars. If you are really looking at this movie, it can be said that it will be as fun and fresh as a hundred years.
