*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This movie, The Divers, is really interesting. All I knew about was that it would include Nazi history, submarine scenes, and everyone would speak Danish. I decided, however, for one reason that the story was developing around the sunken German submarine of the Second World War. I have a fetish for German chassis, especially wrecks to dive. So I was somewhat skeptical about the Danish section, but I reasoned that the NCO would consider this weight. Since the Nordic films are not always so good and they are not sure what budget I am, I was very skeptical. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see you. <br /> <br /> I had a few thoughts about the fact that the actors are inadequate because they see how some are very young, especially the two main actors. It was not a question, they both work well. Just like other actors who mostly consist of people in their fifties and years. This makes interesting interactions between young and old that are not often seen on the screen. In any case, it is not so unique, but rather rare. And it's all good. As far as the Danish language is concerned, it is almost impossible to understand. But that was no problem, it had subtitles. Another question was the submarine itself, I thought there would be internal shots, just like submarine exotic submarine shots. When I decided that their budget was lean, I thought it might have been a good one for the best and the right one right in the worst. Again I was surprised that the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic. With the fetish for the German chassis, I knew how the sub should look, especially inside, and it was not. The team has done serious research. Everything is good. I suspect that more people than I will be watching this movie just to see some scenarios, so I feel like I have to issue a "warning." The submarine in the movie is not the real model that existed during the war. He's a special subordinate. But to show you a hint of what to expect is a transition between Type VII, IX and the Japanese I-52 I-52. It's God's good design and makes a nice wreck. The setting is on a Danish island or a peninsula, I can not remember. It's summer and two brothers travel to grandfather to celebrate the coming summer as they do each year. Their grandfather is a sailor. Cinematography is pretty pretty, lots of nice summer scenes on the island of docks, some newly discovered teenage love, nice diving weather and the general feeling of "perfect". Again, it's all good. Visitors of the suspected species appear on the island, the assembly of men hires one of the ships, an old mineswalker, and it's a crew. One of the visitors, a man in his fifties, has a German tattooed tattooed and a swastika on his back. The inhabitants of the island all remember when the German U-boat was sunk by the end of the Second World War, and since then there have been rumors of Nazi gold. Grandfather was one of the young men looking for a sunken ship shortly after the German bodies began floating on shore in 1945. No submarine was ever found. What are you waiting for? <br /> <br /> Key elements are Nazi experiments, Nazi history, treasures, secrets, competition, teen love, plot and ... surprises. *** WARNING - SPOILER *** <br /> I did not expect any supernatural elements to appear in this movie and caught me. He is not a big fan of supernatural events, but it is still a fitting story and there is no problem. It's not like "From dark to dawn", where everyone eventually turns into vampires. It's a little smoother. TOTAL: A really good film, I gave him 8. Some because it is not a hollywood film with unlimited means. Later I learned he had a fair budget and that some actors were experienced Danish veterans. But even if it was a Hollywood production, I'd give her 7 or 8. It's definitely worth it. Yes, some story of a child, but again a mature story. He has plenty of tension and a great aura of adventure that I found very attractive. Again, cinema is really nice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
