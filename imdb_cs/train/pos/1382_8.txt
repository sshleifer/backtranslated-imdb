Not all of this is said in this excellent first feature by CÃ©line Sciammy. Friendships, "They Want to Come", First Sexual Feelings ... All this and much more is sublimed through the scenes of swimming underwater. <br /> <br /> All three girls in the movie try to find and express their personality in a very different way. It is a much less violent approach to understanding teen years compared to, say, "thirteen" but a very useful trip however. You must see, and please, leave all American cinematic prejudices on the door. Soundtrack is A + by the way. <br /> <br /> Bon cinema!
