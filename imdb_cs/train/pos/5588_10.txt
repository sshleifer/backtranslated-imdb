For the first time, I had the opportunity to see that all but forgotten classics had appeared in the early 1980s, in one of our art houses as a revival. When I saw this fever dream of a 1930s sexual exercise, I thought YOWZ! They were murdered in Europe in the day. Unfortunately, this movie was heavily cut out in its original release in the USA by the blue nose of the Hayes Office (a determined government censorship board, launched "crazy than you" biblical thumper, Will Hayes ... former post officer if you can believe it) because it's total The theme of human sexuality (Heavenly forbidden people actually had sex in the thirties). Ecstasy is a young woman (played by Hedy Lamarr) who married a much older man and later regretted. She (Lamarr) meets a handsome younger man and has a relationship with him, leading to a divorce from his previous husband (not yet in Hollywood movies at that time --- Divorce!). Despite the fact that the film was produced in 1933, it was probably the director first working in the audio format (ie, the film seems to have techniques that were mostly used in silent movies - ie the 1920's Expressionism). Still worth looking for a window into early European speaking pictures along with Luis Bunuels' L'Age Dorem (1930) and Vampyr (1931) by Karl Gustav Dryer. Not rated, but it contains the obscene swimsuit scene and some thin cover sex links that according to today's standards have nothing more than PG-13 (but it would easily land the dreaded "X" until the 1930s, if it existed then)
