It's not a bad movie. Somehow I managed to really rotate the Iranians to win the game in the film, although I know nothing about football and I am not a fan. The conclusion on the bus was exciting. The film itself deals with the issue of women in Iran and about how men can not go to sport arenas because their swearing is unsuitable for women to hear. Despite this law, some women try to break through, but many are captured and detained. It is truly overwhelming that every society could still have an outdated concept of gender. Panahi says in his interview that his films are documents of history and his injustice and that one day in the future we can watch these films and see how Iran once lived. One hopes the future will come sooner rather than later.
