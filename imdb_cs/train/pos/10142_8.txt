Maybe it's just because I'm afraid of hospitals and medical things, but this one got under my skin (forgive the stick). This piece is courageous, not afraid to go over the top and as satisfying as it comes to revenge movies. Not only did I feel a lot of hatred for the bolt and a lot of sympathy for the "screw", I felt I was getting sick and feeling angry pain at certain intersections, which is really a rare and wonderful thing for a somewhat crazy viewer as my little thing. Some parts are very familiar with "Hellraise," but they are more of a tribute than imitation. It's a tough song that does not sell a lot to the audience to think about it, but I was glad to have been filmed once and for all. This piece brings it and reluctantly. I liked it very much. Do not use pudding when eating.
