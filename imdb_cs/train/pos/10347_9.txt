A gorgeous little film, juggling comedy, and detective, romantic and dramatic genres as a lieutenant as Lieutenant Kenny Williams (Melvyn Douglas) equates his devotion to his girlfriend Maxine Carroll (Joan Blondell) and his duty to power as an ace detective. <br /> <br /> Today, it can appeal to all viewers, but in its days it has something to offer to all members of the movie family, and the solution to the rather tired feeling is original and refreshing in comparison with the work, and it is worth waiting for. <br /> <br /> "Wonderful Mr. Williams" contains what must be among the most outrageous blind dates in the history movie, and its clear comic spark corrections. Melvyn Douglas, who is sadly angry, brings some of the best words: "I would walk the main street in a Turkish towel before I let any woman manage my life!" And sparkling Joan Blondell lets her fly with a typical idea: "Good grief! You look like my aunt Nellie!" <br /> <br /> The criminal solution here is a standard fare, though a gentle actor's image helps bring the material to life. From today's point of view, "The Amazing Mr. Williams" is perhaps the most interesting of his credible commentary on sex as a socially defined construct that is even more ductile with its seemingly stiff borders. While most of the gender commentaries take place in the superficial battle of gender, it is sometimes subtle, penetrating, not only in some finer details of the film but in the struggle of genres that have reached their climax in the final scene.
