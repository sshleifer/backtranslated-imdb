Four teenage girlfriends are leaving for Fort Laurdale for a spring break. Unfortunately, they get a flat tire in Medley in Georgia, and one of the girls is witnessing brutal murder deep in the woods. The local sheriff is a crime and a nightmare begins ... "The Flat Tomb" is a pleasant low-budget surprise. The cast is quite sympathetic, the direction is stable and the violence is particularly ugly and misogynistic. Especially the second murder is quite bleak. The murderous sheriff is not the one-dimensional character of a few scenes that seems to feel remorse for what he has done. The subplot, which includes two boys with whom they meet in the dining room, does not lead anywhere but the scenes in the woods are tense and exciting.7 of 10.
