The "secret of the lens" is perhaps my favorite my favorite everywhere. The best and funniest of Kajawari Yoshiaki, who is known for anime spitting and dirty hentai-ecchi anime. I wish I could do more like this. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes are the psychedelic sequence of CG, the part where Lord Helumis throws out his erroneous supporters, the party rebellion that causes Bill (one of the most fun scenes), and whenever my favorite character, Worsle, appears. <br /> <br /> Check it out. <br /> <br /> WARNING: This is not for serious Anime fans!
