I grew up with this as my favorite movie. Special effects are unbelievable and appreciated for this time. I remember the dialogue as if I heard it yesterday. It's just a great, timeless adventure. The music is made by Miklos Rosza, who is the best cinematographer. Sabu is a thief. Conrad Veidt is a big villain. I have a copy to reach for another memory trip. Hi! Rex Ingram wants from his bottle genius!
