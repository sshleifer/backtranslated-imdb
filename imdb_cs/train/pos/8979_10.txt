I loved this film, at first I thought it seemed to me that the gray graphics were grainy, but I quickly got into it. It had to be a thousand hours of shots, and I really admire the work I did when cutting. If you are easily shocked by drugs or violence, it may not be a movie for you, but here are some great characters (and some real tossers). Technically, I liked it very much, had to use a new de-interlacing algorithm, or maybe it was just that the shots looked so dark anyway, but I was not angry with the usual artifacts seen in movie movies. (Open water propelled me, mainly because cheap, progressive cameras are available, and I do not see any excuse in not having one shot in a movie if you're going to be screening at the cinema). I'm sorry it's my little joke. I definitely recommend this movie, if you've ever been involved in the music scene, it has some tragic moments, but most of them are cheerful, maybe I'd be accused of laughing at other misfortunes but it's a classic piece.
