Historical drama and age story involving free people in colors before the Civil War New Orleans. It starts slow, but it will tie up as soon as you learn about the main characters and real action can begin. It's not just a story about the exploitation of black women because they were free men. Perhaps they did not have all the rights of the white, but certainly had more control over their destinies than their slaves ancestors. Young men and women in this story have to choose how to live their lives, whether to give up the system's corruption or to live with optimism and contribute to their community. I liked it all, but Christophe, Anna Bella and Marcel were favorites.
