OK. I'm interested. I live near Shrewsbury, England, where this wonderful film was shot. It still looks the same. I remember shooting them quite alive, and fake snow on the streets all day long. Often when I walk through Shrewsbury, I see a street or a house and remind me of this movie. Scrooge George C. Scott is a more realistic character than many other versions of the screen. His physical appearance is not a typical fool. Scott is big and impressive. The man who finds those smaller than himself is inferior. We all know the story and quotes. The book is one of the most popular works in English. And I do not believe there are many cynical people who say people are unable to change and redeem. This movie version renders everything pretty nicely. George C. Scott may be an American, but he plays part of an English fool with a wonderful skill. I love this movie. If you have not seen this version, I would strongly urge you to do so. Is it usually available for a very small amount of money ... or are you too bad?
