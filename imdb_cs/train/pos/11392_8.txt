Paris is a place where you can enjoy beautiful art and music and fall in love with madness - as is the case in this movie. A boy meets a girl, falls in love, but something stands in the way of eternal happiness, which is a classic story. George Gerschwin's amazing music complements the great dances of Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron. "American in Paris" is a funny, reckless, loving film that's worth watching. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
