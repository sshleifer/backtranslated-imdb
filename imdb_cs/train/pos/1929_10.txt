I recently enjoyed seeing The Big Bad Swim on Ft. Lauderdale Film Festival and I must say that this is the best movie I've seen all year and the only movie I've ever felt inspired to write comments / reviews. This film was beautifully directed and combined with a realistic dialogue, a great actor and inspirational message. Common life joins the adult swimming class and becomes extraordinary in celebrating the diversity of life. This is vaguely illustrated by the depiction in the first minute of this breathtaking film, where we see only the legs and body of individuals of different shapes and sizes that enter the pool with water. This movie is brilliantly focused on the fact that the actors are placed and placed in stunning scenes that keep your attention and imagination.
