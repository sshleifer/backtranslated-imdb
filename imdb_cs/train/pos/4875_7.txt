"Father Is Still Out", was the title of the review after the premiere of "Promise Me This" in Cannes. I understand why many think it's the same, but the unique expression Kusturice is still present in his new film, and it's something that critics can not touch. I had two hours of pure energy without rest. Even when Kusturica suffers from a lack of concentration or fear of empty space, it is still unique and intact. Surprisingly good performance by Stribor Kusturica. Much more detail and less landscapes, then "Life is a miracle". Marija PetronijeviÄ‡ has femme fatal potential of the world class, please do not ruin her. I certainly recommend everyone to see this movie.
