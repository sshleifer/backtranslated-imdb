Rich psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse has just published her first novel and feels that her job feels hopeless to help her patients. A young client of gambling addicts will ask her to help him pay off his debts if he really wants to help him better. Here he joins Joe Mantegna. To discover another plot, you spoil one hell of a fun movie, and "House of the Game" can really be the best movie I've ever seen.
