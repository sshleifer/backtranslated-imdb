This movie will not sit well with some, but it's a necessary insight. I am glad that someone finally brought to discussion the fact that African-American couples worked to create names in communities and how many of them felt that they were trying to stay where the "other" African-Americans were moving in. </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < the occupation of 1970 is. Like any other American, he moved his family so that he was compatible with his ascending status, but he forgot that there were still many problems. The only African Americans in the area were business. One owner of the house? Wow. <br /> <br /> Then the blending began. His wife (Whoopi Goldberg) is told to "get involved", and so does what other women do in their neighborhood. And just when a man thinks he and his family are "in," next door is another African American who got in because he won the "lotto" (Mo'nique) and in his eyes and wants nothing in common because he does not want that the neighborhood thinks they are similar. He is, of course, a better caliber, his new neighbor is a "ghetto" and should not be there! Who now has a problem? What this film shows you, it is the great pain that this family needs in order to get into it, and how it is lost in this process. This challenges you where racism begins and ends ... and with whom. It shows that no matter what color you are and how much money you have, you can still turn off the real world and help those around you. It also shows how these African-American children, when they "blend into" neighborhoods such as these, fall into a trap to change to suit the culture (complete with blond hair and blue eyes, you think!) Around them. They laugh along with jokes, they do not know they are a joke and they do not know why. <br /> <br /> But overall, this movie is about 'people'. No matter what race you are, this movie gets into how horrible you are to be against your neighbor and towards yourself ... everything to get in ... everything because you feel like you have more money than others, you are better - and forget about the struggles you had and those who come to you. <br /> <br /> Again, not for all. But look and judge for yourself. <br /> <br />
