It's a stunning movie. Just like showing real shots of key events in a failed coup to keep Chavez away, we get a background image describing a class divided society. Many of the rich seem to have a choice of popular democratic choice and are willing to use the army to change the regime. "Be careful what you say before your servants" is a revealed remark. The head of the largest oil company in the country is named as the new president with US support, and these young Irish movie makers have it at the camera. A great movie that educates young people about democracy. We see transparent documentation on how media can be manipulated and power used in the interest of large businesses against the interests of people's democratic aspirations. Riveting material.
