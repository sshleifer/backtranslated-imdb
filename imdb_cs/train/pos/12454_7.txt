So I suppose you've never heard of "Topper". <br /> <br /> Which, besides the two stars that only one member could see, had a dog like that. It was a kind of "Not Gonna Make It" program written throughout the first episode - it was like an arcade video game where you really need to read instructions for playing; no one (obviously, few of us, apparently) wants to watch a comedy program that has a basic premise that actually requires * to think * to grasp.
