Undoubtedly, this film must be one of the greatest ........ in the history of film. I have it as many times as I remember, and it's always like watching the movie for the first time. Where does it start? <br /> <br /> Meena Kumari's central performance is undoubtedly one of the best careers, followed closely by Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam and Phool aur Pathar. Every movement and the nuances of its performance make it a pale meaning for some other Bolelywood heroin. Her spectacular interpretation of Kathak, coupled with her grace, tragic vulnerability, and the poetic delivery of Urdh, is like nothing that has never appeared on the Bollywood screen. Pakeezah is perhaps the most stylized interpretation of human condition; photographs, excellent cinematography and missions en scene are so full of symbolism and the sense that the viewer remains breathless. <br /> <br /> Naushads' music is unbeatable, his knowledge of the music of courtesan gharanas is incredible and the way he distorts the story with dark atmospheric motifs and stunning romantic melodies is really remarkable. My only advice to anyone who really enjoys a show on the whole cinema should watch this epic mediation of life and art.
