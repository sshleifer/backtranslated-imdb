Well, I got used to reading comments about those movies that do not reflect my experience at all. Amitabh was a better villain for me than in some of his most famous films. It was a dirty villain, a fearless thief. For me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his anger is not somehow undercut. The boy who played Aryan was probably overhead with this occupation. I think the director could do better. But to be honest, the best part of this film was Shernaz Patel. She is an unspoken heroine, a real veteran who is exaggerated for every role she offers. But I must say that I very much appreciated her contribution when she played Virendra Sahi's wife. Maybe he does little, but he does everything with utmost conviction. I'm sure she sailed right over the heads of most of the spectators. So if you have a habit of satisfying the Bollywood average, you will not be much in the movie. But if you're always looking for something more, then it could give you something you missed.
