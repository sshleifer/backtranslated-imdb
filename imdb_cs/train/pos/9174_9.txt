There have been many film and television productions by Jane Eyre, each of which has aspects that recommend it, but I think this is the one that people have since discovered and will fall in love for decades. It's just a classic (and offers much more story than others). Timothy Dalton is totally in his element as Rochester, rarely missing a mark; his performance is amazingly agile and multi-colored, without deviating too much from the dark complexities of the character. Zela Clarke Jane is much more brain than another world, but she does a perfect foil for Dalton (which covers her!) No details of her performance come better when you look at the second look (once you absorb the shock of Dalton's charisma). There are some technical mistakes and a few moments when production values ​​could be better; although it was quite a top production according to BBC standards at the time. But these are the achievements that are a real pleasure. Do not miss this!
