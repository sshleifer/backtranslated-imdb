What a good movie! Finally, the image revealing the unknown side of the rock: the illusion of glory. Famous rockers are getting older and forgetting, not music. And with a good sense of humor. Have you ever danced on rock Bill Haley for about an hour? Still Crazy is still the best rock n'roll movie I've ever seen. Far better than Spinal Tap. Why? Because in Still Crazy people are ripe. They have a different opinion on rock, love and life. They want to catch up with their crazy youth, which they lack so much. In addition to the story itself, we see characters with their own personality, weakness and dreams. Just like any of us. <br /> <br /> Spend a good time watching this (listen to a great soundtrack!) And finally, think about your future. <br /> <br /> Hello!
