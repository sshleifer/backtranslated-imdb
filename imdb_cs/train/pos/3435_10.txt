This movie is an amazingly simplifying work. Comfortable from start to finish is sad and at the same time uplifting. Miranda Otto's performance (oh, how much he deserves!) And George del Hoya is beautiful and yet painful to watch both tortured souls understand each other. Supporting workers in the Dead Letters Association are in themselves a wonderful part, just like Alice's long-standing friend, whom I could not help, but I'm a little bit sorry. There is one particular scene I'm looking at (and I have!) Over and over again. It's such a shame that such films will not be recognized, so they bring them into the public eye so that they can enjoy more people. I cried, laughed and sighed. I recommend this movie to someone.
