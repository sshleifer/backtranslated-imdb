An amazing film once again dealt with trials and tribulations from the 11th World War in England. The movie is so good that it touches the human element. This film is definitely in the tradition of such British line classics as "Mrs. Miniver" and "Hope and Glory". As in the case of this film, we see people's despair at the time of the war. The performances are exceptionally advanced, especially the grieving John Thaw, who was assigned a child who was evacuated from the bombing in London. Soon we will find out why the baby breathes on the bed. It comes from a crazy mother who was terribly abused. The old man takes the baby and brings happiness to his sad life. When the child returns to his mother, the old man goes to London and looks for him just to find a tragedy. He literally kidnaps a guy and can convince a taller child that he is better off than being in a boy's house. The picture is so good because it deals with and builds on cute relationships.
