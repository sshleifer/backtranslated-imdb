In the west of Hollywood, these trails were harsh hands, which seemed very persistent when they arrived at the city. After all the rides on the routes, lonely work was the day the railroads reached all parts of the USA. <br /> <br /> The predators who worked for Gil Favor as Eric Fleming played did not differ. But Fleming was a man of all sorts, he had a job and hired a top crew to do it. <br /> <br /> With the long training of Rawhide and the fact that most of them stayed, we all knew the predators at some point. Some point stories focused on all of them, although much of them were with Fleming and Clint Eastwood, Rowdy Yates, Reader No. 2 with the herd. The Western image of Clint Eastwood was created by Rawhide; it is a shame that these data are not displayed more often. Probably because they were made in black and white. If it was an NBC show, it would have happened in colors like Bonanza and would have run as often as those shows. We could see much more of that man who became a legend of movement. <br /> <br /> It was ironic that Eric Fleming left the show before he closed to make films. He made a couple of them and hoped that the title of the film would be recorded on the show. He was sadly killed in a movie spot where he shot an action film drowned in the river. If he lived, he could become Eastwood's name. <br /> <br /> Clint took over as a boss in the last season and then finished the show. And he, of course, became an icon he represents today, and not just the Western genre. Rawhide was a heavy Western who had hard boys inside. There were no ornaments in this, this is what cowboys have been doing, who are doing their job and fighting the elements, and no matter what the situation they have made in each year. In fact, such TV series are not doing anymore. What a shame.
