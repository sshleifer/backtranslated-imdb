"One of the musical better early moves, humor is partly lost because Hung tries to imitate Lee's motions and facial expressions, and also a bit of hunger in Jackie Chan's Drinking Master, when he hung up at the end of the trio for martial arts professionals. It's not the biggest movie, but it's pretty good for kungfu in the 1970's, especially if you're a fan of Hung and / or Lee. The movie's version is of poor quality, so it's a black character that some people might consider Sammo Hung is a rural piggy who moves to Hong Kong to fight some bad guys Sammo sets off his dead-on Bruce Lee Impersonation in a fight This film is often billed as a parody of Bruce Lee's "Enter The Dragon" but it's not exactly ... Sammo is a rural piggy-obsessed with Bruce Lee - who moves to Hong Kong and helps his relatives to run a small open-air restau In a new job, he is forced to defend house gangsters who are looking for money to protect. When Sammo goes into combat mode, Bruce Lee turns on the identity that must be seen as believed! This film is quite careless, in many combat scenes, Sammo fights against people who are obviously actors rather than fighters, and there is one character to be black that plays an Asian man in heavy (and absurd) makeup. But what this film lacks in budget and accuracy is more than in the atmosphere and energy. It is recommended for a good mood. "
