I was looking forward to this film, because there was real honesty in acting. Writing was top-notch. James Arness is a great actor and showed him here. Brian Keith was too old to be Davy Crockett and can anyone actually play Davy but Fess Parker? Another great actor in this move was Raul Julia, who gave the depth of Santa Anna, the vain and complex person who led Mexico over stormy times. While some may think that the film was slow-going, it captured the battle as it unfolded, a lot of boredom followed by a couple of hours of terrible terror. <br /> <br /> What interests me most in this movie is that you've been thinking about some things and how some people are willing to die for what they believe. Nowadays, when nobody means anything, I find it refreshing that it's time for people to die for freedom, no matter how you feel about time politics.
