I saw this movie on a preview and was dazzled. It's not a typical romantic comedy. I do not recall that I was filming so much that I was shooting, but I still moved. Laughter is not here - it's observation, laughter of appreciation, little shakes "Oh, my God, I thought I was the only one who felt it!" I will not make a plot, which is more than just "Guy falls in love with her brother's girlfriend." The whole family is involved in this relationship. Probably the best laughter and warmth since you slept. "Steve Carell goes deeper than he did before, and I really liked him for the first time, and the cast is amazing, a list of theater actor veterans I loved in other roles, but they mix to create a convincing family, Dianne Wiest is beautiful as a mother , Juliette Binoche is bright and cheerful (who knew it was funny?), And even the ominous Dane Cook gives a warm, quiet and moving performance. Sondre Lerche soundtrack is a wonderful addition and I will buy the second CD that is available. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this.
