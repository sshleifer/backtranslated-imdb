If you are a fan of Crispin Glover, you have to see it. If you are a fan of Sean Penn, you have to see it. If you are a fan of a movie in general, you have to see it. If you do not know who Crispin Glover is, and you have no idea who Sean Penn is, this movie will probably still have a lot of value, but the more work you've seen Crispin or Sean earlier, the better. > <br /> This movie is so fun, but it's also a pure genius. There is nothing I know about it that resembles this movie. It's his own genre. I doubt this will ever happen again. I can not say anything more about why without spoiling some of it, and some of the other reviews have already done a good job here. <br /> <br /> In response to one of the reviewers who gave a bad review here, I ask you to review the movie again. In fact, there is no reason why this movie could be fairly called "boring". This is perhaps the most entertaining, the most entertaining and the least boring. And that's just better with age and repeated tours. Timeless classic, unfortunately, very few people can claim to have seen. Beaver Trilogy is a great work by director Trent Harris, who is also responsible for the amazing Rubin and Ed, which Crispin Glover also stars in. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, copies of this movie are rare and hard to find. I managed to find a VHS version after some careful search and there are several ways to find out what I know about. But I really wish someone put it on DVD.
