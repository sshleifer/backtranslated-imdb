... but I just liked it. I have read some of the comments the reviewers have had to say about this show, and I have a hard time eliminating all the criticism in my own head (with the exception of one: that the show was obsolete, this program was ANYTHING but still). A lot of things people are struggling with on this show are on the money: demanding; forcibly; nervous; desperate for attention; satisfied; harassing the ubiquitous narrative. But you know what? I really liked it. It was different, original, really really TRIED; and it concerned all the minuses. The show was clear, verbal, fast, funny, interesting, fun to look at ... you know, it was just once a week, I can take it once a week and enjoy it and enjoy it. I will be weeping. But I think no one will bring it to life.
