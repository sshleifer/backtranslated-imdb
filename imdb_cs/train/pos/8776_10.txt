Just mention one more thing about Gentleman Jim. I agree with all the ratings that make it the biggest excursions of Errol Flynn in the career of great trips. I would think that this role playing boxer Jim Corbett is more like his real personality than the swashbucklers who were of the type like. Flynn looked like a party from his memory and was one person whose real life was more exciting than his life on the screen. A special thing I wanted to point out is that she notices big montages, transitions, and even inserts beyond the film. Although the director was Raoul Walsh, a frequent associate with Flynn, with cameraman Sid Hickox, the monts were composed by the emerging editor, Don Siegel. I never knew that Siegel had gone so far, but he was credited directly to credit. He would go into a big career as the director of the action himself.
