Because of everyone who thinks it was 1.This was a tedious broadcast 2.Halle Berry and Denzel Washington did not deserve their Oscars <br /> <br /> STOP F ** UP TO !! This was one of the best academic awards since 1.This was a time in history to have a black yes "black actress" wins the Academy Award for Best Actress so many of our black nurses have been ignored by the academy for many years. To be honest, I stopped watching the Academy Award because of the lack of variety of winners or candidates. It was nothing but a bunch of white people who roasted each other on their backs. The Academy had many chances to vote for black actresses who were great in movies such as Alfre Woodard, Whoopi Goldberg, Diana Ross, Mary Jean Babtise, but that 2.Halle Berry deserved that Oscar's uncompetitive academy was under pressure to vote for her so long, that the deserving actresses were ignored by the academy, most of them made up of white voters ye yeah Nicole baby singing was very nice singing in muling rouge! but it was time for black people to be accommodated in these awards show. For the Washington Academy he owed him a great time after this unfair loss for MalcomX. All who think race is not a problem "probably white people" in the film industry, well that many of the most talented black actresses in the neighborhood have either been reduced to a stereo type that gives white people the role of what you think are black women or the existence of "Angela basset". I do not expect many of the white people to understand something because they never had to deal with any of them. Sometimes I think it's him who caused him
