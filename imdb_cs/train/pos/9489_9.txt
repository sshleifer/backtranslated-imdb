I'm not tired of saying that he's one of the best political thrillers he ever did. The story takes place in a fictitious state, but of course it deals with the Kennedy murder. A true and honorary district attorney (played by Yves Montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by the only man Daslow (= Oswald), and although all other officials want to close a case he is constantly investigating with his team. br /> <br /> The script is written tightly and quickly and holds the tension to the end. Only the part that deals with Milgram's authority experiment is (albeit unintelligent) a little out of place. The final sequence - explaining who is really Icarus - partially shot slow and amplified Morricone soundtrack is the most powerful sequence I've ever seen in the movie.
