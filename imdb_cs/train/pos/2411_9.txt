This film seems to me to be one of the most successful attempts to come up with probable answers to some of the annoying questions that arose in the recent scholarship on "Passion" accounts of the New Testament. (What motivated Judy if the money was not a problem, what would Sanhedrin bring to meet on a high holy day, why did Pilate waffles do?) It is a movie for serious, thinking Christians: fans "will undoubtedly be disappointed with the lack of horror spectacle and characterization In terms of myself, I can find the portrait painted - the willingness of ordinary people so blithely sacrificing common courtesy when they are at stake of their own interest - much more realistic and deeply worrying. (The uninvolved person, "just does his job," looks at the face of the man who controls the first nail in Christ's wrist is as cool as ever in the movie.) The film does not claim to be "authenticity," but setting and costume always feels "more correct" than many other highly regarded efforts. It is a slow film, but if you accept its own limitations (that is, after all, "Death" - not life - "Christ"), eventually greatly changing.
