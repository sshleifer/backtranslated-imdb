Stupid, cheerful, tragic, sad, inevitable. The squad and team team is working with a "seasoned" step to get out of poverty. Great idea ... if you ignore the screwing factor. <br /> <br /> You can see how George Clooney does something really fun to change. Casting is perfect and game standards are very high. Although it could be said that the straw crew is not new, I think this film treats him with an interesting and unique way. Sufficiently enough to make it stand out from what it was before. <br /> <br /> Very good guys.
