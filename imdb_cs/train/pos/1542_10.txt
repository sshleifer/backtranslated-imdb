Well done gives a look at the other side of the fraulein the doctor captures both the cost and the futility of the war. great work, especially when the German High Command refuses in the name of chivalry to present the Kaiser medal ordered the strike. scenes of bloodshed are probably too intense for powerful American brains who would probably prefer some silly speeches and absurd abstractions like 14 points or a league of nations. real Americans could appreciate the story and the action. for all actions and intrigues, the Fraulein doctor compares favo (u) rably with Jacob's ladder.
