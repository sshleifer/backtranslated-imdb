Let's put one thing straight: this movie is not trying to redefine the genre, it's not Dr. Strangelove o Young Frankenstein. It's silly filming, with three great female stories (I can not remember any other comedy with similar characteristics), Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehler from SNL and Queen Parker Posey's India, which is charming. The story is basic: three galleys have been "defeated" at a college and are after it after separation. Poehler is a dog trainer (who can not get a blind date), Posey is a senator's assistant (who "has not been affected by a man since Clinton was in office" ... I caught it a few minutes later ... I'm a bit slow, OK!) And Dracht has a gay fianc√©e (Seth Meyers from SNL, funny). She must prevent the "unwavering" daughter of the senator (always cute Amber Tamblyn from the television series "Joan of Arcadia") to suppress her during the spring break. So of course she has to watch her and there's some joy. Overall, it's a light, simple comedy, rather short and pretty
