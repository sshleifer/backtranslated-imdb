Nick and Kelly are ready to be married, but Travis (Kelly's dog) leads Nick to the strange blue wall that will change the honeymoon for Kelly. Richard Burgi and Susan Walters play Nick and Kelly and make a good couple. Nick loves to drink, smoke and play with boys for fun, but Nick abruptly abstains from this type of entertainment. Sex is the only thing she loves because she wants a baby. We have discovered that the alien race is dying and needs to cross with the women of the Earth to save its population. It is a battle of survival among humans and aliens, involving the dog population as well. Nice movie.
