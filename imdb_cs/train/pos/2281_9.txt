There are many films about World War II, but Mother's Night is quite different between them: In this film we introduced Howard Campbell (Nolte), an American living in Berlin and married to German Helga Noth (Lee), who decides to take on the role of a spy: More specifically, CIA agent Major Wirtanen (Goodman) recruits Campbella, who will become a Nazi propagandist, to enter the highest levels of the Hitler regime. The treaty, however, is that the United States government will never recognize Campbell's role in the war for national security reasons, and Campbell becomes a hated figure in the United States. After the war, he tries to conceal his identity, but the past is back and haunted. His only "friend" is Wirtanen, but he can not do much for the avalanche of events that fall on poor Campbell ... The story is deeply touching when we see the tragedy of Campbell, a great patriot, regarded as contempt by all who surround him. Not only that, but also gradually realizes that even those closest to him have many of their own secrets. Vonnegut gives us a moving atmosphere when Campbell's despair builds and almost stiffens the viewer. <br /> <br /> Nolte plays the role of my life in my opinion; he is even better than in "Affliction," although in both roles he plays tragic characters that are destined to self-destruction. Sheryl Lee is also excellent and the same can be said for the whole cast. <br /> <br /> I did not read the book, so I can not evaluate what the film is comparable to. In any case, that's not important: My criticism is on the film itself and the film deserves 9/10.
