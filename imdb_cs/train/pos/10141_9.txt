I was all ready for this episode when I see that this "Master" does not really have any horror pictures underneath the top ... but this is probably the best season episode. good!! I do not know how he was arguing about it, but in this episode we have some real talent! And although you could see things coming from one mile far wrong, at least it was fun and I managed to keep my commitment for 56 minutes, something that was missing until this moment of the series. <br /> <br /> I especially liked it at the end, not an abbreviation, but just a little bit of fun where, as always, a hen's hen. <br /> <br /> Really good effort. As with other reviews - they are not real masters who are doing a lot of these episodes. But sometimes they may end up in the future as masters.
