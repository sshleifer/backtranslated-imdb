This movie was absolutely brilliant. In fact, he was thinking. Throughout the movie, I was confused as hell. I loved everything ... it was so confused and so twisted and weird, it was hard not to love him. All the actors were phenomenal and no one could do a better job ... This is one of my favorite years ... it deserves your eyes.
