Dick Tracy was not the best for many comic fans because they wanted something with blood like Batman. Dick Tracy plays innocence just because he is a comic book with villains who have a serious disorder of appearance and are entertaining. Warren Beatty drives and stars as the main character that fights crime without using super power. I liked Dick Tracy from childhood due to the comic atmosphere of the main colors: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. It's a perfect movie for someone to watch with their kids. Al Pacino is like Jack Nicholson in Batman and plays Big Boy Caprice with enthusiasm. Madonna, as the child who is the second villain in this movie, does not play the same toy he represents. As I said, no blood, obscenity, sexual irritation, or anything to offend someone.
