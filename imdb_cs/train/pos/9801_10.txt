The original animated Dark Knight returns in this eso adventure film that rivals Mask of Phantasm in its cool. There are lots of styles and intelligence in Mystery of the Batwoman, much more than Batman Forever or Batman and Robin. There's a new criminal on the streets of Gotham. She dresses like a bat, but she's not a mature Batgirl. And Batman denies any affiliation with her. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has to deal with the usual romances and detective work. But the penguin, Bain and the local Mob make things a little more complicated. I did not have any hope of this because I was strongly released, but the weak Batman: Sub Zero (Robin did not know so much!) But I was excited by imaginative and exciting pieces, a clever plot and a catchy sense of humor. This is definitely a movie no fan Batman should be without. Keep your ears open for a really catchy song called "Betcha Neva", which is prominently featured. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the DVD is not that great. Do not get me wrong, there are some great features (short 'Chase Me' is amazing) and very cool Dolby 5.1 soundtrack, but ... the movie is presented in Pan and Scan. Batman: The secret of Batwoman was drawn and shot in 1.85: 1, but this DVD is presented in 1.33: 1 and compared to widescreen clips shown on the features there IS picture cut off on both sides. I think it's extremely unpleasant because the Mask of Phantasm was presented in an anamorphic widescreen. Warner had to re-release literally dozens of movies on DVD because people complained about the lack of original ratio for some titles. Why they decided to make the same mistake is behind me again. <br /> <br /> I give this DVD 5/5, but the lack of OAR brings a total score of 4/5. It's a shame because the wide screen would finish a great DVD package.
