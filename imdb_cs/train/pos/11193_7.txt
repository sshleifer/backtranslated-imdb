I like Lonely Lady. Give Pia a break. She looks great and has really nice eyes. What does not like? The scene where Ray Liotta raped him with the garden hose was so cruel and cruel. In fact, there are a lot of things that are going on in this movie, gross and cruel. But it's a scary movie. Many movies that are dirty are not all bad. I liked it better than the Valley of the virgins, which was not only ugly but also dull. At least it was not boring. <br /> <br /> She is pretty naked and seems to be a miscast as a writer. Watching her stories about Pushkin and Byron with a guy three times older is totally unbelievable. I'm sure Pia is a real person in real life, just does not show the writer's atmosphere. She looked much happier when she worked as a hostess for that Saturday night guy and she was wearing a glittering disco dress. Several scenes are funny. The one where she tells a two-time actor that she is pregnant and he turns his eyes and sticks to her to "stop hanging around!", All the while he practically dashed over every bimbo who floats. > Pia's nervous breakdown scene is good. It was probably the mistake of going so supernatural to her (a swirl of floating faces and a frosty cry - whoa!) And her subsequent catatonic bout is a little exaggerated. Speech acceptance is a hurry, though. I want to see someone doing this speech in a dramatic classroom. But again, it's the basket we talk about. In the 1980s, you could find worse movies a week.
