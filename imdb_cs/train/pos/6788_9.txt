The story and the characters were some of the best I've ever seen. The graphics were good for PS and cut scenes and the voice overlays were amazing. At least three times I beat the game and loved every second. I felt the problems the protagonist had encountered were credible and realistic, and I believe he deserves to continue. or at least remake. If they sell it for ps3, I would buy the system just for the game and perhaps its striking idea, and the realization of the dragoon system is enough to ask for rents and, moreover, that advertising, even though sometimes cheats (a dumb buster with a wand ) combat system and action makes this game a certain purchase.
