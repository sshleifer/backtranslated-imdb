Good Earth is a great movie !!! Everyone has to see ... It's a jerky and very warm heart. It is about increasing value - formation about perseverance, humiliation and love for the family ... The story can be connected with our present life, especially in that poverty is at the threshold. The way to respond to such a problem is very important, and if one is not strong enough to face such problems, he may be deprived of defenseless and unnecessary. I am very glad that the characters justify their roles to the young actors ... Their emotions have taken the audience. The film could be done in black and white, but the story is so charming that you do not want to end. That's really great! This very nice movie should be re-make.
