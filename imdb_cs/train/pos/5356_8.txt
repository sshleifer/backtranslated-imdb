Running Man is not a great movie, it's actually a little stupid. But it brings what you want in the movie Arnie, and it's action and fun. I do not see how anyone could look forward to this picture, it's so stupid and over the top that it almost makes fun of herself. By the way, this is probably one of Arnie's most sensitive films.
