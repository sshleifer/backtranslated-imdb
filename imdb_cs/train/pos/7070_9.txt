One of the most appealing elements of Gilliam's film is that well-created visuals, disturbing backdrops, and manic frustrated characters are proof of the creator's involvement. Instead of most films (where a filmmaker is a hired director who is paid as a star or two), you can feel the presence of Terry Gilliam through experience. "Twelve Monkeys" is proof of Gilliam's own imagination and style, in contrast to making endless films for himself. "12 Monkeys" is a variation on similar topics of Gilliam's repertoire: repressive / recessive society, loneliness of the protagonist, frustration associated with distrust and parallel empire. In this film Gilliam does a good job of blurry lines between these two spheres, using ambiguities to force the audience to swirl rather than know. This tendency for Gilliam to neglect filling certain gaps leads to criticism of the pretense of art. The difference between Gilliam and artistic poser lies in the fact that Gilliam's decision is clearly meaningful and all of his paintings make sense. Two nearly similar swimming scenes from Cole are about to draw comparisons that leave the audience dissatisfied. His bald head is a sign of unity in a future world that is missing out on illnesses, yet it is born in 1996. The title itself is a sign of Gilliam's creativity because it requires that most of the story be embodied to fully understand its meaning. Overall, Gilliam's commitment to making creative films that are interesting to watch, but also require thought and interpretation from the audience. The movie has incredible value because there are fine details and hints that can be omitted at the first tour. Definitely one of my favorites.
