And that's me. And not just me, as I see on IMDb or leaving the theater. Why do people love it? It's obvious: everyone knows zombies now (at least horror fans of the heart and others through "Dawn of the Dead" reinvention or Resident Evil movies, etc.) Or at least they thought they knew everything about the zombies ... that's until this the movie will not appear. And you will see the zombies in the new light (maybe). It's not a horror film, though it contains some violent scenes, but rather a comedy. Satire must be accurate. And never gets couples! That's why I rated it so high. Pacing the wise is incredible, the acting is great and the script has no (obvious) mistakes ... on the contrary: It's a gem and if you're just a little interested in zombies, you should see it! And even if you do not like it, watch it! Because it's a great (comic) movie!
