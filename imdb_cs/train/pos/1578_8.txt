Rosenstrasse is a moving story of courage in adversity. The Reichdean women found their Jewish spouses closed until deportation. One aristocrat, whose family Lena Fischer had refused, found himself in a crowd just like General Gudarian's sister. But rank and privilege deserve special attention. <br /> <br /> Neither the Empire service as a female detainee, whose husband is at Ostfront, will learn. In one of the most frightening scenes of the movie, the guards take the wedding group her husband gave her. <br /> <br /> Before you think it is a typical German abrasion, today in America, Lady Bush imperially ordered the arrest of the Golden Mothers of the Mother (the mothers of American servants killed in action) because their presence is death. Little, unfortunately, changed to 60 years from Der Fuher to Der Fumbler. Fortunately, eight-year-old daughter Ruth is escaping capture. Waiting for the cold at Rosenstrasse Lena Fischer first regrets that Ruth responds in a way that we take as typical German. Even Lena Fisher's brother, Colonel Arthur von Eschenbach, who is aware of and against Holocaust, warns Len before. but Lena chose to accept this idea with American resistance, even by renaming Ruth, the more Aryan name Helga Lehmann. Siege ends favorably on Rosenstrasse, but Lena sad: What happened to Ruth after the war? A few years later, Ruth's daughter, Hannah, goes to search for her mother's past and meets 90-year-old Lena under the guise of writing a personal history of war. It seemed interesting to me that Hannah wanted to look at the family so much, but she never believed her fate's grandfather, who was the last known to have served on Ostfront.
