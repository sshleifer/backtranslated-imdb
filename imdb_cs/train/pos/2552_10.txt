Fatal error is really a great movie! Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., Janine Turner, Jason Schombing, Malcolm Stewart and David Lewis are in the movie. The feature cast of the film worked very well. Robert Wagner played his role well. The relationship between Sabottem Jr. and the Tournament was nice. There may be a big age difference, but they are a unique couple. These two actors really worked quite well. The music in the movie is really good to Ron Ramin and he fits very well. There are lots of things in the movie that do not know what's going on or what's going on, and this movie will continue from start to finish. If you like Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., and Janine Turner then watch this great movie!
