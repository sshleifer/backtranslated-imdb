This film is about the life of Queen Victoria during her youth and her first years as a monarch of Great Britain. <br /> <br /> "Young Victoria" has an amazing production. Each scene is designed and decorated with immaculate details. Extravagant costumes, rich places and beautifully landscaped gardens make "The Young Victoria" very impressive. The most sad cinematography was most impressed. As each person is placed in relation to the background or the foreground, he is well thought out, each scene is well composed. The scene that hit me most was when Victoria talked to Melbourne. Melbourne was placed in the middle of a door frame from Victoria's point of view, while from Melbourne's angle, Victoria was between the space where Melbourne held her hand on her side. to be followed and understood by a person without Queen Victoria's historical knowledge. Many events are submerged or even explained. I was expecting a big coronation scene and disappointing it took only a few seconds. Overall, "The Young Victoria" is a good movie and it would be even better if it was longer to make the events properly explained without hurry.
