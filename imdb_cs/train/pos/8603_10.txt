The film is fantasy. The story line is thin, but it serves as a structure to sing beautiful songs and sing beautiful songs. (I still can not believe that such handsome and attractive people could sing well.) Some of the dialogues are incredibly clever. I felt like I was looking at the haute couture fashion show from 1942. The films are designed to serve different purposes. This is for fun, and it certainly does. If I have one negative note, it would be that Nelson Eddy was a little too old to be a handsome and agile earl. Some of them were disturbing me. But he could still sing and sing spectacularly. However, Jeanette MacDonald was as dazzling as ever. He is a magnificent angel. <br /> <br /> This genre is a long time ago and I'm a new film by Jeanette MacDonald / Nelson Eddy and related conversations. The music in this movie is beautiful. Like me, I love classic rock music that fills up the latest movies, there is no idea in my mind that this music is simply and clearly more memorable, more beautiful, and better built. The stars in this movie are more talented than the stars I see today at the cinema. And Jeanette MacDonald, without the benefit of plastic surgeons Beverly Hills, was more beautiful than the stars I see today. I'm not sure why so many more posters are justifying that they love this film and, more generally, this group of films. They say she is dating and tries to explain why it is. And those who do not like say they are not very good, but compared to what? I think this movie will undoubtedly still have fun with people when so many other movies have long been forgotten. In this film, it is too good in every direction to be memorable and used. I highly recommend this film to all who appreciate great talent, great beauty and great music.
