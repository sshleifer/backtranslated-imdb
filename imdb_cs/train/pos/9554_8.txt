Lock Your Daughters is one of the best comedic films I've ever seen. It is misunderstood because it lacks the "social commentary" values ​​that required many films of the day (1969) <br /> <br /> The characters are exaggerated satire of everyday people and played by all actors. <br /> <br /> Christopher Plummer shines especially brightly as Lord Foppington, noble with his hair too big to fit into the door. <br /> <br /> The plot includes the usual 18th century things; mistaken identities, confused novels, corrupt government officials, and jokes at every turn. He answers the questions: What happens if there are four furious, eager for seafarers in the British coastal small town? Who cares and how does it turn out? Despite being wrong at the box office, he has great costumes, excellent music (based on the Mermaid Theater of the same name), great, live plays and sets that are obviously authentic. <br /> <br /> The fact that it has never been released on either the VHS or the DVD is really a shame because so many bad movies are released every day.
