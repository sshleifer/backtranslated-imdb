I have to start saying that it's been a long time since I saw it, but I saw it 5 or more times; delightful little story that was clearly inspired by the musical / comedy pairs of new or vyblednut√Ωch stars and music groups of prominent personalities. Kay Kyser's secret would be a good example. When Spike Jones unleashed, this is the best part of the show because he and his band play many melodies and are part of the event, doing a great job support, the support. Hugh O'Brien plays on the face, Buddy Hackett, that this was what he offered Lou Costello, so Abbott and Costello replaced. I do not know if that's true. Overall, it's a nice movie, but it's important to have Spike Jones and his bands on the history movie. You want it to be released because I have not seen it or heard it in two decades. I hope it's not lost
