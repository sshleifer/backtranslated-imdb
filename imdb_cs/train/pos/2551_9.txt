This almost unknown gem was based on a French farce - which shows, and I think it is a compliment. <br /> <br /> Caroline (Lee) is a polite Argentine (Roland) who asks his father for a marriage. But Caroline is already married to Anthony (Colman), who has just arrived at the airplane and is immediately releasing an audience focused on reminiscence. Caroline decided she was in love with someone else: an amateur sculptor (Gardiner). The film tells the story of Anthony's strategy at Caroline's separation from her sculptor and how this experience helps with the Argentine. Perfectly Busy: Ronald Colman is in his most upbeat and charming, Reginald Gardiner is in his most crazy, Gilbert Roland is in his most exotic, and Anna Lee is just deliciously moody. The film is beautifully directed by Lewis Milestone (who also produced); all production feels like love work. There are wonderful touches such as Colman's frames and addressing the camera and the exceptional use of the sliding door of the cabinet. It's a sin that it was not released on DVD - it's a kind of movie that can spontaneously awaken interest in classic film.
