Aro Tolbukhin fired seven people on a mission in Guatemala in the 1970s. He also said he had murdered another 16 people (killing pregnant women and then firing them). This film is a documentary portraying Aro personages through several interviews with people who have met him and through the scenes that actors played on the basis of real facts. "Aro Tolbukhin" is a serious job, so analytical, not at all ill. Such terrifying testimony of how childhood traumas can change man into a monster. <br /> <br /> * My number: 7/10
