I agree with the previous commentary on naming the content of the film "Everyday Insanity," but I would like to point out that: "Dog Days" relate to how women are treated (male) society. The episodes that we see here show the differences in the daily discrimination of women, which are mostly divided by age groups. There is an elderly man who looks and looks with his new partner as his late wife behaved as a doll who would be "worthy to wear" her clothes. There is a middle-aged couple whose relationship is almost a slave and a (violent) master. Next, we find a rather younger person who does not communicate with his friend and wife and, instead of being really jealous about his affairs, even brings friendship with his competitors. A young adult person clearly explains to his friend - a girl who is really concerned about being pretty nice for him - that jewelry must be on his side and follow his narrow look at the rules of the label. Finally, at the end of the seventies, a man who calculates his advantage brings a simple-minded woman who stops, a furious client who - when he took her guilty of scratching his car - naturally takes her. To complete the examples, we find a mate in the "master-slave" - ​​after collective abuse - threatening and degrading the former "for her" because she gets rid of her partner and takes herself as her new "master." During this time, all the inhabitants of the newly built neighborhood in which the event takes place reside under the burnt summer sun - absolutely immobile (sic!). Unfortunately, I have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic portrayal of archaic structures that still rule in the relationship between women and men, but what I saw convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination. Probably a useful tool in teaching even a less sensitive viewer of what is happening - due to good visualization.
