for film slasher, this movie is actually better than a lot in the genre.yes is a predictable-resident matrix job goes to killing spree, people die, yada yada yada.however there are some good positives in this movie.first away, I'm really she liked the mask to work with the nut. It was certainly scary to say the smallest and perhaps unique (although I did not see every movie slasher ever made) also, the genesis of bad maturity is something I have not seen before, and he finally meets his end, it's a Romanesque concept if I like it. I also really like the weapons of choice employed by Mr. Sick, for most of the murders. The murders themselves are not as graphic as most genres, but it is a small interest. The film does not give up serious, which is something that usually suffers. It seems to me that watching the movie reminded me of the early "Friday of the 13th films, seriously.there is a few worries about this movie." In several scenes, the killer at once carries as reminded one of our horrifying icons.We mean his movements and reactions that he was shot and how he walked, but a bigger fear is a scene very close to the end where the madman carries more than the really complete detachment of another famous horror titanium.And in the last scenarios we again have our fools looking just like the first the icon of horror that I mentioned.In fact, the last scene is almost complete to break away from another icon in the slasher genre.these scenes were weak and non-original (of course) By the way, the film is located in Australia so if you are a rash for chickens with an Aussie accent (like me), you will be in the heavens, if not before you could just play around. : Beautiful Kylie Minogoue (just do not get too involved) There is one accent that is not Aussie, courtesy of Molly Ringwald.Anything, there are more reasons to watch than not.i liked it and had some fun.so, I have to give " Cut "8/10, which may seem too high for some people.
