Wow! Danish film with this kind of content? I mean, actors, story, paintings, efx - everything was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> And Danish EFX house producing these VFX - Wow! It's like the 2nd or 3rd time when the Danish FX produces visual effects in this quality. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER AHEAD * Cutting the terrible children in the submarine was pretty good, but in general I did not feel the great cold I would expect from the spiritual film. * END OF SPOILER * <br /> <br /> But it is also a Danish movie that I could be proud of as a Danish. The only "bad" about it is that he was not a Danish director but a Swedish director ...
