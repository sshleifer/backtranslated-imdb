"Home Room" came as a surprise. He has no idea what this all was, it paid off for a long time, because he has no blows and what we see is how life changes by going on a young man who is not satisfied with his referee who are innocent victims of his extortionate acts. Paul Ryan, a director who works and adjusts his own material, is a talented man who is rewarded with some amazing performances. <br /> <br /> Alicia Browning is an older girl who is trying to graduate from high school. She was gone for a few years, and it does not seem to be the same wave of other students. One is a rebel with a punk look, plenty of makeup and mouth that destroys anyone who dares to get closer to her orbit. Alicia was among the students in the home room, where nine students died who probably killed her girlfriend. Alicia, as we realize, is a wounded girl who has experienced terrible suffering in her life, but there are no traces in this sense. What follows is the result of a tragedy, as it focuses on the young woman who survived it. Deanna Cartwright is a rich teenager who should not be at school at all. When a ricochet bullet caught her, she was hospitalized for more than a morning. They try to overcome this dark period in their mind, but the nightmares will not let it be forgotten. Alicia is taken to the hospital by the school head. Because she does not cooperate with the police, the school manager wants to see Deanna in his terrible condition, and maybe calm down and tell the authors what he knows. Alicia does not like Deanna, but in a couple of days both girls will make peace. We do not realize until the last sequence of what really happened that awful day at school. Busy Phillips is an excellent Alicia and Erika Christiansen is as good as Deanna. Victor Garber, James Pinkins, Taylor Holland and the rest of the cast as a set. The film is intense because it is not clear how to show how the shooting took place, which helps tone, Ryan wanted to give this film.
