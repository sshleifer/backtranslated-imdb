I saw this classic for the first time a few weeks ago. Nearly 30 years ago I thought the scary moments would be rather twisted. The boy was wrong. Some great moments sent me shivering. Even the acting was great, Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic, and Donald Pleasance was great. On the bottom it may be rather slow to start, but as soon as it comes, it is not stopping. Makes all copies, such as Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream looks very tame. I can not say it's the best for Carpenter because I have not seen much of him, the only thing I remember is Starman (I think he did). Halloween is the ultimate success of the horror genre.
