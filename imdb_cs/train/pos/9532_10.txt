I loved so much about this movie ... the time needed to develop characters, attention to detail, great performances, amazing lighting and cinema, a wonderful soundtrack ... <br /> <br /> It has combined intensity and lightness of touch that will not work for anyone who wants a typical fast movement. If we lived in Elizabethan days, I would say that this film is a bit like a Shakespearean tragedy. But because that does not mean, let's say it's more like Drama-Suspense. The story is simple, but the story is complicated. The film is intelligent in the way relationships and problems are explored. A lot of the story is shown rather than spoken, which, in my view, makes it more subtle and movable - and also works well for a story based on a comic book (or a graphic novel). Sometimes I felt that I was actually in the 1930s, part of this story - it was such a realistic, yet dreamlike quality in the style of his narrative. books on which they were based, but in this case I do. (I even liked the book.) I bought a DVD, which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and imaginative comments. (I also took my little cousin who is younger younger than the boy in the movie to see it after seeing it for the first time because it has problems at home and I wanted to use it as a way to start a debate about father systems. and discussion.)
