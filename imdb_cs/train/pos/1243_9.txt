Every once in a while, Eddie Murphy will surprise you. In a movie like "The Golden Child", especially. This is a movie you would consider to be Harrison Ford or Kurt Russell or someone else. But Eddie really works; he is smart, he is funny, he is brave, kind, polite, friendly, clean, and all the other hero should be. They were chosen to ensure a mystical child who holds the key to protecting the world from total evil (Perfectly Embodyed Dance), Eddie goes from California to Nepal and back, while beautiful Kee Nang (Lewis) wonders if it's all he says, that he is and fools an old holy man (Wong, perfect as always) he is. <br /> <br /> It's exciting, stunning in places, shocking and, of course, funny. Eddie is the only action hero I know, who could start the film by making harsh comments on some guy who read the porn magazine and ended him with clever notes about Ed McMahon. <br /> <br /> No problem with this "child": it's a "golden" finding. <br /> <br /> Nine stars. Viva Nepal!
