I have not seen too many Columbo films ... actually, I think I only watched one or two, except that. I've always liked Columbo without seeing it so much. Peter Falk is and has always been the perfect choice for the character because of his appearance, his voice and his charm. The perfect proof of this is that although the series began in 1968, the latest (and probably not the last) films were made in 2003. It's 35 years. And Falk was 40 when he did the first. The series consists of 68 films (if my earl is not off), all made for television. Everybody knows this figure, even though nobody has ever seen a movie with him in the cinema. That's quite a success when you ask me. The story is pretty good. The only problem I have with this is that the murderer and murder are revealed at the very beginning (although it may be the same for all Columbo films), it leaves no secrets, but Columbo solves it, which is somewhat boring (because there is The end of the movie you do not have to look forward to, the movement is good, there is hardly a scene where you are bored.Actor acting is very good, especially Falk and Ruth Gordon.In the film they have some great dialogue exchanges.Hearts are well written and trusted. The script is unusually good for a television movie, and overall, the movie is surprisingly good for television and is definitely worth watching for every Columbo fan and / or criminal / mysterious footage.
