It was a TV show, and HBO showed two incredibly terrible health conditions, so I turned to my twin sister and said, "It looks like fun," - I really love documentaries - so we started watching her. At first I thought Jonny Kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that he had never been through puberty, a high voice and a smaller body because of his condition. He was on a crusade to earn money for his cause. He had the most amazing sense of humor in combination with a beautiful sense of spirituality ... I cried out, looked even more, laughed, got up to get another Kleenex, then cried even more. As soon as Jonny Kennedy's time, he flew to heaven to be with the angels. He was more than ready; he learned his lessons from this life and was free. I highly recommend. If you do not love this guy, you have no heart.
