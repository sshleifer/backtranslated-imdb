Ride with the Devil, like the later Brokeback Mountain Ang Lee, is a film of aesthetic and historical significance. Film lovers should see him at least twice, because his artistic nuance is worthy of being understood. <br /> <br /> Perfect artwork, the surprising depth of humanity. I really do not remember another war movie, capture you, change the current concept of history and politics, restore your belief in humanity. After seeing so many murders, so much misery, you do not feel numb, instead you are more appropriating the bond between people. The performance of the actors is troubled by your heart, music drives your mind. Some shots are not just some pictures, they are overcome and they become the sight of the soul. Such is the real sense that film is a genre of art. The movie does not require long comments or reviews, all in its own right. Ovation on the cast that includes Tobey Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Kilcher, a cinematographer and composer of beautiful and lyrical music, what a success!
