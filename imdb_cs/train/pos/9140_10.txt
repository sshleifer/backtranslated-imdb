I love this movie !!! Purple rain came out in the year I was born, and my heart is because I remember it. Prince is so tight in this movie. Last night I went on a special show of Purple Rain and it was like a concert I was glad to see that some real fans make this film so underestimated, it's really one of the greatest movies of all time. Music is inviolable. The film is about "The Kid," which plays the prince, his family is dysfunctional, his band is the hottest act in the city and has eyes on Apollo, an aspiring singer. There is no doubt why purple is my favorite color that I can thank for "Kid". So if you have not seen this, you need to forget about it quickly. That's a classic - 4ever!
