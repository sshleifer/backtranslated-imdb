This is one of those Westerns who are virtually lonely in the unrelated quality of their dialogue. Few people are able to withstand a long route. That sounds, the rest is pretty bad. Still, I give him eight because there is no other Western with such a constantly good interview except The Wild Bunch, Junior Bonner and maybe even a few others. <br /> <br /> It's full of weak spots, John Drew Barrimore the strongest. But it has one really memorable scene. Nothing like that. Its right after Kid Wichita kills the sheriff and goes to Jack Elams and tries to get him into the fight. Amazing things. Right with the best in every Western.
