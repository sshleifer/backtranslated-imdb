Excellent comedy was played by Dudley Moore, supported by Liza Minnelli and well-spoken John Gielgud. Moore is Arthur, a man belonging to a multi-millionaire family, who approached $ 750 million, assuming he married Miss (Susan) from another multimillionaire family. Arthur basically accepted the conditions, but eventually refused to meet the pretty and poor Linda Marolla (Liza Minneli). Arthur was just a parasite because he did not work, just enjoying drinking and having fun with prostitutes. After some serious thoughts in his life, Arthur first decided to marry Susan just a few minutes before the wedding. The end was happy for Lindy and Arthur, though he knew his life would change in the coming future. This comedy is a good lesson for everybody. Rich people are usually not happy with their way of life.
