Fun somewhere. Pleasant, well built somewhere. <br /> <br /> There is no need to say "Do not take it seriously" or "so bad is good" or "it was not frightening." None of these comments is relevant. <br /> <br /> The cut has an atmosphere. It's an atmosphere that is actually a very unique and truly original aspect of a movie that personally makes a movie for me.
