I'm a big fan of Faerie Tale Theater and I've seen them all and it's one of the best! It's funny, romantic and classic. I recommend it for all ages. It's great for little kids because it's good, Cinderella and great for adults and teens because it's funny and not over the top. I saw it when I was little and still looking at it. He has great lines that I quote with my family and my family. The acting is great and never stops. If you love cups and novels, you will love it. I watched many of the Cinderella movie in my time and it's the best of them. (Sorry Disney) I highly recommend this movie and all the Faerie Tale Theater shows. They all appeal to all ages and are unique and very entertaining.
