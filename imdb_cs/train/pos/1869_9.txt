Antwone Fisher's story of child neglect and abuse is the inspiration for all of us who have witnessed or even experienced the difficult situation of foster children. Mother abandoned by mother, Antwone never met her father. He grows up with "church" oppressed, who use "n-word" not only for intimidation and harm, but also as a blessing because a young man witnesses how his best friend is killed in steady, and when served in the navy is Antwone's anger was slowly transformed into a positive force when a psychiatrist from the navy advised him, and love came into his life. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Antwone meets her mother is one of the most powerful moments in the movie. Anxiously confused by the unexpected confrontation, the woman listens silently, hearing the young man telling her how he lived without crime, drug addictions, children's fathers left and right, despite the most unfavorable circumstances. /> If this scene is not strong enough, the other guides her home (and opens the flood gates): A reception that welcomes the home of Antwon; dozens of smiling faces and open arms that announce that he is part of this great family. One of the messages of this wonderful film is that there are many good and honest people working to help orphans and unwanted children. Even if some of the houses and administrators do not seem to look self-service, many give it to everyone. The character who found the "set" of Antwone as soon as he discovered the circumstances of his birth is one of those "bright lights" in the darkness of the system. The DVD contains a French footage, various captions, as well as other features and information on foster parenting. <br /> <br /> Like Clevelander I appreciated the location of the shot. No matter where you come from, you will be deeply moved by this autobiographical gem.
