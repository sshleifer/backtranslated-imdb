It seems totally illogical, at least for me, that "Arthur" deserves only 6.4 of 10 possible. A one-time masterpiece by Steve Gordon is a totally "unlikely" if not totally "impossible" combination of wildly uneven elements. Being able to make alcoholism more laugh than tragrow is itself amazing. That he gave Dudley Moore the best role and every other film element that has its optimal impact here, including score, seems to me patentable and indecent. I urge someone to sit through this movie and do not know loud. But it seems that almost a third of his spectators have mastered it. Well, I, for one, found and found Gordon's quest for both ridiculous and sweet, as well as the attributes of Geraldine Fitzgerald and Stephen Elliott, a murderous future father-in-law, the absolute gems of background characters. Even the black driver managed to escape the patronage and the late, sober Sir John Gielgud was right about accepting his charge, but mistakenly assumed his role. "Arthur" does not make any attempts to "Underztand," much less to rationalize, the "alcoholism" disaster (hey, iFit is not booze, other drugs of choice, including meth, and dependence are only symptoms, not targets) simply observing his own quiz way.
