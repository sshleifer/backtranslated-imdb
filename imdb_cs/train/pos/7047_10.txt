this film needs to be seen. the truest picture of what's happening in the world I've seen from Darwin's nightmare. Go for it! and if you're lucky to be in your city open, do not forget to see it on the big screen instead of the DVD. The scripture is sharp and the direction is good enough for ideas to go through, though hardly perfect. Joan Cusack is amazing and the rest of the cast is also good. It's inspirational that John Cusack shot this movie, and I think he had to use some of his own money. It's a wild, absurd ride, apparently made without the means it needs, but it is still successful. Jon Stewart, Steven Colbert, SNL, even Bill Maher, did not show the courage to say what this film is saying.
