"Written in the Wind" is the melodrama of Douglas Sirk. Douglas Sirk re-discovered "Cahiers du Cinema", Fassbinder, etc., who considered him the director - I think it's because of the sophistication of his cinematography - "Written on the Wind" offers beautiful color images and wonderful decorations. But I ask myself: Is it enough to shoot a movie? Effects on "Wind Written" vary from weak to fair (with the exception of Robert Stak - is convincing as a weak and spoiled playboy). Lauren Bacall, normally a strong presence on the screen, is wrong in this movie. Dorothy Malone as a seducer, carefree "femme fatale" is fine but lacks the strength for this role. Rock Hudson is effective but faulty. The plot has very interesting components. The main characters are: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (Dorothy Malone) Lucy (Lauren Bacall) - a woman of principles, a former secretary who now married Killem Mitch (Rock Hudson) along with Kille and his beloved patriarch. <br /> <br /> Secrets behind the door, love triangle, frustration, fistfights, laughter, death etc. - Well, when I read the story summary on the back cover of the DVD, I thought I was treated. My fault! Why? I will try to explain: "Written in the wind" I take seriously and try to tell a dramatic story. As I said, acting in general is not good enough - the intensity is lacking. There are many powerful scenes in the story, but actors just do an effective job. I think Italians or Spanish actors would be able to fully explore these scenes - they ended up (for us) with a laugh or tear explosion. What's left is beautiful cinematography Douglas Sirk. It's not enough for me. To enjoy a good melodrama, check out "Aventurera".
