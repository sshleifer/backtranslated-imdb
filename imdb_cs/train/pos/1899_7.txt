Arthur Bach needs to grow up, but that is unfortunately the only thing he has to do. According to his enormously wealthy father, Arthur must marry a wealthy Susan Johnson or be cut off from family money ($ 750 million). The problem is that Arthur does not like Susan (though I hear he's doing a good chicken) and just fell over his head for a waitress and part-time merchant Linda Marolla. Arthur is an interesting man. It's really just a big kid who was born into wealth and at least one person cared for him every second of every day. The work simply instills Arthur wrong - he enjoys having fun, feminine and, of course, drinking. Drinking gives Arturo a Jekyll-a-Hyde complex; and although it gets into all sorts of trouble, it's totally funny to watch on the screen. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is a great actor in this movie like Arthur, winning an Oscar nomination and the Golden Globe wins for his performance. Moore is fantastic with the comedic aspects of the film, transforming funny lines into unforgettable comic gold, but it is also great when he brought Arthur to a relatable level and made his character available. Moore has some help in the separation of stars - Liza Minnelli is great as Lina, a temperamental nobody Arthur can not get, and John Gielgud is amazing as Arthur's butler Hobson. Gielgud has won Best Actress Oscar for his performance in this film and there is no doubt why. Hobson has a solid, dry dry joke and attitude, but he always looks for Arthur - and Gielgud is perfect in the role. Steve Gordon's 1981 film Arthur is short and simple, but it brings laughter-lots.
