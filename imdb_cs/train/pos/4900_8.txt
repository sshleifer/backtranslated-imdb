It's a special movie that the British do so well. Low budgets, cameo type, well done. The story is a bit faint, the recently widowed Judi Dench has decided to round off "blonde bombs" by all (almost all) girl band that she played during the London War. A mandatory son / daughter who thinks she's gone. as the film allows young people to see that they do not have the monopoly of feelings, love and even the lust that "old wrinkles" can also laugh well. "Judi Dench was as good as ever, a pity that we do not see another of the other" blond bombs, the end was somewhat bleak, I thought. I still thought when I watched David Jason make Patrick even better than Ian Holm, though he was good enough as a "transvestite" drummer. Everything in all the funny movie, which is worth the night with the girls :)
