I have seen this movie on TV lately a few years ago, but it was a disturbing experience that has remained with me until today. The assumption may seem a little non-original - because of the earthquake, the hidden underground store of the toxic nerve agent in the hills above the town is broken and the microscopic amount of substance gets into its food supply. The inhabitants of the city are starting to lose their ability to stay above every whimsical and basic wish that floats our minds from time to time, and we normally know that we simply can not act. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film is slow, but it has only contributed to creeping disturbance because the behavior of burghers is slowly beginning to reveal. There are several surrealistic and very disturbing scenes that have remained in my memory all the time. <br /> <br /> It raises interesting questions about what we could all be able to give up our wildest instincts. I liked it? I'm not sure that "enjoying" is the right word. That made me think? Definitely. I'm still thinking. Scary things.
