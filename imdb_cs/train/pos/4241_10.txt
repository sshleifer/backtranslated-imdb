I loved this movie !!! The characters were people you could feel for yourself. The young man out of service still fell in love with the girl he left behind. Tom Drake is always perfect in romantic leadership, just like Donna Reed as a love for his life. The look that she gives to her as if she was starving for her, as well as her hesitation and confusion, as well as her feelings for her, played very well. The rest of the strange characters in the store were perfect when they tried to connect them. But the most comfortable scene was a young couple in his grandfather's house. I laughed in parts, wept in some and thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. Actually, I tracked it for about 5 times. She must definitely see complete romance.
