I did not care about the movie before I first viewed it because it was part of the Welles I've recently bought. I got the box set mainly because I wanted to own the Man for all years and also to re-evaluate Waterloo. So I kept Orson and Rita in the player and I was dealing with class and confusion as well. <br /> <br /> On the surface it seemed that the story is simple, a man meets a beautiful woman and rescues her from a few criminals, clicks instantly, and one gets a job offer to sail with a woman and a famous legal husband, and then ............. <br /> <br /> ..this well becomes the murderous mystery of a devoted figure and a lot of rage. Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) himself does not know what's going on, he's just as confused as the viewer, and it's great to watch him get everywhere in the movie. It is obvious that she is pulling the heart of the femme fatale string of beauty as Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth) has its moments, but you know things are going to be pear shaped. in the movie Welles has a visual style all over the world, sees the scene in the aquarium, which is amazing and the final sequences in a fun house are majestic on the eye. The O'Hara narrative is jokingly laughing and we are getting a good relief through a litigation with Everett Sloane to greatly illuminate the proceedings. The film is strange and in fact it's a disturbing viewing experience, because (as I was supposed to find out after) the studio bosses have lowered the film for almost an hour, and that's not only for us, the viewer, unfair to the faith of Welles. I am convinced that the original original film of this film would be praised and worshiped wholesale, because that is the one we have a very good and interesting film, one that sadly only points to size, but remains a contemptuously glamorous film that I am " I have another visit 8,5 / 10
