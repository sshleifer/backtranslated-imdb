The thirty horror films that are best remembered are always like Dracula and Frankenstein; and there is a very good reason, but there were several smaller, yet excellent productions, and the invisible ray is definitely one of them. This conspiracy is not very original, and a similar site has been seen many times before (even in 1936), but the way it is all set up is certainly very imaginative and director Lambert Hillyer has created a very small, original horror film. The plot focuses on good Dr. Janos Rukh; a man who has discovered a way to restore the history of the Earth. His discoveries lead him to believe that there may be some unidentified radioactive element in Africa, so he and his fellow colleagues agree. But the tragedy will hit the expedition and the good doctor will end up exposing the element; which darkens him in the dark and also spreads him in the mad ... The biggest feature of the film is undoubtedly the fact that the stars are the two biggest horrific stars of their day - Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, and they both give great performances. Karloff really shows what a good actor he is and his character has plenty of meat for Karloff to make it happen. Bela Lugosi plays a role that is extremely different from what we're used to seeing, and it's also a great performance from him; it's nice to see a little versatility from Lugosi. The film begins to slowly begin; but things will soon begin to rise. The other half of the film is the best, and that is when the film excites and Karloff has a chance to shine (literally). The film can not focus on great special effects and relies heavily on events of a central nature to make things interesting; and it works very well. The film remains interesting all over the world and falls into a very good climax that wraps it all up. Overall, an invisible ray may not be one of the best horror films of the 1930s; but it is very good and we recommend it.
