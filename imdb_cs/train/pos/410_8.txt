I chased this movie in DVD format without knowing it at all, which is part of the winter marathon when watching the film every night. After some terrible American action adventure films (Ballistic, Daredevil, Cradle of Life), Zhu Warriors hit me like a brilliantly original film. The story is a complete nonsense, but I found cinematic honesty, good heartiness and a total lack of irony refreshing and the film looks great. Sure, special effects are not as technically flawless as those produced by Hollywood, but filmmakers are more wisely interested in color, composition and motion than realism, and so many shots are breathtaking. In one shot, two of the superhuman figures are standing on rocky rock towers, a huge moon in front of them, a picture perfectly balanced by three elements. In another, the princess-warrior flows through the heavens behind her glowing sword like a rocket looking for heat. And colors explode from shot to shot, they are used to express emotions rather than to represent reality. Characters have the same simplicity and straightforwardness of comic characters that do not provide any great depth in themselves but refer to artypes that resonate deeply. Physically, a few actors are terribly beautiful. They play their roles straight up, without irony or greed, and so they are credible. Most strange of all, despite the clumsiness of plot and thin characterization, I found myself very close to tears at the end, moving with the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wildly original, good vision of the director. <br /> <br />
