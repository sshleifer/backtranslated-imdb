It's very funny. He has great acting that everyone gives great performances. Especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline. It's a well written script by Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon In Vegas). I do not like soap, even if I do not see them. But I love this movie because it's so crazy and out of the wall that it's exhausted from any silly soap they have on a daily TV. In my opinion, this is the best film of the year 1991.
