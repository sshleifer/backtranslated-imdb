After a slow start BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very entertaining film that has something positive to say. It was not one of Jim Carrey's best performances, but he was still fine. Morgan Freeman was right as God. Jennifer Aniston had some good times. I miss Steve Correll at "DAILY SHOW!" I like the decision of film director Tom Shadyak. He also made LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS and NUTTY PROFESSOR. In all three, Bruce the Almighty takes a big comic star and tells a human story. A director who knows comedy can get the talent he gets, and he can tell a meaningful and intelligent story that's hard to find. My biggest complaint is that they should use more biblical references. I only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three most fun parts of the whole movie. My guess is that the first few scenario designs had more biblical references but were cut out because the producers were afraid to offend people. That's too bad, because I thought it was a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> My rating: <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
