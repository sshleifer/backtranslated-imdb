Perhaps most personal works by David Lynch are most accessible to him. This time, rather than mysterious thematic structures, which may or may not include plotting or pose more than vivid nightmares, Lynch provides a reflexive, fragile meditation on the universal subjects of aging and family and finds relief in both. The only true story of a farmer from Iowa (Richard Farnsworth) who rides a mowing mower to Wisconsin to visit his stolen brother is still a host of unique and original visual dreams (some rare airplanes of the heart, shot by veteran cameraman Freddy Francis) to become unchallenged Lynch's efforts and characterizations, which are some of his most unforgettable. Farnsworth is excellent in a stoical but still perfect way that lets the stories he hears on his way become part of his life. Sissy Spacek is the smallest part of his most beautiful work as his mentally-tested but attentive daughter (whose painful secret appears in a gentle way in a sensitive script by John Roach and Mary Sweeney), but the rest of the small cast gives an indelible performance, the most prominent is Barbara Robertson, whose random killing deer is both passionate and sad. But that's vintage Lynch with his ability to engage and upset you to his best. For those who are not familiar with Lynch or who know only his violent, disturbing legend, it's a great place to start; for those who know his work, he is one of the best in his repertoire.
