I saw this with my whole family as a 9-year-old in 1964 on our black and white television. I remember how the father noted that "it could happen - Adam and Eve." I remember the scene clearly when Adam finds Eve, her eyes blackened. I asked my father why her eyes were black and she said she was tired and hungry. When I did not see this episode in 45 years, I still remember it alive - TV broadcasting back and forth with home planets, bomb scenes that shook the headquarters, with the last scenario of two outgoing ones, Adam carrying his package and Eve following. Perhaps it was not a theatrical work of art, but it was all interesting to me.
