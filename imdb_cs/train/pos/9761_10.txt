Now there's a childhood movie, my family is used to filming; but it has come to an end of the past years. Now I'm lucky to be watching the whole movie on youtube.com; I loved this wonderful film when I watched him as a child, and after watching again (online), I still do today. My favorite song from the movie is "Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers" (I always remember the sweet song forever). <br /> <br /> I was surprised when I looked at the initial credits (about who revived who) that some animators date back to the 1930s (WOW! it's like 47 years old).
