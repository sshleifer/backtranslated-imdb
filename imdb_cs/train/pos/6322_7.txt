This movie was recommended by a friend. I have never seen an ad or a trailer, so I did not know that Clooney was in her and was not concerned about the fact that his role is so small. I thought the whole movie was good and the movie was pretty nice. The opening scene, with a small crew of bandits standing at the side of the road, looking whimpered and furious, immediately caught my attention. She had a way to tell you, "do not stay away, it will not be boring," and it really was not. It turned out to be an interesting and reckless comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you in place at the very end, but when the end was over, I felt a little cheated ... just a little. Events have been evolving so you expect them to continue building, but at a point that I can not define, it is going to some extent, so the end is slightly disappointing. I think I expect a higher peak, but it turned out to be a little key. If you are looking at a movie with that in mind and you can live without high doses of George Clooney, you should find this movie very fun and well worth watching. Now I'd like to see the original Big Deal on Madonna Street, but it's probably a rare find in the United States.
