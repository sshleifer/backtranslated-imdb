This is probably the second remake of this film, which was filmed before 1911 and 1918. And in many ways reminds me of the later film A YANK AT OXFORD. Both films relate to a restrained strike that will arrive at one of the best schools in the world, and both will eventually show off slowly learning about team work and decency. In this film is William Haines "Tom Brown" and his main rival, "Bob" plays Frances X. Bushman. And in supporting role is Jack Pickford - always remembered as Brother Marie. Of the three, Pickford gets out of the best, as a sympathetic loser who becomes Tom's friend-he actually has some decent scenes and a dramatic moment just before the Big Game! All the standard clich√©s are there and the movie because it has been done so many times before and since then, it offers little surprises. It's a nice movie and enjoyable watching. In my opinion, Harold Lloyd's FRESHMAN - the football scene is frankly more interesting to Harold Lloyd's FRESHMAN, and Harold is much more fun and affectionate than the unpleasant Tom Brown. FRESHMAN is probably the best rail picture you've ever seen. Another reason why BROWN AT HARVARD is a smaller picture is that William Haines played essentially the same unbearable and bombastic character with the same conspiracy over and over again (for example, in WESTPOINT and SMART SET among others) you saw one of these films, you've all seen them. Well made but definitely NOT original! And because it's just a rehash of his other films, anyone who gives the movie a score of 10, it's MEDIUM recommended to see these other movies. <br /> <br /> 4/25/08 == I just checked and saw this little movie was the best rated IMDb movie since 1920 !! Talk about overrated! There are dozens and dozens of quality movies - how this movie is supposed to be number one, it's someone.
