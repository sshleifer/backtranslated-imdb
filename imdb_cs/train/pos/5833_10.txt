I can not believe people are looking for a conspiracy in this movie. This is Laural and Hardy. You'll lighten it already. These two were riots. Their comical genius is as entertaining as 70 years ago. It was not a dirty word of mouth, and they kept the audience in the stitches. Their comedy was not sophisticated in any way. If you can not satisfy the cow pillow, there's no reason to follow some of the things these guys did. It was easier time, and people laughed at things that were funny without conspiracy. I think it's easy for you to enjoy, so I qualified. Two male comedy teams do not count, We're just too sophisticated ... Are not we lucky?
