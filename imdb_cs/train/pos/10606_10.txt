I just watched this movie and found it nice. It's a silent, small film that will not overcome you with a special effect or "big" performances. It will simply take you to the life of people who live in a small village in North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Henry Thomas gives a good performance as Raymond Toker, a young loner who finds a child abandoned in the woods. Toker's search for the child's parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life. David Srathairn plays Truman Lester, a slimer konman with a later motif. And David played a bad man to perfection. <br /> <br /> There is much more to this film than first encountering your eyes. Filmed on a spot in North Carolina and with a wonderful soundtrack of traditional music, it is worth seeing.
