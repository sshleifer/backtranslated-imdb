What could be more skocky than the idea of ​​private detectives to engage in women who should spy on? And most of the dialogue, as it is written, is totally trivial. But the actors change the dialogue to something that makes sense. You can see real people in unrealistic lines. And the direction is amazing. Every scene does what it has and ends without stretching too long. <br /> <br /> I showed it to some friends in the mid-1980s because I was confused about how such a bad material could be such a good movie. Friends also enjoyed it.
