When I first saw this show, I thought it looked interesting. I looked at it and saw her turn around Sarah as if the figure was seeing the world ... turning around her. I have it but it does not laugh. On the stage and on the stage, she is racist, cruel, insensitive, and extremely confident. I did not get it first, and I took it all in nominal value. Then I saw her movie, Jesus is magical. I think she was the basis of Sarah Silverman for me and explained to me what "language" he is talking about. It's like Marilyn Manson, who works hard to give us the face of terrible ideas and pictures, but you finally realize it's not an attack, it's a statement. And once you understand this, you will find that you are glad someone is finally giving you. <br /> <br /> I do not want to suggest that smart people understand or that hating this show is to show your idiocy. While I like a lot of "smart" shows, I still do not notice the humor that should be avoided by your enthusiasm. I think it's good, but I just can not do it. Many people never get Sarah Silverman, but I'm glad I finally came. The creators of this show are working hard, each episode is filled not only with dialogue and plot but with compositions or dreams, serial numbers. These people do not combine something that would fill the timeframe, and please advertisers seem to be on the mission to create the best performances they can bring together. If I had to foresee the future of this exhibition, I would say that he will go on the road of arrests and damnation. It will be canceled before it's time to live in fans' hearts and DVDs. But take your heart, the creator of the SSP, your audience is out there and we will be watching for as long as it allows you to make a show.
