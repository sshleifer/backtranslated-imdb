A scientist who desperately works in isolation is looking for a way to locate a meteor crater with a new radioactive element. All (pseudo) scientific and breakthrough technological talks of the 1930s are directly in this area, including the idea that radioactivity could cure any disease if properly utilized. When he summons his rival - who threw him out of the scientific community and mocked him - to witness his discovery, they proposed a "joint" expedition to Africa ... of course, eventually they would eventually steal dr. Rukh's original discovery, which gives him only the residual credit. In addition, the effeminate poor man, who looks like a comedy actor from the worst abbot and Costello (Lawton), literally steals dr. Rukh's young trophy (Drake), who falls on the heels of being a human being. Developing horns like a deer will not do by dr. Rukh (Karloff) any friendly, so he embarked on a mission for revenge under shelter ... kill his 2 enemies and friendly dr. Benet (Lugosi), the only one who helped him ... was finally subjected to the lethal radiation that allowed him to go to revenge to begin, but (in his most sad dissatisfaction) he was investigating the adulteress and the poor justification for the man because he got married. Acting is mostly fine, Karloff and Lugosi are very good. Check out the hysterical chamber scene ... Other characters are not worth mentioning ... Recommended, like all old Universal horrors ...
