This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. He has a very good acting from Hanks, Newman and everyone else. Definitely best performance by Jude Law. Cinematography is excellent, editing is about as good and contains great original scores that really fit into the mood of the film. Production design is also a factor in what makes this movie strange. It takes a lot for me to beat The Godfather, but the fantastic cinematography that has appeared wins this contest. Definitely the best friend in my book.
