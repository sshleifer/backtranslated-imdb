Angela Lansbury plays Eglantine in middle age in a war broken by England during the First World War. She studies witchcraft by post and secretly teaches her in her house, doing well while the three children who have been separated from their parents since the last air raid have been sent to remain in Angela Lansbury's huge home. She does not like it because of their secrets. They just want to go home. The oldest boy is very difficult to reach with him. The other two boys and girls are just curious about how their new place will stay and the lady who is their hostess. Children learn about their secrets and it is a time when entertainment begins. Fun and more. Family fun. Laughter, disgust, adventure, something for everyone. Special effects are pretty good. These musical melodies are equally catchy to sing later than any other Disney movie. Add this to your family video library. You will not be disappointed.
