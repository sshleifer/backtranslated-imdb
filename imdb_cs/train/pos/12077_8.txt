He was very pleased with the 1945 thriller film about a young woman, Nina Foch (Julia Ross), who does not have a job, and lags behind her rent and is desperately looking for a job. Julia reads her ad in the local London newspaper, looks for a secretary, and tries to get this position. Julia gets a position and is hired by Mrs. Hughes (Dame May Witty) who wants her to live with her employer in her home and wants her to not care about friends, and Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire job to this work. George Macready (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some special stimulus for playing legs. It was a low-budget movie, and most of the scenes were close to avoid background and scenery costs. This strange family lives in a huge mansion on the coast of England in Cornwall and there are secret doors and plenty of tension.
