As a child, I preferred the first Care Care Bear because it seemed so dark. I always sat down and watched first. As I got older, I learned to prefer this. I think this movie is too dark for the kids, but how old does it take you to learn it, because you know it more, it does not sound as dark as you were a child. > <br /> <br /> This movie is, in my opinion, better than the first one, everything is much deeper. This may conflict with the first film, but you have to ignore the first movie you watch. The young are too adorable, I turn the scene "Flying My Colors". I tend to bother with all the singing. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is great! Big hand for Carol and Dean Parks. I love every song in this movie, everything is downloaded and it's all I'm listening to, listening to "Our Beginning", which is now also known as "Recalling". I always preferred this soundtrack first, although I loved Carol Kings in the first Care-A-Lot movie. I think the animation is great, the animations in both movies are fantastic. I was surprised to sit down and watch it about 10 years later and see that the animation for this time was excellent. It was really surprising. <br /> <br /> There are not many backups from other people to say that this movie is great, but it is. I do not think it's weird / weird. I think it's a wonderful movie. Basically, it's a movie about how the bears cared for and defeated Demon, Dark Heart. The end is surprising and again defeats any 'Pok√©mon film' with the Moral Questions of Care Bears. You leave your influence. Again, this film can teach anyone in the age of morality.
