Customizing the book "Fish Search". This story is about the rookie of young sailor Antwon Fisher (Derek Luke) who tells the painful story of his past to psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). Derek Luke's brilliant debut performance and always stunning Denzel Washington's performance. The film was incredible on so many levels, and I was disappointed that it did not win the Oscar, I think it was because it was released in bad time, so it was overlooked. I strongly recommend this film to everyone, you will touch his story and really make it to the audience empathy with this young man who is Antwone Fisher. If you like inspiring true stories, then watch Antwon Fisher. <br /> <br /> Thank you
