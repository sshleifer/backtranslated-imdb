It's such a great movie, "Call me Anna," because it shows how you've been suffering for so long without knowing what's wrong with her. For Patty Duke to come in the public eye and say that her story is an inspiration to those who suffer from this illness. I have great respect for her as a human. The only thing I do not like is that I can not get it on a tape, I tried to look for it, but without success. Who knows how to get it?
