If you're used to see Gabriel Byrne in serious roles such as Tom in Millers Crossing or Keaton in The Usual Suspects, I recommend that you look at this film. Even if you're not a fan of Gabriel Byrne, all the actors in this movie are really doing great performances. If you have about eleven dollars (which is almost nine dollars), I say you order it online or you can rent it from your favorite movie rental. Guaranteed to laugh, whether you usually like gangster movies. Mad Dog Time / Trigger Happy is one of those movies you will never forget and you will find yourself looking again and again. You will talk about it so much that your friends will ask you to borrow it.
