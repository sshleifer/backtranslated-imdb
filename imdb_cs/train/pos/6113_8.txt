After I saw "Marriage with the Mafia," I almost lost my belief in a Korean film business. But this brought my faith back. The main female figure who is a college student must be forced to teach a mature, rich, but charismatic high school student. In fact, the age is female. Through some cheerful quarrels, these two become great friends. I was pleasantly surprised that the newcomer, Kwan, sang Woo, who did his work with ingenuity. It was such a revelation! Actress Kim ha nul was as charming as usual. This film tried to avoid any clich√©s that can be seen in typical romantic comedies. And it did not show us any unnecessary naked sex scenes. It was great, beautiful, fresh, made me want to see it again. <br /> <br />
