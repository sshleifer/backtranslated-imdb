I feel Muslims in the Warners Brothers depression are becoming more important in the years to come. Yes, we are in the economic state (or live under the rock) and times look gloomy. But we always have movies as a way to escape our problems. In the 1930s, the film was very popular even at the height of economic darkness. The "Footlight Parade (1933)" was one of those films that the audience had met. While this musical instrument managed by Lloyd Bacon does not capture social issues like "Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933)", it's still a wonderful talent show. We have to wait until the end of the movie for the three main figures of Busby Berkeley, but boy, it's worth waiting for me. Yes, little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and the actress and her knocking is so, but Busby's magical "Waterfall" attracts her and it seems to be a hundred other girls' choirs, to miraculous water. Of course, Busby's numbers can not really be performed on stage (they absolutely resist the boundaries of gravity for one thing), and they contrast perfectly with the realism of hard, unobtrusive scenes. And "Footlight" also has James Cagney in one of his too small musicals (really, what could not be done by this man?). He even manages to take over from the head man, the navy and dress up the Shanghai Lil sexpot (which is really little Ruby in the Chinese girl's wig!). He works with Joan Blondel, his adorable, adoring secretary, who somehow overlooks Cagney for the benefit of other women (until the final role, that is). Blondell seemed to be the only woman Cagney loved from her wife. And you see mutual adoration in every scene.
