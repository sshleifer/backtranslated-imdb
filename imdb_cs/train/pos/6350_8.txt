I waited and waited until the movie came out, the trailers seemed long years, it was worth it. I'm not a big fan of watching movies over and over, but I can not wait for it to come for everyone to buy! He is not a big fan of Jim, but it suits him perfectly, it's so much to be seen and "good feeling" is out of balance, perfect for Christmas. I think Ron did a great job and turned it into a movie. If you have not seen it, do it if you have, watch it again, I know you want it!
