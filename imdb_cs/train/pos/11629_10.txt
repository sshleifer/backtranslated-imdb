Red Eye is an exciting film by creator Freddy Kreuger Wes Craven. Wes Craven depicts the story of an ordinary hotel worker, Lisa. After completing his grandmother's funeral, he decides to go with the red eye. While waiting, he meets this man named Jack Rippner (how is it fffrreeaakkyy?) And they become friends. Ironically, they both sit right next to each other in this plane. Then it's when horror begins. This movie is exciting, and for the faint hearted people who do not like exciting / horror films, say it's possible they could peek out in their pants. This is an excellent example of bone shaking. Wes Craven took good care of this film. He chose the right actors, like Rachel McAdams, an intelligent, sexy girl who knows what she's doing, and she's careful when playing in the movie. Cillian Murphy, a spooky and frightening actor who can calm your bones in his amazing acting as a bad character in this movie, and his face can really expand his eyes. Wes Craven did a great job, and I hope he made other movies like this one.
