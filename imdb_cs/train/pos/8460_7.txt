Gundam Wing is a fun show. I appreciate it for getting me into Gundam and anime in general. However, after watching their predecessors, such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam, and even G Gundam, I find Wing behind Gundam Lite. Characters: Gundam is a long aspect to get your characters into trouble and mature. It will not happen in Wing. Heero is the top dog at the beginning and the top dog is at the end. Personality does not change, growth is never reached. The best character is Zechs, who is a heroine for most of the purposes and purposes for most of the series. But suddenly the series betrays him and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason. Mecha: Wing has great suit designs. Gundams are super cool, with the fact that Epyon is my favorite. I even keep in mind that some of the OZ suits are at the same level as classic Zeon suits. But sweet suits do not match a series of boring characters. Conclusion: In the end, Wing has cool combat scenes, although they are full of recycled animations, but shallow fence and character development. Comfortable but not moving as previous trips to Gundam.
