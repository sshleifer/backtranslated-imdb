ROLL is a wonderful little movie. Toby Malone plays an 18-year-old child (by the way, very well acting) who is in football. Malone's cousin takes him in the night before his big adventure game with many twists and turns that include two gyms, a drug, some heavy bikers, some cops and some prostitutes ... and the movie lets us guess how characters are on which side of the law , what is the content of the gym, and what gender is a key biker. Parts of that reminded me of LOCK STOCK and two smoking drums. <br /> <br /> For me, ROLL reinforced three views I had already held before I saw ROLL. These views are: 1. I really want to visit Australia one day. The lands and cities are beautiful and look like such a cool holiday spot. <br /> <br /> 2. Some of the best filmmakers are Australian. ROLL's cinematography was particularly impressive. I loved stylized colors and lighting in many scenes. <br /> <br /> 3. Australian women are HOT!
