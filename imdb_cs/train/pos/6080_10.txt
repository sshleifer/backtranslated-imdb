Othello, Shakespeare's classic story of love, betrayal, lies and tragedy. I remember studying this story in high school, actually, I found Othella probably my favorite story of Shakespeare because of how fascinating it is that Shakespeare perfectly captured the feeling of friendship, love and racism. I mean, if you really study this story, you can go into so many philosophies about why Othello went mad with jealousy in the flash of his eye. But later on, I also watched this version of Othello for my report and I must say that it was absolutely brilliant. Lawerance and Kenneth just capture the story so well and understand its darkness. Othello is a great soldier in his city, loved by everyone, including the king. But when the king discovers that Othello and his daughter, Desdemona, have escaped, the king is furious, but besides. Othello is welcomed in the city and his best friend is Cassio, his side man instead of Iago, who stood at Othello. Because of his mad jealousy he is revenge. Still pretending to be Othello's best friend, he just suggests Othello that Desdemona cheats him with Cassius, he never says they are, just makes Othello think it's happening. Othello is driven by a madman and has no desirable plans for Desdemon or Cassia, and Iago is more than happy to help him. <br /> <br /> Othello is an incredible story, I highly recommend you to read it. It's an incredible story that thinks you after reading it. Othello's movie is great too, and I recommend it again, captured the story perfectly and has a great tearjerker feeling, or you could only be in full shock of what is going on between Othello and Desdemona how quickly he believes his true love would betray him. It's an amazing movie, great acting, good set-up and good direction, that's what Shakespeare meant when he wrote the story. <br /> <br />
