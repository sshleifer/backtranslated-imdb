At War, Inc., we are finding a logical expansion of the current outsourcing of all war-related activities we currently do in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you are familiar with Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root and Blackwater abroad, you are halfway home to fully appreciate the satire of Cusack's latest work. Cusack plays corporate hit-man Brand Hauser, who finds himself in Turiquistan and organizes a fair at his newly liberated state fair while waiting for access to his latest goal. While appearing to be concerned with Marisa Tomei's filming reporter, which is aimed at an exaggerated sex star star played by Hilary Duff. We introduced Hauser's past, which included a tragedy that had persecuted him since then, and the corporate assistant named Mars Dillon, who actually operated the entire operation for him (and Joan Cusack played cheerfully). While some moments are playing well over the top, it's not always the moments you expect, and little punches will often surprise you. All directors turn to solid performance. Duff's accent comes and goes, but he does a very decent job and goes a long way to dispersing Disney's picture. Tomei is funny but understated, while Cusack is virtually every scene in which they are. To be fair, they got good material. Writers have come up with a lot of twists and questions and visual gags in a good script to giggle you all the time to the foreseeable conclusion. In fact, the predictability of the end is the only thing that keeps me from evaluating it higher when the story changes and changes its way to the expected conclusion. If you like your comedy as broad and physical, it's probably not enough to get your whole movie interested. On the other hand, if you love a comedy comedy and a wide satire, it's for you.
