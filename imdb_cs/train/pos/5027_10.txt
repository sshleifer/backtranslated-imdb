I gave this movie ten, because it had to be rewarded for its spooky elements and actors and my god got involved! The point is, I do not want anyone to say anything about acting or story because it destroys the movie. But I suggest that you get to the nearest moviestore right now and rent it! (Do not forget popcorn!)
