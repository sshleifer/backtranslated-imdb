This is a movie for those who believe that cinema is the seventh art, not entertainment. Lars von Trier creates the new atmosphere of post-war Germany, which is totally charming. You will meet in a dream and you will only leave at the end of the credits. This plot is necessarily the second, but it is still a thrilling story with difficult problems. Just great.
