The Footlight Parade is one of the best musical comedies of the 1930s. A clever screenplay and feature cast, including Jimmy Cagney, beautiful Joan Blondell, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler, make this picture above the rest. Directed and choreographed by creative genius Busby Berkeley, this movie will have a grin from ear to ear from scratch. Busby is undoubtedly the undisputed master of the Hollywood musical with "Gold Diggers from 1933" and "42nd Street" for his credit (as a dance director). The backlighting is decorated with hundreds of slightly dressed choir girls, Berkeley trademarks. The developed dance figures were shot with only one camera, and Busby was the first director of the film's detail of dancers. His obsession with distinctive legs and "back" shots is sufficiently demonstrated here. The overall effect is highly erotic and fascinating. Our boy Jimmy Cagney plays Chester Kent, a producer of "prologues" or short musical stage productions that were introduced at the cinema to entertain audiences previously displayed. She is surrounded by crooked partners, a corporate spy and a girlfriend who digs gold. Although Cagney had a solid background in vaudeville, it was the first film in which he showed his dancing talent. Joan Blondell is memorable as Cagney's wise strident secretary. And Ruby Keeler is adorable, as always. The film culminates in three outstanding production figures: "Honeymoon Hotel", "Waterfall" and "Shanghai Lil", each of which is a masterpiece and is unlikely to be duplicated in today's Hollywood, where so-called "special effects" have replaced creative cinematography. Claudia's Bottom Line: Clever and erotic, with some of the best musical production numbers ever to be celluloid. Totally pleasant depression.
