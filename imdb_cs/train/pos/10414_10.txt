I first discovered the fantasy of Alexander Kordu (1940), The Thief of BAGDAD in the early 1950s for a re-release called "The Wonder Show of the Century!" Both Korda Technicolor, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD and JUNGLE BOOK have been shown on a never-to-forgettable program. Music Miklósa Rozše improved both films. Technicolor in each of them was incredibly beautiful! The BAGDAD CASTLE remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made. As it passed, it was more difficult to enjoy the color of the film in the way it was originally presented. True Technology Technicolor stepped down the Eastman Color process in the mid-1950s. Both the cinema and Samuel Goldwyn made the film both theatrical and video again. However, Eastman Color prints were more pastel-like natural features and suppressed the vibration of the original Technicolor. The laser edition of this title also has a pastel look - nice, but not as it should be. Now comes the release of the M-G-M DVD (December 3, 2002). CHAPTER BAGDAD once again has a beautiful Technicolor that looks at it on a DVD that is nothing but STUNNING !!! It was so exciting that I once again realized that when I once viewed the DVD, I saw it a second time. The only "Extras" are the Spanish dubbed version, the subtitles in English and Spanish and the beautifully made original theatrical trailer. Thank you M-G-M for this extraordinary DVD release. Now you can only hope that KORDA FOUR FEATHERS and the restored version of KORDOVY JUNGLE BOOK (to replace the poor public press in circulation) will soon be followed by DVDs.
