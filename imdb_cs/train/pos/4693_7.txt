Johnny Dangerously falls completely into the hit or miss category with his bloody gags and the complete lack of a comprehensive script or story that makes ANY sense. But that's why, right? <br /> <br /> The cast is sympathetic; Michael Keaton was an excellent comic book before he took too seriously this year. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito are all enthusiastic and at least laughing at me. But the complete screenplay is Richard Dimitri (the blending of the word "Iceholes" into the history of the film) as the gangster best suited to murdering the English language. I attach a lot of children's memories to this movie. I've been watching it quite often, so maybe I'm prone to enjoy it more than many others. Johnny Dangerous is at least a completely innocent gangster film spoof who even transmits some meaningful reports of the dangers of smoking (and sex). I like it, but it's hard to recommend it. <br /> <b> 7 of 10.
