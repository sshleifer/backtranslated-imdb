When listening to a sound book, Cambpell Scott is a reader. I was so excited to hear his voice and it made me disappointed that the "six degrees" had been canceled. They seem to never keep a good show in the air long enough to capture an audience that can relate to the story. What a shame and disgrace in the network for not doing that would mean it would be a full season. It was a great show with great occupancy. The network gave "Men in Trees" the second chance of the witch is also a great show, but they took the "Invasion" away and it was also something completely different to watch, not the same old-same old themes. Why networks do not have the right.
