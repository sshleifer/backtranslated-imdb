Franco again proves to be the prince of surrealistic and erotic cinematography. It is true that most of his work can be considered a fun tangle, but with Succubus (Necronomicon) he shows what he really is capable of when he lets his distracted creativity run off riots and gives us a film that is both hypnotic and mysterious eroticism is real in his work. Jerry Van Rooyen is a great score of pulsates as a spectator throws them from one bizarre scenario to another as we watch the attempts of a stripper artist (Reynaud) who can be schizophrenic or can really (as one mysterious character states) to be a devil, trying to cope with the world in which he lives. A beautiful and mysterious cinema recommended to all who are even interested in an alternative cinema.
