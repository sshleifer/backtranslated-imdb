I saw this premiere on Friday (1/19) evening at Park City for Sundance and was incredibly moved. Sitting in the theater and listening to the hostages that are passing through are almost more than I could have known. Others in the audience were equally impatient, and while we wanted to turn away, it could only be a testimony because these men and women shared our experience with us. Robert Acosta, Paul Rieckhoff, Sean Huze and Herold Noel, all war veterans in Iraq and the film were present. While they can be at home now, you can say that this war is still inside and probably will always be. Whether you support the war or not, it is our duty to support units with something other than a bumper sticker. Watch this movie!
