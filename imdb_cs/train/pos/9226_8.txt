I have read about THE HERETIC FLAVIA for many years, but I only saw it at the beginning of last year when I went to the crazy movie I bought, and for whatever reason I thought it lately, even though that's been a few months what I watched. <br /> <br /> This is a striking film, located in Italy somewhere around the 15th century. Certainly the Middle Ages (although I do not think that any particular year was ever given). This is the time of Christian ascension, age is a time of complete insanity, and the film captures it very well. <br /> <br /> Flavia, our protagonist, is a young lady who meets a fallen Muslim on the battlefield. She seems to be a warm and interesting guy and she takes them right away with her. Her father, a soldier from a family, comes almost instantly and murders a wounded man right in front of her eyes. But she will still see him in his dreams. Her father took her to a monastery, which looks more like a mad crazy asylum - the inhabitants who so hard suppressed the intolerable medieval Christianity, slowly go crazy. Flavia gets under the influence of one of the most beautiful nuns. But in the crazy world they are just real fools, and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the madness around her. She takes her while she lives, and strikes with Flavius, who is young and seemingly protected, begins to question everything about the world in which she finds herself trapped. The film is inconceivable in its portrait of this world, posing a lot of inconvenience. We see the horse rolling, the sovereign raped one of his women in a blind alley, the pious torture of a young nun. Through it all, Flavia watches and challenges, and eventually rejects the Christian dogma that makes such a show of horror in the sense that the film has received some criticism over the years as seemingly anachronistic. I do not share this criticism. Flavia's views, though sometimes expressed in ways that rarely reflect the then feminist commentary (the film originated in 1974), revolve around what are quite obvious questions. Perhaps it's hard to believe that there might be a lot of fish in the water at the time, but it's such a small point that can not be done. Flavia is written in such a way as to allow people from our era or from any era to concentrate on their situation. Capturing this matter would lack the forest for trees. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Smitten almost instantly allows him to practice his army virtually, becoming Joan of Ark in full combat equipment, and to direct the invaders to suppress Christian society and avenge revenge on all those who have seen them commit evil. /> <br /> Is it a testimony of a new and better world? Maybe they think so, but also the Muslims of that time were not feminist because they will soon learn hard. As they say, meet a new boss ... <br /> <br /> This is really just a preview of some things happening in THE HERETIC FLAVII. The film is quite gloomy and has a very slight, somewhat depressive ending. It was not a mass audience at all. It is quite good and does not belong to a pile of "nunploitation", which is often unwise to throw. I think the final movie is very useful and I'm glad I saw it.
