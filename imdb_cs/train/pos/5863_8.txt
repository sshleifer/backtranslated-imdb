Even 15 years after the end of the Vietnam War, "Jacknife" did not arrive too late or was even superfluous. It is one of the few that is trying to deal with the second sad side of the war. Various films, such as "Taxi Driver" or "Rambo", which represent their main characters as broken heroes in the aftermath of the war, allow the audience to face another view of Vietnamese veterinarians. Their development is shown very precisely before and especially after the war. Problems are obvious, but in all these tragic, there is always a sense of hope based on love and friendship. "Jacknife" may be the darkest Vietnamese film, but after almost 15 years it's really credible and therefore justified. In addition, he can believe that the war has not yet ended; at least for some of us. <br /> <br /> The three main characters are awesome. De Niro did one of his best works, but Ed Harris is the star of this film. Maybe it was his best performance ever.
