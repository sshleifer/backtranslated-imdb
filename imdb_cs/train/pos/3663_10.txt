Perhaps the last movie you would expect from Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavattini (who wrote the novel on which this film is based). It's a neo-realistic fantasy, like an oxymoron, really. An old woman finds a baby in a cabbage and raises it as her son. After several years, the child is a young boy (Toto) and an adoptive mother dies. He goes to the orphanage, and when he is 18, he leaves. He immediately finds out that he does not have a home. But this is optimistic and will not allow anything to get him. The man steals his pool and instead of being angry with him, Tom becomes his friend and goes and stays with him in a small shonytown. This takes a certain initiative and organizes many homeless people living in the area and builds better slums. Soon the landlord is trying to sell this land, and the citizens of the poor neighborhood must protect themselves. After many attempts, the owner builds the force of the police to get rid of the homeless. At this point, the film becomes a full-fledged fantasy (before it was more of a comedy / fantastic melodrama in the style of Charlie Chaplin). This thing is so strange and shocking that it is probably best for others to see it for themselves. It's quite amazing and very fun. There are objections that you might raise in connection with the miracle happening in Milan, of course. Fellini and Visconti were greatly criticized as they began to rely on neorealism. I think I read it was widely criticized at the time of its release. At this point it's so nice - I loved it very much. This could be my favorite films Vittoria de Sica, although Umberto D and The Bicycle Thieves are very, very close. 10/10.
