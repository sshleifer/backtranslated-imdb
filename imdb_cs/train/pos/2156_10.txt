This film is one of my favorite foreign films, some of them Amilee and My Life as a Dog. The similarities with these films, as well as many great foreign movies, are that it takes a secular piece of life and transforms it into a deep heart lesson. <br /> <br /> In Japan, a man who is bored with his worldly life and ghostly marital life, sees a beautiful Japanese woman staring out of the dance studio window. The moment his train endures, she is enchanted by her. But is it only her beauty, remote view or union that they both discover they share? <br /> <br /> Shall We Dance has unforgettable fabulous characters that have to deal with painful facts by overcoming them across the dance world. Breaking traditional forms and stereo types of Japanese companies risk everything for luck and find that joy is not too far away. It is one of those films that is so magical and meaningful and in itself transcends the secular art by showing real magic and a miracle that can be life.
