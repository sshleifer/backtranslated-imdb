Theo Robertson noted that the WAW did not sufficiently include conditions after the First World War that led to the rise of Hitler and the Second World War. Perhaps he missed the first ONE and a quarter of HOUR 8. He covers this period and, together with the earlier volumes in the series, clearly shows the existing conditions, I feel. My boyfriend grew up in Germany during this period, even joining Hitler's youth, and his experiences were very similar to the ones in the WAW. This document is so far beyond Document History of the Channel History. owns that there is no comparison. The only bug, and it's small, that I have with WAW is this: numbers are not included, many times. For example, if you are talking about renting, how much military equipment was lent / leased? How much to Russia, how much to Britian? How many merchant ships made the U-Boats sink and when? How many ships did the German or Japanese Navy have in total in 1941? What type were they? How many soldiers? How many soldiers had allies total and by country? Lots of numbers could make many audiences nod, but I would prefer more! And of course, I always want to see more military analyzes. Just as why did not Patton & Clark capture the German army that was at Cassini after they surrounded her, instead of moving Monty to Rome and letting him escape? I do not think you can begin to understand the war until you see some of these segments of the "general war" video, such as the Dresden fire bomber. It's like trying to understand Auschwitz, etc. Before you see the clips of death camps: you just can not wrap your head around it - it's too incredible. <br /> <br /> Unknown at that time, and of course unfiltered, were the most dangerous cruelties and inhumane populations of Japan, including cannibalism (read "Flyboys") and some LIVE vivisections of medical "experimental" prisoners without any anesthetic! <br /> <br /> Dave
