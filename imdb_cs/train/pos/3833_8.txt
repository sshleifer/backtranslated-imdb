I can not believe that others have so seriously realized this. God, it was a very fun rooting for Hop-a-long Cassidy. It was a big hold on the western series years ago. It was not a great movie experience, except that it was. So what if there was not a big bonanza of special effects. It was fun, tongue on the face, look at the old west. Man, rest and enjoy yourself.
