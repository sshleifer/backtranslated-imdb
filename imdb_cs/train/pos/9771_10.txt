Distinctive and innovative! At the beginning of this critically underestimated Whoopi Goldberg film, writers draw a parallel between Theodore Rex and classic Ornes Welles "Citizen Kane" in 1941. Writers are allowed to draw such a seemingly disparate parallel, but the audience is too often abandoned to see the overly inviting Hollywood block, to appreciate the subtle similarities between the two films. In "Citizen Kane," Charles Foster Kane fears and admires his colleagues and his subordinates, like Whoopi Goldberg in this film. This film is about finding love in the differences of all. It is an epic exploration of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society that is dominated by greed and self-reliance. Whoever coined Whoopi Goldberg and Theodore Rex formulated a dyke for ages, Bogey and Bacall, Hepburn and Tracy and Hall and Oates are the only legitimate comparators. If you would like to watch the lofty, celluloid philosophical examination of some of the deepest human stories; Bergman-esqe, but not so depressing, Theodore Rex should be immediately seen!
