I'm addicted to how ABC may have been licensed for this Pearl TV exhibition in Hong Kong. I was going to surprise it because it was a break from Chinese listening. But I started to lean because cast and story lines are just NYC enough and thoughtful. Nothing unbelievable, though I think it's very stereotypical when I write Damien as a potential black man with a sheet metal !!!! This was the most disappointed aspect. The rest is great and I find it sad to learn that I can not look forward to Season 2 when I return to the US. I'm as disappointed as other commentators that it has shown a lot of promise, quality and taste. But just as it shows that the figures are showing closer, it's probably harder for people to watch if they've been watching several episodes. Which is probably a little too late for an eager network to happen.
