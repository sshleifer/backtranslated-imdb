When tradition dictates that the artist has to hand over his heritage of magnificent skills and charm, an aging and very proud street artist known to all as the "King Mask" becomes desperate for a young disciple to learn and cultivate. His warmth and humanity will find him to pay a few dollars for a small man displaced by the devastating natural disasters in China, in this case a massive flood in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> He takes his new seven-year-old companion to his straw hat to live with his valuable and beautiful monkey "General" just to find out that the child is the child. life is instantly transformed because the love it feels for this little slave girl becomes intertwined in a stupid tradition that requires it to pass on its art to a young man only. There are many stories in this area ... many people are touching and China's culture opens for our Western eyes. Thousands of years of heritage returns to the tea track and few of them leave this dry eye DVD. Technical transmission itself is not so great because I found sound levels across the world meter and actually see the video transmission lines in several parts of the film. Highly recommended :-) 9/10 stars.
