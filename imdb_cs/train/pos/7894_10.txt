It's a great show and you will be screaming, this group of people really loved oneself in real life and shows it over and over again. Send me an email and let me know. I was in Australia and they really talk like this. I want you to enjoy Five Mile Creek and give these wonderful stories about correctness and misinformation and friendship with your children. I have all 40 episodes on DVD-R that I have collected over the past 5 years. Check out my Five Mile Creek hold at www.mikeandvicki.com and hear extended theme music. Talk about them. <br /> <br /> These people are so cool!
