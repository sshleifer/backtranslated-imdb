I saw this movie back in 1984, we first started watching "It's a spinal tap" and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep. So instead of watching this movie. If you have a conspiracy theory in mind, you will want to look at this. <br /> <br /> The question you have to ask when watching this movie is: Do you think the government could do it? (In my opinion there is no doubt that they could) <br /> <br /> But I do not want to give too much information because it would be a spoiler and I think you should see the film for yourself. <br /> <br /> But to inform you, we're still talking about this movie 20 years later and trying to explain it to people is not the simplest thing in the world.
