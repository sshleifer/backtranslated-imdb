I saw the movie that was criticized by the words: "If you can get moralizing ..." It lacks sense. Moralization is in the conscience of the observer as it was. It's a decent movie with a standard murder mystery, but with a sharp twist that lies in the middle. The resolution lets the viewer think, "What would I do in this position?" And I have to believe it's exactly what the filmmaker intended. To this end, and to the end of the entertaining audience, the film succeeds. I also like the fact that violence is never on the stage but just out of the camera. We know what has just happened; it just did not listen to us, then shuddered in our faces as if it were today with the blood and the dress. Besides, violence is no reason. It is the moral dilemma of a protagonist who is clever, though worry-free.
