The film I'm about to review is a small television film from 1996 starring Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin. Main protagonist / antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical American teenager who feels he has such a controlling father (Baldwin). However, when he meets a former horse named Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan "Never Killed"), they instantly "fall" on themselves, but Jennifer has a different idea of ​​where to take his relationship. she manipulates him to kill her parents to protect their "love", but she just used it to get rid of her parents to be with Brad (David Lascher the future "Sabrina" judge for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart actually actually surprised me as a evil manipulator, and she carries the film well with her friends and Nick to literally escape the murder. The rest of the supporting cast iron works well and each of them keeps their own when they have time on the screen. I also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year, Hart began portraying Sabrina, Teenage Witch, and it shows that he can act in my genres of film and television. Although the movie is a bit far from it, it looks like some of her best work that includes drama or thriller and I look forward to the 'Nine Dead' that comes out in November because it shows that she can see like other people who are not called "Clarissa Darling" or Sabrina Spellman "I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Melisy Joan Hart or Sabrina. You can watch it on the Internet so I suggest you look at it.
