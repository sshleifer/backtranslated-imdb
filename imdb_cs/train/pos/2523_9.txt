When I first heard of Moon the Child, I thought it was a joke. After a few months I thought it was real. Several reviews I've read that DO NOT HAPPEN to fangers are not very promising. When I was given the opportunity to watch it, I was totally ready to run, twist and otherwise have to close my eyes to avoid stupidity. <br /> <br /> I was more than a little surprised and in a good sense. Yes, the Moon Child has its moments of cheese, camp and general dorkiness - I think it's impossible to avoid when it comes to Gackt Camui, a man who is not known for his mental health - but that was all very pleasant. the work of genius, but it is very, very honest, entertaining, with entertaining choreography, touch score and fun cast. I know very little Japanese film, so I can not really judge acting, but given that acting speaks a language or an extreme dialect that is alien to it at one time or another and that some of them have almost no acting experience, I was quite impressed. <br /> <br /> If you can enjoy a good action movie, a good track, a good comedy, check out this movie. At least you rent it from when it comes to area 1. <br /> <br /> The side note is in this film zero homosexual / homoerotic content. I did not see too much of a subtext. Do not let people who read too many things to destroy you.
