The sixties. There were interesting films there. I was more like a filmmaker. Now I like to borrow movies and relax in my house before I go to the theater. I also saw this short film "The Legend of Boys and Eagles". I've been looking for this movie for years. It was really inspirational. Surprisingly, I finally got more information from your site. Thank you ........ I am surprised that this short film was the opening of Disney's picture. I also did not remember Disney movie. I did not even remember that it was the first Disney movie. I really want to show it on TV sometimes. I wonder if Disey has the rights to this movie? Is it available on DVD? This is to be seen for all generations!
