* First of all, although many say it is the worst of the series, I do not think it is true, since this ideally reflects the mental mentality of the 21st century. It brings perfect opportunities to make you feel and remind you of a good teenager when you enjoy the same fun as the characters. <br /> <br /> * I agree with the fact that it is a teenage film, but comedy films are not meant for teenagers today? ... cinemas are mostly a place for teenagers; plus, see such a movie during sleep or something like that is very good for very good time. <br /> <br /> * Many commentaries on the amount of nudity in this movie. Well ... Let's try it ... does not it mean that it reflects the teens' thoughts like those in the movie? what would you like to see ... smart books, romantic things? it is not at all what would be in the minds of those teenagers ... In the end I think if you are a teenager, you must absolutely see the movie and even if you are a really grown man or woman you have you would see it if you still have a teen mind or you often think it was a teenager or such things. Thank you for reading!
