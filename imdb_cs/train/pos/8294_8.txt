This movie has great fighting scenes. Now it's true that acting is a little rough. But if I wanted to see a film based on acting skills, I would watch movies with a similar name like Like American Beauty. But if you want to see a movie with real artistic combat items and amazing bits without the use of wire and flying, they blow the air like so many films around that are now killing the matrix. Then watch it. Now it is true that the two main stars on the show where the boy show the powerful rangers and the next cast member of this show has a bit of part in this movie. But hey fight scenes are enough to put Jet Li in his pants. And the pieces are good for Jackie Chan to sit down and admire.
