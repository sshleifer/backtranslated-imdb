Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is a long-lasting online fan movie, completely crafted for the love of the show, and has to watch Trek fans. Production quality is extremely high for fan movie, although sometimes you can say they are green. However, this does not eliminate the overall experience. CGI boats are fantastic as well as space battles ... For negative reasons, I could tell in earlier episodes (and even occasionally in newer ones) that some actors / actresses are not in their role, but again it does not eliminate the overall experience with new Star interpretations Trek. Cast and the crew really came up with something special and as a whole I would highly recommend this series to fans of The Next Generation and Deep Space 9.
