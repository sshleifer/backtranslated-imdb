Unlike many other movies that are disturbing either their naked unpleasantness (Human Dog) or their total violence (most of the Peckinpah movies), Deliverance is shocked by its credibility. Of course, the stroller scene is quite unpleasant in its inconvenience, but the effect of the film comes much more from its slow creation and tangible sense of isolation around four guides, both before and after everything has gone wrong. The moment the canoe passes under a child on a bridge that does not even recognize men with whom he has previously played music, let alone show some character of human affection, he is one of the most important in modern film. The tension is steadily rising during a canoe trip and persists even after the final credit - the end causes the character of the characters to be very real. The suitability of the film is greatly enhanced by the acting of directors, especially Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as a victim and reluctant hero, respectively. Burt Reynolds has never been better. The cultural influence of the film is evidenced by a number of people who understand the link to "banjo territory" - perhaps Get Carter has become so effective in the regional tourism industry. I can only think of a handful of films that have been brought to me in such a serious depression after finishing - the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I think. Although so much of this is excellent in itself, Deliverance is a classic, especially because there are no adequate benchmarks with it - it's unique.
