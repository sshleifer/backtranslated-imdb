Version: Universal / Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD release. Canton / English subtitles <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, five years ago, the world was obsessed with the "Matrix" and I was perhaps one of those fifties who still believed that "Terminator" was better than "Matrix". I was just an ordinary teenage boy looking for a good action movie, and then light came on a TV station I never saw, a small station known as SBS. One night in the TV Guide, I noticed that Jackie Chan's "Police Story" movie will be later. He was thirty-five years old and when I saw only "Rumble in the Bronx" and "Rush Hour," I said "WOW AWESOME," and sat down to look at him and shout "WOW AWESOME." Two weeks later, after SBS showed the Police Story trilogy, I knew I'd found my new favorite actor. Jackie plays Chan Ka Kui, a Hong Kong cop who is defying a major drug lord, Chu (Yuen Chor). Chuo's secretary, Selina Fong (Brigitte Lin), is the police held as a witness against Chu and Chan to protect her. Things are bad - it's bad - when Chu's case is rejected and he decides that Fong and Chan want dead. "Police Story" is one of the biggest action movies ever and certainly one of my favorite Jackie Chan movies. It starts so strongly and ends with one of the most incredible action sequences ever shot. Everything between them is great. However, some of the funny part may seem a bit tasteless for more than a few people ... As a story it's still one of Jackie's better efforts. For the action movie, the story is quite good, and Jackie is a much better actor in this than in the acting and fence intensive "New Police Story". It's not a miracle, but maybe it's a good thing. The police story is one of Jackie's best works. He got me addicted to Jackie Chan movies and should offer me a nice start for all potential Jackie fans. The bad news for anyone who sees it first is that Jackie Chan's movies are not coming much better - 10/10
