An outstanding film from 1943 with Paul Lukas, who made an Oscar's calibrated performance as the head of his family bringing them back to America from Europe, while the Nazi threat deepened. The usual brilliant Bette Davis maintains her reputation here and was not nominated for the best actress for this or a 1943 film for change. Lukas is about to make a betrayal of this situation. He knows he must return to Europe to return to the secret mission and return. Davis pulls out all the stops with Katharine Hepburn again, like he has to divide. Resolute, knows that her older son must follow him on his way to freedom. A fabulous film that highlights American positive propaganda against a malevolent enemy.
