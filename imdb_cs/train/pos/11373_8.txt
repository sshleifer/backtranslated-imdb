Here's a strange thing: a modern serial killer movie that has no fighting scenes, no one saw dying, no car chases, no loud sounds ... and it's happening in Russia. There are only two short action scenes, but they are terrible. The rest of the story is detective work and how much bureaucracy the poor detective had to go through to solve the murders. This is a very dark film and "dark" best describes the personality of the hero (Stephen Rea). Still, the story is not depressive and it's very interesting all the way. Rea is excellent as a decisive, harried-looking detective. Jeffrey DeMunn is a terrible killer. Donald Sutherland's Russian accent is suspicious, but he plays only one character in this film with a bit of warmth. The story is interrupted by liberal agendas again and again, without being two references to homosexual prejudices, the overall validity of secular psychology, police officers and government officials are outraged / raw / fanatics, yadda, yadda, yadda. <br /> <br /> Otherwise it is an intelligent and refreshing low key crime film. This is a somewhat unique movie that is probably not well known, but people who have seen it like it well. Because it is based on the real life of this murderer, it is even colder. Do not let it just because you have nothing.
