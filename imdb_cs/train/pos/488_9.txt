Part of the entertainment I got from this film came from the fact that I knew nothing about him except playing John Turturra and Emily Watson (two reasons to be supervised) was part of the season and chess. Everything that developed before me was completely unexpected. That's why I will not give much more. Suffice it to say that Turturro is spectacular as an eccentric, obsessed, and profoundly vulnerable chess genius, and Em approaches him step by step as a strong woman who is attracted to him. It is about love and obsession, rather than about the worshiped table game, and after being overwhelmed over the first half hour, it became absolutely convincing. And I do not mind somebody who is arguing about the end.
