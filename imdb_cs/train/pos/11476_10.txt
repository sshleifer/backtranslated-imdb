Zero Day is based on a massacre at a Colombian high school. and his video of two boys. at first you do not know what's going on, you think it's just a bad student movie. when they start talking about the terrible things they are going to do in this ultimate school. when they talk about bombs and guns and shoot them in the woods. There's a lot of talk about this movie. you all know that this movie is also a movie that you forget to watch the movie and watch the real video two boys. Two boys behave like a strange cult. he burns all the things there. as a play station game book dvds homework school stuff. these two boys can be someone your friends, brothers or people who will see you walking down the street. there are daily activists (and it makes a gun.) in videos that say it concerns the bullying that has happened to them and how people have said things about the clothes and things that you do not say their right but many people do they do that. <br /> <br /> It is also with these people who suspect they like it because of the sensitive topic they have chosen for this film. <br /> <br /> So this is my review on a zero day. <br /> <br /> And let's just say that the end of the scene is wrong.
