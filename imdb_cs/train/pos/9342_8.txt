Strongly beautiful film. You are held in death when you let yourself get involved in the story. Successful dentist, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), is torn in the life crisis of balancing his career with his family. He watches his former colleague Charlie Finemann (Adam Sandler) and wants to touch the base. He found that Charlie, who lost his wife and family in an attack on America in 9-11, is no longer in touch with reality ... to choose to involve his mind in his favorite past and video games. Former roommates recount their friendship and strengthen their former bond. Johnson has his friend Angela Oakhurts (psychology Liv Tyler) to try to bring Charlie out of his grief ... but Alan is trying to get his friend out of his deep darkness. Jada Pinkett Smith plays Johnson's wife. Writer and director Mike Binder plays the role of Charlie's lawyer / guardian. Also in cast: Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Adell Modell and Robert Klein. Excellent soundtrack with Bruce Springsteen, Graham Nash, Pear Jam and The Pretenders. <br /> <br /> Note: I have never been a fan of Sandler; but in this role I found him excellent. In some scenes, I was thinking aloud ... why never told me to play singer / songwriter Bob Dylan in biopic.
