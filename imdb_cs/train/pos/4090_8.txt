This movie is simply unbelievable! I've been expecting something completely different from the movies I've actually seen. He is, however, very grateful that he shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its link to the behavior of animals. Allow me to warn readers of this article who are easily offended by content that is too sexual, because the explicit sexual nature of this film feels like the tip of a pornographic species. It is even equipped with a scene that is very close to rape. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I strongly suggest to see this rare work of "sexual art." Every minute of the picture breathes the sexual spirit of the seventies, by the way. We should not forget how times have changed! <br /> <br /> Go to it! It's worth the money and time!
