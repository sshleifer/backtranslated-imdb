It was the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was also the best movie. Sci Fi original movies are supposed to be bad, that's what makes them fun! The line "I like my dinosaur meat well done!" is probably the best quote at all! Also, the conspiracy sounds like something from a pot-driven dream. I can imagine it now, the writers woke up after a long night when they got up and played the dancing dance revolution, and then they came together with ideas: The Navy came to a strange planet that is infested with dinosaurs and has medieval houses to protect the scientific the team studying the planet. Best idea! In fact, it fits into the complete Sci Fi movie the original list: Dinosaur weapons Medieval times Space travel Terrible talk <br /> <br /> So go watch this movie but do not buy it.
