I did not read the novel, although I understand it is somewhat different from that; the fact that I enjoyed it, along with the fact that it is not really my genre, leads me to the decision not to try to read a book. When I did not read one word of Austen's writing, I really can not compare it to any of her works. I can say that almost every line of dialogue in this is smart, funny and well delivered, as well as the greatest source of comedy in this one. It made me very laughing out loud, perfect British and verbal material. Every performance is spot-on, and Paltrow has completely nailed the role of the matchmaker. Characters are well written, credible and consistent. Some of them, however, are extremely irritating, and although I think at least some of them should be fun, it has tended to repeat overly, and sincerely it was not funny for the first time that they appeared. Cutting and cinematography are amazing and everything looks absolutely amazing. The story and the step are great, you never get bored. It will * end * in a * obvious way, but maybe that's what the audience prefers. I can not say that it did not kill me, from start to finish, and I would watch it again. This is a short language. I recommend it to every fan of romantic stories. 7/10
