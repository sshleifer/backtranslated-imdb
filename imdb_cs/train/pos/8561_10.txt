When two writers create a scenario for the horror version of Tiffany Breakfast, you know something will be fine. Drew Barrymore, Patrick Highsmith, Leslie Hope and Sally Kellerman are great actors. The FBI agent was a terrible actor. The scenes where Patrick looked Holly up and down like some objectivist were strange. Drew Barrymore is very hot. Intimate aliens, where Sally Kellerman worked, were a great part. The strange rubbery worm was just strange. Nathan was a very nice cat. But what was that scene where Patrick followed Holly into the cave and Mr. Gooding attacked him? And a scene with Dr. Wallace? What does he do there? And not every man has a woman, as Sally Kellerman said. And when Patrick and Elizabeth saw Drew outside Victor, it was weird.
