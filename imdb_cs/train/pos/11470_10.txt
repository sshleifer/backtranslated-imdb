Everyone knows about this "Zero Day" event. I think the movie that Elephant did not do is lead us like these guys. They showed their lives for about a year. Throughout the movie they like to laugh at them, even if they know what they do. And that makes me feverish. Because I felt guilty about reminding them of their remarks, and I thought Cal was a sweet guy. Even though I knew what was going to happen, you know? Even at the end of the movie, when they were going to commit suicide and deciding whether to do it at the beginning of the third or fourth one, I thought it was funny, but I was still horrified when I saw their heads bloated. Of course I was. I have to like them. They may have been angry, but we felt they were really normal boys that they did not really realize it. But I knew they were. <br /> <br /> This is the IMO, the main strength of this movie. We realize that our friends, relatives or someone can plan something crazy and we do not even notice. This movie, as good as it was, made me sick. That's why I can not sleep. There is still a small feeling in my stomach. Butterflies.
