When she spoke "Good Times" in 1974, it was the first black family sitcom. It focused on the poor Evans family in Chicago and their efforts to end. Most early episodes focused on parents, James and Florida Evans, and on their struggle to organize a family. John Amos and Esther Rolle were the best part of the show. They were great actors and they had great chemistry like James and Florida Evans. They had three children: J.J., Thelma, and Michael. J.J. was a skirt-hunted but well-thoughtful teenage son who matched his lack of fine artistic talent. Thelma was an attractive, bright girl who constantly traded with the insults of J.J. Michael was an almost childish miracle who was well educated on social issues and was designed to become a lawyer. In 1976, producers made a huge mistake by firing John Amos, literally killing his character. It really changed the focus and not what I could add. The exhibitions began to focus more on J.J. and his foolish behavior that annoyed black audiences, as well as serial star Esther Rolle, who left after the next season. Instead of a show that focused on the key African-American issues that existed at that time in society, viewers had shows that were overloaded with skirts and funny jokes. Once Esther Rolle left, the quality of the show suffered even more. Although it was still observable, it was no longer a great pioneering show that once it was. Although Esther Rolle returned for the 1978 season, it was obvious that the show was on his last leg. All free ends were bound during this season, and the show quietly disappeared from the air. <br /> <br /> The first three seasons: A. The last three seasons: C +.
