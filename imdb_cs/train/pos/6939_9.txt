I was very impressed with this film. I had to evaluate it as one of the better westerns of the classical era. I say that for the whole thing: acting, mature dialogue, meaningless story, and excellent cinematography. Director Anthony Mann, who made several well-photographed nourishes at this time, also made some Westerns like this one. He has the same movie noir. Mann and Jimmy Stewart collaborated on several Westerlands during this period. . If you like this movie, I recommend the Mann-Stewart movie "Bend Of The River." In short, the story is about a man, "Lin McAdam," (Stewart), who owns the prestigious Winchester 73 rifle, the weapon he won in the competition. Then it is stolen and handed over from a villain to a villain. All these villains are interesting characters. Aide Stewart behaves like an interesting story by Shelley Winters, Dan Durye, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer and J.C. Flippen. Everyone is fun. It was a bit of a stretch, but see Rock Hudson playing Indian ("Young Bull"), but you can not have it all.
