The only reason I did not give this ten stars was the DVD format - no menus, accessories, etc. However, if you ever dream of doing something with your life, this movie is for you. If you believe in yourself and your dream, do not let anyone stop or stop you. It's one of the most animated films I've ever seen. And magical. The game is excellent, the story serves this purpose and the start order is fantastic. It's one of those movies called "cult". I have recommended this film to all my friends. Some love it, some do not finish it. Whenever I think or feel that something is impossible, I think Alan Arkin's role in this movie. He certainly wants to make more movies.
