Just after I saw the movie, I got the real magic of Walt Disney movies, and I realized it was long ago that I saw the movie "real" magic. <br /> <br /> Combining the right music, expressions and magical effects brings Disney's feel to your body. The very strange things I've seen, where the unconscious effects in the movie, began to transform the Disney logo into the Cinderella and ended up as an old-fashioned tale with grandparents. <br /> <br /> The spell came back in me. Rate this movie 8 of 10.
