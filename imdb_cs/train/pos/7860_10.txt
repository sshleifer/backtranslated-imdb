I have never seen a silent film until July 24, 2005. I have never seen a movie with Mary Pickford on it. I've seen thousands of movies. Very little for me hypnotic. I found Last of the Mohicans and the unforgettable (Ray Liotta) to be hypnotic, so consider the source to read this. I began to watch Tess from Storm Country on TCM just to find out who it was Mary Pickford, who many were doing to launch Hollywood. I had no idea what I was. Two hours later, I disappeared and realized that I was watching one of the most beautiful women I'd ever seen and playing a role that perfectly matched her. Imagine a movie fan in 1922 when you've never seen someone so beautiful and eloquent. You have to see it again and again. The setting was perfect for a girl who is distinctive. She was a bad squatter, she could not speak English, but you must admire her. What movie ... time to start your Mary Pickford movie collection!
