"Holes" is my favorite movie! Meanwhile, I've seen this movie three times in theaters and I'm looking forward to buying it on DVD in the upcoming September. I read a book after I saw the movie, and was amazed at how similar a book and a movie. The director of this film has done an excellent job of re-making the book into a film. Also, all actors selected to play the roles played their characters, especially Max Kasch as ZigZag. Records for everyone involved in the movie were a real success! 10 out of 10 stars, I strongly recommend that everyone see it!
