CHANCES ARE is a charming romantic fantasy about a woman (Cybill Shepherd), whose husband (Christopher McDonald) is killed shortly after learning that she is pregnant. Then we see that the husband in Heaven leaves the powers known to have been taken too early and that his wife needs him. He told him he could return to Earth, but not like himself. Flashforward 19 years, when we see Shepherd's daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson), who is preparing to graduate from college and meet a young man (Robert Downey Jr.) who appears to reincarnate her father. The movie is a bit on the predictable side ... the story goes to all the places you expect, but it's so magically played energetic cast (especially Shepherd and Downey) that you can not help but get wrapped in fun. Shepherd is rarely seen on the screen for a better advantage and she and Downey are backed by a talented group of character actors in supporting roles. A beautiful and charming fantasy that will catch you and enchant you.
