Victor Nunez blends this unsentimental story about the emotional journey of a young woman with feelings of poetry rarely seen in the cinema. In poetry I mean the sense in which literary and film production enters into play. There is something very literal about the film, almost as if the novel has been customized to a page. In this sense, the film achieves depths that many can not; but it is also somewhat slow at other times that undermine the depths that once achieved in favor of ennui. Ashley Judd has not made a better film than her debut. It fits the role of Ruby as a glove, almost as if she did not have to act. She really has a movie star in her film, and in her later films she has been able to show the same love, though she was impressive in Normal life.
