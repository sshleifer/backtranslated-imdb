Amazing performance by Simon Pegg, who improves and improves each role. As usual, there's a part of a very overgrown character that makes you ever wonder about your pillow, but that's what Pegg is about. The laughter was regular, each of them headed for Penn. The film was very cleverly assembled where each character plays a very sophisticated and serious role, with Penn being the only humor that is a huge credit for director Robert Weide. And I can not let this go without a quick applause to Gilliam Anderson, who shone all over. We highly recommend it to everyone.
