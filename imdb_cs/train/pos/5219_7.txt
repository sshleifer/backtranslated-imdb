Gere and Danes play 2 staff for the public security department who track down released sexual offenders. Gere, who plays Babbage, calls them her herd. Gere is overly obsessed with the alert, who is on his way out. He is trained, Allison, to take over the job. Gere sees his herd as very sick, upset puppies. They ask questions that are not on the list and try to act as a police and solve crimes. He is constantly alert to this behavior, hence the reason he is replaced. During the last few days, a young girl disappears, and Babbage is certain that he is one of his flocks that has gone mad. He and Allison narrow the list and find out that some offenders have left AWOL. She decides therefore that she needs to watch the missing girl rather than help the police. This part is a bit bit. <br /> <br /> There are some bad, twisted things in this movie. Just as Babbage and Allison go to this building, where a lot of sick people make interfering things. There are also people who kidnapped the girl. At the end of the movie, we see the bad monsters. However, I would not consider this film to be excessive because it does not show much in the movie. FINAL VERDICT: If you like thrillers and movies about serial murders and cops who are chasing killers, then you will like it.
