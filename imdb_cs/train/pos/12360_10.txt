I loved the movie. he has a beautiful analysis of the Italian petty bourgeois society, as the leftists of the 1970s surrender all their ideals and come to a happy arrangement they do not want to disturb. An aging psychoanalyst who is jealous of his own son and does not want to recall his more radical youth. After a long time he wanted to buy a video after seeing the film several times on the big screen and on TV, but it seems they have disappeared from the market, even in Italy no one in the bookstores knew about the film. such a shame. One sexual scene, which everyone seems to be doing, makes the movie harmless.
