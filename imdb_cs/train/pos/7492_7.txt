Though not a horror film in the traditional sense, this haunted film delivers goods. The vampire seems to be emptied of blood in a small German city. Police Inspector Karl Brettschneider, Melvyn Douglas in one of his first roles, is skeptical that he believes that a crazy killer is not a vampire running amok. The only one who trusts him is Ruth Bertin (Faye Wray), Inspector's Girlfriend and Dr. Lab. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill), who is probably a prominent scientist along with the theory of vampires. Local residents suspect strange Herman Gleib, playing with his usual madness Dwight Frye, who seems to have a lot of fun with his role. The film contains quite a bit of humor that helps alleviate some of the intensity associated with all the murders that have been committed. One of the funny parts is Gussie Schnappmann (Maude Eburne), Aunt Ruth Bertin, thinks the weird Herman has not changed as a bat, but into a dog. Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye are a good comedy team. This budget film brings features from "Cabinet Dr. Caligari" with Dr. Niemann uses the power of the suggestion that the somnambulist perform his orders from "Frankenstein" using human blood to help create life in the lab, and "Dracula" because the murders are believed by everyone except the inspector and his girlfriend to be the work of bloodshed. These elements are well mixed by director Frank R. Strayer, with the little comedy they fired. Preparation works. The restored version I saw used toning to increase the ghostly atmosphere. So try to see this version if possible.
