<br /> <br /> I have seen this movie many times. At least ten. But unfortunately recently. However, the Etc in my memory never leave me is the scene in which Mickey Rooney - "Killer Mears" knows he is to be executed and that he is approaching the moment of truth, dancing and crying and laughing, he drops from hesitations to euphoria and leads gambit still emotion. I have never seen such a brilliant performance of any actor living or dead, past or present. Then I knew for sure that Mickey Rooney, yes, "Andy Hardy" was and is an actor of great genius. However, I kept it, my thoughts on myself for many years thinking, I must surely be alone in this view. About fifteen years after I last saw this movie on TV, I wanted to read the old Q & A Los Angeles Times section. The question was asked by Lawrence Olivier and the question is: "Mr. Olivier, do you consider yourself one of the greatest actors of all time, who do you consider to be one of the greatest actors?" His answer was: "Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney" I was amazed, but not surprised. I immediately returned to his "Killer Mears" And I felt very good that I saw this great ability in him and now my opinion was supported by another one who admired the work. Later, of course, there was "Bill" and many other great moments with Mikey Rooney. This film "The Last Mile" should be seen by all acting students. I can not honestly remember the film all these years, but Mr. Rooney will never leave. If someone outside remembers this movie just like me? I want to hear you. For this image etched only in my heart I gave him only 10 on the face of his performance.
