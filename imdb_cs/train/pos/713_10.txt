this movie is amazing. somehow. that dosent actually say a lot, or do a lot, but it's an amazing movie to watch because it's silly it is. high school is taken over by a bad ms.togar who hates the thing that all students love, rock & roll. riff randle get all the tickets to the show ramones and this movie tops with the takeover of the school led my riff randle and ramones. this movie has everything, bad screenplay, dubious directing, bad actors (eg clint howard & pj soles), amazing soundtrack, extreme campfire, these elements and much more join to what it is, classic. > <br /> Note: During the live ramones, notice that a burst of germs has appeared in the front of the crowd. clean it.
