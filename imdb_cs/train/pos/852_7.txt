MATADOR is a hit-man movie lite ... if you can say it about a hit-man movie. Violence is never proven, but is often presented. At first, I was afraid I was another gangster-hit-man-hipster-dark comet protector in the mid-1990s, and I was surprised to realize that it was just a sweet and humorous story of friendship. There's nothing terribly exciting in this movie, but it always leaves me a grin. Three leads have the best chemistry the big screen has been offering in recent years, and it seems they have had a great time to join the movie. The script is sharp, but sometimes it seemed that the script was adapted to the scenic scene. This is a good movie I probably do not remember for too long, but it was a joy at the time. A good movie.
