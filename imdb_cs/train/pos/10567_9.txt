Miracle. One of the best musicals ever. The three Busby Berkele numbers that finish the movie are spectacular, but what makes this movie so amazing is the incredible non-stop temptation and natural action of Cagney and Blondell. (Keeler is also beautiful, though she may not have been a great actress). There's a freshness in the movie that you do not see today in movies, but rather in 30-movie films, although the plot that includes setting up prologues is pretty late.
