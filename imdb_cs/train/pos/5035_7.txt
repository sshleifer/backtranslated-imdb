McConaughey in horror / thriller? I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised. The conspiracy is said in flash mode and concerns an otherwise normal and happy family of three going through a very bizarre problem. I can not say much more without spoiling the whole movie, I'm sorry. Just know that if you decide to follow, you will at least be surprised. All major players are very good. Bill Paxton did a great job driving these kids and his acting is amazing. McConaughey's acting is solid in its entirety and fits perfectly into the account. <br /> <br /> This movie calls you to think. Daddy is crazy? Is there God? Are there demons? How far would you go wrong? And what is "right"? I am still thinking. So I recommend "Frailty". 7/10 and that's one of those films that deserves and rewards the second, or even third, view.
