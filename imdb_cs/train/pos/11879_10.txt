This is one of my favorite times. <br /> <br /> If the movie is a mistake, it's like a furious bull. The viewer does not take too much of an attack on him. "Scarface" is as wild and indescribable as Tony Montan himself. Nothing is left to the imagination of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Fashion Morodore's synthpop fits into the tee. Like a chorus in Greek tragedy, he shouts and screams, acts and pulls, constantly reminds Tony's inexorable fate. Not like the catastrophic story as the catastrophe that is happening, "Scarface" "stretches across the screen with the unstoppable power of the train, which he avoided.
