At first I did not think that Ben Affleck could really take a fun Christmas movie. "The boy was wrong, my daughter invited me to watch her and I was not disappointed at all James Gandolfini was funny, I really liked Christina Appelagate and Catherine O 'Hara was also good, the story is what really sold me, , think "too family" at a table for people you can hardly see once or twice a year, and you probably will not do it anyway, you really need so much alcohol, what kind of system can happen with Christmas, so I get thought the $ 25,000 family was a little too attracted to the side, but it turned out to me that I was working pretty well for me because it was a revolt all the way, showing class struggles of different families. it has a lot of funny moments, including the torturing of things on a computer for a teenage boy. Overall I loved this movie and will watch it again next Christmas or earlier if my daughter wants too.
