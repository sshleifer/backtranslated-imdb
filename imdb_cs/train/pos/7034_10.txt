when you add all aspects of the movie - dancing, singing, acting - the only one who performs best in cast is Vanessa Williams ... her commitment, energy and timeless beauty make Rosie the perfect role for her. I have never seen someone portraying Rose with such energy! Vanessa's singing talent shows beautifully with all the songs that perform as Rose and her acting skills will never hold me! Her dancer is so incredible, though some people say the choreography was bad - her dance skills were shown better than ever before! I would recommend this version over '63 just because I found that even though Vanessa's lengthy acting is excellent - not to mention that Jason Alexander and the rest of the cast are very impressive also (except Chynny Philips .. what in Hell they thought when they threw it?) Overall, I would say that this version is awesome and I recommend everyone to see this version!
