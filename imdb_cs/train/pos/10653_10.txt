I know it's fashionable now that I hate this movie. I've seen hundreds of haunted films, including the original 1963 Haunting and most of the Hammer films. This film is not restrained and does not hold back, which is probably the reason why so many modern viewers did not like it. Yet many viewers can take movies out of control, such as Scream, because knife killers are easier for most people to believe than demons or ghosts. In fact, this movie had many great scenes, and the acting and special effects were great. I've seen it 15 times and it's always better. The director of this film made a number of interesting and stylish films and did not aim for the 6th sense of realism. Haunting lets go and is certainly not boring. Perhaps this film will appeal to more John Carpenter fans, but rather the traditional fence structure. Old Haunting was also a great film from 1963. It was even more scary. Look at both and the Innocents and Legend of Hell House with Pamella Franklin.
