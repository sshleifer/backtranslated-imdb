This movie was pretty good. I'm not a big fan of baseball, but it's a movie that helps understand the meaning of love, determination, heart, and so on. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza and Milton Davis Jr . comes with a number of talented actors and sports comprehension. The plot was plausible and I like the message. William Dear and the guys put together a great movie. Most sports films revolve around true stories or events and often do not work well. But this film encounters 10 degrees of perfection, although there have been several minor mistakes. <br /> <br />
