After reading the comments on this movie and reviewing mixed reviews, I decided to add ten cents for thinking that the film was excellent not only in visual beauty, writing, musical score, acting and direction, but when she told the story about Joseph Smith, and the journey he traveled through life with difficulty and persecution for believing in God, how he felt and knew it was his way. I am very pleased to have played a small role in telling the story of this remarkable man. I recommend everyone to see it when the opportunity is present, no matter what religious path it can take, it only gives it to a person with greater determination to live a life that we have with the true values ​​of love and forgiveness, as the Savior taught us to do.
