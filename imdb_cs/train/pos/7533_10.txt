I loved this series when it was on Kids WB, I did not believe Batman bounced off when it turned out that the original performance ended in 1995 and this show came in 1997. First I loved the idea that Robin left Batman to solve crime itself. It was an interesting look at their relationship. I also liked to join Tim Drake in the series, and again, as his predecessor, he had great stories, great animation (better than the original), fantastic voice work and, of course, brilliant writing. The only thing I did not like was that when it was in the United States it would often have to do episodes in a 15-minute story. I just want some episodes to be longer. My favorite episode of all Batman cartoons comes in this series and is called "Over the Edge", in my opinion is good, if not better than "Heart of Ice" and "Robin's counting". Overall enjoyable watching, along with Superman, this show has made my childhood very happy.
