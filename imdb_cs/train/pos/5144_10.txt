This very strange film is unlike everything that happened in the West at the time. With its buzzing emotions and a network of visions, dreams and surprising images, its effect is beautiful and disturbing. Actors are choreographed more like dancing than playing. It contains a single dream chain that I know is actually like a real nightmare (sorry Dali fans).
