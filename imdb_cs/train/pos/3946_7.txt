I found one and only comment about this movie completely informal and overall too rough, so I decided to write my own. I first saw this movie when it came out and has captured it several times since then. First of all, let me say that overall there are things that get this movie right, and that's what it's worth. It does not matter that it has some low budgets and other mistakes. It's worth watching. The idea of ​​setting up a film to visit Walt Whitman, the restrictive, anxious Anglo-Canadian community in southern Ontario, and bringing people to life is an excellent mis-en-scene. The film is about the kind of humanitarian catalysis Whitman inspired by humans. And in this sense, it's exactly accurate. Actor acting - especially Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as a doctor - is very good. Scripting and dialogue are strong and pay proper attention to the morals and curves of time. Overall, what do you dislike? In addition, name another movie in which Whitman is so alive to life?
