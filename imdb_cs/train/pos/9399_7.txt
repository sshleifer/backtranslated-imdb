It's a movie I saw when it first came out and I've seen it several more years. It's always nice. One thing is that the comedy does not care about the hips: oblique work and capitalists as well. Only Sid looks out of classical combat, even though he is responsible for it. <br /> <br /> Warnings for savers: do not read more if you have not seen the movie <br /> <br /> This is fantasy, although it is quite credible. Ask Yourself: Could someone wear most of their weight in a single fabric of fiber? It would break almost any support. Also, when Sid is in the alley, he uses rubbish covers as knighthood. Cute symbolism. Sometimes, I get it on DVD.
