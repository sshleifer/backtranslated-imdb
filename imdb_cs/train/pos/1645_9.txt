This Western is happening differently than most others. Realism is the key. Conchata Farrell arrives in Wyoming, where she works for Rip Torn on her ranch. As mentioned above, it makes the most interesting slice of Americana. I'd like to see it on the big screen rather than on the tape, but it's worth seeing how life has returned to the real west. Cinematography is excellent. Solid 9. Torn & Farrell excels in this movie.
