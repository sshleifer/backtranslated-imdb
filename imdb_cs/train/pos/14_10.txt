This movie has a special place in my heart, because when I first caught it I taught adult literacy. I have been very right about myself and even the excellent student I had at that time. There are scenes that irritate you with sudden emotions, and those that even smile on your face through pure identification with the characters and their situations. The outstanding performances of Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro, which are one of their best work, the great turn of young Martha Plimpton, inspiring storyline and spooky music score, are the most enjoyable and successful experience for you.
