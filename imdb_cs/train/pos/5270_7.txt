This movie may be really bad, but it's a lot of fun. Poor action and poor direction increase the hystericality of the film. Twins are very entertaining in their Conanesque roles. If you go into this movie expect the first Conan or Excalibur before you hate it. If you watch it in a good mood and accept it as good, stupid fun you will have a good time. Look at the scene where they try to hang up brothers, her funniest scene in the movie. I wish the Mystery Science Theater 3000 did this!
