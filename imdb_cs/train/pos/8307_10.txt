Tressa's vocal performance was great! Tressa played the female singer role while Richard was in the club. When she first stepped onto the stage and began to rip and twitch her things, it made my soul tremble. Her voice is platinum. It has to create a CD. He has more fans than he realizes. I loved her show that halted performance in five heart beats she also played with Leon when she was younger. How can a girl have such a big voice. It's really amazing. Good voice Good Good Good Good voice Voice voice Voice pronounced voice Fantastic voice, shivering back, tears crying, uplifting, take you back to today's voice. Tressa, if you read this confirmation, please consult me ​​and start recording the CD. If not just for the love of singing, but for your fans. I believe you can do it. Look at these other single singers, lol.
