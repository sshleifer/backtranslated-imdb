Rosenstrasse is an intimate film rather than one of the epic proportions that could keep away many movie visitors looking for a similar pianist. Fortunately, Von Trotta, a good screenwriter, decides for a feminist view of the era, which is too illustrated on its color exterior, but too little analyzed from the point of view of intimacy and from the viewpoint of the ordinary Aryan German, rather Jewish. Rosentrasse finds its strength in these unsettled burdens of people captured in historical situations from which they appear as victims. The pace of the film is introspective, very slow, meditative. In addition, characters are so lively, while generational transitions and timing have been skillfully crafted. Rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece, and some narrative shortcomings are well recognized. Another mistake lies in trivial cinematography, which fails to capture the intensity of the internal drama that lived the characters. However, this film is worth seeing. Finally, Rosenstrasse is part of the latest trend in German ghostly horror films, a trend that includes such superb films as Nike's in Africa and the recently controversial Downfall. I would recommend this movie to those who know how to read the pictures.
