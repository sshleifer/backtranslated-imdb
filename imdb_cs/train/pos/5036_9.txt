Bill Paxton, from Aliens, Near Dark and Terminator glory surprised me with his debut director for Frailty. It's about all the war, but it's unlikely that it's a FBI agent (Powers Booth) that subtracts a point from this otherwise cool and thriller-provoking thought. Besides, this movie was cool. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton plays his father. He never made his first name, but it is not the weakness of the movie. The film actually strengthens the film and allows the viewer to see it as a symbol of some sort. One day he has a vision that he has been sent from a god who told him that the world is ending and how he and his two sons Fenton Meiks (Matt O'Leary) and Adam Meiks (Jeremy Sumpter) have to punish demons and kill them. Demons look like normal people killing, and the viewer is wondering if the father has just lost his mind or really does God's job. There are scenes that reflect both points that increase confusion and give the film more tension. The story is narrated in retrospect by one of the sons who is now grown up (Matthew McConaughey) and talks with FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Booth), who is very skeptical and legitimate. After all, it's not everyday that someone comes to your office to tell you he knows who's a murderer. The film has many twists, and Bill Paxton guides greatly by letting us guess without losing interest. The game is incredible. The two young leaders and Paxton are working together, looking like a normal family, even if everyone is involved in the murder. Just like I said, it's one improbability that concerns the character of Powers Booth, but that's really not a big deal. It was an extremely well-formed film involving faith and family.
