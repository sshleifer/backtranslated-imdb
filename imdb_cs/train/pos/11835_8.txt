While I wanted to make this movie since I first watched the trailer, I was deeply surprised by this film. While some of the elements and acts of the characters looked a little too - cartoon, "the dark nature of the movie really makes it a very different experience. Instead of what you felt good, a happy story, this movie takes you in a different direction that appears to be uplifting, but Most of the children do not understand some of the dark moments in the movie, which makes this film more adult, and I was also amazed by cinematography, animation and digital animation to create a seamless web of sail and sail.The sound score was solid again, proving that Hans Zimmer is a guy when it comes to animated scenes, and I never thought I'd say I really enjoyed the music of Brian Adams.
