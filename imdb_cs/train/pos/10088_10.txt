Elephant Walk (1954) He plays Peter Finch early as a manor of a manor on a deserted planet where there is always the danger of elephants or mad English who remain at noon the sun and they will be beruerk. Well, and eventually they do it after the outbreak of typhus or cholera and of course there is a lot of trouble. Taylor replaced the sick Vivien Leigh in this fight boiler / adventure film. When the elephants curse the house and capture Liz on the big staircase, I still have gushes. Thank God, Dana Andrews is about to save the day. One of my favorite wine pleasures. In color too!
