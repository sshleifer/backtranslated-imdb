The film is very complete in what it is, keeping one constant interest in the memories of childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father and scattering him with the end of serial murder, we just can not go wrong. The plot itself, the story itself and the nature of the movie, is fun. It's such a story that director (Bill Paxton) could do so much, and in this case he was really good at it. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, you are still anticipating more and more information about what is happening and where the film is filming and the creativity behind this story is the first class. I felt as though this movie was great from start to finish and one of those precious gems that seemed to be without any tediousness - an action that stretches neatly, quickly and closely from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> It shows how far people can go: to do such terrible things to their loved ones and to do such acts of evil in the name of "God" when they are disillusioned as in this case. It is also sometimes interesting in its "bends" and acquires the concept of morality as a whole. Overall, this is a movie that easily overlooks, but I would recommend that you do not do the same and check this movie - it's so much your time.
