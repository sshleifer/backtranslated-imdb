He argues for the best role of Al Pacino. He plays Tony Montana, the little time of the hood of Cuba has turned into a rich and powerful criminal in Miami, and he does it with the only two things he has in this world, his balls and his word, and he does not distract them for anyone. He begins to work with Cuban merchant Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) for a long time, and quickly joins the organization along with his long-time friend Manny (Steven Bauer). Soon she has eyes for Elvis's sexy wife (Michelle Pfeiffer). After Frank sees the threat from Tony to his position, he tries to kill Tony, but without luck. Tony is upset and can not stop him. the film has a great supportive cast among them is F. Murray Abraham as a miserable gangster, another famous face is Harris Yulin as a crooked cop trying to shake Tony, Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's young sister. Credits on Ecxellent Scenario Oliver Stone. This film is one of Brian DePalma's brightest points in his long career and is falling, you can see that this guy is very talented. The movie has a wonderful look at it. Also pay attention to two unforgettable scenes: One in a fantastic restaurant ("Say Goodnight to the Bad Boys"). the second is the last shootout where Tony shows he still knows how to kick his butt and kills about 20 murderers who attacked his house. this is surely one of the most impressive endings of the movie I've ever seen. For fans of Al Pacino and criminal films it is necessary. For others, it is highly recommended. 10/10
