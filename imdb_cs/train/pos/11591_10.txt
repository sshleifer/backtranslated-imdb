I've also been looking for this movie for some time and how great it would be to find it on DVD ... <br /> <br /> This movie I saw when I was about 6 years old, the Netherlands. And that made me very interested. It was shown before Walt Disney's JUNGLE book! <br /> <br /> What I remember from this movie is fragmented. I remember the Indian boy was an eagle friend. That made me very impressed. For some reason, he was thrown out of his village (he did not know why). When other guys tossed stones to him, he climbed onto the rock and jumped up. At that time he became an eagle and flew with his eagle friend. As an eagle he still wore a turquoise necklace. <br /> <br />
