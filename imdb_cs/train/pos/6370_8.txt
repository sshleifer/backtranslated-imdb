To my surprise, I really liked Disney's latest animation payment. The film had its minima, but overall I felt the story was strong and the characters were easily linked. It was also nice to see the Disney animated film that was not musical. I was pushed into the border with Tarzan. Fortunately, they gave the music a break. Another nice feature of the film is that the comedy was not totally devastated (a la Hercules), somewhat gentle, so it still laughs children without the adults feeling cruel or just stupid. <br /> <br /> One disappointment was animation. With all the great animated movies that take place outside of Disney Studios, you would think they would move and catch a bit. There is something to say about tradition, but imagine the possibilities with the story of Atlantis! Overall, the film was fun and definitely worth a trip to the multiplex. <br /> <br />
