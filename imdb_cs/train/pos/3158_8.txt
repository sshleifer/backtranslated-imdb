There are too many new styles of sitcoms, but the one that works best is an old-fashioned way with audiences and indoor compilations. Show 70 is a great example. When the show appeared in the air, no one really heard of Kurtwood Smith or Debre Jo Rupp's much less how the adolescents played beautifully Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton (both of them are leaving for other interests this year) I wish Topher stayed around because the performance began his character, Eric and his close circle of friends. Ashton is already John Travolta of our time. Remember, when John was in love with Diana Hyland of Osmi is enough, think of Ashton and Demi Moore. Actor actors have never met us, which is a good thing because a cast member of the cast can spoil it. I miss Mo Gaffney playing Don's girlfriend Joanne. I miss Lisa Robin Kelly as the original Laurie, her replacement could not compare her and I'm sorry. I really liked Tommy Chong's distinction as a lost but beloved father's character to Steven Hyde. I loved watching Tanya Roberts apart from Charlie's angels. I loved Brooke Shields when Jackie played Mom. She really showed her acting talent before she went on Broadway. This show was a pleasure from many surprises. I hope this show will take longer even though 2 of them will come out, but I hope they will not be away for too long. I wish the creators of the show, Bonnie and Terry Turner, who also created their next favorite show, Third Rock from the Sun, are more successful on Fox than they on the NBC that sabotaged their show. Turners are not dummies and I hope they will create more exhibitions in the future.
