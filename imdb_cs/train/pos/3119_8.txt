"Bourne Ultimatum" starts ruthlessly in the midst of persecution, and pulse-swelling fashion explodes from there as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, absolutely outstanding) watches the composer for the CIA black-ops, which made him the perfect killer in the last attempt to learn his true identity. The devastating icy David Strathairn as "the man behind the curtain" is added to the returning regular cast, including Joan Allen (excellent) and Julie Stiles (nonexistent). series, I would like Paul Greengrass's "restless handheld to make static at least for a few minutes of downtime. However, this is the perfect way to capture the tense, claustrophobic feeling of an intimate scene from hand to fight and works just as well in the pursued scenes that they are mostly on foot and over the roofs with an occasional large pile of cars - the upper part of Bourne's entertainment is the constant globe-hopping and manipulation of technologies and communications that seem to resist the laws of physics and present-day capabilities Bourne's movies seem to exist in some sort of overwhelming hyper -reality that is full of technological magic It does not make sense that everyone seems to be in the right place at the right time but I'll be damned if it's not a blast when you look at them <br /> <br /> absent emotional and entangled by Frank Potente, the writers are trying to create some emotional connection between Da Monem and Stiles, but she is such a stupid actress that it will never do anything, but it can be forgiven because, unlike "identity" and "domination", this "Ultimatum" reveals everything and finally learns the truth about Bourne's past. It's a fun and satisfying conclusion to the series, and if they have any good sense and Damon gets his wishes, it will be a perfect end.
