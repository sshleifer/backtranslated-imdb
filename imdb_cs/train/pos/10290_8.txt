Bruce the Almighty is Jim Carrey's best work from The Truman Show and was a pleasant surprise for his recent "hey hollywood - look how good I can do!" disappointment at the cash desk. It's great to see Jim recognize and embrace his strengths. He will not receive the Academy Award, but the film itself will take longer than many of the Academy's award-winning films. He is at the top of his appearance in this latest film - it's like returning to an old friend. Carrey, Freeman, and Aniston all have a great job together - comfortably in their comedic roles, great comedy timing, and of course having fun together, but without "hey mom - look how funny I am" is a comedy type. Steven Carrell was really surprised as Carrey's The Nemesis (Carrell of The Daily Show of Fame), who left with the finest and most entertaining scenes of the movie. At Carell, I laughed more than anyone else in the last three years. I can foresee that religious walnuts in the United States will be in the fight against God, but the bottom line of the film is true to all the main theological beliefs - we are mass protoplasms that we try to go through a short life by doing our free will. Without marriage to children, it becomes the target of people with mistaken priorities (who know the types - men decorate the gold watch on Sunday morning and late television and sell prayers to God). And again, 0.5% of the country will take care of, and 80% of the media will be informed. Finally, this is a purely funny movie, each audience member laughing about what they would do, and feeling good at the end of the movie. Walking along some main street in America must confirm that God has a great sense of humor. What a better comic genius reminds us of than Jim Carry. Thanks, Jimi - it's great to get you back!
