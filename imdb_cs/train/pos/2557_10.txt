I, I am a baby in my heart, which means I love watching cartoons, I'm still doing! I remember watching Bugs Bunny when I was a baby was still my favorite. I thought he was a man, it was a great "new" show on television and than my dad said, "Bugs Bunny, I remember watching him when I was younger" and I'm glad: "Dad, Bugs did not exist when you were younger ". So I think she's definitely pleased with more than one generation, maybe 3. I like to show it's great for both kids and adults, OK, everyone. It's very funny, I and my husband, both in our twenties, love watching shows, and we do not mind that they re-run either. This show brings a lot of memories, happy. I also like the Christmas specialty with Tweety like Tiny Tim, it's nice. I can not choose my favorite character Looney Toons because it has changed over the years. When I was small, of course, it was Errors and Porky Pig. Pepe is fine, I always loved him. In fact, I have to say it's my favorite. I'm giving this show 10 out of 10 because it's a great show for all ages, very funny, voice acting is incredible, the only defect is that it unfortunately ended 2 decades ago, but the re-runs are great!
