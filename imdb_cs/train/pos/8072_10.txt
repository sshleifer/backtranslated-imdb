Excellent and unforgettable, amazingly atmospheric and brilliantly acting all. I really do not understand what kind of people this masterpiece is doing, and it gives the majority of votes like 8 (and nine!) <BR/> <br /> This is along with Grape of Wrath the biggest film of John Ford. I would say Long Voyage Home is another in a row, though quite back. <br /> <br /> Rating: 10. She deserves 12.
