but it is worth watching Boyer, Lorre and Paxina. Greene's entertainment that was filmed during the war either required a move to the US shores as was the case for this rental weapon, or the use of American actors in roles where they did not fit. Bacall answers. I still waited when she whistled and brought Bogie to life; her voice tone is simply bad for the upper class Englishman. But listen to the dialogue! No, people do not speak it differently than in books, but Greene sends a message about England that has to wake up to the dangers of the world. One more positive note: Greene's line of characters has been preserved. While Mr. Mukerjee reminded more Braham, at least his nationality was preserved, and his final conversation with Paxino is invaluable.
