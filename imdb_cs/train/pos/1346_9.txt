As a British film institute, he created a documentary film with Martin Scorsese as a "suicide" that focuses on the top 100 AFI films. I'm a huge movie fan and I'm proud to see many, many movies. But now I'm compared to my model. In this fantastic (though long) documentary, Scorsese passes through several scenes of American history to the film. It is divided into several sections including Western, Gangster and Noir. Martin Scorsese, full of enthusiasm, is a great guide as well as a fantastic professor.
