After I was forced to sit through some real rags (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl), I really enjoyed watching "Fried Worms". I never expected the end! It was fun and fun, and it did not apply to blunt humor, despite the title. My guys (6 and 10) loved it too - and my 45 year old boy had a smile all the time on his face. This is a family film that is not just tolerant for parents. The relationship with the little brother is so close to real life. "He does not stop singing just to bother me!" Also, the way a new child is trying to make friendship and how these friendships really make up is right how children behave. Of course, my parents must be a little jerky - but my favorite scenes included Daddy to get used to his new job. Have fun!
