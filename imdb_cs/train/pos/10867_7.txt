At the Santa Barbara Film Festival, where I went when I was in Hollywood, I saw in the film's guide that the movie was in the movie. In essence, it is the election of the new chairman of the Hong Kong Triads Wo Sing Society that comes to see how much violence will happen during this event. The fight is among the "nominees" of Lam Joy (Simon Yam) and Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) to control the oldest and most powerful parts of Triad. Also play Louis Koo as Jimmy Lee, Nick Cheung as Jet, Cheung Siu Fai as Mr. Tak, Lam Suet as Big Head and Lam Ka Tung as Kun. There are some good realistic themes and moments of corruption, just about enough action, except when the cops joined, but followed the sequel, so it's a pretty nice crime drama. Very good!
