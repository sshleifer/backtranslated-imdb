"Elvira, Lady of Darkness" is a sort of "Harper Valley P.T.A." with touching the supernatural. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) leaves her job as a hostess television horror movie after she becomes the owner of the new station. She now relies on a show in Las Vegas that carries her, but she finds she needs to come up with more money to start the show. Things look hopeless to raise that money until they receive the announcement of the death of their aunt, who then takes Elvira to Massachusetts for reading the will. The house that needs repair, a dog, and a cookbook are all her aunt leaves, and again, Elvira seems to have trouble coming up with money for a show in Las Vegas. Adults from a small and narrow-minded city make things worse by making things more difficult for Elvira. Only a local room (Daniel Greene) and a group of teenagers will be friends with her. Elvira Uncle "Vinnie" (W. Morgan Sheppard) tries to sign a contract with Elvira for a cookbook, but Elvira will soon learn about her strong heritage, which includes magic and a few very effective stones. Elvira no longer wants to sell a cook to his uncle, but he's determined to get in his hands to know about his power. Elvira then faces the burning of an old accusation of city witchcraft and the conflict between her and her uncle. The plot is quite simple, but humor and well-developed characters keep moving at a nice pace. "Elvira, the Lady of Darkness," is full of cute, crude, crazy and clever humor that goes through many visual gags, play, props, songs and parodies. The film touches occult music and makes one of the best horror parodies. It is a well-made film with great work of all artists; including Edie McClurg, and Jeff Conaway ("Grease.") There are also nice special effects. Many people (including me) were wondering if Elvira's character might have a feature film and the answer is wonderful, YES!
