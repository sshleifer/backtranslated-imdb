Yes, it's another great magical Muppeta movie and I love them all; characters, movies, episodes of television shows (it's the best comedy or music TV show ever) and all the artists behind it. But here they have made such a rare fatal mistake and I'm definitely talking about the strange end! <br /> <br /> I think it's very dangerous to engage so much in American drama and end the marriage affair with marriage! We, as well as all the poor audiences, feel so free or maybe happy for not having annoyance, anger and misery! So we all look forward to these stories that gather 2 cute heroes as love couples without a legitimate bond like Mickey Mouse and Minnie, Superman and Lois Lane, Dick Tracy and Tess, etc. So, with all the previous couples and their bets, you have a feeling of security , peace and quiet. So when you look at what the creators of this movie have already done, you'll be as crazy as me! <br /> <br /> They made a weak pathetic creature (Kermit) to take the everyday nightmare, the most powerful woman, (Miss Piggy)! This is a historic change in US industrial entertainment! And it was normal to have a negative impact on the audience who just refused blessings or beliefs or satisfaction with this sudden marriage (even the pathetic frog did not have the time or opportunity to think or make anything!). No wonder you know this movie is the biggest failure in their movie series, earning only 25 million compared to the 65 million that won the first movie (The Muppet Movie? 1979) five years ago! <br /> <br /> They just took Manhattan and my rest in this movie!
