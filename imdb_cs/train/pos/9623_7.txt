Hmmmm, do you want a little romance with your mystery? It has. I think if romance was destroyed, it would mean a better film. But how romance can get rid of when the story goes from something called the Harlequin novel, whether it's all hectic. If romance was destroyed, the story could have been a little weak. The secret was not very bad here, quite interesting, but nothing at the level of Impossible international spying. Oh, okay. I thought Mel Harris was pretty good; her short skirts, I think, have added some sexual attraction ... but this Rob Stewart's guy might have been better occupied, perhaps with a more famous TV movie actor. The direction was decent and the writing could improve - both of which could be a bit rougher, a little darker and more adventurous. One thing that was great in this regard was the use of real European places. It could easily be changed, so it could be filmed in Canada, but it really was in spectacularly beautiful places like Budapest. Probably the drawback is that the director and / or the cameraman choose the framing of some postcard pictures to be perfect. Bad. If it was a more dramatic movie shot on a big screen, the picture postcard of the perfect scene really need to have a back seat and just be a nice part of the background. It was just a television movie, so they had to add some Ummmph to the picture and some of that Ummmph came from the scenery. Overall, this is not really a bad movie. I'll tell you what, this was the best Canadian-Hungarian production I've ever seen! (and the only thing I know about.) I hereby declare that this is the average movie for the TV that gives him the grade C-
