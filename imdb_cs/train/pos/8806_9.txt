I decided to see this film on the day that it opened up nationwide in France as a personal way of thinking about what happened a year ago; the collection works as it was intended: it raises the belief of thoughts and emotions, works as an intellectual hommage, never involves inexpensive sentimentality or reaction to its knees. <br /> <br /> There are many claims that the film is anti-American: while I can not speak for all in this regard, I am one American who found such a statement to be totally untrue. people are making a lot of noise on the Egyptian Chahine segment because they are expressing views on Palestinian suicide bombers claiming that civilians in democracy are "just targets" for choosing governments that bombers are trying to attack but ignores much more: we are discussing in a few perspectives, no one holds true, and critics - if they even look at the piece - they seem to forget the kindness and warm dialogue that takes place between the director and the spirit of the American dialogue, and the director's intense sadness after hearing the tragedy. In most cases, all films are beautiful, thoughtful and inspirational, especially the brilliant work of Mahkmalbaf, Tanovic, Loach & Inarritu. Nair, as usual, actually tells the true story of the injustice committed against the Muslim family as a result of the anti-Islamic hysteria that froze - and still sweats - the states. I found Gitai's piece a bit vulgarly loud and just in the criticism of media hysteria in the face of terrorism, and Penn's piece was too impressive and elliptical for my taste, though I expected to like it. Borgnine is very good and brave in him. SPOILER WARNING: One of the reviewers below incorrectly read the fall of the tower as a joyous moment for the character; my reading rather lies in the fact that the fall of the tower is because the light floods his peace, and he keeps him in the loss in his life, which he refused to recognize. again, it is an impresionist piece, for we know that if the towers actually blocked this apartment, then it would be nothing more than smoke and ash, not the light that flooded its window.
