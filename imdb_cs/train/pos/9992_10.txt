... this is a classic with so many great dialogues and scenes that no one should miss. A nice story, funny situation of wealth on hand, Mel Brooks is not a bad leader, maybe not perfect, but it's funny, D Do not pay attention to the rating, it's BS. Watch this, then look at something like a destination (2009) and tell me that Life Stinks deserves the same rating. If so, I do not think we could be friends XD At this point I recommend to every Brooks fan of the fourth season: "Cover your enthusiasm") Vote 10 against the unconscious views of the firing! Do I have to make 10 lines to write a comment? I do not want to write a book here: P
