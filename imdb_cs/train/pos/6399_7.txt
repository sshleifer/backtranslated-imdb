While it certainly was not the best movie I've ever seen, it definitely cost $ 8 (which is not the case today for many movies). A true story, though many details of the real story were twisted for the movie (ie Billy's Sunday character was three or four people in a real story together.) Robert DeNiro was of course good, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. , was also impressive.
