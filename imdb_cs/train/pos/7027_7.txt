"Bye Bye Birdie" is not one of the best musicals of all time, but it is very entertaining and accessible to many audiences. The original movie could be amazing, with Dick Van Dyke, who reflects his signature role on Broadway, but instead shot, so the film is very unsatisfactory. This re-make, which was broadcast on ABC in 1995, is much more faithful to the original script, and includes some of the original tracks that were used in the nationwide tour from which the film was set off by Tommy Tune and Ann Reinking choreographed this Jason Alexander is a very different type from Dick Van Dyke but he is well-liked as Albert (before he started his "Seinfeld's" days, he started in the music theater.) Vanessa Williams is perfect for Rose. They are also great works by Tyne Daly as Mae and Mark Kudisch as Conrad Birdie (the role he played on the nationwide tour). <br /> <br /> This movie is no problem. Chynna Phillips is the main attraction, which, however appealing, looks simple and seems too old to be a teenage Kim. And George Wendt is somewhat dull as her father, rather throwing the number "kids" away (the number of original cast member Paul Lynde stole the show s.) But all in all, it is a wonderful, well-filmed film that deserves the material.
