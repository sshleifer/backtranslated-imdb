This movie has always been my favorite since he first saw him as a 12 year old child in 1962 when he appeared on Los Angeles TV show "Late Show". The characters are very attractive from the beginning of the picture, and it is bad that the film has never been released on a videotape, nor is it on television at all (apparently due to the prohibition of the authors Moss Map, a playwright / director / producer who wrote the story and first presented it in New York during the Second World War - the reason why his performance is denied is hard to read for more than 50 years after its inception). I have not seen the movie again for more than 30 years when someone who was actually the main filmmaker was able to take me a copy of the "bad video" on VHS (poor video quality but good sound). My recollection was right: it was still a nice and fascinating film to watch. The amazing aspect of this film lies in how many of his stars began in his career in 1944), they became either the film's major stars or at least well-known and fully engaged actors (such as Judy Holliday, Edmond O'Brien, Jeanne Crain, Barry Nelson , Don Taylor, Karl Malden, Peter Lind Hayes, George "Superman") Reeves, Red Buttons, Lee J. Cobb, Kevin McCarthy and Gary Merrill). The scenes with the B-24 liberators are amazing, especially close up, where you can see details of a huge four-cylinder bomber (for that time) (then 18,000+ made, now almost extinct). A good overview of the different levels of training the pilot-cadet has gone on to be assigned to the bomber crew (of course, very gender-based, as well as the trend of the day: only men have become pilots, women have only supported them in their roles - today's world are hardly acceptable). I hope one day it will be released on the video for the next generation.
