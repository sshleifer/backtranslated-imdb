The job seeker is wrong with a man in the small town of Wyoming, which leads to all sorts of complications. Cage is perfectly occupied as an unhappy schmuck who hopes to make a quick buck and get out of town but finds out that he can not escape the title town. Hopper does what he does best, playing a psycho known as "Lyle of Dallas", a real hit. Walsh as a crooked sheriff and Boyle as femme fatale rounded off a fine. John and Rick Dahl's scripts include delicious twists and turns, and John's direction creates the amazing atmosphere of "neo noir". Funny and very entertaining, it absorbs the viewer from the beginning and never leaves.
