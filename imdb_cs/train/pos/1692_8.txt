Just like the big classic Bugs Bunny cartoons, this movie has humor at different levels. I just introduced it to my ten-year-old daughter and eleven-year-old son. They both enjoyed the movie - they laughed a few times ... and my daughter is not a very sci-fi fan. The film kept me laughing though I met several times ... Adult humor (it's a humor that adults get simply because of a bigger life experience, no real or R-rated stuff you can find here) keeps the movie as comfortable for adults. For example, adult-level humor, Martian voices are based on characters of various films / actors. The Martian pilot, Blaznee, has the voice and the mummies of Jack Nicholson; scientist, that Dr. Peter Strangelove's seller. Special effects are surprisingly good for this movie. The lack of the top ten actors actually works in favor of the film, and the actors / actresses play their part well - in fact, I would like to say that the producers have chosen actors and their skills for role-plays through box-office draw power (an excellent example being "Vern" Alexander). I had to write this review ... kids play it for the third time in 4 days for dinner right now. Good for a rainy day or a late night weekend is a movie that has nothing to do with it.
