Blonde and blonde have Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards in almost every scene and if you want more of the movie, it's totally disproportionate. It feels like the late Carry On era when the series was no longer flaming, but it was even more fun than not, to think of Behind or England and not too far from the brand. Pamela and Denise are ballooning, charming, and they realize that this is not the masterpiece they do, although you can give it to me over the many things they tell me. Supportive casts are energetic, although some are not particularly good; I can not see a couple of twists in a movie that's almost forgotten, something that's going on, so just to smile. I think Blonde and Blonder are an ace and I hope you hate me for it.
