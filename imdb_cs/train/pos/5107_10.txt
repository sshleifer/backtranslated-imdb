What overlooked the 80s soundtrack. I imagine John Travolta sang some songs, but when watching the movie it seemed to embody everything that was the 80th Cheese. Clearly, films that rely on mechanical bulls, bartenders, and immature relationships were in style. It was best his miserable Texas accent. Compare it with Friday Night Light. I suggest watching a cocktail and stirring a fool to really get into the stupidity of the movie. Also, as a side note Made in America with Ted Danson and Whoopie Goldberg is a terrible bad movie. I was so shocked that I never noticed it. One other strange film of this genre would have to include the Cadillac Man and Robin Williams. Just remember that all these BIG stars played great roles in these films CHEESY .. Tom Cruise, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams and John Travolta
