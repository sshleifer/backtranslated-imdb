The alternative name of ecstasy is Love Symphony; a title that appropriately describes the mood and feel of the film. Ecstasy is an early talk and could be a very good classic film if it was released during the silent film era. This film is a visual treatment and is deliberately moved so that the viewer can enjoy his sensual lyrical quality, which is presented by the artistic low key. The director's style is clearly European. The subject and access to sexuality was much more sophisticated than what was being done in Hollywood at the time. Imagine the censorship code in the US during the 1930s, which sums it up to a large extent. Hedy Lamarr, one of the greatest beauties of all time, was the perfect choice for this "Symphony of Love".
