Reading all the comments is very exciting. but can anyone tell me the name of a real artist who painted the pictures for good times? I realize that everyone refers to the j. as an artist in the family, but there was a real family who has a real artist, and yet has no credit in this respect. So if you do not mind someone saying the name of a real artist, I'd like to call him a "well-done job." I know that this vision is for filling GOOD TIME, but you do not agree that the heart of all of us has touched. I want to know if he's still painting or if he's still alive. I would like some of his work to be displayed in my house.
