When I saw a dentist, I thought it was great. However, this film is not for everyone, especially for people who do not like disturbing scenes because the dentist has a lot of bloody scenes. That's why it's the R18 rating. These are beverly hills dentist Dr Alan Feinstone, who finds his wife Brooke cheating on him with a poolman. It's best to go to your dentist before you do it, but if you do not like going to a dentist then it's best not to look at it because you could put your life to a dentist in the best bloody vengeance I've ever seen Who has ever seen a movie that has a dentist (Spoiler) pulling all the teeth of his cheating wife and cutting a tongue without an anesthetic? Overall amazing movement, but not for everyone.
