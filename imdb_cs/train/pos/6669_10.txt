I saw this movie on the day it came out last year. I was glad I thought. Well, she's on the video now and I've seen it again. I love this movie! The things they do are sometimes stupid, but that's what makes me my third favorite movie of all time. The special effects are fine, but a funny dialog box will guide you through. I'm the person who says I'm inspired by this movie, so if you like dramas and other things, avoid. But for everyone else, enjoy yourself! The game is great. Hank Azaria is the best player (not a comic or a fruit), followed by Ben Stiller (uh, do not fix me, it dirty me) and then William H. Macy who did his best performance praised every macy for the garafalo, that Kel Mitchell was quite good as Invisible Boy. Two Problems: The most boring part of the film is the subplot of romanticism between Stiller and Claire Forlani and the hearing of Casanova. Some scenes are not completely out, but they are explosions. Kinky and especially writers tend to drag on the scene until everything that is cheerful, but bam will change and you are ready for the next. I swear that when you look at it, you'll get tired of the explosive climax (which I think is nice). The camera is also quite cool and moves with actors at a furious pace. Also, Tom Waits brings exceptional performance (he has this cold bad heroic cold for him) and, as someone else said, the best parts are when characters show some humanity to them. Captain Amazing is quite funny (especially his talk to Casanova about his perfect plan - I rolled) and rush is pretty cool like Casanova. One beef: the most entertaining comedian ever (eddie izzard) is almost useless, but his heart is in the right place. So in all, a wonderful movie. I give her twenty stars and I hope one day everyone will see brilliance in the best parody movie, Six Million Dollar Man one. He laughs now that I think about it. 20/10
