I was lucky to have received a DVD copy of this movie recently and I've seen it twice. The first time in Australia was late night more than 20 years ago, but I have never forgotten this strange and gloomy film. There are not so many people in this movie because they are so unconventional - the fact that there is almost no spoken dialogue in this movement - we just hear the thoughts of the characters - is just one unconventional aspect. <br /> <br /> When searching for a copy of this movie I found out that the producer was dead, the main actor was dead, was not stored in any British television or film archive that never was released on video or on DVD that television networks the world had broken him after their copyrights vanished in the 1980s. When it first appeared on television in Australia, it was not possible for consumers to record devices. <br /> <br /> During the second review I recently understood why this was unforgettable. Occasionally it is very tense and unbearably claustrophobic, like Harold Pinter. <br /> <br /> Again, if someone wants a copy of this DVD, please send me an email and I'm sure we can do something.
