... and the series lets you forget about it all. I'm three years older than the children in the series. He was born in 1958, I learned to manage during the first gas shortage and got my first postgraduate work during the second gas shortage in 1979. The 1970s were a terrible time to be young - inflation, competing for the school minimum - the basic work with paid thirty years, horrible music, worse clothes. The funny thing is that this series ignores nothing of this and still makes 70 years look fun, even for those of us old enough to know better. He's going to look seventy in his face - complete with time-consuming clothes - yet he filled the show with the hope of youth and things that make high school and college both the best and the worst. Then there are parents. Two young lovers in the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - really have horrible parents with the best intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not exactly red and Ward, although they are conventional for decades. They represent what happened when the 1960s finally reached the suburbs during the 1970s. Donna's parents are two people who waited for the 1960s to show them their whole life to give them strange legitimacy. Eric's friends, Fez, Kelso, and Jackie round a group representing inequality, a good degree of incompetence and snobbery. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a suburban show, but for the most part he is someone who has to play cards that have been dealt with, even though these cards deal with mostly absent and careless parents. I highly recommend all eight seasons, although season eight does not stay a bit due to the absence of Eric.
