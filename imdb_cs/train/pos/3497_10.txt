Yet one of those brilliant young men who have all escaped and dared to make a romance for teenage children (I can actually call it - that would appeal to the devil from his fans) at the micro level but packed with such taste, sensitivity and maturity. Peter Sollett - You deserve more admiration and respect. It can again be appreciated that the powers that are in the "industry" can stereotypes flush with the toilet. One place, a handful of wealthy figures, a low budget, good acting (even amateurs), decent lighting - believing real India cinema should watch more and STOP watch ... well ... you know what.
