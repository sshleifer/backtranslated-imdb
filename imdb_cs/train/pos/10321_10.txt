Most people lack the Hollywood concept. If a hero can encourage heroic acts in the mind of a child, within the limits of the law, I approve the lessons taught by Doc Savage. In all times of conflict or war the public and the government are looking for the heroes they decorate. The film industry brings heroes to the screen so people can identify themselves - such as Doc Savage, James Bond, Superman, Batman, Spiderman and others. Doctor Savage remembers more than one generation as "best of the best" before James Bond, Superman, or one of the others. All the others who follow Doc Savage are just part of the character, not the Bronze Man.
