This documentary was very thorough and revealing, yet fun, which I thought was quite impressive. I felt like they were very good at sports since their inception to the present, but that's why I do not give this high score to this movie ... <br /> <br /> I had a feeling like it sometimes the story has focused too much on the "own essentials" of the sport, speaking this way: too much in individual places where surfing can be, and especially too much to individual surfers. I felt as if the document was more related to the nature of sport, sports ideology, etc. It would have been better (although of course it was covered, I do not think it has as much time as it guarantees). <br /> <br /> And for many people who are not absolutely ugly for surfing, they sometimes hear them, go further and further on specific places, and specific surfers might become boring. While video clips and in-depth research are well respected, they could be presented in a way that would be better for those who are not enthusiastic about surfers. Moreover, it was the biggest disappointment when they talked about how totally awesome and miraculous some events in surfing history were yet to have real footage of these events unfolding, and all the while waiting for you to see on the silver screen this amazing, breathing event, the men talking about moments that change life, and finally everything you get is a lot of people talking about it, not real shots. It was too irritating to hear these stories and then I could not see them. I understand the difficulty of collecting records of everything, but please: do not make such an event and then do not show it. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very fresh document I liked. not the best document due to the above reasons, but it is very fresh and has some extremely exciting shots and a good soundtrack, it's a document I'd advise everyone to have a look at.
