Sometimes you have to look back to move on. For 60 years it just did. We must remember the past. Past is part of the future. <br /> <br /> Great combination of Gary J. Coppola. I see a great future. You deserve to be nominated and win, the best mixer of 60. <br /> <br /> Best mini-series of all time. <br /> <br /> Thanks Ursula <br /> <br />
