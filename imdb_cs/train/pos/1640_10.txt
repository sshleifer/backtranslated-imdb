"Heartland" is a wonderful show of what was really like to live on the border. The hard work and individual strength needed to survive the climate troubles and the lack of medical care mingles with the friendship and interdependence of the settlers. The drama was especially meaningful because the story is based on the diaries of real people whose descendants are still alive. It was also nice to see the west inhabited by real people. Nobody was charming or looked as if he had just spent a session with a make-up or costume department. Conchatta Ferrell is just great. He is an example of the strong and persistent people who came to Wyoming in the early 20th century and left no misery to stand in the way of a new life in a new country.
