Michael Cacoyannis had a relatively long career, but surprisingly few credits to his name, including some real duds such as the Cold Cold War satior war, The Day the Fish Came Out. But Iphigenia is the pinnacle. Adapted by Cacoyannis from Euripides, it's an excellent rendition of classic tragedy and has recently appeared in the United States for the first time in the TV series Flix Channel. The film is filmed on an epic scale, but it is certainly not a "big" film with an emphasis on a simple story: Agamemnon (Kostas Kazakos) is forced to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia (Tatiana Papamoschou), much to the dismay of Queen Clytemnastrae (Irene Papas) . Kazakos and Papas are both outstanding, but stunning Papamoschou brings on screen the most intriguing elements that link the innocence of childhood with a smile that is a pawn in the political game. We strongly recommend fans of international cinemas.
