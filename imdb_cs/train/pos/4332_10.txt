Paul Reiser did a great job writing this movie. Peter Falk gives the performance of his life. It's worth the Oscar. It was one of the most enjoyable and fun movies of the year. Reiser's joke is fantastic and he's as good as he is and was in his long television series "Mad About You". Peter Falk has done a masterpiece like his dad, and Peter, now 78 years old, has made us laugh and weep at the same time. Supportive cast was equal to the task of particularly wonderful Elizabeth Perkins. It's a movie that you have to see in 2005. We are betting that all people of all ages and religions will love this film and somehow relate to it. We have mothers, fathers and siblings like you in the movie. We all had good and bad times together and wishes that things are the same but different.
