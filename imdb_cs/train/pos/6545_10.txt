I really enjoyed this movie. Most reviews were bad, but most critics think the film should be like an idea track. This movie has a bit of drama but the rest is just pure fun and very fun. Forget that Julia Roberts is a pretty woman, Emma Roberts is a beautiful young lady and she's more than just her. Emma was so entertaining to watch Nancy Drew's role. It is good to see a new face. I believe he will go far. Nancy Drew may not be based on books, but the story is still good. There is also a good mix of other character actors and supporting actors such as Pat Carroll, Barry Bostwick, Rachel Leigh Cook and Chris Kattan - not credited. I'm surprised Disney did not release this movie. Some people do not like this movie because it does not contain sex, violence, and curse. This is a good family film that is rare today. So take a family, check out this movie and judge for yourself how good it is. I can not wait to continue.
