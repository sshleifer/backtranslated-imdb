He has to see a movie for anyone who ever went to the camp or wanted to. This film captures the absolute essence of what the summer camp is. It's funny, it's compassionate, so you'll want to watch the characters more as soon as the role rolls. If you did not see this movie .. what are you doing? Get out of the heat and start the video store. Have a great summer :)
