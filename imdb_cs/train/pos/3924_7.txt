This 1939 film by John Ford and writer Lamar Trotti tells the story of a young lawyer Abraham Lincoln, his exams (literally) and his tribulations. It's a sentimental film, quite well done, but hardly breathtaking. Casting Henry Fonda as Lincoln seems to be a mistake because while the actor had the right features for this part, even with a few centimeters of makeup and a fake nose, he is too handsome for Honest Abe, who was so cozy. This is a good attempt from Fonda, which is nothing, if not honest, but its miscasting throws the whole movie away. Support for the cast is excellent, but includes Alice Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Meek. Ford, however, is too respectful in dealing with Lincoln, who is presented as simply shy saint, and in the final scene the film moves across the summit.
