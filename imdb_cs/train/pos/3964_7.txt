The story of the FBI Story was very fun and optimistic for my New Year. His drama and action episodes were exciting. The character of Hardesty was well-drawn and admirable. Overall, photography, script, and direction were absolutely kind. Rather than making the film a nasty propaganda, as some might have, I enjoyed it as a well illustrated idea of ​​the need for ingenious minds and brave characters to fight crime. Again displaying a family that holds together under the burden of a husband's commitment to his (probably) significant work, I have not found to be a twee representation, but an ideal and exemplary one.
