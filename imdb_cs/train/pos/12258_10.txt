Emma Jane Austen is a very pleasant story in the worst time, and this story production is the best I've ever seen. Emma Kake Beckinsale is blameless. Gwyneth Paltrow (thanks to good screenplay and excellent cinematography) can effectively provoke a comedy, but Emmy fails. Paltrow does not help the fact that her hairstyles are simply "bad" (and I believe it is an era) and she looks positively sick in Roman dresses. Kate Beckinsale, on the other hand, manages the comedy effortlessly and can still show what Knightly (the most romantic heroes of Jane Austen) is seeing. Mark Strong is a beautiful Mr. Knightly with the right combination of a nice look, age, chivalry, compassion and gentleman's behavior. Emma and Knightly are encouraged by the actors and production as a whole is quite pleasant.
