Pegg had several hits in the past few years, ranging from "Shaun Of The Dead" in 2004, "Hot Fuzz 2007", "Run Fat Boy Run" at the beginning of 2008, and now comes: Lost Friends and "The film is about Sidney Yound, a man who writes a missing magazine that makes fun the most celebrity because he is not one of them." Anyway, one of the most successful magazine owners (played by Jeff Bridges) he calls (from nostalgia) to work in his magazine.Sidney is of course excited and moves to America where she meets a girl who has written a book and is making fun.This film is great and I hope it will be similar in the near future Pegg gave people another good film everywhere and I can not wait to see the third part of the Paul and Paul trilogy of blood and ice cream.
