Since I first saw anchor Aweigh in 1945, he saw a lot of nostalgia for me on the videotape. At the age of 15, it was easy for me to get into the first of MGM Technicolor's biggest musicals. Now I'm most interested in thinking about the future career of leading players. Although Sinatra made a few insignificant films soon after his emergence after Dorsey's days, as a solo singer, it was his first major film appearance. As another spectator remarked, it seems that this is almost a warming for the city. Sinatra might have to work hard, but Kelly's dance is trusted and he would do better in his other pairs. However, when observing his character, it is easy to understand why he was caricatured as a bean. Who would have imagined that during the decade he would win the Academy Award for acting and play many roles as a hard-hitting detective or leader. Although Gene Kelly's personality and dance dominated this film, his excellent performance did not imply that he would become the main creative force, an almost iconic figure for MGM musicals, where he developed a dance style complementary to Fred Astaire. Finally, it was strange to see Dean Stockwell with a fresh face and remember that he would later play in Compulsion a killer of "excitement" based on the Leopold-Loeba murder of the twenties of the 20th century. Another note: One reviewer praised Betty Garrett's performance as Sinatra's love interest. She later played opposite him in On the Town, but Pamela Britton was featured in this film.
