I loved this movie. It was so great! Great acting and dramatic and historically accurate. I like Romy Schneider movies. This rock, not as big as Sissi, but still rock! <br /> <br /> And Scorpiolina commented and said French dubbing. Well this is originally a German film that is not French. So yeah. The second of all was a conspiracy, maybe you did not know history. Oh and her mother played part of her governess, not her teacher. And the story was not really Cinderella, but Queen Victoria, maybe I missed the detail. But anyway ... yes, the history in this movie is great, I love historical movies and Queen Victoria is very fascinating! I love all the historical things. Like the guy who tried to manipulate her mother. And when she fled, she met her future husband and he showed her a "new type waltz." When the waltz was new, it was considered scandalous, because couples dance so close. Her governess was like my god! <br /> <br /> And also clothes, like clothing. The styles are great, the skirts are amazing. And of course Roma always look very nice.
