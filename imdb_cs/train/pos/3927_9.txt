OK, first fix the mark on the main page of this movie. Abe Lincoln did not go with his sister in the movie, nor did he stop at his sister's tomb. This is Ann Rutledge, who was Lincoln's very close friend in his New Salem days. Some say Ann was actually Lincoln's girlfriend, but there is no evidence to support her. Fiction and fiction appear in this film. Hollywood has always received a dramatic license with nothing under the sun and "Young Mr. Lincoln" is no exception. However, the courtroom case that is in the movie is based on real events: the murder charge against William "Duff" Armstrong, and although he is mostly fictionalized in this film with many name changes, viewers will still be screened. This is the Golden Age in Hollywood, with a drama in his best, and Henry Fonda gives maybe the best Lincoln played by somebody.
