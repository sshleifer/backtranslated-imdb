Call me silly, but I absolutely loved the horror film from 2001, Valentine. It was so well done, well written, well acting, well controlled, etc.! It was all great! There were parts that were relatively routine (Lily Dead), very fun (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com), absolutely terrifying and scary (Paige's death) and just heartbreaking (the first scene). I think all the performance was great, especially the three main ones: David Boreanaz, Denise Richards (both I met and got autographs from shooting this movie - very nice people!) And Marley Shelton. br /> <br /> I am very sick of people who have called this movie "The Next Scream Clone". This movie is by no means a Scream clone. In fact, this movie runs around Scream. In fact, SENSE! Screaming was not the only film that would have a camouflaged killer. I'm sorry, but it looks as if Scream was a clone (ah ..., Friday 13, Halloween and many other scary movies also featured masked killers). I also think the peace killer's novel is brilliant. It's so weird to see a sweet, facial face that makes all these horrible things. Another novelty (nose bleed) is the way to fantastic ending! The end gives me freezing every time I see it !!!!! So even if you do not like it for the first time, watch Valentine again and give him another chance! PS - Watch out for your new website (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Soon...
