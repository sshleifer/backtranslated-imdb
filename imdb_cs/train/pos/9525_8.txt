The road to danger can be summarized in Thomas Newman's score. It's creepy and beautiful, but you know that this music is similar to other Newman's work and when you listen to a soundtrack that reminds you of SCENT OF A WOMAN, MEETING JOE BLACK and SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, we remind you of other movies as a story unfolds on the screen. When Sullivans goes around America and tries to escape the psychotic intervention you think about THE GETAWAY, the Irish gangsters are MILLER'S CROSSING, while the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up between the gangster epics of Coppola and Leone. Despite seeing it all before, he felt that it should not be considered a serious criticism of Sam Mendes, which I repeat is scary and beautiful, and the only mistakes that work against him are a very slow opening of twenty minutes, and I am was a slightly confused event that caused Michael Sullivan to be betrayed. But if you stopped thinking about how much sentimental mess that Spielberg could do with a story revolving around his father and his twelve-year-old son running on his life, you can not help thinking about what is excellent director Mendes. <br /> <br /> ROAD TO PERDITION is a movie in which the whole acting performance provides flawless performances. I've never been so interested in Tom Hanks, but he's as good as any major player, probably better. Paul Newman plays a character with a Irish accent, but I did not think I was looking at an American screen legend that has a false accent - Newman's performance works because of the delicate body language, his character is torn guilty, but Newman never milk or it passes over the top. While the never-ending Newman non-violence that best performs in the film, two British actors Craig and Law are also very memorable as American gangsters and while Law will have a long career as a leading actor, one is surprised how Daniel Craig could proceed as though he had decided to stand with James Bond, a role that jeopardizes actor's career
