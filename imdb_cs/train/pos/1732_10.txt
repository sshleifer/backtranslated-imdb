"Sandra, the creation of a woman" is exceptional among the exploiting films, and it is for two reasons: (1) the excellent but effortless performance of Monika Gayle; and (2) the fact that Gary Graver was on the helm of the project. These two talents, some of which are quite underestimated, make the movie "Sandra" that should be seen. Another key element in the success of the film is its realism - there is nothing fake or "Hollywood" about this movie in the California film. It's really a piece of life. The modest house in which Sandra lives at the start of the movie, the simple dress the character wore, the scene where Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart, who jumps on her front door, and Sandra sits on the couch without a make-while Digart she tries to sell her cosmetics, it looks as if she wakes (but still beautiful), a harmless strange Sandra who likes to love her while wearing a bra, one bedroom flat into which Sandra moves - all these elements of the film seem totally real and the viewer is drawn to Sandru's small world from the beginning and immediately interested in her and wants her to be successful. Sandra also makes her case for free love with eloquence and dignity and she comes with a lot of class. This film could easily fail in less competent hands, and could have gone in any of the usual sexploitation directions, but Garver / Gale's team made clear that "Sandra" is not only the creation of a woman but the production of excellent film.
