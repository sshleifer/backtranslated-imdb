All Dogs Come to Heaven is a movie I always liked. When I was a child, I did it every day to watch. It is underestimated if you look at the IMDb rating and the comments of many people in general. It's not a bad movie, as many say, it's a very good movie. This is good and your kids will probably like it. Although it is rated G, some parents may find it a little violent. It's a really dark story, where the dogs are similar to the horrors that are involved in gambling, performance and even cold blood. The film follows a dog named Charlie, who escaped from a pound, is killed by his old friend, goes to heaven, but eventually returns to the ground. Many younger children who are watching this movie may feel as if watching a big kid's movie. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that can scare small kids, but I'm sure they will do it well. Every time I look at this movie, it reminds me when I was a little boy. I'm sure everyone has a movie that reminds them they're younger, it's the movie that makes me feel like that. The performances by Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise are great and it is the latest film that appeared on a young girl named Judith Barsi. Unfortunately, she was killed at a young age, which is a shame because she had so much potential, deserving what happened. Now that I know her story, I can not watch this movie this time because her voice sounds so sad. <br /> <br /> Animation in this movie is great, the voice work is great and the story is good, but a bit different from many other movies for kids. It was popular at the time of its release, but was over the shaded Disney's mega-popular Little Mermaid. This is a non-adult film, but if you are a child or when you are growing up with this movie as a child, then I'm sure you will like it.
