Henry Fool surprised me. I did not expect it to entertain and entertain as much or as strongly as she did. Fay Grim continues to surprise by providing a solid follow-up that does not seem to need her. As soon as the viewer watches the first 20 minutes of the film, he begins to blind that it is one of the best brilliant indie films. At least as good as Ginger Snaps Back if not better. I'm a bit disappointed that part of Jeff Goldblum is so small, but I'm glad he's part of this short run. He is convincing and pleasant as a Fulbright agent. It is also a pleasure for Liam Aiken, who quite impressively portrays Neda Grima, son of Faye and Henry. This film is pleased for many reasons. I like, for example, when he finds out that Henry is not really the one who seems to him (until the end of the fool), and he finds out that he is really brilliant ... well, that's really a beautiful pen blow. I hope they do the third ... as the end of the trilogy. It seems to be missing. It should be entitled to Ned Fool Grim, and Liam should be looking for his father, confirming the amazing change of mother and the feeling of almost genius that he feels within him. We assume, of course, that Fay continues to detain many of the most important facts from his son about his father. It feels like it needs to be done. I would buy it. <br /> <br /> Even if it's another action, it's still not an action. It's more drama and intrigue ... secrets. I look at it often. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
