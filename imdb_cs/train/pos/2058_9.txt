This movie is interesting to take on the killer scarecrow genre - wonderfully he rises to become bigger than the sum of his parts. Average scenes, 30-year-old teenagers and some excellent facial expressions combine to become one of the "new waves" of modern classics. As a spectator I came from a movie with the same sense of "shock and respect" as I first saw The Godfather in 1969. Tiffany Gardner's surprising portrait of morally bankrupt Judy deserves to nominate for Grammy, which was well documented by Ricky Martin stolen and restless hips. Unfortunately, none of the sequels could meet the expectations of the original one (unlike the Godfather series, which improved with each installment and should culminate in 2012 with Godfather 4: Eat My Rage.
