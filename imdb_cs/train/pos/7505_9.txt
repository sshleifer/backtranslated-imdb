If there is one genre I've never been a fan of, it's biopic. Always misguided, filled with untrue information, dramatized scenes, and tricks, biopicals have almost never done the right thing. Even in the hands of genuinely talented directors such as Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind), they often do a great deal of abuse for people trying to capture on the screen. Skeptism dominates the humor with most biopicists who get to the big screen and Notorious Bettie Page is no different. Some critics and friends protested that Gretchen Mol played Bettie Page, saying she was no longer a celebrity and had no part in it. I never doubted that Mol was able to handle this page, but I never expected it to perform her performance just as I did when I saw the movies. Mol is awarded the Oscar, which was honored in 1950 as a 1950 cult girl who, in an early life of abuse (shown by the finesse and taste made by some directors), will inadvertently become one of the most spoken models of all time. The image covers a lot of space in a 90-minute run, although there are no less than three subplots, there is still a feeling that little is missing from the story. Director / co-author Marry Harron and the fantastic screenplay of Guinevere Turner are just disturbed by too sudden and not as clear as it should end. Nevertheless, both ladies must be provided with credits to create an almost flawless biopic that can give away both his subject and the decade that he masterfully imitates. Come Oscar, Mol, Turner and Harron should be nominated. Hope this happens, though there are certainly not three women who deserve it. 9/10
