Like the characters in this show, I was also a teen during the 1970s. The producers really taught the whole zeitgeist that in the 1970s they were a suburban teenager. The 1970s, cars, home accessories, food and fashion are very authentic in this show. The show boasts a very talented cast occupation that is very good to the camera. I really like unique psychedelic-style movie sequences. No other show makes such cameras. These top-of-the-line movie sequences really help convey the hipness campaign that characterized the 70s. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very fun sitcom. The only thing that worries me is the excessive reliance on cruel humor, generating laughter. In this way, I think this show is trying to be too similar to a woman with children. While married to children is a great sitcom, it's flexible that the 70s developers are trying to imitate it. <br /> <br /> I recommend it in the 1970s, mainly thanks to the nostalgic factor. It could be even better if the writers relied on a humorous dialogue rather than dirty funny jokes and jokes.
