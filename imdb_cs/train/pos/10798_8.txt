At first he saw this jewel from Joe Sarna back when I had to say that after seeing I never forgot Jennifer Welles. At first I thought the film was moving a bit slower than the Sarno movie would have expected, but when Jennifer entered her, the first time I ever saw her, I sat down and watched. Her presence in this movie is hard to avoid and spice every scene in which she is involved. I have seen most of Sarn's other films and other mainstream movies, or Jennifer Welles, and I have to say that Sarno and Jennifer were the best in their team. Sarno's direction in this film is the home-grown drama is excellent, and Jennifer has shown (figuratively and literally) acting heroism that they have to see. Rebecca Brooke (aka Mary Mendum) and Chris Jordan, both of Welles' frequent stars, as well as Sarno's frequent stars, will turn into adventurous, yet normal, housewives. This movie is Sarno classic.
