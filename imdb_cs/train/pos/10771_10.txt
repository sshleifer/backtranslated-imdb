This film has all star casts, John Candy, Richard Lewis, Ornella Mutti, Cybill Shepard and Jim Belushi to name a few, running amuck in Monte Carlo, as well as some other beautiful European locations and is very fun. The problems everyone gets when they lie to protect themselves is great and I highly recommend that you see this movie, that's worth it! John Candy is in top form in "Once upon a Crime" like everyone else! If you and your family are looking for a great family movie, it's a ticket. Everybody gives stellar performances, great acting, great comedy, and great timing, which are rare in these days. A big plot, a big secret (which I love) and the whole money is worth the money you spend on it. So kids, grab some popcorn, juice or tea, or soda, and enjoy the show !!!!
