Definitely a very good idea, the script was fine. It could have been better, Positive is that it does not hurt you if you are a lover of adventurers, a new idea about the lost world of Atlantis. The negative is that I personally feel that this idea had far greater potential than this. It should end with a better adventure than this. It was not bad at all, but it would be much better with some other runtime. Rather it was nice to say it was boring or not good .. Good for people who like adventure animations like Sindbad like the way to el Dorado. This movie is also recommended for people looking for a nice little adventure with very nice happy ending.
