A notable record of significant achievements by the WLA in Kumba, southwest Cameroon, which legally secures women's and children's rights from acts of domestic violence. In this Muslim culture, where men have always been sovereigns to women, the Sharia law allows for the difficulty of introducing secular legal rights for women and children. After 17 years of unsuccessful efforts, WLA leaders have recently won several victories, and the aim of this film is to share these winning stories. Leaders of this movement for legal reform are Vera Ngassa, state prosecutor and senior judge Beatrice Ntuba (president of the court). Both are played in this movie, which may include spontaneous shots, although I imagine it, if not all, lies in the subsequent recreation of the real events for the camera. Four cases are reviewed and all applicants also play in the film. <br /> <br /> Two cases involve repeated defeat of a wife, in one case with violent sex; another involves forced sex on a ten-year-old girl; and another relates to repeated whipping of a child, at the age of 8, aunt. One of the deceased spouses is also looking for a divorce. We track cases from investigating complaints about experimental results. In any case, the results are favorable for women and children. Offenders receive severe prison conditions and / or fines; divorce is granted. The aggressive prosecution of an aunt's child proves that these female law enforcement officers are genuinely neutral when it comes to law enforcement. It is also worth mentioning the respect that all parties, including those found guilty, are treated. It is a highly important and well-filmed movie. (Interestingly, one of the directors, Mrs. Longinotto, also co-directed the 1998 film, Divorce, Iranian style, which dealt with related topics in Tehran.) (In Broken English with English Subtitles). My rating: B + 8/10
