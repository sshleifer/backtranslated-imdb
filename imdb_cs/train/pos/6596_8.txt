Brazilian films often get a more positive rating than they deserve. Rather unbelievably, Contra Todos (against all) (the original name that the manufacturers discarded: God Against All) has gained a very low GPA value on this site. It seems to be broadly rejecting viewers. Actually it's not that brutal. I mean, when it comes to graphic violence. Her brutality is natural because she portrays future lumpens, I think that citizens who actually have top-class techniques who coolly execute murder orders in exchange for "grana grado". Is this postmodern person? Is his only concern for a fast, almost impersonal, ultra-permissive lie, in the midst of satiating meals? The picture is probably the best Brazilian film of 2004. Its lush editing style, Ã  la Godard, his curious sound contrasts, his more than efficient overall cast, and above all his original narrative with subtle, chronologically hidden points that only appeared in the epilogue deserves at least 8 mark.
