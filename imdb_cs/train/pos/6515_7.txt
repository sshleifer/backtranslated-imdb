I almost did not miss it because of all the bad comments, but I did the same. I thought it was like the darkness I liked. The only part I hated from the tooth ferry was two black neck brothers at a gas station. It was funny and the dialogue made me laugh, but it was not a comedy. The film was a little bit destroyed because it was useless. The rest of the film was the way the film should be horror or tension. Makeup was good and I saw worse movies than this. It was a simple story with an acclaimed acting role. It's not the most amazing or the worst movie, but after watching it I was not checked or I wanted to return the money. DVDs were previews of other movies that look good and I'll check them out.
