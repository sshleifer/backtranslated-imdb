The Eyeliner was worn in Egypt almost 6000 years ago. There really is not so much stretch to be around the 12th century. I did not realize that the series had disintegrated. Is there a second season now? I am amazed when the comments are made by those who are either poorly informed or not watching the show at all. It's a waste of place on the boards and the time of others. The first show of the series was perhaps somewhat painful when the cast began to fall in place, but that can be expected from every show. The rest of the first season is excellent. I can hardly wait for the second season to start in the United States.
