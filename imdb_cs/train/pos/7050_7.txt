I do not want to spend a lot of time here, how to bother the plot - you saw a trailer and if you do not have your online. But I do not recommend to see it - it was badly created and no laughter or spell came from the movie. So those who avoid this film because of his miserable trailer should give him a chance. It's really fun. I was away from the charm and originality of this film. For the first 40 minutes I had a hysterical floor on the floor - the only problem was that he had unnecessarily developed into bad Austin Powers' film in the final 20. This is one of the few films when the campy ended, the rest of the film (which is a normal case). Everybody gives great performance (especially Joan Cusack) and there are really great moments. I personally plan to see it again when it comes out - just capturing all the details I laughed during the first watch!
