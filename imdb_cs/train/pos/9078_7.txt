Generally speaking, the conspiracy was much better than I expected. The laughing track was sometimes annoying and had a tendency to get in the way; But in this episode, there was a really sad smile to solve it. My biggest surprise was the finding that some of the best lines and the situation were not on the trailer. Spade, in particular, was not presented in the best light in previous promotions, but his character gets quite well in the pilot. There is plenty of eye-candy to please almost everyone and all the regular characters seem to have a task ahead of them. Now, if writers can only live according to what they started.
