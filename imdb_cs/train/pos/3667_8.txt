Hollywood North is a satirical view of time in Canadian film history, when the Canadian government offered huge tax relief for films made in Canada. Mostly it was considered a tax haven or a cheaper way to get American movies. Porky, for example, came out of it. By the way, Matthew Modine plays a novice producer who wants to adapt his beloved Canadian novel. However, to earn money, he needs American names. He gets a free cannon and learns that he has to compromise until the film no longer resembles the book on which it was originally founded. He plays well in Canada but may not be understood outside the Great White North. The Americans will think we are cheering ourselves, but we will lose that we really have them. For Canadians 8/10 for the rest of the world 5/10.
