I teach the Japanese at an online high school and include cultural activities so that students can learn about the country and the language. And tracking "Gung Ho" is one of the requirements. Students can buy or rent a movie. Stereotypes or not, it helps students see that other people see the world and their lives differently than we do. Many of my students told me that the film so much liked it was that they made a copy for themselves. It is really interesting to see what we value and appreciate in our culture in our culture. I just wish I could get the cleaned TV version. I'm not really in the rough language that the authors use all the time.
