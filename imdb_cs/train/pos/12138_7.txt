Several features of this movie are immediately dated. The sound is somewhat brilliant and one realizes the great steps in sound reproduction in the years to come. The language of the dialogue is rather quaint and unnatural, and acting still recalls the transition from stage techniques. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis always gives powerful performance in all of her films as she does in this early period of her very successful career. But I feel that some accent does not match the facial expression. I think this is the supposed accent of a cock, which does not mean to me that it is true. Somerset Maughan loves to dive into human relationships with great dramatic intensity that will delight all the movies. As in many of her character roles, Bette Davis can move from a beautiful seductive woman to a desperate full fiery hatred. Leslie Howard is well-liked as a club-footed English club artist who desperately looks for a partner and makes a bad choice at a small waitress. At the end of the film the young doctor meets his true love in a busy street. They travel through a transport that does not realize that many horns and whistles are shouting at them. This scene may be ridiculous, but in this otherwise very serious film I find it rather ridiculous. They probably want to send you home with a smile on their faces. And after all, if we see (and hope), it's a happy ending.
