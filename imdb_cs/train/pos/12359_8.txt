Remarkable is due to its notorious scene where the beautiful Maruschka Detmers takes a young loving cock from her pants and mouth. Even without this moment, the movie is a great, though slightly disturbing, passionate and dazzlingly sexy ride. Detmers gives great performance as a part of the upset, insatiable pleasure, wandering through her flat naked. Dressed, partially dressed and naked, she steals most of the film about love, sexual passion, philosophy and politics. For me the last two a little lost and the end is most confusing when the marriage is released during the release of the terrorists, it looks uncertain who wants and the young lover seems more interested in trying than anything else when crying, of course, of course!
