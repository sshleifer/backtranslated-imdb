Catching all political opinions aside, Feroz Khan and Anil Kapoor's "Gandhi, my father," is a good film that cleverly examines the confused family side of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and the struggle of his eldest son Harilal Gandhi with his father-in-law, his head. One draws parallels with Gandhi the father of the nation and fights with any son he could have with his father. Acting is good. Shefali Shetty, Darshan Zariwala, and Akshaye Khanna - strictly in this order - we add color and patos to this heart-setting story of Harillo, who weeps to be hugged once and also escapes with the slightest touch of his finger. <br /> <br /> Feroz Khan is the director and production of the canvas is rich and attractive, but the script could be narrower. A few years ago I saw the pirate DVD video type (I think it was called Mahatama vs Gandhi) and it was certainly more. Although the film background and father-son and mother-son moments are just brilliant treatment. This movie could be great. It's boundary. It has the potential so huge that it was just a story about the differences between father and son or just Gandhi or even both. Somewhere the conspiracy is lost and when you expect the absolute feeling of emotion, nothing comes to you. He's settling decent with the other Gandhi. There is certainly no surveillance movie, like Kingsley Gandhi, or an abstract like Hey Ram Kamal Hassan. The film just tries to find its foundation; however, one left them thinking "what if ..." It's a lot of watches. 7.5 / 10
