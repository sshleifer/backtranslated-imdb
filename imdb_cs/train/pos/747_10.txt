Even though I was born in the year when this movie appeared and I never heard of it until I found out that I was quite embarrassed with laughter and crying and feeling with the characters because I and my friends were theirs. <br /> <br /> Their hair, clothes and speech were obsolete, but the emotions and despair of every situation were so familiar! I remember how I thought how real it was and how I wanted to make movies like that. Actually, I saw this movie the night after I was on a crazy party (not so different from that in Jay's house) that was crashed by what we thought were lost abandoned and unleashed on the edge of our crowd. The BS'er world class and the "responsible" type I mate immediately identified with Jeanie (I was also with the car) even though I had a small part of Madge's uncertainty that was moving there. My best friend was Deidre and her good friend from childhood was our Annie. Watching a scene when Jeanie is in school or where her and her boyfriend crumble and then Madge says how much she loved him, she felt like the interviews and situations I had personally. Now at the age of 27, I saw the movie again and felt a flush of emotion because it was like watching my own work of youth (even though none of my friends died). I think it's for all girls 13 and up.
