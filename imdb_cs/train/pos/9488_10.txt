Highly memorable, intelligent and thrilling film from one of the true geniuses of French films, extremely capable of Henri Verneuil. This conspiracy is the exact parallell of the JFK assassination and takes place in an undefined imaginary country. The film, both visually and conspiratorially, is sharp. Sufficiently carefully shot, followed by Henry Volnay, the prosecutor who took over to unmask the coup. In many ways, it is a very disturbing film, even for the cold and analytical precision of his commentary on the so-called internal functioning of the modern state. Atmosphere and characters are utterly believable, and Verneuil left nothing in his conspiratorial conspiracies. At a different stage, this relatively little-known film had only a 15-year-old start on Oliver Stone, who was recognized as JFK, an inferior film in many areas, the smallest of which is not credibility ... <br /> <br /> It's a master work, it should be seen by every film lover, preferably in his original French version with letters.
