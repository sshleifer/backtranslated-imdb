For the first film in the proposed series he will achieve the right balance. It happens in a style and class that show that Modesty is a wounded time as a fugitive and the beginning of her rise to power in the criminal world. I think this is a very honest / true portrait of her character just as the writer Peter O'Donnell intended. Alexandra Staden as Modesty is an amazingly beautiful and excellent choice. She acts very convincingly as a hard survivor with an exterier of cool / intelligent / innocent. And full of signs for Tarantino that she chose for her role an unknown actress - much more faithful that she has a new face. I look forward to another movie.
