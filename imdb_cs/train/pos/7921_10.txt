It's just funny, watch it! <br /> <br /> OK want 10 rows to make there: This is spoof 50s / 70s werewolf films. Lots of satire, some political. He feels like an early Clouseau movie (probably due to Alan Arkin) but with a less slap stick. If you like naked weapons movies, you will also like it (again in this game). <br /> <br /> In fact, humor moves from a slight sexual cue (inevitable in a teenage comedy) to a really painful socio-political satire. The transformation of the middle school from the 1950s into the 1970's is really fun. Sequence with changing presidential portraits is excellent! Ok maybe not brilliant but still cheerful. There are plenty of (historial) cracks from the 50s of the Cold War paranoji and the inflation of the late 70s. <br /> <br /> Anyway, just watch the movie if you have a chance!
