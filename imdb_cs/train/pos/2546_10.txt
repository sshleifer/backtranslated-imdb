It's just about the same league as "Black Cat", though I would put it 9 and not 9+. That's really a praise for a movie that was so underestimated that it's amazing! "Invisible Ray" is part of horror, partial drama, and certainly part of science fiction. For the 1936 film, sci-fi elements were a long time ago. The mixture of horror, drama and science fiction is the perfect mix, while acting on the Lugosi and Karloff side can not be better. Director Lambert Hillyer captures many of the elements that James Whale has so often. What I'm saying is that this movie is mysterious and well shot. The gargoyle scene outside Lugosi's room is a perfect example of mood. This is an extraordinary moment in a movie that is so sadly missing in today's films of this genre. <br /> <br /> As in the case of "Black Cat" and "The Island of Lost Souls," I can not understand why the movie has not yet been released on DVD. When you realize that some of the junk emails that have already been converted to DVD, it's much more mysterious. <br /> <br /> Anyway watch this movie if you have a chance. When it's released on DVD, grab it quickly and put it in a valuable place in your DVD library.
