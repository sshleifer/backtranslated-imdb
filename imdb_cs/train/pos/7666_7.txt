Two wizards fight in the fourth dimension, one (Brian Thompson as Kabal) attempts to destroy Earth and the other (Jeffrey Combs as Anton Mordrid) is trying to save. "Doctor Mordrid" is a fantastic fantastic fare offering plenty of cheese. The story is pretty stupid and gore is totally absent, but the film is very short and fun. So if you have enough time to kill, give that look. My Rating: 7 out of 10.
