You will be amazed at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation and the novelty is unlikely to wear out in the first, second or third view, but you will draw characters that are so simple but interesting that you can meet yourself in fact they are interested in unexpectedly, which may or may not cause you to feel a bit childish due to the media. Disney continues to hold the title of "The Biggest Animation in the World", with "Bug's Life", one of the greatest achievements. One of the innovative attachments that are gorgeous "out-s" are added to the end of the movie. The DVD has two sets of these outputs, where I said the VHS cassette has one alternate tape version. The DVD also includes the "Gerry Game", which is a beautiful little PIXAR short, which was also shown before the movie in the theaters. Is it a far superior insect film compared to Dreamworks? "Antz," who is fairly good in his justice, but lacks something in animation, story development, and characters. If you look at the stars of the two films, "Antz" is largely occupied by stars with the big name "film" with several well-known "television" stars, where "A Bug's Life" is just the opposite, TV stars with Kevin Spacey as the only but the difference in quality is obvious and obvious. <br /> <br /> Dreamworks can not be blamed or surprised when when you drive with Disney in the head, you have a job cut out for you, that is the movie that almost attracts me to have children to share it with. Do not think for a while that it's just a movie for kids.
