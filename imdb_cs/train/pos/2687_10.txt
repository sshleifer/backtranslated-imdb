No other movie felt me ​​like this ... and I do not feel bad. I do not want the money to come back, or the time I waited for watching this movie (9 months), or I do not feel bad when I used two hours of sunny summer day to see ______. The reason I say "_____" is that no matter how much I destroyed my brain, I just can not come up with a word in any of the seven languages ​​in which the film was shot. I have no idea what's going on all the time and in the middle of the movie I needed to bleed. No movie ever made it. Never in my life did I want so much cauliflower, milk and baguette. Thank you. - Ed Ed. <br /> <br /> Uh. * cleans throat * no words. No thoughts. I do not know. Really do not know. - Cait
