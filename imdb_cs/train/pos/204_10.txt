First, I do not like almost all the films Neil Simon. But it's something that's unique, it attracts me and I think it's one of the most adventurous comedies I've ever seen. The second time I watched it, the connection was clear. When did Neil Simon meet his grandmothers? <br /> <br /> Oh, they're afraid they could sue, so they turned them into a man. And how boring it would be if there were only housewives, the biz star show is more fun. Well, this is a personal review, and my ever-living grandmother at the age of 97 (even even surpassing Walter Matthau's magnificent pretense!) She would have denied it - but some of you must find resonance in these characters. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I have little tolerance for George Burns, but somehow he turned to one of the best supporting performances I can remember (and my late grandmother even liked her even though she did not know the remarkable similarities, which she shared with the film character). </ span> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < For me, pleasure persists.
