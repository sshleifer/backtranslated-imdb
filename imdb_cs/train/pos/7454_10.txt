** Warning - this post may contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I only have Gamecube in September 2005 and the first two games I bought were James Bond games, a decent Agent Under Fire and a dark Goldeneye Rogue Reagent. Another game I wanted to get is All or Nothing, because my friend told me it's better than the two games I already had. I must say he was right. <br /> <br /> I bought it a tenth in HMV, and when I returned home, I slammed it into my cube and played it for hours. It was much better than my other two games and there was a much better and more interesting story. Graphics were one of the best I've ever seen (but now, when XBOX 360 is released, Farcry Instincts Predator has some of the best graphics known to man). The story was smart; (Willem Dafoe, named as Nikolai Diavolo) and the beautiful henchwoman (Heidi Klum, named Katya Nadanova), trying to destroy the world using small nanobots that at the beginning of the game, you, James Bond, have to destroy the train. The bad thing is that one of them is hidden in Katy's breasts. Then you must suppress their plans and save the world. The big thing in this game is that it actually has actresses who express characters such as Cleese with Q statement. There are 27 levels, some of them short and some of them quite long and difficult. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Sound - 9/10 Replay value - 7/10 Multiplayer - 8/10 <br /> <br /> I give this game a total of 90%
