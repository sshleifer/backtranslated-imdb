A woman who remained alone after her husband's death finds himself in love with her son's friend and a handsome man. In a slightly twisted story, a woman begins to sleep with a smart man in an effort to revive herself. Twisted part? A handsome man is also her daughter on her back and interest. <br /> <br /> As if it was not strange, her mother will fall down and when her daughter finds she accuses not only her dysfunctional relationship but her misjudged life on her poor mother. Though you think wrong about this woman, the truth is the film can render it in positive light. He played Anne Reid beautifully, this character has a dimension and portrays great emotions. <br /> <br /> Great performance and a nice movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
