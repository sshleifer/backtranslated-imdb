Wow. What a wonderful movie. The script is almost perfect, it seems to be the only film written by Minglun Wei, I hope he has more stories in it. Actor acting is noble. It seemed Zhou as Doggie was amazing - a very natural talent, and Xu Zhu was a pleasure - very believable as a crazy old traditionalist. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was very effective and led without being overwhelming. <br /> <br /> If only other movies like Hollywood or Hong Kong were made, a well-functioning, well-written, well-managed, almost perfect gem.
