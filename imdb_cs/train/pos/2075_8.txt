To say that the film is depressing is not necessarily a bad thing. I am very willing to watch a depressive film if there is a point, and it certainly has. It is often the heartbreaking story of a Chinese man and his family who have been experiencing many years of difficulty and quantity. But I must warn you that this could be about the most depressing film that came out of Hollywood in the thirties - because China's rural life was TOUGH the smallest. Be prepared to watch segments of famine, death and illness. The only negative, rather than permanent, tone of misery is that Paul Muni plays the lead. While he was an extremely talented man, it's just a shame that Hollywood has always occupied people of European descent to play Asian leadership during this time. If you have paid attention at all, it is quite obvious that Muni is wrong for this part.
