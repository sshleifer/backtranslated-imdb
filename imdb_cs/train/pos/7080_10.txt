Terry Gilliam gives a stunning movie I enjoyed. Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Brad Pitt and even the little look of Christopher Plummer make the movie absolutely brilliant! That's the only Terry Gilliam movie I've seen, and Twelve Monkeys are definitely in my ten. I think it's one of Bruce Willis's four best films; and Brad Pitt is the best. Brad Pitt delivers perfect performance. Maybe one of the top ten actors I've ever seen. He played his role (Geoffrey) very convincingly. Bruce Willis's role (James Cole) was also quite convincing. Both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt worked extremely well. With a brilliant story that will support great performances; and to support it, the excellent direction of Terry Gilliam.
