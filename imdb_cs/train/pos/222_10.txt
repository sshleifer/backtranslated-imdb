Cheerful comedy Neil Simon, which evokes laughter from beginning to end. Late Walter Matthau is a furious ex-comedian who is convinced to join his former partner (late Oscar winner George Burns) for the final reunion show on stage. Benjamin Martin is Matthau's agent and nephew, and both have the same chemistry as Matthau and Burns. I like Matthau's pointless character - it's the same as it is always, and yet it's also very different. Burns, like an absent old man, is as entertaining as Matthau. > <br /> Matthau: Do you want some crackers? I have coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: What about a bare cracker? <br /> <br /> Matthau: I'm not clear. I have coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: Well <br/> <br/> Matthau: They're in the kitchen cabinet. <br /> <br /> Burns: Maybe later. <br /> <br /> Or as this: <br /> <br /> Matthau: When I did black, the whites knew what I was saying! <br /> <br /> You can see it in the movie to understand! All in all, a refreshing cheerful, sweet, warm, warm, honest character of comedy with heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time. <br /> <br /> They just do not have it! At a time when all the latest comedies are gross, juvenile and silly, it leans back to the subtle core of what is really a comedy - fun characters, clever and fun dialogue and great fun. of the best comedian comrades of all time, with "Aircraft, Trains and Cars", "Lethal Weapon" and "The Hard Way". <br /> <br /> or on TV, but trust me, it will be worth it! <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5 stars. <br /> <br /> - John Ulmer
