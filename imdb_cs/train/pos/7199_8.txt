Editor Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) has a flop after a big hit. He gets a play written by his student, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), who is fantastic. It's so good that Sidney says she's going to kill her. It will be? Thriller of a thinking man. The game was originally ... and it shows it. It's mostly on one set and everyone talks, but I never got bored. It is very well written with many twists and turns full of power. Caine is great as Bruhl - another of his great performances. Reeve is surprisingly very good. I never really believed him as an actor, but he is really good in this role. Dyan Cannon makes miracles with Bruhl's wife signed. Irene Worth is also good (and quite funny) like Helga ten Drop, psychic. But her accent got nervous. Director Sidney Lumet with his only set very well. The camera is still moving and keeps your attention. <br /> <br /> EXTREME SPOILER DEAD AHEAD !!!!! My only complaint is that two homosexual characters in this film will turn out to be a furious sociopath and also contains one of the most humorous kisses I have ever seen - but these are mild complaints. good thriller. Critics hate this film (for some reason) and it seems to have completely vanished since its premiere in 1982. That's too bad - it deserves better.
