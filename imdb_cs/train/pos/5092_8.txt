I thought King Solomon's mines were beautifully finished. My only reservation was Alison Doody. Her acting was great, but her makeup and hair were not at this time, and she always seemed to be out of place alongside other actors. I thought Patrick Swayze was an excellent choice for Alan Quatermain. It was nice to see an experienced actor and actor in this role, and after sitting in a movie with actors such as Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, etc. It was a great choice and I enjoyed every minute of this movie. This version can not be compared to Stewart Grainger's version of 1950. It was a big screen movie and was not made for television. I thought both Quatermains were plausible, but both media had to be separated. I look forward to seeing it once more, and I hope Patrick Swayze will look again for these roles.
