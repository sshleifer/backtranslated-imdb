When I heard the release of "Hammerhead" on DVD and eventually I found it in my local DVD store, I thought "well, just another cheap monster from Nu Image". These boys around Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner have created cheap but very fun B-Pictures in the last few months, but also some very unsatisfactory movies. So I did not expect much, especially after watching somewhat disappointing "Shark Zone" just a few days before. But "Hammerhead" has proved to be an excellent revival of 50s monster films. We have a crazy scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, screaming women and girls in distress, human-eating plants, and of course we have a creature, a huge mutant mixture between man and a hammer shark. All you need for a funny movie about a monster. The only thing missing is the graphic sex scenes and the nudity you expect in movies of this kind, but because the movie was made for television, it's understandable why these scenes are missing. And it does not matter because "Hammerhead" is action and horror fun. There are two reasons why I gave him seven out of ten points: "First, the monster is not seen too often, and the conflict with the destruction of the creature is too fast and wrong, and secondly, William Forsythe is just not the right kid for the" hero " he loves the beautiful Hunter Tylo, and I can recommend this movie to all fans of the fans, to catch a cool drink and some popcorn to watch this movie and have fun.
