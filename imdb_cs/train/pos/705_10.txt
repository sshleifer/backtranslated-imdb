I came across Insomnia's nightmare when I was looking for independent independent films and liked to say it did not disappoint. This crazy, half-hour ride was all about me and the end was great - one of the NOOOOO moments that really stayed with you. I showed it to a number of people and it seems that everyone agrees. Little girl girl was very talented and I think her performance stole the show. She spit out of me, I can say a lot. Nanavati did a great job when she joined this short work. All the pieces just fall into place and you can say she's a great writer of what she's done with this script. So well written. It is undoubtedly the strongest part of the film. The direction was great and the acting was pleasant, but the most important factor is the power of the script. Good job of this girl, I can not wait to see more!
