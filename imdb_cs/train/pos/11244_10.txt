One of my best films at all, perhaps because I got into the punk scene in the late 1970s and went to many concerts about the hazel but the film was a good story line and played very well hazel and up and coming Phil Daniels of course the latest Eastenders project! excellent performance a lot of unfamiliar actors who, if you keep your eyes peeled, will see them in many British soaps today exp: Carver of Billo, the more I look at it, the more it is in place even though you have not seen it yet my night with video, do not forget to dig a safety pin for your nose and heavy make-up black eyes and stick head Mochanian style .... Enjoy
