And I'm not saying it wrong. When watching this movie in the cinema I was 6 or 7 years old. For me and my cousins, it was both magical, beautiful and frightening. When we left the theater, Michael was our best friend, even though we knew he had no idea. Over the years, I've seen this movie broadcast several times, but I've always changed the channel. Even a few seconds when it would return that feeling of spell and warm heart. And so I liked it. So I've seen this movie once and I believe it was a good decision not to worry again. If I saw it today, I know I could not help but criticized MJ's acting, the conspiracy (if there was one) and this and that. For me, this is a child's memory, so my feelings towards him are children 20 years ago. I see that the adult interferes with my evaluation and gives him 8 for memories and wonderful music. For a young child who watched it with respect 20 years ago, it is definitely worthwhile.
