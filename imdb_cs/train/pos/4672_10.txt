I saw Brother's shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and he loved it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as father and son. The film follows Scott Cohen from being released to Alaska back to his family in Brooklyn. He walks out there because his brother died and set off on his way to slowly repair his stolen relationship with his brother's wife and child and his father who never forgave him for being a black family sheep. The story brings us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to understand the complexity of your life in deeper. Also pictures of the woodworking business and Brooklyn background create a tone for this rich and revealing family portrait.
