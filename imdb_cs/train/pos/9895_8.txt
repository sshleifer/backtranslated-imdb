A lot of popular high school students play a cruel joke on the undefiled Marty (a sympathetic performance by Simon Scuddamore), which leaves him terribly distorted. Five years later, the gang returns to the now disintegrating and abandoned high school. Of course, an angry and vengeful Marty dressed in a jester costume appears to convincingly revenge on his torturers. Writers / directors Mark Ezra, Peter Litten and George Dugdale sneak out of all the loving jewels that make the 80s slice'n'd the body count so much nasty fun: fake jumping horrible, striding Steadican shots, wild storms, crazy groovy hard rock soundtrack, a nice blur of free female nudity, absolutely absurd "what the hell?" supernatural climax, glossy make-up f / x and one of those merciful lamas "it was all just a terrible dream" of a fake non-ending. In addition, complicated murderous pieces add horrible things: Gory points out that his stomach explodes after drinking poisoned beer, acid lady, a man crushed under a huge tractor, and two people having wild passionate sex. Thirty British Sultan Horror Siren Caroline Munro is in the first third of the movie as an American teenager cheerfully. All casts are full of performances, particularly from Carmine Iannaccone as Smaralleck's leader Skip Pollack, Billy Hartman as a faded macho meathead Frank and Donna Yeager as a dirty Stella slut. Co-producer Dick Randall has fun portraits like Munr's dirty agent Manny. Harry's manfredini's moody, spirited music is relentlessly recycling the cues from his "Friday 13th" score. The amazing cinematography of Alan Pudney is a trick. Good, scary fun.
