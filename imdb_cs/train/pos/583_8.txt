Two brothers grow up in a small town in Montana. One of them is Norman (Craig Sheffer), second Paul (Brad Pitt). Their father is Reverend Maclean and grows up with his lessons related to religion and fishing lessons. In this movie flying-fishing presents life, a bit. The story is good and keeps your attention even though there are times when you need a little action. Probably the movie has these moments because it is not a real event, but a message. But some things happen. Norman goes to Dartmouth to study. After six years he returns and joins a pretty girl named Jessie (Emily Lloyd) and is invited to teach in Chicago. Paul became a reporter and is known as a "fishing reporter." He is famous and seems to have a nice life, but he drinks a little too much and plays too much. The film is very well controlled, it has a nice score and all the actors are good. The most beautiful thing in this movie is cinematography. Mountains, forests and the river look very beautiful. If the film were made for just these things, it would be good if they could be watched. Fortunately, there is more.
