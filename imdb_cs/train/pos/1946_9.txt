I have not believed Star Trek for the past 2-3 years. With the arrival of Netflix and the distribution of video technology after 2000, I was able to get into the past of all the big episodes of Star Trek. For those who really do not watch every episode and know them by heart, through TNG, DS9, Voyager, etc., the General People's Consensus says - "I love the New Generation" the best. That's because Captain Picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared for the decade of Star Trek starvation. But to be sincerely honest, I appreciate the creativity of Voyager's episodes more than TNG. Voyager's episodes are also going through time, unlike TNG. Allotted data from TNG is great, but they're getting old, but Dr. Voyager - it's creativity now! Instead of being annoying and explosive, give it the freedom to express yourself as something you imagined. Not only is Picardo so great actor but a prerequisite for his extensive growth, as a doctor, self-reflection now, what is the best science fiction! Endgame portrayed him as a husband who married "organic," invented a neuroimplantation transceiver for the human-machine interface, and even in an episode before Endgame did not obey the captain's order and make "human" mistakes. Unlike the DS9, which has been blessed by two beautiful women since the first episode, Voyager has to survive three seasons without Jeri Ryan and I believe it is Picardo who carried them with his personality. Of course, the rest of Voyager chemistry is effortless, Harry Kim and Tom Paris - very natural. I like occasional humor even though I'm Vulcan. Finally, I'm so glad they got rid of the original female captain - oh, when you look at the rare shots - thanks to God for Kate! Over the course of seven years, she has developed into a very confident, credible and serious female captain. What a great job! Thanks to Star Trek for making Voyager, I like every episode, creative exploration of possibilities, morals and our cosmic size.
