The end of the era was released here in the US in the spring of 2002 with "The Rookie", Disney action movie, which looked like "the best on the last !!!!!" It happened right in Texas! In fact, the story began in Western Texas, as evidenced by the area code found on the sign there. He was probably a high school coach who was so convinced by his top baseball team that he decided to go professionally !!!!! What I liked about this movie: It was nice !!! !! It was a very good sports movie, but the "The Mighty Ducks" trilogy. They also got viewers in Texas, somewhere between Panhandle and El Paso to the Metroplex (where I live). I can say it because I recognized the ball (it was "The Ballpark in Arlington", now it's "Ameriquest Field")! It was nice to see Disney's "Golden Age" end here in my area !!!!! <br /> <br /> RIP Golden Age of Disney <br /> <br /> 1920 -Spring 2002 <br /> <br /> "It all started with my mouse ... and it ended with a baseball."
