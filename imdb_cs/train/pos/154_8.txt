"El Mar" directed by the Catalan director Agus Villaron and based on the novel Blai Bonet, offers a view of Spanish history as seen by the balearist author who will bring the viewer back to the days of civil war in that country. The film focuses on three buddies and watches them from the first days after the start of the Mallorcan war a few years later, when two of these friends meet again when they are in the sanatorium, lost in the countryside. > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First we meet three boys playing happily. Not everything is what it seems. The tragic death of one of them points to the cruelty of the one who committed the evil deed. The boys excluded that the young girl, their age, would not take part in their games. When we meet the adult Ramal again, he's on his way to the sanatorium. He appears to be suffering from tuberculosis. To his surprise, one of his young friends Manuel Tur is also treated, and a young girl who has not been invited to participate in her games is now one of the nuns who oversees their health care. It is obvious that Tur is looking at Ramalla in a way that only means he is in love with hard torture. Their relationship will have devastating consequences. Roger Casamajor has a good job of showing older Ramall. Bruno Bergonzino looks like Tur, a vulnerable youth. Antonia Torrens plays Sor Francisca with conviction. Angela Molina, performs as Carmen, wife of the institution manager. Simon Andreu is perfect as Alcantara. "El Mar" is a dark film that clearly shows the talents of Agusti Villaron in reviving the novel for the audience.
