As Grinch Stole Christmas immediately stole my heart and became my favorite film almost since my first tour. Now, eight views later, it still has the same impact on me as it did for the first time when I saw it. Screenwriters Jeffery Price and Peter S. Seaman of Who Framed Roger Rabbit Glory do a fantastic job adapting the story of The Grinch to the screen. Directorate Ron Howard has brought the story to life, and Jim Carrey is typically energetic as The Grinch steals the show. Some critics of the film claimed that it was not the true spirit or principles of an original story. After reading the original story, I must say I can not agree. The film makes the same point about Christmas and its true meaning as the original story. In fact, it improves the impact of the story by being more personal by showing us how and why Grinch has become what he was. <br /> <br /> * MILD SPOILERS * (You probably would not destroy your movie ... but if you have not seen them yet and you are one of those who want to know anything about the story until you see it, you should skip two more paragraphs. <br /> <br /> I think almost everyone can relate to Grinch's terrible experiences at school. I think every one of us was at that time someone unpopular at a school that was always chosen. I know I was ... and that's why I personally had so much sympathy with The Grinch and what he went through. And Cindy Lou Who is naive idealism, believing that no one can be bad, was the heart of the burst. When everyone else turned their backs on The Grinch out of fear and ignorance, Cindy Lou was determined to be his friend. If everyone could have such an attitude. <br /> <br /> Actually, I think the only thing that could make the movie a bit better would be that it would make the humor and the content of teenagers even more relaxed. It was quite restrained, but any of these adult humor (like when Grinch hit his nose first by splitting Martha May Whovier) simply does not fit into such a story. <br /> <br /> This is good on your way of becoming a Christmas classic, with a richly deserved place along the book and cartoon Chuck Jones books as a must for every Christmas season.
