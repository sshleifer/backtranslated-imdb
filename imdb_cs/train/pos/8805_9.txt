It's a patchwork of 911. 11 stories from 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humorous, sometimes boring (for example, first), sometimes the Americans said "we have more deaths than you and you supported the assassins," sometimes really weird (but highly symbolic interesting). I loved Claude Lelouch (a couple's personal life in New York, showing that our everyday "problems" are unimportant), Shoei Imamura (bizarre, strongly against the wars in general) and Idrissa Ouedraogo (funny, typical African optimism despite terrible daily misery); Youssef Chahine (Egyptian intellectual, pro-peace, moral difficulties to adopt US policy towards the Arab countries). I'm really pleased that many Americans liked this movie. It shows that we (or I am still Belgian, but I have been living in Texas for 12 years) are still interested in other cultures and are able to challenge our past and present government as if we were in a democracy.
