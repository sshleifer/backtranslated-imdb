I saw yesterday "The Grudge" and wow ... I was really scared, good thing. I like horror movies and I really enjoyed it. There were so many surprising scenes (what is the English word?) That made you jump to your place. Though too much shouting from the audience made it laugh. I think the worst scene was ... in the bus when the face flashes on the window or when Yoko walks without a chin. Make-up is also very good. Sometimes you really could see it was there, but it still provided a scenic view of the scene. The boy was really good, so cute without make-up and so terribly scary with it. Next time I hear the noise, I'm going to feel pretty scared ...
