The 70s Show is the best TV show ever, the season. She's there with the Andy Griffen Show, Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons in my book. The 1970s continue for eight periods, focusing on a group of adolescents / young adults who deal with relationships separated from their parents and their overall future. The two main characters, Eric and Donna, are two teenagers who live side by side. They live side by side for most of their life and feel more mutual feelings at the beginning of the first season. A lot of the show revolves around how their relationship works. Two other characters, Red and Kitty, are Eric's parents. Red was in service, so he really pushed Eric. Kitty is just the opposite. Despite drinking heavily, he treats Eric and his friends with great care. Bob, their neighbor, is obviously Don's dad. Bob is going to show up with some women in the rough story. Bob also eats red in full. The remaining character, Hyde, Kelso, Fez and Jackie, are Eric's friends. They also play a leading role in the story of the show. <br /> <br /> Well, the first season is great. At that time the characters begin to feel new things to each other. The first season is original, fun and enjoyable. The second season is good, though not as good as the first. It is a fundamental continuation of the First. Eric and Donna are together and everything works great. <br /> <br /> The third season is my favorite. She returned and captured the feeling and humor of the first season. I also think the character of chemistry has improved the band, which will show that it's all fun to watch. <br /> <br /> The fourth season is not that good. Eric and Donna Arne't together in this, so the show is a little less pleasant. It's still funny, even though I did not like it like in previous seasons. <br /> <br /> The fifth season is the last season I enjoyed all the time. It's Senior Year of the Gang, so it really helps with the story. The fifth season also had the best ending of all seasons. <br /> <br /> The sixth season is for the most part good. It's extremely fun, though it does not catch the feeling of other seasons. The gang is out of high school, so I think it did not make the teen feel of the previous season. I also did not like the last three or four episodes because they thought they had a great run for them. <br /> <br /> The seventh season captures the same feeling that the 5th season had some way, it will not do it all the way. I enjoyed the seventh season, like I did all the rest, and the end is great. <br /> <br /> The last season was exhausted. Eric was not in the one who destroyed it. Kelso was not much in it, which helped me. I hated the seaside season until the last episode. I thought the last episode was really good and the end of the series was over. <br /> <br /> So, overall, if you like comedy, put it 70s Show and try. They stopped producing new episodes, but it's still on TV. I also recommend buying the seasons 1-7. It's up to you if you want to buy Season 8.
