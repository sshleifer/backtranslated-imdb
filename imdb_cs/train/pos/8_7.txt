A very good track, though it seemed to have several empty areas that left the audience to fill themselves. I can imagine that life is for someone who can not read or write. This film has just taken hold of the real world: the wife who is suddenly the only supporter, living relatives and their quarrels, a troubled child who goes off and then usually leaves school, crazy husband, nests eggs and buys beer with him. 2 inches up.
