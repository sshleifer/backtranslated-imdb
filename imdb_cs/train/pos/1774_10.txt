After filming the world-renowned world series, Father Ted Arthur Matthews and another Graham Linehan creator, was a forgotten BBC jewel named "Hippies." Although he created a couple of six scripts written by Arthur Matthews himself. <br /> <br /> Set in London in 1969 - Ray Purbs, hippie, is editor of an anarchist magazine. His friends are his girlfriend, very calm and cannabis smokes Alex, his "girlfriend" is feminist Jill and no one too bright Hugo. Simon Pegg was great as Ray, but he's great in everything he's in. This sitcom felt "Citizen Smith". Ray was very similar to Wolfie Smith, trying to defeat the company, but failed unfortunatelly. Finally, this comedy will be released on DVD in March, I can not wait to buy it. Just as in 1999, and it's been repeated on terrestrial television - my memories are not from a comic book, I still remember the two episodes very clearly, the first is the "Protesting hippies" that I thought was a great start - where Ray continues to protest against the glasses and the second episode was "Hippy Dippy Hippies," which in my opinion is Episode 4, again a clear memory of the Police. Sadly, the sitcom provoked a negative reaction from the audience (I can not think why). The BBC entered another series, but Arthur Matthews opposed him because of a negative reaction. Well, I can not wait for the DVD. <br /> <br /> Best Episode: Hippy Dippy Hippies - Series 1, Episode 4.
