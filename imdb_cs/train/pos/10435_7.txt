My watch came a little late, but I'm glad I watched this and the sequel ... which brings me to the compliments of the film makers for the fact that such a clean and basic treatment brought the idea of ​​romanticism ... and very marginally separated from the idea relationships! As already written about the film, it would be worthwhile to emphasize several parts of the film I personally loved. I think this is the place where Jesse and Celine phonely call their friends were a very smart way of telling each other what they meant in a way that did not even last for 24 hours ... the curiosity of two people who think they the second caused an infallible impact on the other, was very cleverly solved ... <br /> <br /> On the front of the fence, making a romantic story of a job on a clean conversation is not an easy job to achieve .. I believe in romantic flicks such a taste, characters are not clearly designed neither in the mind of writer and director. What actors are saying is what happens to them. Right or wrong, even the bearers of ideas would be hard to justify ... becoming a character, the life the actor gives must go beyond the instructions and the story ... here both actors do just the right job! Kudos .. !!! and before the sunset is another feather that makes this even more beautiful!
