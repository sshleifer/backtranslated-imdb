ABC has done more for this show by allowing television veterans James Garner and David Spade to join the cast of this show. Initially, the show was observable and even predictable with John Ritter and Katey Sagal. John's loss shocked the world. Katey and the three kids are really professional cast. An hour lesson after John's death in real life struck home to me. I lost my father at the age of 17 and I could compassion and understand their pain and suffering. ABC should be proud to maintain this exhibition and even preserve it as John's final wish. This show was born and evolved from such impossible circumstances. They should be rewarded with Emmy.
