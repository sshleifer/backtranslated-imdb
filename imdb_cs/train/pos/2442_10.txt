This film is an Irish side that Americans do not usually see, an anxiously religiously prejudiced side of "the friendliest race in the world." The film that admitted that Fethard residents are older enough to remember events is fairly accurate (although they insist that filmmakers have invented some of the more violent scenes just to revive action) <br /> The film was in Ireland, very unpopular because it portrayed the Catholic Church in the wrong light, but the simple fact is that representatives of the Catholic Church * organized a minority veto (they were Jews before the Protestants). <br /> <br /> The film is a fascinating insight into the whole issue of religion in Ireland
