The election marks the second film motion picture directed by Johnnie To. The amazing revelation of Simon Yan and Tony Leung Kar Fai as Lok and Big D, as two test members who have been selected as candidates for the position of Chairman of Ho Sing, a 100 year old test company. <br /> <br /> While Lok is a man who is still cold, the big D is not only impatient but also thinks he's upstairs. Lok was elected as the next chairman for 2 years. For the full control of the gang, the newly elected President must be handed over by a Dragon Label that represents power and authority. Big D was extremely dissatisfied with the results that he was not elected the next president after paying a fair number of bribes to the members of the council. He ordered the man to get Baton before he falls into Lok's hands. <br /> <br /> While Big D gets Baton, Lok has other plans for him. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movie movie movies where there is not much need for bloodshed. Johnnie This brings greed to human beings in a movie where bloodshed is commonly used in other movie films by a test company that show how the greed of human beings can cause death or the decline of one. However, there is no bullet used, in the election negotiations almost no gangfights will participate. It's a battle of reasoning that makes Elections out of the way. In addition to Maggie Shiu, the only actress in the less than 5-line election that speaks throughout the movie, masculinity governs the entire movie. Louis Koo and Nick Cheung, who have been seen in the previous Torah film, are thrown off as a secret policeman and gangster who has sold his life to the gang. Together with some of the veterans who appeared in the film in the film and with an excellent screenplay, he is the only HK film that represents the Cannes Film Festival 2005. The election hardly succeeded critics who want another film movie society.
