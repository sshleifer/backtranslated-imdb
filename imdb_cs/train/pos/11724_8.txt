Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) hosts a cheap horror show. When she finds out that her dead aunt has left some things, she goes to England to pick her up, hoping it will be some money. But to her horror, the elvis finds that all her aunts have left her, her house, the dog, and the cook. Elvira decides to settle in the house anyway, but with a striking dark look and amazing features she will not be able to live in peace. All the neighbors are now rotating the whole city against her and Elvira's outrageous attitude and looks all look better because Elvira is in the fire! I really enjoyed this movie, it's really fun to watch Elvira get into all these adventures, it's great. The whole movie takes you into a halloween mood, of course, it's stupid and jokes are cheap, but it's a pleasure to watch. I would give Elvira, Mrs. of Darkness 8/10
