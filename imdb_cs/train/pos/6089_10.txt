Okay, I skipped it a little to sort out at least one of those nasty reviews. But I liked it. I did not speak out loud but kept my interest and dragged me without ever letting go of it. Story built. Yeah, you knew it would have a happy ending - this genre always does. Meanwhile, it was strange to look at gags you might miss, so pay attention. Stiller and Black have succeeded again. Good team. They should cooperate more. You do not know it will be a classic culture, but it was definitely a fun ride. It's not as good as CO BOB or DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS but what is it? It's still worth getting out of your way a bit to get to watch this movie.
