Five deadly poisons are easily the most memorable K.F. moving from the Shaw Brothers (possibly the master of the killer). It has artists who have come to be known as simply "The Venoms," some of the best martial choreography ever, and, surprisingly for the Kung Fu movie, a great plot! One of my favorite times !!!
