For such films as "Anchors Aweigh", few people have been awarded the Academy Award for the warmth of a happy hour. Either in 1945, he was a good year for a good film, or he was still a bit shocked by Billy Wilder's "The Lost Weekend" that he wrote anything that started A on the best photo vote to please the ever-growing musical picture of the faithful public. Since Gene Kelly was nominated for this performance instead of his role in "Singin 'in the Rain", there had to be something wrong with the chassis system in MGM. Of course, the studio is on its best behavior during this much-lauded tour of the great studies and Hollywood itself, useful for those on the other side of the world. <br /> <br /> Yet, the brilliant talents of Gene and Frank Sinatra are sure to be a nice farce, despite the need for more people to hang out on musical views, so today's audiences would not be wept with unnecessary run time. There were much longer pieces before and since, but in this case all the charming scenes of Kathryn Grayson could be removed. Until tracking "Kiss Me Kate", it may be necessary for the neopher to watch enthusiastically one of her films with a remote control in her hand. <br /> <br /> If women were to be trained on 1949's On the Town, maybe the shore left happy sailors, he did not have to promise to bankrupt Josu Iturbim's debut and perform the piano "Susie". Few are lucky to get a test screen on MGM gold studios. Then few people are even happier than to attend. There are no regrets about Susan Abbot's successful screenings or Kathryn Grayson, but she does a constant non-operative hope for a pink slip that will be handed out to both. <br /> <br /> But for all, stellar talents are a good form and above-average score that defends with a light but fun big navy tale connected with young ambitious naval boys who are good for late eruptions of wartime morale, Kotvy at least do not question selecting a bad movie MGM. Direction holds because the cast transmits the story in beautiful color cinematography. Whenever someone falls into music or song, the film makes a joyful opportunity. <br /> <br /> The natural highlight of the film is the adventures of Gene Kelly in fantasyland, culminating in brilliant dance with Jerry the mouse. This is a worthwhile Kelly career and it is nice to know that he thought this before Fred Astaire started dancing on the walls and ceilings. It's not exactly a triple taste, stewed chocolate, chocolate waffle, cream and cherry and banana whipped cream, but it's a square, careful salt of sugar that eventually melts into your mouth, and the feel of guilt is still a pleasant feeling. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
