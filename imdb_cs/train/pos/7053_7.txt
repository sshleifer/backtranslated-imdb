Do not mix "War Inc." for a sharply carved satire, or for a nasty comedy full of jokes for news lovers. It's not. This is an old-fashioned comedy with beetles, with absurdly random conspiracy conspiracies, action figures (given depth in fun shows by John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff) and direct access to political content. You see that the political points of filmmakers are things that almost all countries already know are true. Yeah, we understand that the corporation that profits from the war is corrupted, stupid pigs, leading political leaders are even more awkward, and American imperialism has never looked frighter and more than the one concerned than now - but none of this is a reason. <br /> <br /> Here is everything that is noise, which is kindness - sometimes in brilliant ways - as a backdrop for stupidity, as the character of John Cusack (hit - a man with heart) tries to change his life with a help journalist, (Tomei) and a young Middle Eastern star who wants to revoke his marriage (Duff). Cusack's sister, Joan, plays her assistant with almost caricatured excitement. Ben Kingsley felt I was lost in his lesser part as a ruthless CIA chief. That's all, and it works. It's simple fun, but if you do not see reality, and you think war is going well and everyone involved is doing good work and there is no corruption, and people in the Middle East want our Western culture to replace them, maybe you would not find it funny. <br /> <br /> For all of us, it was a light comedy with political boundaries.
