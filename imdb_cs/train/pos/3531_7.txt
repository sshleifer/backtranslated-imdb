Robert Siodmak is doing a wonderful job with this B noir with Ella Raines, Franchot Tone, and Alan Curtis. And it will do, I could add, without much help from my male actors, ie. Curtis and Tone. It's all about Raines, a pretty, legendary actress who for some reason has never reached the status of her "noir" counterparts. Siodmak's use of sex, light, shadows, and music is truly remarkable when he deals with this genre. Shadows, light effects and camera angles are all effective. But the highlight of the movie is played in a nightclub with a very sexual drum riff from Elisha Cook, based on excited Raines. It is this scene that brings "Phantom Lady" to the new territory. Siodmak's commitment to material equals only Raines, who gives honest performance as the in love woman is trying to save her husband. Franchot Tone called this. Alan Curtis did not look excited to die, and he did not seem to be happy to have lived. And never, except for a brief moment in jail, he seems to be in love with Raines. The fun thing about many of these films is that as the World War II progressed, the interest in psychiatry deepened. Often, however, expressions were misspelled in movies such as "Property", "Spellbound" and "The Biggest Show on Earth". The tone is called paranoid Thomas Gomez - Tone probably has some paranoia associated with his disorder but seems to be closer to the psychopath. In fact, as his headaches prove, he can have a brain tumor that pushes him against his brain. Phantom Lady has the biggest plot, but it's worth watching.
