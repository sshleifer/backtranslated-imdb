Loss at a nuclear power plant causes most people to turn into lethal, rotten, defamatory zombies, of course, suffering from horrid storms. A nasty group of uninfected people is trying to survive this exhausting misery. Producer / co-author / producer Todd Sheets portrays an appealing, sincere love and passion for a lively and terrible terrible ride: keeps the rhythm rhythm constant, fills the screen with the crazy wall of the action, and fortunately maintains a terrible dialogue at a comfortable minimum. In addition, Sheets does not weaken the famous graphic and excessive over-spraying: this image brings a delicious bite of melting, tiredness, plenty of intestines, harassing one person, and even a nice dent on a tree branch. Leaves gain bonus points that keep the tone indefinite and bad at the literally bitter end (for example, almost all the main characters become zombie chow). I admit that this film has a fair share of its shortcomings: fragmented editing, several attempts at the fifth attempt of champagne and very frantic acting from unlimited casting all leave a good job. Best honors to go to the beautiful and brilliant Kasey Rausch for her winning gorgeous performance by the ingenious Daria Trumillio. Frank Dunlay as well as rugged Army veteran Ralph Walsh. Best of all, Sheet's grasping of the infamous sense of spookyness from an inconspicuous dark hyboku and an obvious relationship to a horror genre will ensure that it remains a complete explosion that will be traced from beginning to end.
