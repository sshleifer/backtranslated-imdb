Surprisingly complicated and well-worked study of the "First" serial killer in the USSR. She met in the days of perestroika, this intense piece was full of life with the performances of Stephen Reah and Donald Sutherland. This examination of Cicatilla as a murderer is well rounded and suggests some of his behavior, while on the right shows others are softness that is convincing without being openly graphic. This is not a weak heart because it is an object that is often disturbing but necessary to fully develop the main participants in this reality-based story. HBO has captured an excellent movie in an unusual way. Congratulations to the director and editor of this great piece of work. This is in my Top 10 Must See List.
