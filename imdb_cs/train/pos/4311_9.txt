This work is not about Steve Martin Davis, but Kline (Mack) and Glover (Simon) and Kline and McDonnell (Claire), but the dialogue, embedded over Davis, contemplates contemplative and almost poetic existentialism. He is funny, intelligent and thoughtful both in dialogue and in content. The writers deserved the Oscar. <br /> <br /> Performance is simple, relaxed and natural; what would you expect from "A List" actors? Martin contributes to the performance that leads to his newer Shopgirl, who leads you through life, love, and wisdom, if not happiness. Kline is a straight - suit - film conformist and as such his performance is sharp and refreshing. This work deals with life in all respects. It creates a true emotional investment in her characters and leaves you feeling the hope that humanity is not condemned, after all, no matter what you believe, deep down. <br /> <br /> In all? This is wonderful, with a giant moment or two easy natural dialogue that attracts you, helping your audience to gain a great deal of enjoyment from this work. It is definitely worth your time, though it may not be the best choice of each of you as a Friday / Saturday night entertainment. <br /> <br /> I really liked the intelligence she had been exposed to. It is not typical and it was an unexpected surprise. Another amazing surprise was the honesty that we are exposing here. Couples and friends hold detailed interviews that feel and sound completely honest and (again) natural. I was very impressed with this work and will add it to the DVD collection soon. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
