This movie is so wonderful that it's hard to find words to describe it. That's the only time I can not decide what's better, a book or a movie. Whoopi Goldberg is awesome and Oprah Winfrey, such a good actress, can be funny, happy and poor all at the same time. The entire movie was well directed by Steven Speilberg and should not go through. 9/10
