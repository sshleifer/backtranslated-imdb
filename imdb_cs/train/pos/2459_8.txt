A beautiful and moving film that deserves wider attention than it is likely. Semra Turan plays Aicha, the second generation of a Turkish immigrant who is trying to break the form. Not even at home with her slightly conservative Muslim family or with her liberal Danish friends, Aicha's martial arts experience is becoming a struggle to find herself and she has the strength to be what she wants to be despite her family and friends. Director Natasha Arthy can balance introspection and narrative so she has depth without becoming a rough philosophical discourse and drawing on choreographic skills Xian Gao pays off in magnificent combat sequences. Eventually, however, is a stunning debut performance by Semra Turan, which gives the film a ghost. The raw charisma and the necessary skills of the martial arts are complemented by the heart to make her personal track credible. <br /> <br /> But you're worth it.
