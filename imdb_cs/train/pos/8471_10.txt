This is one of my favorite Mr Motose and I've seen them all. As usual, Lorre is his enchanting self as Ms. Moto. Lionel Atwill plays a wonderful curator at the museum, the usual comic relief is quite funny and there are a lot of suspects to look at. It's fast and fun. The archaeologist does not have the same taste as Thomas Beck, the usual second conductor in these programmers, but that's enough. Stepin Fetchit is on board and while he speaks stereotypically, his lines are funny, not sad for his intelligence, and he actually saves the day in his short time on the screen.
