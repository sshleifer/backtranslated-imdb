While this film has many flaws, it's actually a fun 80th movie. Eddie Murphy was filming in the 1980s. While his character is indistinguishable from earlier films, his timing is almost flawless, with perfect partners and foils. A couple with the hypnotic beauty of Charlotte Lewis, it makes for fun a rainy day action-comedy movie. <br /> <br />
