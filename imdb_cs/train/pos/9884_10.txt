Rawhide was a great TV western series. He concentrates on a group of cyclists led by Gil favor Gil. Most of the episodes - especially from the first three seasons - were indeed the characteristics of Favor and his men. Stars of the stars came and gone, but unlike Wagon Train rarely controlled episodes in which they appeared. Rawhide was a real, harsh West, and Gil Favor stood out as an unforgettable figure that had never forgotten. Thanks to Eric Fleming's performance, the show became a big hit. Of course he was enthusiastically supported by a great actor of good actors - Clint Eastwood, Sheb Wooley, Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines, James Murdoch, Rocky Shahan and Robert Cabal. All of these actors have left their track in television history. Rawhide captured the taste of the West, which no other series has ever made for me. Later periods tended to divide the leaders and give them individual stories. It sometimes did not work for me - it was driving cattle, and regular people provided the best stories. However, there were still some classic stories, and Rawhide remained the pinnacle of the outlet. Black and white photographs added to the bleak, realistic feeling that other Western series rarely captured. Rustlers, Indians, Commanchero, beautiful girls in distress, serial killers, all of them turned out to cause our heroes trouble. The end ended quietly when the season was less than half. Reason - Eric Fleming was leaving and Rawhide was now a headless man - real realism was gone, Gil Favor commanded respect and radiated authority - he was never infallible, and that made him even more interesting. We do not see his similar. Watch an episode whenever possible, rarely disappointing.
