This movie has so many wonderful elements to it! Reese Witherspoon's debut performance is, of course, amazing, as well as her chemistry with Jason London. The score is remarkable, light and clean. James Newton Howard improves the quality of all the films he has composed tenfold. He also seems to have a talent for films about lost days of youth, and will surely take the score for the recent "Peter Pan" and Gothic "The Village". For the first time I've seen this movie at about 13 or 14 years old, and now I'm screaming at the end, I was tearing tears or two for nostalgia. Show this movie to your daughters. It will end when it becomes a comfortable life movie.
