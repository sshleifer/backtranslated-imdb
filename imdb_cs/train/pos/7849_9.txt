This short is a mess. The words disappoint me because it is almost indescribable. Technically exceptional for over 90 years (visuals are remarkable and sometimes amazing), it's not something you look at if you like things that are secular or "normal" - because it's certainly not one of them, this is strange, a gang, but it's worth it if things like Ren and Stimpy hurt, you can skip it.
