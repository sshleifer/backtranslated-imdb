Seven pounds of Will Smith star as Ben Thomas, an IRS collector who is more interested in meeting with those who have received their tax payments. Thomas caused the deaths of seven people when he was driving his phone and the film watched his attempt to try and bathe for his, frankly, unforgivable crime. The story line is as smooth as a brick green window. What you see is exactly what's happening - even the end of the Titanic was surprising compared to the seven pounds. There is absolutely no intervention, there is no confusion or doubt as to what is going on. I usually like Will Smith when he's in full Bad Boys mode. The guy is best at sporting a gun, driving the Ford GT and saying "Aw Hell Nah" whenever he tries to act seriously that it just hits it as a pathetic attempt to get an Oscar who is so obviously desperate for. This is probably the main reason why I did not watch the film, although it is very underestimated here. There are comedy flashes, but they are gentle, in fact it was the most undervalued Will Smith performance I've ever seen, and he was fantastic and ironically he should be nominated for the main prize. <br /> <br /> The support cast was also great - Rosario Dawson looked to the deaths of the film to a large extent, and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper were cool as all other bit players. Overall, it's shy - but it's not throwing all the usual clich√©s and sentimental violin to give you a different option than to cry. Several times, even my hardened heart almost broke. You will be pressed hard so that you do not find one of the situations that do not affect your own life, which makes it a real reality. <br /> <br /> I would give it 8/10. Will Smith's Theatrical Performance Moves into Drama Without All Despair The Advancement of Happiness And Comes From Everything Better.
