Kudos director and cast for such a realistic film. Grit, lack of spell and despair brought me into the movie and kept me there. I was really amazed at how the data and information was transmitted in the film; ie newspapers, letters, etc. He kept the movie so fast that I did not feel the urge to move forward fast once. Personally, I thought that all the principles were doing great work ... it was great to see Bosworth and Kudrow in such difficult tasks. I wanted to cry sometimes. Val Kilmer did not surprise me ... his performance of this nature usually leaves me in amazement. Overall, this is a great movie you can not miss!
