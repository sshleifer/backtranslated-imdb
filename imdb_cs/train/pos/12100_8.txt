The DVD for "Danaza Macabra" (Blood Castle) is very special. This is because parts of the film are in French with subtitles and the rest is dubbed in English from French. Sometimes characters between the two characters alternate in the middle of the scene! When I tried to make the movie a JUST title or nickname, it did not matter! Special, yet observable. The story is supposed to be based on Poe's story, although I can not remember which of them. In fact, the character Poe appears at the beginning and end of the movie - although it did not look like him. <br /> <br /> A rich man bet with a guy on his luck that he can not stay at home all night. It looks like an easy bet to win - even if the house is very scary. However, it can not be as easy as the rich says that everyone who bet previously has died - yet this crazy STILL wants to make a bet! While in the house she meets beautiful Barbare Steyle and falls crazy for her. Later, however, she learns that she has died more than ten years earlier! How can it be ?! I could tell you more about the conspiracy, but I do not want to ruin any tension. Check out the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> This film gets very high marks to create a ghostly atmosphere. House, black and white cinema and music work together to create a haunted film. As for the plot, it's interesting - mainly because there are many twists and turns - so much that you're wondering who is and who is not among the undead to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing is that I apologized for the bad snake that was unnecessarily killed. As crazy as it may sound, I was sorry, and it hardly seemed necessary. Also, parents may want to know that there is a bit of nudity at the end. An amazingly beautiful woman appears upstairs, but it is not necessary for action.
