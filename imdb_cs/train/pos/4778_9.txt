Like his early masterpiece "The Elephant Man," Lynch proves to his traitors that he can tell a straightforward and simple story without losing his artistic impression. This is the true story of an older retiree (Richard Farnsworth expert) who decides to go on a tractor in several states to finally visit his stolen brother who is now at the door of death. A beautiful score from Badalamenti, beautiful photos of rural life (loving those airy cornfields) and the hands of a bold director who reveals human basic humanity, is a beautiful slice of life film. Its extremely slow pace may keep some audiences to sleep, but those who stay on a ride will eventually be well rewarded.
