This movie is a remake of two movies that were much better. The last one, Heaven Can Wait, was great, I suggest you see it. This is not so great. The last third of the movie is not that bad, and Chris Rock will show some comic fun that has got him where he is today. However, I do not know what happened to the first two parts of this film. It's playing like a really bad movie "B", where people sound like they're in some bad TV sit-com. The situation is forced and it's like trying to get a story to start a real movie. Everything seems to be really fake, and editing is bad. I do not know how they could release this movie like this. Anyway, the last part is not bad, so wait for the video and see it.
