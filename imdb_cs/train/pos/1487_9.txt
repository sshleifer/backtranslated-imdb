"Casomai" is a master story that portrays the story of a young couple walking through the dark waters of marriage. The story is very trustworthy when we narrate the strange attention between forgetting and the continuous interference of others, which is quite typical in Italy (one can wonder if such events differ elsewhere). Pavignano and D'Alatri were very well written and this is one of the strong points of the film. They play Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volo is sober and breathtaking. And the figure of a compassionate priest is funny and well rounded. Overall, this is a truly deserved film, probably one of the best Italian films of the year.
