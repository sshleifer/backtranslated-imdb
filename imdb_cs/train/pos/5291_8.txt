It's been just a week since I saw my first John Waters movie, and I was not sure what to expect a second time. <br /> <br /> While the previous movie was horribly over the top, Pecker is actually a fun movie that satirizes art critics in New York to T. Anyone who can not imagine what these "experts" are so appealing to modern art , is pleased that these demanding snobs get so full of Pecker, a boy who has just found a broken camera and started filming his friends and neighbors. Edward Furlong (Pet Sematary II, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) was surprisingly good as Pecker. There was not much meat on some of the roles in this movie, but he really shines. Christina Ricci (Prozac Nation) comes with another great performance as Pecker's girlfriend. In fact, it was a banner year for Ricci (Buffalo '66, Opposite of Sex, and Pecker.) Lili Taylor, who had only one good role in The Haunting, was also an important part of the film is really nice. <br /> <br /> There are lots of fun scenes, but I have to say the best thing is when the crown gathers to shout: "We want Bush!" "We want Bush!" "We would want you!" I thought it was a Republican convention until I saw the police dancing the dancer. They will have to look for another Waters work, especially Hairspray, in the news.
