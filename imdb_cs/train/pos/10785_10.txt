I saw it when I was small and it was great. Kelsey White as Lisa and Meecy Mices where she is cute. Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle, where Hilarius is. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was interesting. Burl Ross as a little bunny Foo Foo was funny. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was great. What Hilarius is that Snoodle and Doodle eat too much candy. What is sad that Little Bunny Foo Foo, who slaps Meecy Mices on his head and then the fairy, will bring Little Bunny Foo Foo a few wishes and then turns into a goon. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, Doodle go to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is great, the kids will look forward to this show, new words, songs and watch how they play.
