That's the funniest attitude I've ever seen, and I think it's the funniest thing I ever see. If you do not die laughing in absolute joy, then it's not just your cup of tea. But I honestly do not know someone who saw what he did not like. It's 17 years later and my friends and I still quote everything from Goonie Goo Goo to the fart game, Aunt Bunny for Ice Cream, Ralph and Ed to get it! There are just so many individual and collective songs of joy that if you honestly did not see this movie you missed one of the best stand-ups ever. Take one of Robin Williams, Damon Wayans, Kings, George Carlin or even big ones like Richard Pryor or Red Foxx, and that will overcome it. I do not know how and where Murphy got some material, but it works. That's what's going on. It's funny to hell. Can you imagine how this show must shock people who used to Eddie to do Buckwheat and Mr. Rogers and so to the SNL? If you listen to an audience when they crack their first joke or when they say the word F for the first time, they are in complete shock. His first story says that the word F is when he does sketch for Mr. T to be gay. "Hey boy, hey boy, you look so cute in jeans jeans. Now go here and f ** my upside down!" <br /> <br /> Dave explodes in horror of laughter. No one expected the dirty mouth that unleashed them. But the results were just amazing. I have never been bothered by an endless comedy as I was in this situation. In fact, the next time my stomach ached so much of laugh was not until 1999 when I saw SOUTH PARK: HIGH LONG AND UNCUT. The comedy was raw and unconnected and went to the jugular as well as DEL√çRI. I do not think it's possible to watch this comic history and not laugh. It's almost twenty years later and it's still the funniest damn thing in the video. <br /> <br /> "Last week, I took your kids to fishing, and I put the worm on the hook and the kids put the fishing pole back in the boat and slammed their heads in the water for two minutes Gus. Normal kids do like Gus , so they started moving their heads around like that and I f ***** with fish, then looked at each other and said Goonie Goo Goo, I said you could believe this was this! > <br /> Look at it again and get ready to laugh at your shit off! <br /> <br /> 10 of 10
