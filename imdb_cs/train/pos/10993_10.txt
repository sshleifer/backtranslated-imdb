This film is a gem because it moves with a soft but solid resolution. I warn the audience that although it is billed as a Corporate Spy thriller and Mrs Liu is there, it moves meaningfully here, but it still has a tempo. It's not about explosions, the pursuit of vehicles or flying bullets. You have to be patient and instead see the details here. It is quiet because it is the main characteristic. The viewer must see him and think how this story unfolds. <br /> <br /> I do not make spoilers - because it destroys the place of watching. The plot is what you read from other papers: The average person looking for change and adventure is a mark for corporate spy work. Just go somewhere and secretly record and pass data. <br /> <br /> Take it from there. This film begins in a surrealist walk - with a subversion of corporate disillusionment that interferes with a substantial, underlying intonation paranoia. <br /> <br /> Then it starts to speed up. <br /> <br /> Negotiation on all parts is excellent - and yes, some of the events are cartoon characters. But everyone is good and fun. And the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as a soft, soft key ominous theme: Everything is not right at the beginning. <br /> <br /> And finally: Everything is not as it seems. <Br /> <br /> Ensure comfort and turn the lights down to be watched - and the sound up: This movie wants you to LISTEN.
