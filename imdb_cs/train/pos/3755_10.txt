I remember this movie many years ago. Definitely the best film on the subject in my experience. The fact that, after so long, I remember so much of a movie live, testifies to its impact. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to comment on the level of performance due to the language barrier. But they were very strong. <br /> <br /> This subject continues to fascinate us for years. And it has been most effectively treated here, with an appropriate share of historical perspective and skepticism. I wish it was at least once on TV. Or at least be available on tape or DVD. Or is it? Is there any artistic film archive to hoard a copy?
