The film opens with Bill Coles (Melvyn Douglas) and tells the story of how his best friend, Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) and his family are tightly packed into a small apartment in New York, too few bathrooms. When Jim's wife, Muriel (Myrna Loy), wants to renovate an apartment, Jim's advertising falls in love (or falls for!) Ads for the house. Once he bought the house, bills and frustrations are constantly gathering, because everything that can be made a mistake in Jim's dream house is bad. One of the three collaborations between Grant and Loy is a charming little comedy - not too much taxation, no real good news but a great way to spend an hour or two. The laughs are there from the beginning, when the alarm turns off and Jim tries to close it, only to be defeated at every turn by Muriel. The timing and delivery of comedy lines and situations can only be provided by a few experienced professionals, and that's what Grant and Loy give us: polished performance, simple chemistry and a lot of fun. Myrna Loy is in an extremely ungrateful role (Grant's character Jim is getting a lion's share of parts and acting, and Grant, as always, pulls out both with a remarkable aplomb), but she gives Muriel the color, life and bite that only Myrna Loy can give character. Melvyn Douglas also plays perfect fun without a bad note. One of my favorite scenes will definitely happen when Bill gets into the warehouse and Jim is going to "save" him ... just to get stuck! Every little problem that comes out of the Blandings renovation project - including petty jealousy and a wham campaign - seems to link everything that could * mess up with building a new house but makes it an incredible and fun watch. 8/10
