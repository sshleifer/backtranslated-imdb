Boys and Dolls is a unique character-based game. Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) is a high-stakes player who bet with Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) for one thousand dollars. Nathan needs the money to run his usual game and make his fortune. The bet was that Sky would not be able to take only a girl to Havana, Cuba, and the "doll" she chose was Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) who was in charge of a missionary. Sky finally bribes <br /> <br /> Sarah get to Havana with him. They finally fall in love with each other, but later accuse him of something he did not attend. Nathan ran to the missionary at night when they were gone. Nathan's 14-year-old fianc√©, Adelaide (Vivian Blaine), disagrees with Nathan's gambling and tries to stop him. However, when the movie ends, everyone will end up happy with a double wedding. <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are just great, no matter who sings it. Marlon <br /> <br /> Brando has no singing at all, and it's true they would dub him, but that did not matter. He has done great acting work (apparently seeing Brando) and played his character very well. I've seen several movies with Jean Simmons, and I thought this movie was its weakest, but she could not sing at all. The vocals include Frank Sinatra, Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kay. Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye were also in the original production of "Guys and Dolls" in Broadway. Vivien Blaine had a great voice and was a perfect Adelaide. If you like music, and even if not, I suggest you follow it.
