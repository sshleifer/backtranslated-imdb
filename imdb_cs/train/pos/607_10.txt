Maybe I loved this film so much because I felt down in the landfills and it's such a beautiful little fairy tale. Whatever the reason, I thought it was a great pitch. A great, intelligent story, beautiful effects, excellent acting (especially De Niro, which is amazing). This movie made me happier than I was for a while. <br /> <br /> It's a very fun and clever movie. The jogging joke about the royal history of the prince's ferocity and its consequences, the way to indulge in the magical effects of the witch, and dozens of clever things made me all fascinated. That's a lot of what's so good; it's complicated movies with special effects that contain more stories than most fairy-tale films, yet the incredible attention paid to small things. I feel like I just keep looking and watching it again.
