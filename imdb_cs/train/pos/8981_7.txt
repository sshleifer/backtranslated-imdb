Dig! I'd like to say to anyone, even if you do not like Metallica to see "some kind of monster," it's a documentary about the type of spine tap about one of the biggest bands in the world that behaved as mental children during the collapse of species. It's fun and fascinating. Along the same direction is digging! A film about "Dandy Warhol's" and "Brian Jonestown Massacre" two Portland bands that begin a sort of musical scene there home town just for one of the bands to become huge and one sinking into the musical history of the book. From the very beginning, both bands move in the opposite direction to their ability to make decisions, whether they are good or bad. Filmed in seven years and sometimes painful watching, we see Dandy's meteoric rise to glory (thanks to this waterfone advertisement!) And Jonestown's fall from the scene to the wannabes. As the bands become more unrelated, friendships are tense and in some places they fall apart for arguments and even at festivals. It's all half funny and half-tragic, and believe it or not, it's perverse tracking. As I said at the beginning, you can watch Metallica, even if you have no interest in the band. Dig! on the other hand it is slightly different and is much more enjoyable and much easier to watch if you are interested in each band. Still a good film and another testimony that he is not in the band than to encourage it as a career. Dig! It's a crazy ride on the shells on the cloak and a great example of the pitfalls and pleasure of being or wanting to be famous.
