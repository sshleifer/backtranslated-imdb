I was surprised by the improvement in animated film. If you sit near the screen, you will see detail in grass and surface structures. Detail, colors and shading are at least orderly better than Toy Story. How they could pull the shadow, I'll never know. I hope that PIXAR will provide a documentary on how the film was shot to see how everything has been achieved. Based on this film, I think animated films of the future will be judged on the basis of this film.
