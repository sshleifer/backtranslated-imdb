From the moment I heard about Ralph Bakshi's version of "The Lord of the Rings," I realized: What the hell is the "rotoscope" animation ?! Well ... I finally found out ... I saw this movie about three years ago and I did not know who Ralph Bakshi was ... And I liked it ... a lot ... Very good story line ... it he even has a small figure that's great for the cartoon ... You see if you're bored with contemporary animation ... I do not get it wrong ... I'm not saying it's just a nice cartoon ... It's a pretty good movie ...
