This movie scared me from the first day I saw him. My mom watched it when it was on TV in 1992. I remember I woke up in the middle of the night with her tears as my dad helped me up the stairs. She said something like, "Do not let me get it," or something like that. I asked what had made her so upset, and she told me she was looking at a woman in black. So of course I had to look at it, and although I was only eleven, she left me. I was terrified of me. I was immune to horror movies because I watched it!
