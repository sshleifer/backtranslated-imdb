I liked it very much. In fact, when I see it again (and I'm planning), I can just love it. I'm talking to other reviewers when I say that this movie really grows on you as you watch. It starts slowly, but the way she dresses is very natural and in her mood. You just get into it. <br /> <br /> I really like the summer atmosphere of the movie and I thought the movie was very moving as a whole. Characters have a strong element of realism, and the movie is very slow and gentle with spell when you look at different interactions among all, and you want to know how it will eventually appear and the ways the characters choose to take. <br /> <br /> I am very surprised that there are fewer than a dozen comments - there are obscure television movies that have more comments than Rich In Love. <br /> <br /> One thing that I'm missing is the end that fools me and I have to watch it again to see it. It's a movie that does not have to be for everyone but I feel strongly underestimated (even some of my most prominent Purist film fans who saw almost every movie they did not see it) and it does not even look much on the board but much I liked it, and everyone who likes family teas that are warm on the scenery, the atmosphere, and the unhurried dark tempo would probably have to look. It is especially worthwhile happening in South Carolina, so for those (like me) who love the South and for the films that take place there is a jewel. I will add my voice to poorly comments and recommend this little-known film.
