I've seen this movie on TV many years ago and I saw the movie when I got it on a tape. I thought it was pretty well done. It was not the best of all the movies, but it was good enough. The film has enough talent to inspire many people, especially younger children. The game was good, Danny Glover led the cast. The conspiracy line was not very believable, but the script was well written. This movie may also be interested in baseball fans. It does not apply directly to the action sports action. Applies directly to a nice movie that you can watch with your family and learn some of the news that is hidden in this movie. Overall, the movie was good but not great. I give this movie 7/10.
