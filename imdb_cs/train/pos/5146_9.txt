As a man who was born to a German mother and an English father (who spent five years in a military camp), I come from a unique position. One must deal with the different Nazis on one side of the family and the winners of World War II on the other. This miniseries can not immerse themselves in every part of Hitler's psychology and must give the viewer the general taste of the situation at that time and as well as Hitler's state of mind. This series is doing quite well. Carlyle is very good, like O'Toole, but I'd like to have more information about relationships with others in the group. Because Hitler did nothing by himself. He had people around him who followed him on the letter, often undoubtedly and certainly no doubt later in his murderous career. What goes through Goebbels, Goring, and Hesol? It would be useful to see more of these relationships. I hope it will make people study this subject more. It could also cause people to understand why someone like Saddam Hussein could not continue in power.
