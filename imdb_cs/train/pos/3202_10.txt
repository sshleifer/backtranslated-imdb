I do not understand why many IMDb users do not like this movie. Why he thinks it's so bad, etc. It's not worse than anything else. I personally think that "Soldier" is a great movie, much better than most other films in the same genre. Reasons why I liked the soldier: Kurt Russel, Connie Nielsen, David Webb Peoples, great visual effects and directing (Paul Anderson). I even think it's the best job I've ever seen from director Paul Anderson, who previously managed Mortal Kombat's entertainment and not so much an entertaining "Event Horizon."
