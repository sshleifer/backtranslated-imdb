I really can say that I felt the film in its true nature, where games of dreaming come into the surrealist aspect of the future facing Tom Cruise. I did not like the way Tom Cruise behaves, but I must say that he seems to be acting in every place in the movie ... not only because of the exciting story but also because of ... they are joining and then talking and they are beautiful. I must say, however, that this film does not fall under the "average weekend movement" that you choose randomly and watch joyfully; It contains strong attitudes and characters, so do not be afraid of beer and pop-corn. She definitely needs more than that.
