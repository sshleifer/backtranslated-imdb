When I started watching "Fay Grim," I had no idea it was a "Henry Fool" sequel. This time it was not a movie I imagined as a sequel. But one came, and it's pretty good. I assume you saw the original so I will not explain it. She starts with Fay (Parker Posey) living with her son, who was with the corpse of Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan). Simon (James Urbaniak) is still in jail. One day the son is expelled by bringing a pornographic toy to school. But that's not a simple toy. She has a secret that explains a lot about what happened in the first movie. And this mystery plunges deeper into geopolitics than "Syriana". I have to say that I am quite impressed with what Hal Hartley has achieved. Perhaps this does not reach the original quality, but we will certainly look at what is happening in the world. And the end leaves open the possibility of continuing. <br /> <br /> Also plays Jeff Goldblume.
