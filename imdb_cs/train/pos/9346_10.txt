If you do not like this movie either your dead or you hate Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle. Excellent cast, all who have done good. This film proved that Adam Sandler is a good actor despite what critics say. Adam Sandler becomes a highly respected actor. It all started with his performance in Big Daddy, then he made some bad movies, then he did a great performance in 50 First Dates, The Longest Yard, then Click and now he rules over me. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. Adam Sandler plays a man who has lost everything. The closest thing my family has is my father-in-law and my father-in-law. After his old colleague roommate (Cheadle) encountered him, he seems to turn his life around. I will not say any more because I do not want to destroy the film, but I recommend this movie. One of the best movies of 2007.
