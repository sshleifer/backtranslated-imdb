I love Jack's jokes like "Cliché is ..." or "Over the top cliché guy, black, oily skin, a little scary ...". It's just funny! Daniel is going to catch up! Well, Jack is no longer in the team (otherwise) or otherwise it would be sarkasma mania !!!! I love all the lands (Season 8, a little less, I have to admit), the characters are great, the actors are great, I start to choose facial expressions (and others) from Jack, Daniel and Teal'c ... It is theoretically possible and exciting. .. oops! I'm coming again! I'm sorry, but I'm also starting to pick properties from Carter and all that's what my parents control NUTZ !!!!!!! Finally, I think it's good for another three years, especially if you continue to pack episodes with this humor, drama, action, etc. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
