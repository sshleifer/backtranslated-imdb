After watching the trailer I was surprised that this movie never got into the theaters so I ordered BluRay. I had a great watch and I must say that this movie is better than some major animation movies out there. Of course he has his mistakes, but I can still really recommend it. Animation is well done, very fun and unique, and the story keeps track of me until the end. Some backdrops are just gorgeous and you can see the French talent behind it. I thought Forest Whitaker's performance was a little bit of life, but the character of Lian-Chu is pictured in this film. So overall, thumb up, I liked it a lot, and I hope it will be successful enough for all the studies involved to continue making great movies like this one. I would recommend giving him a chance and surprise how big a movie can be with such a small budget. Hektor himself is worth watching the movie because some of his moments are like Stitch-like cheerful.
