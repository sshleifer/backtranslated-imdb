One of my favorite films has been "Last Action Hero" for many years; Unfortunately, Arnold Schwarznegger has decided to spoil his fun by becoming a corrupt dirty politician; so now I can not carry any movie that could have a hand. Adventures of Jake Speed ​​actually play toys with some themes similar to those in The Last ... Hero; so I was glad I found it on DVD, so I could watch these topics that happened so well. Despite the "plot-in-the-plot" involving white slavery during the African nation's civil war, this is not an action film. Because of the conspiracy in which the "conspiracy plot" is in fact a question that the film does not intend to solve: Jake Speed ​​is a real person who helps the hero to rescue her sister from a white slave trader; or is it actually a fictitious figure (which means that the hero has somehow entered a universe that actually exists only in a row of pulp)? I suggest that this is not clearly defined in the film, and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane know it well. The film will become a presentation of what viewers can want from such a fictitious universe of "adventure story". This is, in fact, a rich subject whose potential difficulty is lightened by the philosophical and tobacco sense of humor. <br /> <br /> There are flaws in the movie - especially its cinematography, which makes the movie look like a TV show. And he goes to fade at the occasion. <br /> <br /> But I really like these characters and I like the adventures they live, no matter how silly they are. And it just seems fascinating to me that this adventure really takes place in the novel. Stay under few impressions - it's a good show!
