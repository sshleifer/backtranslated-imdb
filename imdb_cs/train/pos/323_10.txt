It's a truly excellent film with a revolutionary message (both in form and in content) that should not be missed by any fan of French New Wave or Underground. As soon as the credits are opened or closed - we are simply released into the world of consumer art, revolution and youth. This film has little to do with documentary films and is more interesting to play with our ideas of advertising and its relationship to reality. Real and unrealistic lines are crossed in a way that is well known in movies about documentary films, but this time we do it for consumption and marketing, not for the description of the real thing.
