This is an amazing little crime drama that packs a lot in 65 minutes of running. He has all the right ingredients - a mysterious corpse, a tired middle-aged cop, Corrigan (Walter Kinsella), and his newcomer Tobin (John Miles), a shadowy killer on free and even loving interest in Tobin, the female botanist Mary (Patricia Wright), who helps solve the crime. There is also an amazing finale that takes place in the yard of the stones. <br /> <br /> Watch out for amazing criminals at the start of this movie where Lieutenant Corrigan refers to a dead woman as "Tatooed Tilly" Before the coroner reveals that he has a tattoo (confusing?). Also, later, when Tobin chases the killer across the back yards, it is suddenly shown that at one point he goes in the wrong direction - no wonder he did not catch him!
