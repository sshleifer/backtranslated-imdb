It's not a "loose" but accurate, faithful remake of Monicelli's classics "I Soliti Ignoti" from 1958 with Toto, Mastroianni, Gassman, Cardinale etc. And that's a good reason to copy all the funny characters and storyline, even in details is the scene where the photographer is photographed from the local market). I watched the great old version many times, and I knew all the gangs and the end, but I still enjoyed "Welcome to Collinwood," which has its own freshness and atmosphere. Interestingly, how the lives and ways of small thieves in the 1950s were adapted by Italy to the US in 2002. Things did not change much. 8/10.
