FORBIDDEN PLANET is the best SF film of the Golden Age of SF cinema and what makes it a great movie is its sense of entertainment. As soon as the spaceship lands, the viewers - through the human crew - travel with intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventures. We meet an unforgettable Robbie, the mysterious Dr. Morbuis, his beautiful and innocent daughter, Altair, and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet, The Krell, who died overnight. Or yes? <br /> <br /> You can say and say that the planet is obviously filmed in a movie studio with painted backdrops, but it adds a sense of the danger of claustrophobia I feel and the electronic music of Bebe and Louise Barron adds even more atmosphere < > <br /> I am shocked that this film is not in the top 250 IMDB films.
