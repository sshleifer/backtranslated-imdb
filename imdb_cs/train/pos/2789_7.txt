Bend like Beckham is full of mysterious scenes and still has a line of predictable lines. This is a girl named Jess who is trying to reach her long dream to become a famous football player and finally gets a chance when she offers a position on the local team. there are so many frontiers and limits she faces holding her back, she is still determined and trying. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a pleasant light movie and wants to be inspired by what people can achieve. The possibilities of the songs are really good, "skip my baby, just move up ... to the goal and make borders and complications." Anyway, I hope she has helped you in your review. Bend it like Beckham a great move
