I was quite surprised to read a few comments about this work. Some people looking for land ??? OK, when this video appeared more than a decade ago, I was looking at what it was: a collection of music videos. It's not a movie. It does not have a plot or a central plot. It is rather the art anthology of mostly long videos, all of which are rather clever or creative. Michael Jackson may be considered wonderful nowadays, but in the end he was the man who gave us the Thriller (considered by many as the greatest music video of all time) and set trends with Billie Jean and Beat It. Moonwalker, together with the creators and artists who collaborated with him, once again got into the music and dance moves to create live funny things involving clay, special effects, live performances, and even their own parody (Badder sequence). And for those who cared about what Joe Pesci is doing, this video came out a bit before it became a home name and was one of his most memorable performances on the film. And IMHO, I think the Smooth Criminal Sequence (choreographic section) beats something else that Michael Jackson did up to that point!
