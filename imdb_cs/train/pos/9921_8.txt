I have been an admirer of Edward Burtyn's work for many years and it was so delighted that I could see the man at work thanks to Jennifer Baichwal's documentary. The heavy beauty of the shipyard in Bangladesh, the stone quarry in Vermont, the huge assembly plant in China, the old old neighborhoods of Shanghai that are just waiting to be ripped: this landscape is so well captured by the photographer and filmmaker. Sometimes I thought of old TV documents about abandoned coal mines and plastic factories; those things I grew up with. Burtynsky's work is of great value when it shows how industrial activity has shifted to Asia but has not stopped. The most common scene for me was computer scrap somewhere in China - the waste was threatening air while the workers were very jovial.
