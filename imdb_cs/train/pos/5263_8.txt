Netflix should mention this short function on info about silk stockings. Excellent in all directions to the overproduced fluff. It had much better Cole Porter tracks and much more energy. Silk stockings have proved to be a great disappointment. Fred was too old for such things, although Dance and Cyd are beautiful. I'll be on watch for Garbo - Melvyn Douglas version of Ninotchka. Was Peter Lorre wrong in making Silk stockings - seems to be very passive in more active numbers and with smaller lines? I'm very happy to have hit Paree-Paree by accident. The whole experience was much more fun. Bob Hope, as simple "singing and dancing" is pure joy.
