Every time I see Nicole, I like her more. I love the movie like this. A woman you just do not give up, but your heart persists. The first film I remembered that I saw this was a human disaster, Kim Novak - Laurence Harvey's version. Beef about the correctness of Russian spoken in this film is tiny, it was good enough to deceive me or someone else who can not speak Russian, I'm sure. Funny how people are missing. Russian boys who were not good were also well-placed. Finally, I have to put off my hat on Ben Chaplin, as someone else commented, playing with great dignity of juice, and there was definitely some warmth between him and Nicole. To think, the boys get paid for it, blowing.
