I have to be honest. I watched this show and enjoyed it because it was gross, insulting, merry and horrible. Yeah, there's a lot of humor for all the tastes. If you are into such a humor that is engaged in making fun of people who fall from a skateboard, for example, you will have a great time to do it. Or if you love bad guys at extreme stunts, you'll have a great time. And if you like scatological humor and extreme situations oh, you will look forward to the show. I like all three kinds of humor that "Dirty SÃ¡nchez" offers. I like to laugh at the show situations. "Jackass" is like a walk in the park compared to this one. So if you're tired of the typical American stupidity of Jackass, try the English extreme stupidity at this show. With all due respect. <br /> <br /> This is a show that has a small taste or class. It is not recommended for those who are easily offended or exhausted. Now these guys need to look at a psychologist. Especially the character of Paco.
