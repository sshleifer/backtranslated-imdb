No, I'm saying a lie, this is not really the best movie of all time, but it's really a nice movie that no one I've ever seen. He's a comrade cop who plays Jay Leno and Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi) with some humorous story about the prototype of a missing motor or something, but that does not matter. The reason why this movie is fun is the interaction between two potential customers who initially dislike and disbelieve each other, but in the shocking destiny of fate they become friends. The whole thing about culture is doing pretty well because it's fun to watch, it's totally ridiculous, but in an apple and pleasant way. The soundtrack is cool, again in the form of cheese 80, it suits the movie, I tried to find one of the songs for ages, but as I worked from the memories of what I think some of the word was that I did not do it find. <br /> <br /> Another thing that this movie has is the most amazing payoff of a movie at all, but I will not let it go, oh no! In conclusion, I would take this film in 48 hours, mostly from Eddie Murphys, including the Beverly Hills policeman and regardless of Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence. If you're looking for a filmmaker and you're afraid of having a "straight white cop who'll meet a desperate black cop", do it. Perhaps you will be pleasantly surprised because it will turn upside down with a "direct Japanese cop who meets a terrific white cop". I'm 7. I'm honest that I like more than that. I'd rather watch it than a lot of things I'd give 8. But I guess I know deep that it's some crazy thing that makes me like this movie.
