To get in touch with the beauty of this movie, pay close attention to the soundtrack, not just the music, but the way all the sounds help bind the images. How wonderful the opening scene that led to the expulsion of Gin creates a moral ambiguity! Note how music introduces the characters as they are led inside the Giovanny's marriage. Do not expect that in 1943 he will find so much political life in Italy. It's not about it. On the other hand, if you are prone to the music of images and sounds, you will be led into a word that goes beyond neorealism. By the end of the film we have moments that have the form of Antonioni, which has more in common with the inner life of the characters than with the real places. This is one of my favorite films Visconti.
