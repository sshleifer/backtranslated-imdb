Massive multiple chills after the spine! I am surprised that people do not like it! I saw it at 10 am and I was still getting frozen! And I've seen hundreds of thrillers / horror movies! For calling out loud, I'm 22! I mean, voice acting is not particularly good, probably b-movie-ish. But the real look of terror, sound effects, flow! From the very beginning, you are struggling with inerrant, unwavering, terrorizing scenes! So many clich√©s do not surprise / scare! You know he will come, come, come, BOO! and you still jump from the chair. Grab the pillow and blanket, call your closest friend and do not look at him at night! Japanese hats!
