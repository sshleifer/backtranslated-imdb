Of course, I would have to give this movie ten out of ten, because my uncle was the main screenwriter of the movie, "For a crime. Rodolfo Sonego has written scripts for more than 50 years living in Italy. It was a great story, and someone suggested writing his stories. So Rodolfo Sonego did it. If you look at his resume, you can see the number of films made in Italy. Alberto Sordie was the main actor he played in his stories. My uncle visited Australia and my town in 1968 to look at the "Girl in Australia" site, and after World War II, he made a great movie about a Proxy Bride. In all of his films you can see his humor. Now I found a copy of this movie on DVD. GREAT
