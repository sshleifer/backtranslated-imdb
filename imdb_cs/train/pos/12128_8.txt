I just saw the first few days ago "Man Bondage" and WOW! What a mysterious and almost spooky movie. I loved the music moving at the pace of every step of Philip's legs. It made me feverish for some reason ... One of the biggest aspects of this movie is that you see Bette Davis coming in right in front of you. It's great, not necessarily because it's her best job, but because it was so extraordinary that she was so cruel, furious and unwavering as an actress in 1934 ... Bette was risky, always wanted to be different, and that's true when she began to realize she might be as uncomfortable and courageous as she wanted, and people would love to. If you're a real lover of the movie, it's amazing to see ... It just had a way to deliver the line that the film was involved with, and the film that belongs to her. Like a "pile of music and fire, it's me ... old Kazoo and some sparklers" or "But you're Blanche, you're in that chair!" or "with all my heart, I still love the one I killed!" ... These are some of her films, but my drift. She was just as courageous, exuberant and exotic as she looks with those beautiful big eyes. When I see it, I can not believe it was twice redrawn ... Leslie Howard was beautiful ... so quiet and persistent, she needed to be loved. I thought he was adorable, and he could not understand how nobody would fall to him, but then all of them ... except Mildred. He did a great job ... The only thing I did not like was something to do with writing in early movies. They would make a character that would be so hateful that it was almost unbelievable that someone really grabbed them for them. The performances were great, but in real life, Philip would never be interested in Mildred. That's just true ... You see it!
