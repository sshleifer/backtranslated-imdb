Rather annoying that reviewers compare it with the Earth ... Earth * Course * Planet Earth is better - it has much more of the same. Earth is like a widespread trailer for a planet planet and as such is inevitably worse and simpler. But it is not compared to that. <br /> <br /> As a full-length documentary (or in fact, something like lengths), it surpasses almost everything you'll see in your lifetime (unless you choose to go through helicopters with long-range cameras for years and wait for months in the most extreme environments to capture the most beautiful beings on Earth, which is unlikely.) <br /> <br /> In the narrative: yes everyone in the UK - very including me - adore David Attenborough there is little justification for not telling it, but it barely deserves to beat a star or three. He was not a moderator on planet Earth, just a narrator, and I'm sure he's modest and merciful to realize that everything that gets more viewers is a good thing. Everyone who sees it will be overwhelmed by his respect, majesty, and glory. All reviewers agree on this. Those who love it (ie, Everyone) should / should go to buy Planet Earth. So three hobbyists for their movie release and a big boooo for anyone who is so inexpensive to buy it on a DVD rather than a Planet Earth box. But as artwork there are no competition. <br /> <br /> The country is big enough for both.
