It is from this that a musical genre has been created. Humor, talent, romance and action all came together. Frank Sinatra was wonderful. There is nothing else to say. Marlon Brando, though not a singer, has done a great job that has won the hearts of many of his portraits of Sky Masterson. The fact that he could not sing added his character. The ladies in the movie were all right, but the men in the movie definitely stole the show. It is a true classic that can be appreciated at any age. It connects with all viewers and makes you smile and laughter. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie that you can explore and enjoy!
