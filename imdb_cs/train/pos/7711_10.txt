Well, so Robbie is a little hockey player according to today's standards, and some of the actors are pretty spicy and most of the special effects could now be duplicated by a bright 12-year-old child with a decent computer editing program. And do not let me start a poster. <br /> <br /> This is still a great movie, 40 years after his release. I grew up on Sunday afternoon watching "sci-fi" at the "Science Fiction / Adventure Theater" local TV station, so I've seen a lot of SF films from the 1950s. At a time when most of the films were satisfied with suppressing some rubber costume and getting rid of the miniature model of the city, Forbidden Planet will raise the bar forever and show that it was possible to create a science fiction movie that actually had a plot. <br /> <br /> I doubt that many SF films made in the 1990s will still be considered very attentive in 2030.
