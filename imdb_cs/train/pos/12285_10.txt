A brilliant adaptation of the novel that famously celebrated Chilean President Salvador Allende. In the midst of a great estate that comes from ruins and becomes a force of exploitation and exploitation of outrage, a luxury estrangement for the benefit of superior Esteban Trueb and his undeserved families, the great Danish director Bille August will once again develop in a microprocessor that would be the process that led the greatest defamation of his story to the hardened Chilean nation and whose main character would be Augusto Pinochet (Steven's similarities with him are inevitable: let's recall for example that picture of Senator with dark glasses of Augustus attending exceptional cast in Jeremy protruding Irons whose character varies from arrogance and extreme atrocities, hard lessons, that life always brings us to make us almost change. In Esteban fully enforces the law of resonance, with great wisdom, Solomon describes with the words, "What are freckles are the same punishment that will serve you." <br /> <br /> Unforgettable Glenn Close game splint, corrupt Stephen's sister, whose sin, driven by loneliness, spiritual and platonic love, was the wife of his cruel snowy brother. Meryl Streep was also great, a woman whose name came to him like Clara's gloves. With telekinetic power, cognitive and media, this stubborn woman, faithful to her blunt, conservative husband, is an indicator of character and self-control that we desire for ourselves and for all human beings. <br /> <br /> Each character is a portrait of virtuosity (like Blanca worthy of rebel leader Pedro Segundo unhappy ...) or a portrayal of humiliation, like Stephen Jr., a bastard child senator who serves as a tool for the return of boomerang. <br /> <br /> The film moves in the intestines, creating some facts that should never be repeated, but it is absurdly going on (Colombia is a sad example) and another remark that life is amazing, people are always such as Isabel Allende and Bill Augustus immortality.
