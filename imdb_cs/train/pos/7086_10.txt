Note: Spoilers inside. This great movie is "o" so many things, all successful: sci-fi traveling in time, unstable psychology, dystopian society, co-is-real syndrome, gradual undermining of belief systems, global bioterrorism and emerging love story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> or as extreme, check out the dissertation at www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html. Come on! Such time accent is mostly spoken of by a brilliant conspiracy from the wonderful work of writers David and Janet Peoples, not to mention the inspiration of "La Jetee" Chris Marker. It is undoubtedly one of the most successful, fascinating films ever made. But there are plenty of other levels. <br /> <br /> The real film genius focuses on the ugly side effects of time-travel in James Cole's mind (Bruce Willis doing the best job in his career here). His way advances from a gung-vaccine-hunting warrior to a gradually unheded victim? and back. Another wide shot of the story increasingly emphasizes the personal story between James and Dr. Kathryn Railly (beautiful Madeleine Stowe). I love the simultaneous shifts / opposing views of these two characters. For me it all comes to the scene in the hotel room. At this point, James? once grasped by an unshakeable determination? is now falling in complete doubt about its own reality; while Dr. Railly? a cool and rational scientist? eventually, after absorbing James's evidence, he wildly persuaded his terrible predictions. Her desperation of getting to James and keeping her mission shows how far she has come. Gilliam takes care of these characters, especially because of the growth of the stress that gives them life. The balance between the emotional roller coaster and the assembly sci-fi puzzle / thriller is excellent. And the denomination at the airport is buzzingly intense, because we see that it is so clearly coming across James's dreams. Is it here as James decided to leave the mess? and fights his madness more than ever? that he goes back to the plate and does what is necessary for humanity. Do you see Jose and the gun? (Just before, references to Hitchcock's "Vertigo" and identity / confusion switching are great.) This is a movie to be scattered among people's thoughts; it's not just a repeated look but it requires them. "Twelve Monkeys" are intelligent, provocative, bizarre, fun and exciting things. The supporting cast is great, especially Brad Pitt, who steals all of his scenes and shows great flexibility like Jeffery Goines, crazy and spoiled, but sometimes survivors. And there is David Morse as Dr. Peters (interesting as the film just leaves the viewer a bad motivation) and Christopher Plummer as Dr. Goines. But the greatest award belongs to Terry Gilliam, crossing here - barely - his outstanding "Brazil". (A lot of parallel, of course, a particularly lonely warrior who tries to escape from the disintegrating surroundings: hopping inside and without pests.) Every film of this film has a unique mark and tone. The sound is also great. <br /> <br /> This is one of the great achievements of the 1990s, which is really my favorite, and it will definitely hold it for long.
