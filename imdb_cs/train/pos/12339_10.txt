She loved Joan. Great performance. What's wrong with her? I watched the movie and then Jane Eyre just after ... she's getting better. My heart raced. Great old movie drama. That's what I want from a classic movie. The expressions of the face are worth the film. I'm glad I got it on the video. You do not know what else you need in the movie. Beautiful woman ... wealth ..... greed ..... murder .... detectives ...... trial ..... <br /> <br /> The costumes are very nice. I wonder what budget was for this movie? He wanted them to make such films. Whenever they try, they seem to be making a cheese film. Black and white films still contain some secrets.
