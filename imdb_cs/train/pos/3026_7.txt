Charles Boyer is to be Spanish and to London to buy coal in a "confidential agent," in 1945, Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxina, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard and they all stop him except Bacalla. His documents are stolen, he is accused of murder, but he's determined to get coal for his people to fight the fascists. This movie has its good and not so good points. It fits high for the atmosphere and tension and is very fun. Bacall is incredibly beautiful, Boyer is passionate, Paxinou is average, Lorre is slim, Hendrix reasonably pathetic, and Seymour terribly amazing. Not so good points: Bacall is English and Boyer Spanish. No no. Boyer is awesome in his role and with a bad accent, but Bacall is 100% American, not British upper class. They both have no chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is a little miskast. Their acting is neither in the sense nor in the sense; she is better in other movies. But she's a wonderful looking woman and many can be forgiven. Paxinou is almost over the top and hatred. Dan Seymour almost steals the film as a hotel guest who studies human nature. It's a great part and its performance is perfect, while some of the other actors' directions are not that good. This was definitely the case without small parts, just small actors. Seymour was not a small actor. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth seeing with its shortcomings.
