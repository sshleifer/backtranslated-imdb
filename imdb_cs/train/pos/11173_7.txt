Oh, cliché, cliché, cliché; They are the main work of many horror films. That's a lot. It's Stephen King, one of the best horror masters. This movie was really good, just predictable. And what about horror film does not have stupid people? This is overcrowded with retarded victims who practically pray for their lives to be accepted. Animal Sign: I found a little scary. The way everything was set was really scary, but not scary. Mostly it was believed several times, the tension was not so exciting, but the level of entertainment is set in a significant place; My eyes were practically glued to the screen. All fans of Stephen King have to see this movie, but just like anyone else, expect the OKAY trilogy.
