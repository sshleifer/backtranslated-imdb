The three British Army sergeants stationed in India are sent to stop the rebellion of a killer tribe known as Thuggees. One of the Sergeants, Cutter, takes the golden temple out of the camp and is captured by the Thuggy guided by the sinister Guru. Gunga Din, Military Military Regiment, returns to the camp for help, and the other two sergeants go after him, but they are also captured. Now the commander sends out three detailed details, but he does not realize he is going into a trap set by Thug. Gunga Din will save his day. Excellent film, even though it is politically wrong today. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks give very funny and thrilling performances with Jaffe very well in the title role and Cianelli very sinister as a Guru. Rating 10 out of 10.
