Jazz fanatics will show this classic short film that some of the best jazz men are just doing their thing. It's like watching a music video without adornment today. <br /> <br /> Jazz men give us extra care in the person Marie Bryant who sings the classic version of On The Sunny Side Of The Street. I never heard her sing, Bryant sounds remarkably like Billie Holliday. These are compliments. <br /> <br /> Their instrumental work is also peaks. With the black film of its time, a lot of white stereotypes fit, this film must be watched and valued. No great production value, just good music.
