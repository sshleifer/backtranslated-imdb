Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation in his struggle for free fighting, ignored his own family and son, the film is about his son, Hiralal, who feels neglected because of the service of Maham Gandhi to society. The film begins in South Africa where Mahatma Gandhi works as a lawyer and fights against Indian freedom against the British. Hirarala arrives in South Africa to help his father, who is a lawyer, because Gandhi was involved in the struggle for freedom, wanted his wife and children to join as a service to society, and as a result hirarlal has no chance to complete his education and does not pass the exam, marries the love of gulab (bhoomika Chawla) against his father's wishes. Hiralal has the ambition to travel to England and become a lawyer as well as his dad, but his own father refuses to provide him with a scholarship offered by his family to a trader and instead gives it to another person to say that the scholarship should not be limited to his family and should be accessible the most capable student living in the colony. These angering doubts and the rise between father and son are increasing, hirarlal hates his father for neglecting him and accusing him of being uneducated and unemployed. Hiralal struggles to meet the end and set off on the street, losing his wife and children through unsuccessful business trials and huge debt. Akshaye Khanna gives stellar performance as Hiralal gandhi .. all kudos to him, direction and scenario is fantastic, picturization is excellent. overall excellent film and must see. I give it 10/10
