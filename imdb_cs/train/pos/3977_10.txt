Personally, I was looking at the 60s and 70s. It was fascinating to find out how the drug movement actually started and became a popular culture and a potentially uncompromising force in life. Interviews of classic rock stars are upset and humorous. You feel that you have a secret and at the same time nod your head ... because it is so good and well known. I loved it, all segments since the 1960s. I highly recommend it for all aspects, including rock music, movement threatening, politics and good history. I checked the marked box that said it contained a spoiler just because I do not know what some might think of as a spoiler or not because I was discussing what is in all four segments so I wanted to be safe.
