Each story includes presupposition, character, and conflict. Characters that portray their own promises triumph and the militant figure lends itself to it. The concept of Ardh Satya is summed up by poems of the same name written by Dilip Chitrem. The line goes - "go down, doosre palde mein paurush, aur teek tarazu to kaante par, ardh satya?". Cruel Translation - "The delicate balance between right and wrong (commonly seen in the busts of blind justice in judgments) has powerlessness on one plate, and is capable of the other, is the needle in the middle of the truth?" <Br /> <br /> The poem is lectured in the middle of the road in Smita Patil's film at Om Puri in the restaurant. This deeply affects the protagonist and sets the foundations for most of the later events that follow. At the end of the film Om Puri ends exactly in the same situation described in the poem. <br /> <br /> The movie tries to make the poems scared. However, the words Chitre are too strong and, at best, the film is appropriate in all respects for the poem. <br /> <br />
