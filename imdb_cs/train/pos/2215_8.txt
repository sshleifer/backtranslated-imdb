I bought the "Feast of All Saints" and it's not really a terrible movie, but lots of things could be better. It has a lot of historical value played by very talented actors / actors, and it is not the everyday occurrence that actors can play such a role and be somewhat believable. Some parts were a bit average and confusing, but I would not say the whole movie is terrible. As soon as you think about it, capturing New Orleans in 1800 and doing something out of it, it is quite difficult and much harder to get into actors who can strongly mean those parts. But the only big problem I had with the film was that most of the actors who played the free colors were mostly low-skinned Africans, not too universal when casting others who were not lighter. one of the old Creole stereotypes that still exists. Anyone casting could choose a wider variety when it came to shade, despite many creoles being color conscious. Rather the selection of actors who looked almost white in a sense could have been more thought out. The actors did a great job, the script was better to write and Overall, I found out that the performances were very credible.
