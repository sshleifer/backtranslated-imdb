I just saw this movie and fell in love with it. There is a bit of something for everyone, and his special free for all, regarding the romance between Lachlan and Lil. When I'm on the beach, I almost cry ... there's an unconscious awareness that time is the most expensive commodity and it's obvious when they're together. This idea was taken from several angles, from marriage to sibling to find love in the least conventional places. The film almost makes you desperate for such desperation when you know that tomorrow might be your last one. Crowe was especially awesome in his role as Lachlan. I always had that delicate point for accent, but I almost melted away with his portrait of his character. The way the film was shot is also beautiful, with music, a backdrop of open fields, and an excellent actor. Overall, this is a great movie that attracts all human emotions.
