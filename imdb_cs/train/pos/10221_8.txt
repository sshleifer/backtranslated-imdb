Faith and mortality ... seen through the lens of an older Ashkenazi Jewish-American gentleman and a younger, African-American Jewish gentleman who feared he disagreed and had sincere talk about how their lives were unfolding over the years. . <br /> <br /> Mostel's character is a tailor with chronic back problems and finally a sick woman; Belafont's character is a careerist, never to get to work, and a fatal accident will leave him in a strange purge - he must persuade Mostel to restore his faith because he has failed along with the health of his wife (and his own) .. but Belafonte Levine has his own problems, still pining on the girlfriend he left behind .. Belafonte character leaves the film before it seemed, it should, and so the end is mysterious, and the film suffers somewhat from its ambiguous end .. This is not a "typical" Hollywood movie about ethnic relations, or about the person of the crisis of faith. It is worth watching more than once and appreciating the outstanding performances by the main actors.
