The reason I say is because I wrote a script and knew very little about being made until I was asked to see the movie. I wrote it for some manufacturers who sold them without saying it to me. Because Alan Dobie was my friend, I had to hear about it. I just wrote the first draft, so I naturally worried when I heard he was on the floor. I asked Mr. Peter Collinson through my agent whether I'd like to make another suggestion. I also asked if I can see my original script because I lost it. I was told too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and I took my name. I did not know what they could do for my scenario. Then I was invited to see the finished film. I was so impressed that I asked very quickly to go back on my name. It is a beautifully made piece, from the harshly written first sketch, I expected to be asked to do much more; Maybe if I had it, it would not be that good. Would I like to see my original script again if anyone knows where it is? I'd also like to see the movie again, I only saw it once in the small Theater Theater in Soho.
