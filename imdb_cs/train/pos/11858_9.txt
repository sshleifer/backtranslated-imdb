this movie is great. If you have a chance to see it, then you should run to see. Although the film has almost nothing to do with his original since 1932, Pacino does a great job playing as Tony Montana to get around. Pacino has such a way for him to say something in any case, and the sound sounds great. If you thought Pulp Fiction was good with the word oath (if you saw it), then you should also see Scarface to see another angle, as the actor can call it. (its fairly sweet) <br /> <br /> Even if the movie has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast over time, it does not keep the right aspect ratio in real time it's still easy to watch but you must keep your eyes peeled after all the time so he will not lose anything. I personally found watching this movie makes three hours look like a wind, it's really just great. This movie is one of thoe films that behaves and drives so well that you will not only forget that this movie was made in the embarrassing 80s, but that it really makes you the root for a bad guy ... "So say a good night for a guy"
