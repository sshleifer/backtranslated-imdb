it's the best comedy I've ever seen! but not everyone understands it, you have to be from Georgia to understand this amazing movie! :) Overall one of the best movies I've ever seen ......... Vachtangi (Benjamin) and all supporting actors who play very well but act Kote Daoshvili (Father Germogel) is, in my opinion, best play in a supporting role of film history :)) in this film are played many georgian stars such as ipolit xvichia, sergo Zakariadze, sofiko chiaureli, verikoan djafaridze, Sesilia Takaishvili, Dodo Abashidze ... all are stars in Georgian cinematography :) and in this movie plays great Russian star Evgeni Leonov and of course the director of Georgy Danelia is one of the best ...... I recommend this film to everyone, but do not forget that you have to see a good Russian language so you can watch this movie
