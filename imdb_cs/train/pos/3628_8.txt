The film had many basic values ​​of family and love. She expressed human emotions and was an inspiration. The script was clear (it was very easy to understand that it was perfect for kids) and it was pleasant and humorous at times. There were several charged symbols on the search. Cinematography was acceptable. There was no sense of experimentation that many cameramen did today (which frankly warns a bit). It was clearly shot, but it had a pretty fine quality. Although the adjustments could have been made better, I thought it was a nice movie for the family. And organizing the information was right for you, which was something I did not like, but it was a good movie in all.
