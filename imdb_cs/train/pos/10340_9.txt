Even though this movie came out a year before I was born, it's definitely one of my favorite comedies. He plays Redd Foxx as a father trying to understand his son's homosexuality. Like most parents, they do not know what it means to be homosexual and has all these stereotypical ideas about what gay people are. His son, Norman, is now growing up and living alone. When his father, Ben, discovers that his son is a homosexual, he visits his son in the hope that he will change him. The title comes from one of the most entertaining parts of the movie - when Ben gets into Norman's flats, he encounters a female prostitute and thinks he's his son in the move ("Norman ... Is that you?"). The film laughed me from start to finish. Redd Foxx is great. Although much of the content is stereotypical, I found nothing wrong with how the material was processed and even has a good ending. Highly recommended.
