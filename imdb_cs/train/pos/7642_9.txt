It's not really a big box but I was surprised with this movie. James "I did some things to Farrah Fawcett" Orr co-wrote and directed this film about the average, average guy Larry Burrows who thinks his life would be incredibly different if he hit the homerun in the key a baseball game when he was 15. But thanks to the mysterious and magical barman Mike, Larry gets his wish, but soon he realizes that his new life is not exactly what he hoped it would be. I have to say that this movie really amazed me. Critics have mixed up and I have to say that the concept is really interesting and it is pulling away well. Yes, it's a bit standard, but it packs pretty fun moments, drama and great effect to make it really good. James Belushi (I think) was Oscar worthy of his role. Jon <br /> <br /> Lovitz is perfect and Linda Hamilton plus Renee Russo shines in his roles. Michael Caine is perfect as a bartender. It's just a good movie with a good lesson. If you have never seen it, I suggest that you check it out
