I came to see this like me and my lady did not have anything else to do on Sunday, I do not like movies that deal with dirty, lost characters and it's full of em. After a slow start, we get some good turns from shooting, but it's a real 'Bellini' that both makes and lets the movie down. "Bellini" is one of the funniest scenes I've seen in the movie for a long time, but it was too short to make it out of a masterpiece overall 71/2 of 10
