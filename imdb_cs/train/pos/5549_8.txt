The silent film Pride of the Clan with Mary Pickford was to be located on a fictional island off Scotland. In fact, most of the outside shots were filmed in Marblehead Massachusetts on the Marblehead Neck near several rocky coastal geographic areas including Churn and Castle Rock. My first interest in the film was due to two factors: 1) the Marblehead movie location in my hometown, and 2) the fact that my grandmother Lizzette M. Woodfin was hired as a rack for Mary Pickford during the shooting of several scenes, including the "Rock Scene". Both women were small (5 ') and my father and grandmother were related to being in the Chiefton capture scene with a camera on the cliff scene. I just wanted to connect this story with future film historians and enthusiasts. The movie itself (my DVD copy is somewhat poor) is very well done with a number of actions and expressive activities including several scenes where Miss Pickford portrays a strong female characterization. I liked it and I would like to get a better copy, though I'm not sure if there is, as I saw on various film pages, that the remaining copies are dark due to deterioration. Very nice movie of silent genre with a lot of events!
