Surprising thriller with multiple twists and double crosses than a soother pad. A great actress blends with a fascinating plot that oversees director Dahl. Nicholas Cage is a very underestimated actor and shows a brilliant image of a tied man looking for the right thing. J.T. Walsh (RIP to a great actor) is always a wonderful villain, like Dennis Hopper. It's such a pity that he never went to a higher profile in biz. I'm sure he has his followers. Overall, it's a great movie that will show you that you do not need big cod and commercial soundtrack to be a fun movie.
