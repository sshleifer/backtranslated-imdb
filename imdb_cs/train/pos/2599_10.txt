When I enjoyed Joyce's intricate novel, I was so prepared to be disappointed with the script of Joseph Stric and Fred Haines, given the amazing complexity of the original text. The film, however, proved to be a very well done and gentle translation of the tone, naturalism and leanness of the book. It will surely help you read the original text before viewing the movie. I imagine it seems to be unconnected, with very special episodes apparently randomly connected, without reading the text in advance that would help to understand the conspiracy. It is amazing to see how a "dirty" film is, given that he was filmed in Dublin in 1967. The Irish film censored and eventually banned him from watching a general audience in Ireland until 2000 (it turned out to restrict audiences in a private cinema , Irish Film Theater in the late 1970s). Joyce's eroticism is not just nationalistic and terrifying, it offers many wildly "twisted" episodes. It does not matter that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was released in 1922 - they were totally taboo when the film was shot in 1967. It is amazing and encouraging to watch the cream of the Irish acting profession of the 1960s, respected by all the players, courageous to tell and capture Joyce's transgressional text with such a taste. Bravo!
