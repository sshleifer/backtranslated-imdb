NEW VICTORIA is an elegantly costume and reproduced part of the history that is based on a gentle set-up, the firm direction of Jean-Marc Vall√©e from the older Julian Fellowes version of a young girl who became the longest ruling government of England - Victoria. Much of the early part of the film, the part where Victoria is the child whose mother-to-be ascended to the throne (Miranda Richardson) and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) seem to be dragging and losing in several costumes and scenery variations. But once Victoria (Emily Blunt) reaches the age and is polite Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), the movie blooms. Blunt is a strong actress and finds the fine line between the girl and the royal dignity that makes her a good foil for those who will try to control the "baby queen" - including her secretary, Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). But when she was born into her role as a queen, her eye dwells on an overwhelming German prince, Albert, and the love affair that lasts in everyone's memories is connected with the concept of linking with the company of concern with the care of her subjects - the sensitivity of Alberta. The film brings us to the birth of the first of nine children and then ends with some claims about the effects of the effects of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on various Royalties throughout Europe! It is an evening of beautiful drama and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. Fixed if it does not translate epic. <br /> <br /> Grady Harf
