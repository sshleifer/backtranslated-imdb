Peaches is a truly amazing movie. I write it down to refuse a review from someone called "Auscrit" that appeared on this page. First of all, the idea that one Monahans first film "Interview" is a television program is an extraordinary statement. Here is a film that has been praised all over the world because it's just one of the best Australian films ever made. He deserved to get the best picture. Peaches is a brave, courageous and courageous departure. He works for me on every level and I have seen her twice. Monahan is a filmmaker demonstrating great skills and unbelievable sensitivity. For "Auscrit" to comment that it's another television movie, etc. And that Hugo Weaving is not good, it just does not get a movie. Or it does not want to get it. Frankly, it's kind of a comment he expects from another filmmaker who is jealous or bitter or both. Or someone in the industry either distribution, exhibition or bureaucracy. Your mediator, who I found, simply does not describe such comments. I noticed other comments to the site and a link to the Sommersault movie. One must be interested in what people think they are looking at. Unfortunately, in Australia at the time the SS was released, it was pushing if you did not like it, then there was something wrong with you. This media manipulation is quite common. Reality is the only similarity between these two films is that they are rights to passive movies. Sadly for me SS is a movie about nothing, it could be said in 15 minutes. I see it as a one-dimensional film about anxiety. Peach in comparison is the main piece. I personally can not wait for what Monahan is doing, because there is clearly any of his contemporaries in the cinema. In conclusion, if the film does not win all this year's AFI and IF awards, then it's a manipulated game. As for the Auscrit, find something more constructive with your time
