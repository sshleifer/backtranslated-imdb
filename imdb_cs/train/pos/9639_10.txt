A very narrow and crisp description of a bubbling and dynamic emotional world, especially an 18-year-old guy who makes his first experience with his gay love to another boy during his vacation with part of his family. <br /> <br /> I like this movie because of its extremely clear and replaced storytelling, with all the "Sound-close-ups" and silent moments full of intense moods. <br /> <br />
