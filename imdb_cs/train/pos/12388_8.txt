I have read a book and I must say that this film remains true. I think this is the beginning of psychological thrillers in the same genre Psycho. Cristina Raines gives excellent performance as a manager, and Burgess Meredith gives an excellent side actor as an adjacent neighbor. I have seen this film at least twice and I think I will buy both a book and a movie for my collection. This effort is up to the climatic end, a twist you never see. If you like movies like Sign and Village, Sentinel will be the classic prelude. Also, what's interesting is the actors in the movie - you do not know them if you do not read credits. Late Jerry Orbach is great as a business director, and Jeff Goldblum is great as a photographer. There is also Beverly D'Angelo, who is underestimated but great.
