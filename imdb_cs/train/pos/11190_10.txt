One of Stephen King's best (if not the best) screenings. Dark as dark can be a surprising non-Hollywood end, scary atmosphere, awesome book adaptation, excellent cast, educational (do not play with the afterlife), in short - everything should be great horror ... <br /> <br /> My favorite horror film, straight 10+.
