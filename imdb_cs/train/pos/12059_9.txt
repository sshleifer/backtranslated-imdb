I love stories about the spirit in general, but I especially love cool, atmospheric and elegantly haunted stories about spiritual times in the style of British times. This method applies to all counts. A naive young lawyer ("lawyer" in Britspeak) is sent to a small village near the sea to settle an older, deceased female property. It's the 1920s when many middle-class Britons go on vacation for a holiday for "their health." Well, guess what it is, is not the village of Cryptin Gifford, the creepy place of old women who stretches and tastes the Victorian manor, which is on the edges of the misty marsh. When a lawyer rescues the life of a small girl (none of the locals will help the endangered tot - you will find out why later in the movie), the wrath of the evil spirit inadvertently arises, the woman in black. She is not films, gauzy wraith, but a solid black silhouette of anger and evil. The viewer sees her only a few times, but you feel her malevolent presence in every picture. Once the camera appears to a lawyer when reading through legal documents, you expect to see the woman in black every minute. When the lawyer goes to the generator shed to turn on electricity for a creepy old house, the camera throws it on him and thinks he'll be there as well. Waiting for a woman in black to appear is silently tense. We have seen many elements of this story before (a locked room to which no one comes in, a fog, a naive outsider who ignores the warning of local residents), but the director somehow managed to bring them together in a completely new, seeming and compelling ghost story. Watch this with a friend so you can have someone warm to catch while waiting for a woman in black. . .
