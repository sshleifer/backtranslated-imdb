Perhaps you will not be interested in the social commentaries or the opinion of the filmmakers (I myself thought in a "meaningless" angle that Kasdan obviously supported when clearly, the actions taken in the movie support a certain meaning. But there is no denial of the way the story is presented; wonderful symbolism throughout; threaded arc features; visual; dialogue? is an absolute masterpiece. I've been watching the movie a dozen times and I still feel its perfection. There is no moment, action, cut or line that does not have to do with the theme. Realistic human performances from all actors. Scene on stage is woven fantastically. <br /> <br /> I have a fairly smooth sapper. The buzzer never went out during this movie. If you are a thinker (rather than a random viewer)? this film brings. Exponentially. Absolutely fascinating. (Do you have to agree with the message to appreciate the display? Who cares if it made you warm and fuzzy or was not it, was it interesting?) <br /> <br /> Personally, the film influenced me? significantly. In my top 5. <br /> <br /> Note: The overview on the first page clearly speaks of a faulty African-American perception. What he might not have recognized was, was there a hand? shake. It's not manual work. The spiritually dead white man simply saw a man who should respect and admire. And he did something with it. The fact that he was black had little if it had anything to do with it (the color is used only to plot the parallel angle and the abyss). It is no coincidence that the beginning shifts from black and white to color. If you see black in this movie like? Token '?? you may want to rethink your anxiety. You may only see black and white, uh. Just an idea.
