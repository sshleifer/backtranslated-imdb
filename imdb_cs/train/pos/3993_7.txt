"Mother" is a weird, low-budget movie that touches at least two uncomfortable themes that usually do not work in the cinema: a rejection of love for a mother for her son and daughter, and desire and passion at the third age. <br /> <br /> The characters are horrible: May is a disgusting old lady and I believe it is impossible to feel any compassion or sadness for her. He admits he does not love his son and her daughter. She twice cheated her husband with an intellectual. He walks his beloved daughter so that she does not protect her from a person without morality, that she does not love her but just because she feels horny. She tries to organize her life after losing her husband in the worst possible way and destroying her daughter. Paul, her daughter, is a fragile loser who accepts her life as it is. Her brother Bobby is a man who has lost his savings because of his wife, who insists on having his business, a really awful deal. Darren is an amoral addict who does not like anyone, not even himself. <br /> <br /> Negotiation and direction are excellent: actresses and actors have excellent performance and direction is very accurate. I liked the film, but I admit it is recommended for a very specific audience. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Recome√ßar" ("Re-Start")
