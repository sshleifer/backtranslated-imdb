(2007) *** Adam Sandler, Don Cheadle, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Liv Tyler, Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Robert Klein, Melinda Dillon, Mike Binder, Jonathan Banks, Paula Newsome. He sometimes influenced and sometimes told about a thoroughly depressed man who lost his family in 9/11 (Sandler in his best role since "Punch-Drunk Love"), who reunited with his old knees with his roommate and friend (Cheadle to continue impressive work with each role yet), a well-to-do dentist who seems to do it all? family, fortune, fortune? but they really see allies in freedom with their personal life wishes of their disgusting friend. Written and directed by Binder (who collaborates as Sandler's former best friend and acting accountant) with the same work of humor and true grief the film works best when two stars share the screen until the last act falls into almost the film - to deal with problem solving.
