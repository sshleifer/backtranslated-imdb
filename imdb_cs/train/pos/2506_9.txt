Moon Child was one of the more symbolic films I've ever seen. What I really liked was an illustration of immorality / mortality and obstacles and guidelines in life. The film shows a large number of Kei vampire who has the power of immorality and benefits. Whether it has supernormal abilities or eternal life, that is what people usually want. The baby's moon shows the pain and disadvantages of immortality, because feelings of loss affect almost all characters, especially the main characters Sho and Kei. The meaning of the title "The Moon of a Child" reveals how the film is approaching the end, where it clearly shows that everyone is a moon that shines to other people in a way that gives guidance. Personality reminds me of the morale of the film. The film's weaknesses lie in some parts of the actor's and special effects, because the film is less authentic. The scene in which the Toshi character died could have been stronger and more realistic if authentic emotions had come into it. Some scenes with special effects, such as firearms, could also be more authentic without seemingly too similar to a stock video game. The sparks that came out of the weapons looked too fake, and I think it could be removed or repaired. However, I think the Moon Baby should be a movie that everyone should consider. The symbolic ideas and images that the film brings can easily be taken by anyone and could attract many viewers. It's a pretty thought-out movie and also a fun watch.
