Meryl Streep is such a genius. Well, at least as an actress. I know she enjoyed it because she does a lot of accented tasks, but she always thinks an accent. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspirational. Mrs Chamberlain, as described here, was not particularly sympathetic, not so clever. But it just makes Streep's work even more remarkable. I think he has the price of all ten Oscar nominations. The movie was a few interesting things. I do not know much about Australia, but the theme of a religious bigotry story among the general public played a big role. I have missed this many times when I first saw the movie, but it was clear and clear yesterday. And it seems that the Australian press is equally successful in efforts that lead to suffering and overcome its American colleagues. Great movie. Somewhat different. Step: B
