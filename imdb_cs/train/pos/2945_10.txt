I watched this film several times in the nineties, and I almost split on the sides when I laughed. I like Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this is something else. It's funny. Even P.C. the brigade would find this fun. It's definitely to look, and even better when you have boys or girls to drink. Taking Michael Jackson is like him when you close your eyes, you believe it's singing. The things he describes are true to life, and you really should have a humorous bypass if you think it's not funny. My local video shops do not save this video anymore, but I'd like to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and guys when they're old enough to appreciate humor. Anyway, I highly recommend, I hope you like it.
