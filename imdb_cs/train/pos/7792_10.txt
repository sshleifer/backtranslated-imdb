In the sea of ​​crap that Hollywood (and others) continue to throw away, it's one of those unreasonable diamonds. A small, simple film that is very fun and leaves you feeling like you have not lost an hour and a half of life. <br /> <br /> Ashley Judd is really quite amazing in this movie. I have never been a fan, or I have not noticed it before, but I came back and saw that its premature performance convinced me she was extremely talented. Watching this film was a job for me at college, so I was skeptical that I would be interested. I thought, "Oh, lad, a stupid crazy shot or a feminist man who has a crazy Indian cage ..." I was pleasantly surprised. Without analyzing a variety of topics I will say, if you have not seen it, do a favor and look at it. Sometimes movies on the ground are the best, and that's great.
