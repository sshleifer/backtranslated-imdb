First of all, I would like to emphasize that I have not read the book, so I did not have the chance to be disappointed in that aspect. The main mistake I've noticed was the historical detail with a few cars, trains, clothes, etc. I do not think they are at that time. <br /> <br /> A possible spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> The technical aspect of the movie is fine, nothing can boast. I think the acting was amazing. I have no experience playing, I still can not believe how people think they are terrible! Maybe they only saw two movies (sometimes) and the other had to be really good! Especially I liked Jeremy Irons and really understood his character, someone who crawled on a socially high-ranking ladder, then fought against those who would take his life from him, only to join in this fight by not realizing that reason is no longer on his side and he will end up being a beaten, disappointed man. Iron made it so incredible, I sympathized with the figure despite his brutality. After Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder is also gorgeous as a romantic young woman who is drawn to revolutionary ideals by her boyfriend (Banderas, I think he was underdeveloped, and Glenn Close was also very good.) Meryl Streep had average performance, it was not bad , just do not comply with the standards of other actors Watch out for Miguel Guilherme, a fine Portuguese actor, between so many stars, unlike today's films, here interpreting only depends on people, but it is not a tame movie, I'm writing a review about 7 years later, the best evidence I really liked.
