It's a good movie, but it's not recommended if you do not like smart movies. It's about two boys who want the world to disappear, and that's exactly what they get. It works great, the end was not predictable, and in fact, unlike most of the films, it has a good story today. People complain that the movie is too simple or too boring. I think they should just keep films like Toxic Avenger (actually I like B movies) or The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy. One Note: If you notice this, this has exactly the same Cube actors except four actors. Make two notes: Wait for credit (trust me). Enjoy the movie.
