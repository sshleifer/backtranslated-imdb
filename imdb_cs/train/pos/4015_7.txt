One of the more satisfied western all'italiana, Johnny Yuma has the freshness of many WAIs made during the genre's bloom and is highly recommended for fans of the genre or an extraordinary, intelligent cinema. <br /> <br /> Johnny Yuma is in most ways not very original, but it does not really count against it. The success of a genre film depends on how well the spectators' expectations are met, and also provides surprising variations on these expected elements. Earlier, pleasant experiences are recreated, but with gentle (or big) twists that provide a lasting interest. Performance quality is of course also important. A tired protector will be less successful than a sincere attempt to entertain or move audiences. <br /> <br /> Given these criteria, Johnny Yuma is successful. There are many repetitions of elements from earlier films. The encounter is a brutal, twisted semi-feudal twilight world shared by many of the best Western Gothic Families made 1964-1968 as the Tempo di Massacre (1966). This plot is a combination of the basic plot of Fistful Dollars (1964) and Ringo, which was not surprising, as the scriptwriter Fendiando di Leo was involved in both. Di Leo was one of the best screenwriters of the popular film based on Cinecitta in the 1960s, and his work helped to provide many thematic contexts and coherence with this genre (along with several other personalities in several different actors, directors, and screenwriters). On the land of FOD, the hero arrives in the city, causes a tense situation and then passes near death, followed by a resurrection (in some films, such as Quella sporca storia nel west (1968), it is literally crucifixion). The Catholic subtext of narrative and symbolism is interesting, especially with regard to the implicit populist / explicit socialist tendencies of the creators and their films. The Ringo plot, a more developed scriptwriter Ernesto Gastaldi in a series of movies starring Guliano Gemma, an egoistic protagonist chooses the community's interest over his own through a community member with a healthy dash of irony of uncertainty. The relationship between Carradine and Johnny is clearly based on the Manco / Mortimer relationship from Fistful of Dollar (1965). Two weapon belt replacement scenes provide clever dialogue and understanding between the two. Many films, including Da uomo and uomo (1968) or even El Chuncho, quién sabe? (1967), use this relationship between the elderly and the younger man (father / son, elder / younger brother, angelic counselor / adversary, and peasant revolutionary) as the central dynamics of the conspiracy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The focus is on fraud and misdirection, mazes and mirrors that repeat in the best early WAI. The canons and pueblos of Almeria become literal mazes through which protagonists and antagonists play cat and mouse games. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes Johnny Yuma from other WAIs is the quality of director Romero Guerriri in the use of a visual / psychological space in a common arrangement with the intelligent mechanisms of the scenario-forwarding scenario. Dialogue was never very important to WAI and often absurdly incomprehensible (he thought there were exceptions such as cynical commentaries in Django (1966) or Faccia and faccia (1967). <br /> <br /> almost exclusively through iconic images, it's a juxtaposition and it's a description of the overall narration of the situation. Find out how the presence of deadly Samantha smells during the beating scene - watch from the roof or background of the action. Or as Johnny stripes Samantha and Pedro about their security and confidence in their forces through their secret invasion on their ranch, the hotel and even on the bedroom (this is again the topic of the FOD) and finally notice how it focuses on finding information. many elements, it is borrowed from the FOD, which was ultimately based on the hard-boiled secret novel Red Harvest, it's over random contacts, looking for posters, heard conversations, window views, watches went away or mistaken identities and movements through the waves created by the actions of Pedro and Samantha in the context of this surrealistic and absurd fact that the narrative connects to its conclusion. The film was remarkable in its time for what was perceived as an obstacle to violence. Of course, these films were barely more violent than many American Westerns. What was different was the psychological intensity of the violence and the causes attributed to it, which meant that it was not violence but that it had changed. Johnny Yuma is distinct and interesting in his use and depictions of violence, and that is another interesting aspect of the film. What I personally consider to be the most interesting of most of this genre is the link that provides an anonymous, nameless audience in Italy and Spain, with these recurring narratives having a certain meaning and interest. Does the artifact need not have its own value in itself? some vaulted heritage from a prehistoric site, shard cruel ceramics or leather and rusted metal? but it is a reference to a lifeless presence, lives that were significant simply because they existed. While Johnny Yuma has its own value, much of it's interest for me comes from this connection and mystery. <br /> Appliances anumite东δύ предпоЛ Άλλα SystémЛиžitíтели Všechny = 21849889 <br /> <br /> Just for the fanatics (bottom of the barrel) http://imdb.com/mymovies/list a = 21849890
