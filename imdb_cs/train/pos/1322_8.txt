What a fascinating film. Even if it was not based on real life, forbidden lies were the fascinating portrait of the artist in her element. And that's the kind of film psychology that students could study to learn about compulsive liars. Author of Forbidden Love, Norma, was revealed as a scam in the media, but this step really gives her enough opportunity to erase her name. <br /> <br /> But the turnovers taken over by the document producer are amazing. What a patient woman! I loved this movie. I did not read the book, but I just heard good reviews and went to see the boring rainy afternoon. The way this movie interests you is smart, interesting and absolutely breathtaking.
