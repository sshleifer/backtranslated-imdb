They never saw this movie and enjoyed the singing and dancing of Cagney and other cast members: Dick Powell (Scott Blair) who had a great tenor voice and Ruby Keeler (Bea Thorn). James Cagney plays the role of Chester Kent, who writes musicals, and eventually goes into production of Prologues that appear among the feature films featured in the 1930s cinema. Chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas on his shows. It's a very funny movie with lots of comedies and lots of laughter. Joan Blondell (Nan Prescott) provided a great supporting role, which was also very young and pretty. Dick Powell was great as a singer and dancer and just started his long and successful career on the screen. Enjoy.
