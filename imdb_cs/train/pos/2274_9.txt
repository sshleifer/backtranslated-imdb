Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not interested in spy stories and I did not know about it. The only reason I've been watching is Nick Nolte, one of my favorite actors since I've seen "Breakfast of Champions" and "Hotel Rwanda." But the film brought me a pleasant surprise. Of course, Nolte was great, but it was also a conspiracy. There were quite a few political intrigues and much more focused on the moral question: by reading his anti-Semitic radio commentary with hidden secret news for the Americans, he actually contributed to the general attitude of the Germans (and later to the Americans) towards the Jews or Hitler. Who carries greater weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-Semitism? The dilemma is even more pronounced, as these words are never spoken or narrated. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a man who has learned to hide his feelings so perfectly that he does not even open his mind. An internal conflict of this nature is almost impossible to portray - but thanks to the excellent acting and photographic film it can handle it. <br /> <br /> There are other points like humor or the ironic use of romantic clich√©s (like the White Christmas song) that really differs from the average American films. I recommend it to anyone who is bored with Hollywood spy movies.
