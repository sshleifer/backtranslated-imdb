It is a low-budget movie with unknown occupation and at least the location of the shot. Philippines will replace Thailand and nobody actually goes to Hong Kong. A serial shot from Cathay Pacific, landing at an old airport, makes a perfect transition. This film proves that you do not need any mega budgets or a star on the title page to create an excellent movie. It does not include gaffes or excesses that young filmmakers often find themselves in. Strong processing from people who know all aspects of film making and who understand the compromises between art and the box office. Good job!
