A little unpredictable and bad taste; but intelligent enough to be worthy of observation. Jane Hatchard (Helena Bonham Carter) is associated with reluctant caretaker Richard (Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist who made a human flight. He builds an airplane in his garage and plans to fly. She wants to recover her own troubled life by taking care of an independent, dying Jane who suffers from a neurological illness that has left her unnecessary rhetoric and very little motor skills. The vehicle and the full spirit, her last dying desire, is to lose her virginity. It is offered to Richard who will not help her directly; but he is willing to pee the bank to pay the gigolo to do the act. I found this film ambitious and funny. Even in this role, Carter has a certain charisma and sympathy.
