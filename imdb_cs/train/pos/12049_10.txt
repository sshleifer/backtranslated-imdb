I have given this film 10/10 with some reluctance, because it is hard to praise something that has haunted me for so many years and dreaded me. A live threat on a black face is just horror, and accompanying music is aggravated by fear. <br /> <br /> I saw it when I was the first on the television when I was 10 years old, and it really has been going on for years. I am fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said so. So many movie reviews deal with how disturbing or frightening a movie can be, but you can trust everyone who sent this panel, it's really an incredibly powerful thing. I mean, I really like horror movies, and I generally consider them fun more often than not, but it is really horrible and probably it could disturb most people. I have not seen her since I was 10, and I'm tempted to look at it again, but I'm afraid I'll have a couple of sleepless nights. I can not get my finger on what's right, but I think it has something to do with the fact that fear is the biggest weapon of Women, and that we as spectators are just as prone to feel our fear so intense. It is remarkable that the feelings of other viewers are so unanimous. I also saw a scenic game, which was a great production ... but nothing can be compared.
