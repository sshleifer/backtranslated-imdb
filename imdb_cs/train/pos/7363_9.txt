It's not a song of love. <br /> <br /> My vocabulary would be `Excellent '. <br /> <br /> You probably will not be appealing to a mass movie to watch the public? it's a movie that forces you to participate. You observe, think and ask questions. The comparison can be done with Deliverance (Theme / Theme) and perhaps with The Blair Witch Project for the overall movie style. <Br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is unique against both. <br /> <br /> Cinematographic effects (solar, freeze, blur, etc.) were seen earlier, but were most often used effectively in this film to support the natural tension of the story. Participation is raw, threatening and absolutely credible. <br /> <br /> The real movie is about friendship; the name really gives the game away. It's probably not the type of friendship that most of us have experienced or really want. It's a love song.
