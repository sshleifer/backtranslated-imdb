Great movie! Slowly: YES. <br /> <br /> ... but original, deeply atmospheric, dark and frightening, perfectly SURREAL (feels like a nightmare). I compare it to David Lynch (Eraserhead, Inland Empire, Blue Velvet), which blends with a little Barton Fink and Naked Lunch (Insect!). Also a little Jodorowski (Fando y Lis) .... Add some night on Earth, Angel Heart and a little Begotten, Pi, (would it be wrong to mention Tetsuo?) Jacob's Ladder, Barker's The Forbidden and Salome - which should make up at least the concept dark nights ... NUIT NOIRE. If you are out for an advanced and / or surrealist cinema (like me) you will like it. If you expect something else like a movie full of action with some average plot - try your luck with something else. <br /> <br /> Concluding words: The plot is very, very strange and unusual, and it is probably the # 1 reason most people who hate this film do not hate.
