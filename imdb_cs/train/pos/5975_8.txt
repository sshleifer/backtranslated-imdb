Every film critic and metal head hated this movie, but I liked him. I saw it as a kid on TV somewhere, and was stunned by the scene where Sammy comes to the stage and plays Trick or Treat by Fastway. The film itself was typical of 80 years, it fills supernatural help to defeat bullying, but it goes far and must be destroyed. Matt of Melrose Place chose Skippy from a family tie, so Skippy gets a record from Tony Fields from Gene Simmons to make him happy and hell lose all the breaks, which is where Tony sings (lip-synchs) and dances on a metal song before, before the shit hits the fan. There were a lot of mistakes and things, but music and the total number of shots were enough to give my fists 8 out of 10
