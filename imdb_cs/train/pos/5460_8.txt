Lily Powers works when her father dies. Then she goes to New York to work in the office building. There he notices that if he wants to get higher, he has to give people what they want. And what men want is her ... well, you know. Alfred E. Green's Baby Face (1933) is a movie with high sexual content. For the film of that time, anyway. This was one of the last Pre-Code films that were made .Barbara Stanwyck gives a very sexy performance like Lily. Other actors include George Brent (Courtland Trenholm), Donald Cook (Ned Stevens), Alphonse Ethier (Adolf Cragg), Henry Kolker (JPCarter), Margaret Lindsay (Ann Carter), Theresa Harris (Chico). Young John Wayne is perceived as Jimmy McCoy Jr. This movie deals with a courageous theme and does it well.Baby Face is a historically significant film and therefore it is good to watch.
