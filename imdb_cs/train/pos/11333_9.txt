I'm just kidding about losing weight; well, you can lose weight, you never know. Anyway, what I can say I love this movie. He has the same feeling of youth and innocence in films like Stand By Me and The Goonies. Jake's Closet illustrates the beauty of simple things in life and how often we overlook them. The film reminds us how it is to see the world over the children's eyes, and all the magic, secrets and horrors that it perceives. Jake's Closet presents a unique story in its compassion that everyone who has a childhood can relate to it and fall in love with it. Watch it with your friends; to look at them with loved ones; build strength - wine optionally.
