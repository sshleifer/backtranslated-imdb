This show has a great story! It's very credible! The married wife dies and can not take care of her own children and therefore calls her brother to have his best friend and many others come later in the show. Just like Rebeecca Donaldson, dear but powerful dog Comet, Nikki and Alex, you can find out for yourself (I do not want to spoil it for you) and force Kimma Giblera! (Sidekick DJ), but the children are also wonderful. That's Mary Kate and Ashley first flew! And maybe you know Candace Cameron Bure from performing as St.Elsewere Punky Brewster and that's so raven! Jodie Sweetin plays Steph, a loving middle-aged child who feels omitted. It really is a very good show!
