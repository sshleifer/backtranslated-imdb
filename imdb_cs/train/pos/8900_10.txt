This is an amazing classic monster swing from the 1950s! I love the appearance of the 1950s as a car and music. Anyway, I love the way the blob looks. I love when everyone is in the late night horror movie in the theater and the blob comes and crashes the party. Another thing I like is that everything is happening in one night, just like in Halloween II. When Steve and Jane are doing, they see the meteor falling from space. There are drops inside the meteor. Whenever a blob consumes a human, it grows bigger and bigger. He tries to convince the city's inhabitants of the homeless, but no one believes them until later. Could something stop this creature? I highly recommend BLOB !!!
