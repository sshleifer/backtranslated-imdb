I am very sorry that this charming and moody film (which I first saw when it was released for the first time in the early 1950s) has had such a poor reception lately. In my opinion, it is very underestimated - perhaps more like the European sense of humor than the American one: perhaps we can understand and appreciate its subtleties and situations more in Europe because we are closer to some of real life! Special mention should be made of limited but high quality music - a particularly catchy and unforgettable song "It's a Great, Fine Night" that was released separately at the HMV 78rpm record (10inch plum tags, I think!) In the 1950s. I urge someone who is interested to try it if you have a chance: you can have a pleasant surprise.
