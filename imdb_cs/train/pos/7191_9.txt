Reed Hadley makes better actor Don Diego than he did a bold and daring Zorro, but that's almost near the point because this series presents a bar-no best song song of any serial, ever - and best version of Yakima Canutt's famous stagecoach stunt. There are other good pieces and lots of action and a lot of hair limbs, but if for no other reason you do not have to see this movie, you have to look at the script and eventually watch it slow. It's unbelievable, and despite the lower budget for this chapter, Yak plays better stunt than in the more famous film "Stagecoach". Indiana Jones, eat your heart out: This is a real deal!
