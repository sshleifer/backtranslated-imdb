If you think "Weird Al" Yankovic is cheerful, you will not be disappointed by COMPLEAT AL. This notorious moccaster not only contains many of the unforgettable videos of Yankovic ("As a Surgeon" and "I Love Rocky Road" among them), but they are intertwined with funny vignettes that supposedly highlight the rise of parody fame. Yankoviƒç is not for all tastes, but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even non-fans will be at least slightly entertained. Damn fans will love not only his content but also a fairly early look at Yankovic's almost 30-year career. Suitable for all ages, children will undoubtedly love fun visuals.
