A very well-done and scary horror film from PRC's poor film company, which mostly lists really charming movies like DEVIL BAT or FLYING SERPENT. German expatriate director Wisbar makes miracles with a small budget and his studio swamp kit. Gaunt and the evil Charles Middleton are as effective as the Strangler.
