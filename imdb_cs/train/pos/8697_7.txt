Often mixed loudly funny games about sex, family and classes in Beverly Hills make milk more laugh at the postage code than seen from the days of Granny and Jed Clampett. The plot focuses on two chauffeurs who have bet on which one can send their employers (both singles or soon to be ladies, quite sexy - Bisset and Woronov). If Manuel wins, his friend will pay off his debt for the violent Asian street gang - if he loses, he must play the man with his boyfriend! <br /> <br /> A lot of clumsy dialogue, relatively sick physical humor, etc. But a lot of comedy is right under the surface. Bartel is unforgettable as a very sensual family member who eventually marries his sexy, teenaged niece for an annual "mission trip" to Africa. Cheerful fun.
