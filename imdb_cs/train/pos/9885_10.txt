Young Erendira and her tyrant grandmother provide a new fantasy from the new world. This interpretation by Gabriel Garcia Marquez "La incréible y triste historia da la cándida Eréndira, ..." does not rub Marquez purists in the right way eventhough The story remains intact and still carries the full force of work. The power of this film is mainly Papas as a grandmother. Marquez fans and Marquez novices alike will have this film as their real harsh brand joke.
