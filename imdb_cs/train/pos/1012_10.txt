Stargate SG-1 is a reflection of the 1994 Stargate. I'm so glad they decided to extend this issue. The show revolves around the first episode, Jack O'Neill, who retired, has to go through the gate again and meet his old companion Dr. Daniel Jackson. During the first two episodes we meet Samantha Carter, a very intelligent person that no one leaves, and there is Teal'c, a quiet, sympathetic warrior who defends his false god and joins the team. <br /> <br /> Major evil people are called Gouald, they are parasites that can get into the brain, so they can control and do evil deeds. Every Gouald, who has an enormous amount of power, is often considered to be the "Lord of the System". The warriors behind Gouald are called Jaffa, who paradise Gouald in the body until Gouald can get into the human brain. In the episodes, we usually look at SG-1, a reconnaissance team composed of Jack / Daniel / Teal'c / and Sam, through a wormhole that immediately transmits them to other planets (this device is called Stargate) and encounters new cultures or bad people. Some episodes are in the world, which means they do not go through the stargate in the episode, and rather deal with the urgent problems on Earth. Over the years, the SG-1 began to decline by how close the knit, and the other character-building story of the line. This in turn means even more worldly episodes, which is quite understandable. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8.75 / 10 ---- While most of this show is good, there are some examples of stories not always packing and less emphasis on gates traveling in the last few years. But still, top science fiction!
