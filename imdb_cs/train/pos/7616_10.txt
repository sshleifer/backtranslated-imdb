Here is an innovative television drama; which so easily connects a compelling story, brilliantly pulled out character development, humor, romance and drama into each episode. Here is a show that sings on her own melody, whether it's an audience, deciding to follow or not. How many other TV shows these days are boldly changing in tone from one season to another? Where most of the top performances on this site have found a formula that brings viewers and dollars and sticks to this formula (Prison Break, 24 and Desperate Wives come to mind) - LOST takes another path where even after reaching this plateau and winning the formula is a team of executive producers so brave that they develop an overall idea to meet their higher target goal. LOST differs from normal TV here. So it's so defensive to conventional television. And that's why LOST is one of the most modern and state-of-the-art modern televisions. Forget the Chains - LOST is, has been and will always be to soothe your cult after the first and the public next. But it's proof that it's ingenuity to have a fan base that consists of the best of both spectators.
