When Jackie Chan first became famous with Drunken's master, he again appeared in the spotlight of Project A in 1983, an extremely pleasant pirate film that once again made him the main star. At a time when the police story was released two years later, the extra harassment around Jackie got into its zenith and crowds gathered to see this frenetic mix of great stuntmen, brutal fighting scenes, and dubious comedy. Broke down numerous box-office records and inspired a 50% increase in police recruits, but looking at 20 years - is that good? As an action film, Police Story undoubtedly stands. There are some amazing fighting scenes, a stuntman reminding of the best of Chan's hero Buster Keaton, and a convincing, though violent, top. Jackie's performance is also very strong, and although frequent expeditions to a comedy comedy blur the film with little impact, his charisma conveys him. Besides, while presenting our hero as a border psychopath, whose ruthlessness threatens others, Jackie took a significant advance ... even though no one seemed to notice! By complimenting the police story as a simple "Good vs. Evil" fight critic, he has slackened the film's ambiguity of the tone, and though it is barely the Brothers Karamazov when he was such uncertainty, the film was nevertheless an important and praiseworthy move away from conventional thoughts. > <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, it remains a quality popcorn movie * (though you can empty your stomach as numerous villains are attacked or stored in glass showcases in the final scene) - a powerful, frantically fun action movie that ranks best .
