The best of the Zorro series and one of my favorite series, the season. This is a serial set of the period just after the birth of Mexico. The new nation relies on the gold made by this city to keep the Republic solvent. However, the golden god, Don del Oro, raises Indians and steals gold for himself. His Zorro and his group of men on rescue. Reed Hadley is the winner of Zorro, and he brings with him a breathtaking figure when he gets into a nice selection of remnants (most of which were re-used by later Zorro series as well as other serials). The story moves, and it's pretty unclear who's a real bad guy. There's a reason I've seen most of the series I've seen, it's just a great action adventure movie. The only thing I can compare is the Zorro brand with Tyrone Power or one of the other seasonal hijackers. Its super and highly recommended.
