An interesting combination of comments that it would be hard to add something constructive. I'll try, though. It was a very good action movie with some great pieces. Note that I have entered the genre. I did not understand the lack of characterization and I did not show acting. Enjoy it for what it is people, which is an extraordinary action movie. I could go on, but I made my comment.
