Henry Thomas was "great." His nature kept me attentive. I was so "in" the story that I forgot it was not true. I wanted to keep the baby and see what a special person he is. The other people in the story were of fundamental importance for his character. The way they joined together to help each other was truly a respect. I like movies that show the real face of human emotions without having to hit your head because you are not smart enough to realize it.
