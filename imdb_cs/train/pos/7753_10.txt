This Belgian film directed by Tom Barman, the singer of the well-known dEUS band, will not all be preferred. For the simple reason that there is no clear story or even plot. This film shows only 24 hours in the "city" (here Antwerp) and allows you to watch and really enjoy dialogues, direction, humorous (Dario !, osteopath Bruno !, ...) and tragic (Windman, Paul Garcin, ...). <br /> <br /> There are several memorable scenes: Windman on the beach, party at the end of the dance, KISS fan, Windman visit the osteopath, ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some viewers may not understand what is so beautiful in this movie and interesting. They complain that this movie does not have a story, etc. But it's the atmosphere that keeps you watching, and it will attract you. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen them yet, be sure to listen carefully to the music. Soundtrack is extraordinary, just like Tom Barman and his dEUS band. And "ssst, mondje dicht h√©." (do not tell anyone)
