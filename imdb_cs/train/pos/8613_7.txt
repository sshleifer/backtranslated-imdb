Charles McDougal's film is directed by episodes on "Sex and the City", "Desperate Wives", Queer as Folk, "Great Love", "Office", etc., So come with all the credentials, Meg Wolitzer's novel SURRENDER, DOROTHY SUCCESS. And for the most part, he is able to keep this potentially horrible story about the sudden death of a loved one and the way people respond to the surface in her life. Sara (Alexa Davalos) A beautiful, unmarried young woman accompanies her best friends - homosexual playwright Adam (Tom Everett Scott), Adam's current squeezing Shawn (Chris Pine), and Maddy (Lauren German) and Peter (Josh Hopkins) summer vacation. The group looks cheerful until they go to the local ice cream from Adam and Sary) leads to a car crash that kills Saru. Meanwhile, Sara's mother, Natalie Swedlow (Diane Keaton), who has an active social life but afflicts her daughter constantly with the memory of "Surrender, Dorothy", plays it elsewhere: when she receives a phone call that Sarah is dead, she immediately comes to Hamptons where her sovereign personality and sadness create friction among Sary's friends. Slowly but surely Natalie will reveal the secrets of each of them, prospering to talk about Sarah, as if to bring her to life. Natalie's thirst for truth at all costs leads to fundamental changes in the group, and it is only because of the binding love of Sary's departure that they all eventually come together. Diane Keaton is in her best in these roles that walks inside of drama and comedy and her presence holds the story together. The script has its moments on good tracks, but it also has plenty of stuff that becomes somewhat heavy and sharp, which makes apparently the inconvenient actors they give them. Yes, this story has been told many times - the impact of sudden death on the lives of those whose privacy is changed by publication - but the film moves along with a determined pace and has enough real fun to be worth it.
