When I see that Keifer Sutherland plays his favorite figure in television history, it was premature to end that I'm going to the movies and spending $ 15 for that. I also think it's about Eva Longoria's fans. The film revolves around the leak that the secret service agent plans to assassinate the president. As the investigation unfolds, it seems that the only likely candidate is very decorated with Pete (Michael Douglas). Pete, who enforces his innocence, goes into fun, fugitive style to seek the truth. It's solid, but certainly not spectacular. A decent cast, a decent story, but it made me feel a little empty, but you would definitely do it much worse.
