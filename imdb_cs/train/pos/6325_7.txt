Not only is this movie fun, with great comedy, but also interesting political. It was proclaimed at the end of the Soviet Union, but it is fun of the Soviet mentality. The story originated in the early days of the Soviet Union and casts doubt on the rationale behind the revolution, both from a cultural and practical point of view. Of course, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the bizarre strictures of Soviet society were already relaxed, but ideology and mentality are still alive and well prepared for some deserved deconstruction. Fortunately, this deep philosophical commentary is packed into a fun and entertaining package! <br /> <br /> Jur
