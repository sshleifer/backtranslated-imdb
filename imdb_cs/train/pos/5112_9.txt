This movie has everything, action, fighting, dancing, riding, music, beautiful girls. This movie is an authentic view of Central America. Believe me I was there in 1980. Lots of money on oil, lots of women, and a lot of tonka hunts. Pity they are gone now. The film is basically just another boy meets the girl, the boy loses the girl, the boy gets the girl back but is redeemed by actors and music. There is absolutely no movie with any better music that this movie, including American graffiti. It's a movie I watch over and over, and I never bother it. Every time I look at her, I'm young again, and it's time to go out, honky tonking. The only reason I gave him only 9 is that you can not evaluate the zero of the movie, I do not feel you should rate one of the 10.
