This movie is an excellent step, you never have to wait for the laughter of the belly that would appear more than a minute and is much more than the initial premise of the film. There are festivals around the world from the traditional schmaltzy genre of local boys - good-to-beat-adversity, from which they parody. Do not let anyone tell you that they are trying to get cheap laughter just by obscenity - surely, there is plenty, but it's all contextual, not free. I loved this movie and it cost me only $ 2.99 on DVD, so when it comes to the value of entertainment for money, it was the best movie I've seen this year.
