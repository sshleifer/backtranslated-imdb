Paul Verhoeven (genius and principal filmmaker) strikes back with less than a perfect, yet fun, "dirty old man," Hollow Man. The first two acts are so good that the ultimate act of the Slashers is disappointing. Still, I recommend this movie because it's the special effects of MIND FLOWING (maybe the best of the past) and two dandy performances. Verhoeven's moral question is, of course, a provocative idea, and although the film has turned off many, this film is quite soft-core for the old Verhoeven. Two major mistakes: Josh Brolin (aka walk ape) and the whole agreement with the elevator. If the ladder was accessible, why were they imprisoned in the lab? <br /> <br /> A fun horror film for Saturday night.
