Probably the first Portuguese film I've ever seen in my life, and I liked it. This conspiracy resides in how young military officers took power in Portugal in 1974 to eventually defeat the Caesar fascist government and also to complete wars in the colonies, ie Mozambique, Angola and Bissau - Cape Vert. Most of the events in the movie accurately reflect the behavior of military officers and soldiers to carry out the coup, the oppressed people who were very happy with this new development, the resistance of Caetan's men, and the gentle way most conservative officials, including Spinola, took over as new president. The Portuguese Revolution can be remembered due to the action of several young officers, but to me, it was the most interesting part of the film when the young captain expressed that Portugal must develop democratically and that is what the country achieved after years of this coup or revolution. The film also shows that military officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; even the most serious enemies were finally respected.
