I do not hesitate to put this adaptation on "Death Trap" on the list of the best five best film adaptations: "Caine and Reeves (underestimated actor who never had a chance to make more than wet romance and" Superman "play very well.) Even Dyan Cannon I'm not sure that the comparison of "Deathtrap" and "Sleuth" - another brilliant adaptation on stage with Michael Caine - is valid or even fair.Ale of course, two things have a lot in common, but "Sleuth" about the class struggle as a fight with the witty and the house in "Sleuth" is set to be at least as character in the film as two actors - the house does not really have the equivalent of "Deathtrap." And "Deathtrap "is not so much a fight with wisdom as it is a top sign of how people are not damned good (and never smart as they think they are) and deserves everything they get. eknu that both films are excellent examples of this genre, and well worth your time and money. This is America after all. You do not have to make a decision! <br /> <br /> I will not make twists and turns of plot, but I do not think it matters. I watched the DVD eight to nine times a dozen years and still enjoyed chemistry, timing, and average scary moments when it all went "in the shape of a pear." It's all done so well that the ride becomes more important than the real destination. Anyone who likes a black comedy and Hitchcock-style tension will probably love the "Deathtrap" immensely.
