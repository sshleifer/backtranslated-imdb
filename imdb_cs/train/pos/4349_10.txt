Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) unexpectedly enters his son. His son Ben Kleinman (Paul Reiser) is quite surprised that his mother Muriel Kleinman (Olympia Dukakis) has left her father's wife Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) and his three sisters are trying to find Muriel while Ben and his father go to see the farm is on sale.But it's not the end of their journey.Their road trip will turn into a long session therapy between Ben and his father. Raymond De Felitta is the director (2005). Paul Reiser is behind the scenario and he did a remarkable job. The dialogue between Ben and Sam is just amazing. And he's been working with the script for twenty years, so no wonder he's so good Who'd be better to play than Father Peter Falk? Nobody, I can tell you. And I really love the story about why Paul wanted Peter Falk for that part. Peter was an actor laughing at his laughter. And Peter definitely laughed at me in this movie. It's just funny when you go fishing. And how the old man defeats the younger in the pool game and then defeats him with his wand. The film is often very entertaining and I laughed at the same time several times. But it can also be from time to time. You could not tell the story any better than it was said.
