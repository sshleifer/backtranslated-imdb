This movie has everything. Emotion, power, affection, adorable naked beach dance Stephane Rideau ... Expresses the need for a true inner community and external communication in any relationship. Just because Cedric and Mathieu are gay men does not mean that there is not a relatively useful look for someone. I would probably classify him as a gay movie but could be appreciated and loved by heterosexual people as well as homosexual and bisexual people. Mathieu's inability to handle his emotions tells us how our society does not call us to act otherwise, and that is what causes a mismatch between him and Cedric. This is definitely necessary !!!!
