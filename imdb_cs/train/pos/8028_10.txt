This is the best movie I've ever seen! Thomas Beckett and Richard Miller - Two people who want to survive in the "jungle" of violence and madness, one shot - one killed! You have to kill, if you have any doubts about something you have to overcome! <br /> <br /> P.P.- I apologize for my bad / worst / english !!!
