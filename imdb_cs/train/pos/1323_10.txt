The best-selling book on honor killings in Jordan recalls its publishers after accusations that the story was made; associated with other accusations of the author's past as con-women. A few years later she reappeared and admitted that she had obtained a number of dramatic licenses, but she was willing to work with a filmmaker to prove the nature of her charges. What follows is a fascinating view of a pathological personality, someone who has one's behavior does not make sense if what he says is not true but he seems unable to say anything that is not surprisingly dramatic but best proved and most often verifiable False. It's almost impossible to imagine what Mrs. Khouri wished to get by appearing in this film: justification? personality? - all he does is show a certain image of himself as a deeply damaged person, and it can not even be accepted in nominal value. Director Anna Broinowski is increasingly appearing at the camera when her film progresses and is increasingly upset, but eventually it is rewarded with a remarkable, though terrifying and disturbing story - and one of those films that remind us of what a totally weird world is, where we live.
