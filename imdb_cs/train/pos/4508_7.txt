I was amazed by the beautiful photograph in this movie, which was filmed on site in Alaska. Although it is a technical melodrama, we see a lot of activities that eskims deal with, such as hunting, dancing, building igloo etc. And their customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, are commonly in the story. Hunting sequences were sometimes from a serial track because it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals, but they were also fascinating. Spear fishing for salmon, walrus, caribou, and even polar bear and whale, seemed like a documentary. He did not have a list that reinforced the documentary taste. Movie makers have tried to make it seem truly authentic, where natives speak only in Eskim language that was translated by someone on screen or internal titles. In the introduction, it was stated that, with the exception of white traders and the Canadian police of the Royal Assemblies, there were no actors in the film, but that was not strictly true. The two main characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimus from birth, but they were professional actors with credits for earlier films, and sometimes they saw that they had makeup. But they were excellent in their roles and they continued to have Hollywood careers. Overall, the film definitely pays off.
