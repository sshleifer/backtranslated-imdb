The title got my attention and then I was wondering what happened in the plot, as we saw so many "super-people" movies in those years ... and actually I really enjoyed it because there were a lot of unusual fun scenes that I did not wait. Uma Thurman played as an average in the role of G-Girl. Surprisingly, I was able to follow her fingers on a wide screen (as at the beginning of Kill Bill). Luke Wilson played a very good idiot everyday guy who meets a big woman, I can actually get into his situation. If you want a light entertainment experience, you should definitely watch the adventures of G-Girl and average Matt, especially to cheer up your partner. 7/10 in your collection.
