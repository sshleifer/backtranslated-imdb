It's such a fantastic film, Western about a man who cares about himself (Jimmy Stewart) and goes to the golden Klondike. On the way, he came to the local sheriff in Alaska (John McIntire, who was doing a terribly poor performance), who is piling back. McIntire threatens to be dead if he ever returns to his city, which is, unfortunately, the only way back to the states. The main part of the story is that the peaceful city of Klondike Dawson has turned upside down about the new inhabitants of McIntire. For example, Ruth Roman, who came with Stewart and his two companions (Jay C. Flippen and Walter Brennen, who plays Stewart's best friend), builds a salon (a hollywood front for the howitzer) and tries to run an urban restaurant and hang out. She is preparing the way for McIntire and his friends to come. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann created one of the highlights of the Western genre The Naked Spur. The country is the smallest one and contains 99.9% of what made this film so special without, of course, feeling like a cheap copy. Like Naked Spur, Far Country boasts beautiful cinematography on site. The landscape is beautiful. Stewart gives one of his best performances (almost equal to his greatest 1954 success, rear window). I suppose it could be considered a clich√© because it starts with a selfish loner and learns what kind of existence eventually plays. Yet Stewart plays it so damn well, making this character very human. And the supporting performances are fantastic. In addition to those I mentioned, the adorable French actress Corinne Calvet is very good. And I should omit Walter Brennen. He seems to have specialized in playing best friends. His relationship with Stewart is very moving, since at first he is the only character that can make a human being a cynical man. The script is very well written and Mann's direction is impeccable. Masterpiece. 10/10.
