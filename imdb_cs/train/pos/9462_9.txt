A clean family-oriented film. I laughed, I cried ... I loved it. I was afraid that Steve Carrell would not be able to see anything but a fucking Michael from the Office. Boy, I was wrong. For his performance he should win the Oscar. I will definitely buy it on DVD when it comes out. My husband was looking forward and not in the movies of this "type". I saw it with two other couples at the age of 30 and we all agreed that this is the best movie we've seen in the long run and definitely the purest. Only 1 cuss word! He was not even sure why PG13 was. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who likes comedy, drama, romance and more!
