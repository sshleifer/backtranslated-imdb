Dick Tracy is perhaps the best movie based on comic films. The movie has the same feeling as a comic book and remains true to the color scheme. The Batman series climbed, fell, climbed, and fell again. Dick Tracy has real power as something that can be enjoyed by both adults and children. Good guys triumph over evil, without blood and gore, to get to the point. Al Pacino does a great job of his own adaptation of Big Boy Caprice and Madonna is memorable like Breathless. But the best work is by far Warren Beatty, who embodies Dick Tracy as well as Clyde Barrows. I can not wait until it starts on DVD on April 2, 2002, the tape is thin.
