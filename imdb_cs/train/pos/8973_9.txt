I saw this movie when I was a little kid on TV (thank you to Canadian radio companies) and after a few years it was nightmares. Trnka was one of the mentors for Bratislava Pojar, one of Canada's Best Animation National Film Board. Pojar was again the mentor and co-worker of the great Drouin. If you like Trnka, you should see the "night angel". <br /> <br /> Symbolism is obvious but meaningfully used. Opposition of beauty and life (plant) are in opposition to anonymity hand in hand. Poor puppet hero is sentenced despite the lack of political agenda. What I most remembered was the feeling of oppression in decoration. The small room where the event takes place is the whole world of the character. The invasion of hands is a complete violation of this world. <br /> <br /> A beautiful and spooky movie. In public, I found a copy of this and other wonderful shorts from Trnka and showed it to my own children. You must see.
