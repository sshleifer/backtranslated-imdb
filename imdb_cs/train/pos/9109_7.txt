It is mainly the story of the two men who were part of the Portuguese Revolution. It was easy to understand the competition, but usually directors start talking about something else from the historical fact or they also show the period before or after this fact, everything is happening during the few days when the revolution is working. It could also be understood as a documentary. The film focuses on these two people, showing how they are normal, not as ordinary heroes, because the revolution comes from people. Although it was made of military army from the title you can understand that they were just "capitaes" as the main characters. Nice colors and lights throughout the movie, excellent work for the director is her first film, not a banal journey. Well-shown emotions and the passion of people and the crowd. The character maia (master) is well done and Stefano Accorsi is also a good interpretation that can show Maia limits, which is not a hero.
