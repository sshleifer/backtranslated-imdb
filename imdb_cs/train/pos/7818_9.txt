I think the context of the story has been covered with other posters, so I just want to write about the impact this movie has on me. I first saw the movie in 1987. My school organized a trip to the cinema to see her. We were all excited, of course, because we were on a school trip to the cinema! Few know what we were going to experience. Until today, I still remember the feelings she had in me, and I remembered how much she was crying, like most of my friends. I think that at the time we were, we considered it shocking and quiet, rightly offended by our own youthful way. It had such an impact on me that I joined the Anti Apartheid movement the same year. I think it served in my case.
