The third film Fred MacMurray / Carole Lombard is a bit more serious than Hands Across the Table and the Princess comes across. It is another adaptation of the Burlesque game, which was apparently popular during the day. The original Burlesque game ran on Broadway in the 1927-1928 season for 372 performances and it is Carole Lombard's role Barbara Stanwyck was born on Broadway, which brought her to Hollywood. The star version was played by Nancy Carroll in the early days of the Talkie, and later Betty Grable and Dan Dailey made another version of when my baby smiles at me. In fact, I have a vinyl album that Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler made for Lux Radio Theater. That's an interesting job, believe me. Anyway, MacMurray and Lombard are making old chestnuts, the story is now in a nightclub where singer Lombard and MacMurray is a jazz trumpeter. Take note of Dorothy Lamour's nice performance as a Latin vixen that will get between Fred and Carole. Anthony Quinn is also one of his earliest films like a Wolf named Lombard. Swing High, Swing Low is really nice today, and I would not be surprised to see another version of Burlesque for the twenty-first century.
