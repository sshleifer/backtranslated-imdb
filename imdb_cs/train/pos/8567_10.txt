I enjoyed the film and I would like to suggest if you enjoyed it. Do not take the movie too seriously because you remember it's Disney and it's rated G. It's good fun though some parts can be recognized by adults, but children will never notice, especially a "triangle" between Cruel, Le Pelt and Faithful Cruelou valet Alonso. Glenn Close is fantastic and really made Cruella her own and is credibly scary, although she is "cured" from her furry loving ways, she can bring fear to the audience with her threats that literally shake the theater. (I even found myself at my congress when she surprises you with her "bipolarity" like a dog who loves Ella.) Overall, I'm returning to the theaters so I enjoyed it so much.
