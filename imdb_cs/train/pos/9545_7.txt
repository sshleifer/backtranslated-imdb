I do not know if I recommend this movie to fans of "Tetsuo" or not. Why "Tetsuo"? Because you can easily label some things about this movie as a very obvious "Tetsuo" rip-off. The concept is similar, editing is just as frantic and fast - which is good, because besides the fact that the film is more dynamic, it covers some shortcomings caused by low budgets and other factors. , lesser eroticism, and in the case of "Meatball machines," the transformation of a human being into a creature that is partly a machine called "Necroborg" (very original) is caused by slim aliens. <br /> <br /> These slimy tiny skulls of the universe actually use human beings as vessels for their gladiatorial games that play each other. They infect the body, somehow managed to put into it the poor number of mechanical parts that seemingly lost them from nothing and transformed it into a killing machine that focuses on other Necroborgs. Their goal is to beat another stranger who is in another Necroborg, dig him out of the corpse and eat. <br /> <br /> Overall, it sounds a little stupid and I did not expect much, but the end I actually enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's a low budget, but it's still fairly decent. Do not expect a lot from actors, usually not very good, but they can be tolerated. I enjoyed the atmosphere and gore, some bizarre situations and the way the film is shot and edited. Though the story is not very original, it has a certain spell - at least for me. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10.
