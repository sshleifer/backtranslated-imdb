Halloween is one of those movies that will get your skin deep! In my opinion, it is the most frightening film of all time. Michael Myers is the best boogeyman ever! He was so terrible! What makes Halloween so special is that there were no special effects where you can tell how the computer animated it is, it was on a low budget and had one point of note but it managed to scare the hell out of people. 25 years and this movie still has the same effect as in 78. It's about Michael Myers, they kill his sister at the age of 6, and so many years later escape the mental institution. Dr. Sam Loomis is after him and will do everything to get him back because Michael describes "... pure evil, the darkest eyes, the devil's eyes." Michael is on a mission but kills his second sister, Laurie, starring Jamie Lee Curtis. She has to watch Halloween while her friends are out and of course, we know the rules, they get it! But Laurie may have a chance because she's a virgin. D Halloween gives a lot of honor to Psycho, we have another character called Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis, daughter of Janet Leigh. Halloween is an absolutely awesome movie that breaks the borders and causes you to lock the door, open the windows and turn off lights! "They'll get you, they'll get you!". Halloween, the ultimate horror movie! <br /> <br />
