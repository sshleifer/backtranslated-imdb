I have to admit - the only reason I bought this movie was because I'm a big fan of Gackt and * a huge * Hyde fan. I expected a good movie with lots of shots that would be, as we say, a nice feminine eye, but a slightly cheese story. I mean, the synopsis really sounded. And now that I just watched her-I feel the world has to be told about my brilliance! Hyde and Gackt both showed the heart and my eyes are still hot from the crying that lasted for the last half of the movie. You get into the story and you really feel that way. The element of vampirism - which I love, but it is very easy to overwhelm or destroy the film - is gently mixed into the story to make it something exotic, normal for this setting rather than a random unnecessary addition to the story. I placed it at the beginning of 9 of 10 ... and then I went back and tried to think about why I did not give him the last point. He came with nothing. So, ten out of ten. After all - I'm not much critic - the fact that I'm afraid to write a review means I either really hate the movie or I really love it. You can tell me which side I am with the baby's moon.
