The first and second season began shivering, with good episodes between interdisciplinary and sometimes resorting to clich√© stories. But as soon as it begins to create the universe in which it exists and has begun to develop its characters more, it has become more fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The main reason why this show has succeeded for four men: Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Deluis, Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullie. Richard's dry sense of humor shows it much better, Peter's leadership is excellent and makes any episode much more fun, and Joe & Paul has never been able to make a funny, interesting episode together. <br /> <br /> Once you understand what the show is and what you know, I doubt you will not like it. For those who get into the show, I suggest episodes "The Other Side", a good serious episode and "Window of Opportunity," a classic comic relief episode.
