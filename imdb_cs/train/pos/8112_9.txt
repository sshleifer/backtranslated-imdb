Genius William Cameron Menzies and Herbert George Wells have created this exceptional film with eyes, ambitions and difficulties that can be found today. They predict the Second World War, the way the United Kingdom was attacked, and the fact that after the war, the universe will follow. Changing timing; in film war and exploration of the universe are much longer, but there are so many qualitatively right things that are amazing. We even see the helicopter (the movie is older than them). <br /> <br /> Unforgettable giant aircraft and futuristic meritocracy of scientists who look like Romans with bubble helmets: If you can see through these funny costumes, you will appreciate the state of artistic architecture of the 30th century masters, Well's vision of rational society, interesting reflections on the nature of power and John Cabal as an archetype of an adventurous and inventive human being who decides to shape reality and not be shaped by it. <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 of 10. Inspiring like the final monologue John Kabal.
