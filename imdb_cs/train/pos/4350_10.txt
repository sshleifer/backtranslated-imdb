This film is one of the films he likes. It's earthy, grounded and a movie that makes you think ... and smile. Paul Reiser and Peter Falk will take you on a journey that you will not forget. The soundtrack is beautifully diverse and convenient; and the film itself is like a breath of fresh air. It certainly deserves recognition of both the film and the actors! Finally, a work of art that deviates from the obvious love stories and frequent special influences that are visible today. I never went out of a movie with such a deep warmth and a feeling of reflection in my heart; because it felt as if someone had packed it on a fleece blanket. To see this movie, you need to find real treasure and enjoy.
