This movie is such a good grain. A lot of people trapped in an abandoned school. They start killing, they know they are being persecuted, so what do they do? One girl decides to bathe, the other chooses to cheat her husband (who is also there) with an old friend to find a bed (in an old abandoned school?) And go for it. <br /> <br /> And it comes with gore and T & A. And it's also interesting from a historical / sociological point of view. Where the usual 80s slash is a reflection of how we look at each other, or how adults see young people, or as Hollywood views of the rest of the country, it has a unique look. This is a British film made as an American slasher. It's fun to see how often British actors who are trying to talk "American" inadvertently slip back into their British accents. If you like straw 80 slashers (like Pieces), then you like it.
