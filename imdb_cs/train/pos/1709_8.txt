After locking up Halloween's Orson Welles' classic radio adaptation WAR OF THE WORLDS for the true invasion of Mars, a group of sinister Martians appear on Earth, . <br /> <br /> It really is quite good and fun, with some decent lines (just check the unforgettable quotes) to start. This will most likely appeal to sci-fi fans. It passed the test of time for me because it saw it again lately turned out much better than I expected it would be. In spite of being cast from an unnamed star, it may be just the most entertaining invasion of Mars ever filmed. Interestingly, martians themselves represent almost every classic action hero / Sci-Fi Hero stereotype, which is (teen 50 years, fighter pilot, ruthless astronaut, brave soldier and cow scientist). Entertainment for the whole family. <br /> <br /> "Get ready for DIE! Earth Scum!"
