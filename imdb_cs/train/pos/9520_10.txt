It's a beautiful movie. The true story of the bond between father and son. That's by far Tom Hanks at his best. Tom Hanks is really out of the box in this movie. She usually has nice guy roles. Still, in this film, this film comes as a bit shy, but still smells like a rose, even to the last scene, assassination of its character. The casting of this film was well connected. I really like it when there's a complete silence when Tom Hanks's character shoots and kills all the men in Mr Rooney's group. There is something cold and yet deep that there is no sound in this scene, just an emotion. I like to look at John Rooney's character, Paul Newman's figure when he realizes that before he saw him, Tom Hanks is missing revenge, and he knows his fate has come. The first time I saw this movie I blew and I knew I had to go out and get a video and since then I added my favorite movies to my collection. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is my favorite actor, so this movie has a special place in me.
