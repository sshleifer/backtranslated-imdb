I wish I was "in the 1970s" to return to television. It was the biggest show ever !!! They should make episodes among other episodes, but of course they would be confusing. But I want her to come back and make more episodes. Please come back ... The show was absolutely cheerful. You could not laugh without seeing an episode. Every episode is really funny and the show was much better when they went along with Hyde and Jackie. Those were the best episodes. "The '70s show is the best" .... It will and will always be the best show ever. It was really sad when she finished the show. They should make new episodes.
