I just read the comments of TomReynolds2004 and I felt I had to jump in here. I understand he does not like the movie, but his reasons are not obvious. My feeling about this movie is that they are not afraid to travel on dark paths of loneliness, failure, disappointment and sadness. Each of these two people, as it is portrayed, has many reasons to be bitter and angry, but to find tenderness and comfort in each other. Only great acting could do this without becoming an emotional fool, sentimental and poor. I began to care for these people because of their tremendous humanity that had been given to them with such powerful performances. I have all the reasons why Jane Fonda did not want her Vietnamese deeds but personal feelings apart is wonderful in this role. Robert DeNiro is excellent as a man whose intelligence and goodness begin to sink him into a world that is indifferent to his abilities. This is the first thing I've seen DeNiro using tenderness rather than toughness to sell the character and I really like it. This movie was a big surprise when I first saw them and I'm looking forward to seeing it again.
