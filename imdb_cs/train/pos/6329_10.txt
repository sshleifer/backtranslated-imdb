Cult film for every true Russian intellectual. Everything is brilliant, especially it works: it's out of praise. The film as a book is full of symbols: my favorite is the brightest symbol of Razrukha (the colloquial Russian word for "devastation," often refers to the period of chaos of life after the war in 1918-20) - wide-opened the dirty door in the rough wall that is in the snowy wind and the black hole behind the door behind him. Now the movie is launched on a DVD with a fully restored picture and 5.1 sound, there are well translated English subtitles, although some obscene words of Sharikova have been replaced by milder versions in translation. I do not know that the DVD is available abroad, but if you find it immediately, it's really good watching. And finally: about 50% of Russians today, mostly youth, can be labeled as Sharikov. It is a post-Soviet effect: it seems that Soviet people are totally unprepared for the information attack of Western civilization, television producers and film makers have made the entertainment industry and the mass media incredibly aggressive, soulless and thoughtless, the instincts of all the Russians. Even among Internet users, every third uses a dishonest language in forums and chats because it is terribly common in speaking speech.
