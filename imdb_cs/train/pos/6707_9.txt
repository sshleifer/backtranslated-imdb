Sometimes I know it's really terrible ... But the acting is amazing and Melissa Joan Hart is just as cute as a button. I love this show a lot and I'm almost embarrassed that I have a b / c show that I'm really frantic but I feel good. My only problem is that sometimes it can be a relatively low budget - sometimes it changes actors and just enough to deal with it ... Like Sabrina's father two different guys throughout the movie ... I mean they could not say she's a uncle or something? Still, I can not help but love this show. Harvey and Sabrina make a really cute couple and Salem is totally cheerful. I certainly recommend it if you are looking for some light and fun entertainment ... My favorite episode is "Pancake Madness" ... HILARIOUS episode. The best season is probably 3 ... I'm not really a fan of some of the seven seasonal twists ... Once you get to college, Morgan joins the group and her dialogue is painful and very wrong ... Plus she's ugly, so the jokes about how she survives her good looks were lost to me ... But I think it was set to have a really good eighth season and it was really sad to see that one of my favorite concerts was canceled!
