In addition to the dazzling scene, this refreshing fairytale fantasy has a funny and gorgeous thread of a teen cynical joke that boasts its way into the audience, as well as a sound accompanying film that powerfully drives this fabulous epic. In addition to one of Robert DeNiro's scenes, which is not smooth and looks synchronized with the rest of the movie, this beautiful romantic fairy tail has a great sense of conversation, and a strong spell and delicate balance between serious adventure scenes and lighter spiritual humor are well done. In the updated tradition of PRINCESS BRIDE, this present presentation of magic and love is captivating. Eight of the ten stars.
