Greetings again from the darkness. A look into the mind and the motivation of a beautiful artist. How strange is that most of us see someone who MUST work ... regardless of the circumstances, otherwise the reason for his life is interrupted. See that Goldsworthy's statues come alive and see that his reaction to each of them is extremely voyeuristic. This artist creates because he must - not for money or glory. It's his life force. When you see his failure, it seems that the energy radiates from his body like a hot air balloon. It is not a fear from the beginning again, it is that it takes its energy out of its work. Watching him create just to take over nature and remind him of his work is somewhat painful, yet amazing. He discusses the flow and time in minimal dialogue, and there seems to be little doubt that the artist and the country are one in the same. When he says he needs a country, but he does not need it ... I want to be different. The only complaint is that the music score seems to slow down the pace that is at best relaxed.
