The "last wave" is much more than the sum of its parts. It's not just a catastrophic film, not just a survey of Australian indigenous spirituality, and certainly more than a simple court drama. Writer / director Peter Weir can put these elements to the next level to create a really effective film that was really effective and thoughtful, with the same exciting atmosphere he gave two years ago Picnic At Hanging Rock. When lawyer David Burton (Chamberlain) is summoned to defend Chris Lee (Gulpilil) because of the death of an indigenous origin for whom he or she may or may not be directly responsible, he finds that he is just trying to fight the truth from Lee but gives meaning to what he hears it will come. Just as the indigenous belief that there are two worlds - everyday and Dreamtime, the truth exists on two completely different levels, the consequences being much more catastrophic than Burton could ever have imagined. <br /> <br /> "Picnic On Hanging Rock" is better to realize is because of its permanent secrets. We are guided the same way, but forced to find answers for ourselves. In The Last Wave, we can draw everything together by the end of the movie. However, with all the information, we have to choose how much of this we want to believe, because the film takes us beyond the limits of our normal reality. <br /> <br /> On the production side, Weir uses a big effect budget, gradually creating a sense of destruction in everything ranging from mild illumination to heavy rain to good sound utilization. Random music is unobtrusive and never attempts to be grandiose. Richard Chamberlain was able to showcase a surprise the spectators no doubt felt when trying to reveal the mystery. David Gulpilil greatly portrays a man trapped between two worlds who wants to do the right thing but is afraid because he already knows the end. All these things combine and you have a perfect example of why David Weir has been known in the cinema for thirty years. Strongly recommended.
