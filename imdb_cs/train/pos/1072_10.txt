I would like to comment on the series as a great effort. The story line, although it required some improvements, was pretty good, especially in season 1. Season 2, however, became a strange show and lost the original DA spell. Season one story line was more interesting, a light side to life on the Jamian Pony, while a concentrated serious conspiracy with Mantico pursued the X series. I was looking forward to the new season, in fact I am still. I hope the guys from FOX and the DA team will realize that a lot of ppl is still waiting for DA to return. Even after two years of his cancellation, DA might be great when he works right, and I think he should be called James Cameron.
