Some films can survive almost exclusively on originality - "Wonderland" is definitely one of these films. The script can throw everything in the course with a fever, but without being incompatible. The speed of this thriller is not chosen to conceal a weak script, but rather reflects a drug-dependent reality. As director James Cox as a very special way to work with his actors. Most characters are constantly on the edge and often because they are rather ugly personalities. Val Kilmer described John Holmes as a cheater, capable of manipulating and controlling. Kilmer did not miss it, but his version of Holmes appears to be able to control the drastically weak-eyed. However, it is a stunning performance. Compared to Kilmer's "Hollywood" roles like "The Saint," it seems to be much more at home in bold Indian flicks. Actors are the main force that holds all together. There are various small performances - especially women. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow have only a limited time on the screen next to their male counterparts, but they are all fantastic. In addition to Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott add a strange stunning energy to their roles. Originally, I postponed watching the "Wonderland" because I supposed it was a pornography movie in the strictest sense. Yes, the story revolves around John Holmes, but literally has nothing to do with his professional career. In essence, this film is a mystery of the murder and as such - it's great. <br /> <br /> RATING: 7.5 out of 10
