Weapons shoot, buildings explode, cars collapse, and it's just the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> This action movie featuring a silly ex-CIA mercenary who does not seem to die no matter how many times he shot him (hence the title) is quite decent. <br /> <br /> Hard and jagged Gary Busey, usually occupied as a villain in such rapid movements, has his usual crazy spell, but he's a little duller: after all he carries the whole show. This does not mean that there are not many amazing supporting roles including William Smith, Luke Askew, Mills Watson, R.G. Armstrong, Henry Silva, Lincoln Kirkpatrick, Thalmus Rasulal and several other "forgotten" actors. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of smaller action sequences that can keep the whole story: Busey has to release a group of "abducted" US military elites and return the high-tech "supertank" (a normal tank with the addition of cheese - put in the top) back to states. <br /> <br /> But America deserves this machine to kill more than boys? This question is, of course, the same as in any CIA film ... but without getting a report.
