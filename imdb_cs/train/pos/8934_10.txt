Two things chase you intruder: Who is an intruder and is it a movie or a dream that you watch? The end is so shocking that for a moment you are losing the answer to any of these questions. The intruder appears as different characters, different men in different circumstances who do not belong to the scene, so they are excluded from it, kindly or brutally but often without emotional engagement. The main character, Louis, is a contemplative person. He has rough ways, some bad work, and no heart. He needs one and goes after him. He has a heart transplanted and then decides to start a new life. Can this man succeed in his search for redemption? Such a guy could tear his neck off his hat. You know, but Claire Denis does not force you to judge him. Sometimes there is a young Russian woman - a beautiful girl who seems to be living somewhere between heaven and earth - who judges her. He may even punish him. But not Denis. There is a character played by Beatrice Dalle who does not need any work with him: do not touch me, he says. But Denis lets this man alone, filming him in his self-absorbed search. I do not know if what is filming is heart or mind, but that's not the traditional foundation of the plot. Whatever she is filming, you will eventually get it. You know who is a "intruder", you know why, more or less, and some scenes are coming back to mind with full meaning. But was it a movie or a dream?
