This movie should be classical. This is not perfect, of course. The motion that is perfect for the scene is slow in the film as a turtle with arthritic knees. Jean Seberg is misdirected to be too sweet and too gentle. She shows a lot of acting talent, skills and crafts to play smart, passionate and sure Joan, but unfortunately the director lacked the point of the character. George Bernard Shaw is my favorite playwright. In no other game is his dialogue sharp or the line more musical. However, processing this film requires you to look at him as a lawyer. This movie is a case and the viewer is a judge. This way you can enjoy this picture. 7/10.
