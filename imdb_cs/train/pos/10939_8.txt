Five Deadly Venoms is a great kung fu action packed in whodunit secrets. There are all the usual kung-fu stories: great choreography, terrible dubbing, various "fighting styles" and a wide range of vastly exaggerated, often raw human emotions. However, the plot is better than average. It's interesting and captivates your attention across the scene without fighting. Sometimes he is even able to fire an audience, for example, when X character gets terrible injustice. Another thing I love about the five deadly poisons is the beautiful simplicity of moral and film themes. Approximately everyone gets what's coming. Smart, greedy and corrupts lose. Thieves who are consumed by selfish greed are eventually destroyed by their own betrayal and skirmish. Good guys use team work, planning, and integrity to overcome chances and get to the top. <br /> <br /> Poison Clan Rocks!
