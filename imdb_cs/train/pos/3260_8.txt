People call it a comedy, but when I just watched it, I laughed only once. I think the problem is that I first saw her when I was 14 years old and I was not old enough to understand that it was not taken seriously. There were quite a few scenes to be fun, but I liked the characters to laugh. <br /> <br /> I suggest watching this movie the next time you fall in love and try to take it seriously. I think you'll find that despite some stupid mistakes, it's one of the most moving love stories you've ever seen.
