well I said it all in summary, I just love film and cast ... I would give every Oscar player ... great, great movie ... I'm 25 years old and I watched him 4 times different times and I always thought that i will not cry and i always do, about 2 or 3 times ...;) meryl s was totally great, jeremy iron also ... just brilliant ... wanna get the movie got another awards ... i really do not know someone who watched him and did not love it ... also glenn near was fantastic. .. the story was beautiful and sad at the same time ... I loved the fact that despite everything that is clear and esteban they love each other so much and how the blanca approaches the parents ...
