First of all, this is an overview of two discs that merged with the DVD rental "Wonderland". The two films included in the rental, "Wonderland" and the documentary Johnny Wadd completely destroyed the myth created by "Boogie Nights". The myth consisted of the fact that figures dealing with adult films were far more than slimes that would do something for the money, basically denying that they were anything but repulsive self-sacrifices. This is amazingly similar to what the book "Wiseguy" and the film "Goodfellas" made to "The Godfather" fable and most of the rest of the gangster romanticism tradition. Now that I was most irritated to watch these movies and the likelihood that someone who saw and liked "Boogie Nights," is how foolish and mental supposedly educated and sophisticated people can be. "Dirk Diggler" in "Boogie Nights" is undoubtedly John Holmes, who, unlike "Dirk Diggler", had no redemption. Holmes was a criminal sociopath who abused someone close to him, was utterly consumed by his pursuit of self-satisfaction and was undoubtedly a key participant in the brutal murders at Wonderland Avenue in Los Angeles in 1981. The film revealed the great that "Boogie Nights" was and strengthens the description Lindy Lovelace about the cruel and poor business that is known as the adult entertainment industry. This should require viewing, both features on the DVD "Wonderland", for anyone who has some positive opinions about the story in the movie "Boogie Nights".
