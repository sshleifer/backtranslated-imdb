Once in a lifetime it means that one capuchin, always a capuchin, and no one will get out of the "Life" for free. They sell drugs in New York, and they are scamming because they do not do it in a legitimate world, perhaps because they have a criminal record or a drug habit or because they are just lazy. This simple story, with some twists and turns on most of the scuppy characters, can compel audience compassion for their major players because of their loyalty and sympathy to each other. The film is written, produced and directed by Laurence Fishburne, who also plays as a 20/20 Mike (all violins have nicknames), and is based on his "Riff Raff" play. It feels like a game from start to finish, especially in the longest scene where the three main players have decided who can be trusted. Often, the dialogue is very fast, much faster than on the stage, and I think it's the biggest bug in the movie. The movies feature street poems, a sort of jambic pentamed rape, a violent and evocative world that tells the story. Poetry is difficult to reject those men who are murdering, cheating and betraying each other as inappropriate to our attention or under our contempt. The worrying thing about this film is that its realism shows us not only how these people live, but how they suffer for the same reasons as we all. One is too stupid, another drug addict and the last one suffers conscience as spectators wonder or even laugh, behind the irony of the bush who ask him to hang in the gallows to tell them jokes in the midst of his extinction.
