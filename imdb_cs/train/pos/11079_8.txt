I always enjoy movies that think about you and you are not listening to just the answers to your audience. The "Revolver" is one of these films, and although many reviewers have said it's hard to watch it, a bit of concentration and open mind I got it. First. It's true that it's not comparable to other stupid things like "Arranged Suspects" or "Memento," but in itself it's an intelligent and thought-provoking movie. <br /> <br /> Another thing I really liked about this movie is how damn beautiful it is. Every scene, it seems that every angle of the camera has been for ages. When you see it, you'll know what I mean. <br /> <br /> So at the end ... watch it with an open mind and you can enjoy it. If not, no, no one ever said that "Revolver" is for everyone. And that's my 2 cents.
