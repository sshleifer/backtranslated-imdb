I like to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes of raptors. I like predators because they are scary. My favorite places are where the raptor looks behind the pillar, because it reminds me of the scene from Friday's 13th film with the girl who banana her. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy watching this movie because computer graphics look a little fake but it's okay because once you get into the movie you hardly notice what's going on and I think it's good the end, even though I did not understand what was happening on my first couple of visions, I made it over time, and that's an important part. The second important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you see it for the first time. <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE BEST FILM.
