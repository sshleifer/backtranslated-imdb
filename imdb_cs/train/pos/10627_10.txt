So what does a real independent movie mean? Nowadays, when the latest Hollywood mainstream flick is discovering bold and sharp, I'm sorry to say that what the public tends to perceive as an independent film is usually nothing but a smart marketing trick. <Br /> <br /> Therefore, we should be glad that there are movies like "Hate per Minute". Through the film, this film tells us that it is in conflict with his own template (indie horror film). To hate or hate it, "Hatred" is not afraid of what it is, and in watching this movie, you get a real feeling that Kallio (the director) was not just making this film spitting fake blood all over the place, to tell stories. Good. You can find this movie in a horror film in your video rental shop, but do not be fooled, this story is also about love, about good people who pushed over the edge, and that huge light at the end of the tunnel. <br /> <br /> If you expect a sad or rival Evil Dead, stay out of this movie. But if you dig the finer points of the horror / tension genre, check this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes. Bruce Campbell produced this movie, and I'm sure he's proud to tell somebody it's not "Evil Dead". Bruce never tried to doubt his "popetic" image, and it was obvious that he did not engage in "Hate," so that they could do it. My advice to all the dead ites furiously devouring everything Mr. Campbell has done is to control this film as well and see what Mr. Kallio and Mr. Campbell are trying to show. <br /> <br /> The acting is good, although nothing about this movie is an oscar caliber (maybe deliberately), it is good to see sympathetic performances in horror film. So often, actors in films like these are not even apparently trying to "hate", it seemed that all the participants with THIER charecters very seriously, never resort to the typical horror film campiness. <br /> <br /> Technically, "Hate" is about as competent as an indie movie gets. Editing is fast, cinematography is good given that budget and "hate" keep fast, without any bog-down points or bad anti-peaks. <br /> <br /> Overall, Hate can not have the glossy look of all the fake indies that have become millions of dollars, but I personally have no problem with it. It's a movie from people who genuinely care about the medium. The people who got into it broke their pockets, pulled out their poles and shuddered, gently welcoming the wind and making a damn good movie. Check this out.
