After reading some relatively negative views of this film, I was not sure if I should make some money to rent it. But it was a pleasant surprise. I did not see the original movie, but if it's better than this, I'll be in the sky. Tom Cruise gives strong performance as a seemingly unstable David, convincing me that he is more than a smile on his feet (only for a third time in his career - another example was Magnolia and born on July 4). Penelope Cruz is slightly light but fulfills the requirements for her role as well as Diaz. The only disappointment is the slightly inconspicuous Kurt Russell. In the film, however, it is not the acting that really works - its filmmaking. Cameron Crowe excels as a director and provides a welcome change of pace from his usual schtick. The growing madness of the movie is perfectly done by Crowe (the short sequence where Cruise passes through an empty time square is incredibly effective). The soundtrack (the characteristic feature of Crowe) is also magnificent. <br /> <br /> You will be shocked and questioned as a viewer. The conspiracy seems to be somewhat contrived, but the problems that are explored behind it are endlessly debatable. The film is not perfect, but its welcome change for Cruise and Crowe, and for those who have brought up a hollywood diet, should be a revelation.
