"Silverlake Life" is a documentary and was clear and straightforward. In fact, it was more like a home movie, and if you want dramatic lighting, look at something else. And that's not a tearjerker. But I think it is positive. It shows two men who love each other and how they are affected by AIDS, they affect the quality of their everyday lives. It's hard for me to say whether it was a good movie or not because it was so seductive that I had to look for other ways to answer. It's an admirable movie, in fact one of the most admirable, honest papers I've ever seen. These two men have incredible integrity because their lives are limited to the most basic parts. It seems that the production of hollow wood for AIDS seems hip and heartless. These men shot this movie for themselves, which is one of the best reasons to create something. The scene where Tom sings "You're My Sunshine" to Mark and tells him that goodbye is a real thing.
