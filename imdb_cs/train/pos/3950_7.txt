He finally got to this classic TV movie on an unofficial disc recorded from the old VHS, it's a classic piece of horror. Still a pity that this neglected corner of horror when it comes to the official release on DVD and VHS ... a television horror movie. Recommended for all TV movie fans of the 1970s, just like the terror trilogy. Interested people should get a book on the subject David Deal - Television Fright films of the 1970s. Send me an email with the opportunity to see ..... its wonderful to see it again. It has problems like many television films that must be rather inventive in the dept effect and even for 70 minutes it may seem to stretch, perhaps we are all accustomed to more modern editing but still great things and much better than many theatrical horrors .
