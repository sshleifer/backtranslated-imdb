Eve (Hedy Lamarro) just married an older man, and in her honeymoon she realized her husband did not want her. Her disappointment in marriage and renunciation of love leads to Eve returning to her father's home on the farm and leaving her husband. One afternoon, bathing in a lake, the horse escapes her clothes and the young laborer gets them and returns Eve. They love each other and become lovers. Later her husband misses her and tries Eva back home. Eve rejects and wealth trio leads the same place and ends the tragic affair. I just watched "Extase" for the first time and my first comment is relative to the terrible quality of VHS released in Brazil by Brazilian distributor Video Network: the film has only 75 minutes of running and it seems to have been used by various film reels. Some parts are completely damaged and other parts are very damaged. Therefore, the beauty of images in the Brazilian viewer is unattainable if it is possible to find this precious VHS for rent or for sale. The film is practically silent, the story is very dated and has only a few lines. As a result, characters are poorly developed. But this film is also very daring, with the exposition of Hedy Lamarr beautiful breasts and naked body fat for current standards of beauty. Another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphorical use of flowers, symbolizing the relationship between Eve and her mistress. The way the director performs scenes in order to prove the needs of Eve and his liberation is very clear. The unmatched end is also very unusual for the 1933 movie. I like this movie but I hope one day will be able to see the 87-minute restored version. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Ã‰xtase" ("Ecstasy")
