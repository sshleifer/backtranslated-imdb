It was such an experience when this show was because it was such a fresh, innovative and original show. That makes every show I've ever seen just look boring. The moment I was broadcasting the first episode, I was enchanted and I joined all the characters so easily (which is not usually the case because I always hate a few characters). It's a shame that this show will not have a third season, because it must be one of the best performances I've ever seen, and it does not in any way outweigh my feelings. Nothing can ever replace Pushing Daisies, because what ABC is likely to find replacing this show? This is perhaps the best show on TV. <br /> <br /> I came for Kristin Chenoweth and I stayed because I fell in love with the whole show.
