I really enjoyed this movie. All aspects of the film were the most important, including the most important, scenario and acting for me. This is certainly one of the most powerful roles of Richard Widmar. His performance is absolutely convincing. Just wondering how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum could handle this role. This is my first exposition of the work of Jean Peter, which I remember. It was so impressive that I would definitely look for her next job. Thelma Ritter, in an enemy role, deserved an Oscar nomination she received as an informant. This movie works at all levels. Black and white photographs are perfectly suited, and the story snaps the viewer right from the start. Widmark and Peters have great chemistry in their difficult romance. We strongly recommend 9/10.
