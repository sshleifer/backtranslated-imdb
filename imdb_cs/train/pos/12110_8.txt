For those of you who think the anime is just about the giant reptiles that rape the pupil, think again. There is a completely different side to Japanese animation. Yakitate! Japan is one of them. It's a sweet story of a young boy with a gift to taste the bread. His universe is about creating Japanese bread that can coincide with the famous European breads. The show is as crazy as they come, and I'm sure the non-Japanese viewers will miss a lot of jokes. But it's very nice to watch for the complete innocent atmosphere of the show. <br /> <br /> In the world of Yakita! it's not unusual for people to look as if they just had an orgasm after a meal of bread. Bread is a hallucination and can give the consumer a wide range of super performances, from time to bathing like a fish. This strange aspect makes him one of the least predictable and entertaining shows I watched in a while.
