For anyone to play video game games, someone here noticed that GTA: Vice City Mansion inside the game and some other things including the movie weapons that are associated with this movie and this movie inspired the Rockstar Games to copy some things from this movie and by the way it's one of the best 80 movies I recommend it for everyone who has not seen it yet 10/10 no questions
