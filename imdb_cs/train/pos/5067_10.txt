Here at IMDb.com I read that Gray Owl is the best character Pierce Brosnan ever played. I do not know if he has a better or worse role, I'm not his fan, but this was really exceptional. The second thing - the impressive hand of the film director. I give my respect. The path, the beauty and the spirit of the wilderness have been illustrated truly exclusive, I have never been so close to anything in any movie. <br /> <br /> Another thing left behind in my mind in my mind is the film closest to the original book and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> And a little more. I fully respect the original gray owl.
