From blocks allow me to just say that I'm a huge fan of the zombie, so I do not have a statement like the above mentioned slightly. Secondly, let me say that this is an Italian zombie movie and Fulci just 15 minutes before it was handed to Rtu, Night of Terror by Mattei. This is none of the dawn of the dead. <br /> <br /> This is simply one of the most fun zombie movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is terribly terrible. Just look at two scientists trying to find an antibody ("Try to put together these two molecules"). <br /> <br /> Zombies are in all varieties. From dive mixers to machete with maniacs, with birds! <br /> <br /> Gore is abundant. The legs are dirty, the arms are amputated, the stomachs tear. <br /> <br /> The tempo is fast and flies from one zombie attack to the other. <br /> <br /> Then the head is in the fridge. Head in the fridge! One of the greatest horrible moments since Ash got his hand obsessed with Evil Dead 2. You should already know if you are such a person who will like this kind of movie. Get some buddies and some beer and you'll be out for a fun night. Did I mention my head in the refrigerator?!?!?
