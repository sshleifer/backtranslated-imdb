When Sabrina first came to our screens, I was about 12 years old and therefore I spent my teenage years watching a teenage witch who has gotten into all sorts of weird problems. It was always one of my favorite programs, the witty feeling of sixty-two "Bewitched" sitcoms, but this time the character was cooler. I always liked Sabrina because she was smart. She was also friendly and easy to watch. The figures at the beginning were great; Harvey, Jenny, Libby, quizmaster, Salem, and Mr. Poole (my personal interest, the shame that she left so soon), Hilda and Zelda, her aunt started all right, but then they started to irritate. Mr. Kraft, like him, was always a little closer to discovering Sabrina's secrets. What I loved in the first three shows was the original idea, discovering family secrets and learning new spells, but as it happened, it became more predictable. Too many characters came and gone, like Valerie, Dream and Brad, and then decided to do Sabrina at a college that destroyed her. <br /> <br /> Sabrina absorbed herself at college, no magic book, no aunts that lived with her, and Roxie, Miles, and Morgan were annoying. The last series was boring and I just watched what he saw, what happened. It was not that Hilda and Zelda were wrong and Miles was gone. The last episode made me feel a lot better when (SPOILER) when Sabrina ended up with Harvey on her wedding day, Aaron was great! Overall a great program if you forget the poor last two or three series that reminded me of so many teen shows. Magical.
