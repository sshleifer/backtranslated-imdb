Some of the renowned "masterpieces" of Altman now seem sad to me. Maybe it's me. Just like the last reviewer, I even like this "smaller" Altman (recently shown on FMC), though I do not think it is focused on a wide audience. Organizational policy as a "microcosm" for public campaigns. Some of these satirical "docudrama" are now dated, like Dick Cavett, who watched the Tonight Show, but I found most of the dialogue funny and prominent (eg, "You're real, that means you're not a threat to someone.") The story is not "deep," but I liked it. And the performance is fun, especially Cavett (as "myself"), Lauren Bacall as an aging conservative figure, Glenda Jackson (who actually became a member of parliament) as a leftist ideologist (in the opening scene lecturing somebody dressed as a carrot on the Holiness of politics) and Carol Burnett as a briefcase. Everything in the inimitable Altman style, though perhaps not as incomprehensible as usual. But quite inimitable.
