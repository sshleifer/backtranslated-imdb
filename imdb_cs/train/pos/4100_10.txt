"La Bête" by Walerian Borowczyk is based on the short story "Lokis" written by Prosper Merimée. Lucy Broadhurst (Lisabeth Hummel), an American heiress betrothed to a son of impotent awning, arrives at a broken family lock and learns about a mythical beast supposedly going through a nearby forest. It is legendary that the former lady of the house (Sirpa Lane) once dealt with perverse sex with the creature, and Lucy finds herself trying to make an incident. "Animals" is an artistic mix of unreal horror, explicit torment and porn. There is implied bestiality, assault and reversal in the priesthood, a lot of false ejaculates blurred on extinct breasts, masturbation with roses, and the most graphic of all the animal of the same name playing with incredibly large phallus. Still this truly erotic film is beautifully photographed and tasty. The women here are amazingly beautiful and naked most of the time. Overall, "La Bête" is a visual feast. Whether it's from fetishist attention to detail or visual motives pregnant with information, Borowczy's masterpieces should be watched with care and attention. It must be seen for fans of the European cult cinema.
