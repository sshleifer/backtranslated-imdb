At this point he was criticized by critics, but fans loved him, this movie became a classic. Mixing allegedly "surrealistic" shots shot at John Lennon's house, among other things with Marco Bolan & T.Rex's live footage at their best, this film is not only a must for anyone who likes Marc Bolan but gives a fascinating look to the time. <br /> <br /> It was when Marc was talking to Ringo Starr of the Beatles (who drove him) and you could even find a short spot from one Reg Dwight [Elton John to you] bashing in amazing [and never officially released ] version of Tutti Frutti and the rock and roll version of Children of the Revolution. <br /> <br /> There are also wonderful scenes featuring Chelita Secunda [he said he 'made glam rock' using his glitter etc], Mickey Finn and even an actor from Catweazle! The best scene for me is in the garden when Marc leaves the dining table, sits cross-legged in front of the string and bounces acoustic versions of classic like Get On On and Slider. <br /> <br /> High, highly recommended! Five stars [out of five]. <br /> <br /> Rory
