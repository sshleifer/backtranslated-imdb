I saw this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival and it was not a dry eye in the house. It is unbelievable that I see not only what a great person is Darius, but how admirable the rest of the team is, even at such a young age. He was also thinking about how hideous MTV was and how they had an opportunity for positive engagement and inspiration. It tells you whether the youth and their viewers care at all. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful and heart-warming true story ... take your tissue, but it's great to see being.
