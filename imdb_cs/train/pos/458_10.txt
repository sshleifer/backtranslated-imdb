My wife, Kate and I absolutely love the series and we can not wait for another (hopefully it's a sequel!). I would like to know what is called a catchy song and who wrote it, perhaps because I'm "old and gray" and I'm still interested in life :-). If someone has full texts, send them. <br /> <br /> Of course, one of the main reasons why my wife and I liked it was that we are 75 years old and retired, but we are still very active intellectually. It's great to see a show highlighting the contribution to the company that can still be done by older people with special skills and experience. The human affair, which shows the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them, is an important part of the show. <br /> <br /> This series is very fun and very sophisticated, as well as some of our other favorites, "Spooks" and "Hustle".
