I'm so upset that ABC gives up another series that has a chance to be a real winner. This show is so good, the script and the story were great, a real original idea for a show instead of another boring reality show. Casting was magnificent! Not only that characters and actors have just begun, but they are a very talented group of actors. Concept and idea are really new and cool idea for TV shows, many of us share the whole idea of ​​"connection". I really love characters like Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But to be honest, there is no person to this show that I did not like, even those that were only for a few episodes (like Sheri Appleby). The characters and characters are so easy and so talented !! I wish ABC gave this show a better chance and did not interrupt the show in the middle. It has also not been sufficiently promoted. Really unfair! for each! This show showed a great promise. I'll let ABC know for a moment how I feel and will continue to send emails to make this show live. Join me, I know we can do it. She worked for Jerico. (By the way, where is episode 13, I want the last show!). Support this show and send emails to ABC, we can do it !!! This show is worth it!
