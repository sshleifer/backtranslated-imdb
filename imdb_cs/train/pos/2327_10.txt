A 14-year-old girl develops her first serious grief on a seventeen-year-old boy living nearby, and at the same time tries to overcome her feelings of inadequacy compared to her older sister. This is a simple assumption of this beautiful, poetic approach to the age of Robert Mulligan's film. Mulligan is known for having previously conducted the summer of '42 in 1971 and killing Mockingbird in 1962, two giants of the approaching genre. Here she controls newcomers in the lead role: Reese Witherspoon, in her film debut as a 14-year-old girl; Emily Warfield, like an older sister; Jason London, like a court, a 17-year-old boy. Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly good in her film debut and portrays all the emotions that a 14-year-old girl feels in experiencing young love and sorrow, never writing fake notes. Warfield and London are just as well. The film accurately describes the thoughts or feelings of each teenager about love with heart sensitivity without ever surpassing surpluses. Kudos to Jenny Wingfield's autobiographical screenplay; it is one of the few films about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally dishonest or sensational. Music is incredibly simple, emphasizing tone and mood from scene to scene, but it never gets distracting. Beautiful cinematography is made up of the famous horror director Freddie Francis, who was in his seventies when he was shot. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston play the 1957 dead-parent parents, caring, strict and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is also good as a boy's mother. There are feelings to be solved, the lessons to learn, and the truths that we must face in this sweet-welcoming film that packs an emotional touch. To date, it's Robert Mulligan's latest film. This is one of the best films of 1991. **** of 4 stars.
