I hardly remember this show, a little, but I remembered it was great! My eldest brother recently reminded me of the show and I saw that the ad for D.V.D was released. Did the network rise again as she pulled her out of the air to give something else in its place? It should take at least 3 years. Why not? Sometimes I think network leaders think they are the "gods" of the world of entertainment. But they mistakenly estimate and lose from time to time to miss a good location. Let's say they have a lot more flops than "hits". It was one of the poor decisions that should be made in a row. Anyway, I get it for my collection.
