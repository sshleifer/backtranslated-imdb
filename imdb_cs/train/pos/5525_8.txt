A lot of the problem many people have with this movie is that they think the story should be fun (ignoring it is based on a true story) or arguing against a film that celebrates Che (which is not really). This film is very close to John Anderson's definitive bio on Che and gets the story right. Soderburgh does a great job of setting the mood to break the debacle, which was a Cheyan Bolivian adventure. You really feel that the whole shyness and confusion of the Bolivian peasant succeeded in the revolutionary thoughts of Che or the difficulties his men faced with hunger and terrain. I'm sorry I paid attention to the movie fan, but that's what happened. So they're not going to expect Rambo to shoot this movie, it's a real story!
