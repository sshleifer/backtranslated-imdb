Rene Clair's pioneering musical. To see where the songs were first played, it's a place. This is the story of a starving young artist who found himself winning the lottery just as his creditors called. Unfortunately, his ticket is in his coat that is in his girlfriend's apartment and he got to the attacker who then ... oh, but that would say it. This is a light and foamy story where most dialogues are sung (most people think this did not happen until Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber). It's such a movie that no longer does, and rarely did it when they did. His sound is a film from the beginning that plays as a movie five or six years later. Clair moves the camera in such a way that Busby Berkeley does not do so (although it is clear that the comparison of two filmmakers is unfair because Berkeley was basically a border dancer and Clair moved the camera through the "real world"). It's an amazing little movie. and his lovely film that just smiles at you. It's just a fluffy piece of fun. I'm sorry I can not say more. It's just a nice little movie and that's all you need to know.
