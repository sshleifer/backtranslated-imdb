Made only ten years after real events and built in Bunker under the Reichstag, the Pabst movie is completely grasped. He uses the sulfur of death, waiting for the perpetrators of the world war. They have not seen it in more than three decades, but remain strong in their visual and emotional memory. It looks like the characters are waiting to be strengthened in their cave. Different dialogue between two generals: "God exists?" "If he did, we would not." It is a shame that it is not easier to make for an exhibition or purchase, because it would be interesting to view and compare this documentary with Traudl Junge, "Im Toten Winkel" and "Downfall" with Bruno Ganz.
