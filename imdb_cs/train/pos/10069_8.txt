This film is worth seeing the visual beauty and movement itself, but also an interesting cultural background of alienation. Women and artists (both assembled in the supportive role of the transvestite opera star) are both condemned to be pushed into sublime roles in China. This makes an unlikely connection between an old street artist and a young girl even stronger than triumph over indigenous culture. The only problem I had with this movie was the tendency of soundtrack, which increased with emotion, which is unnecessary performances of actors. <br /> <br /> A welcome alternative to unsuitable summer action movies.
