Cinderella is one of Disney's biggest movies, one of those films I think you appreciate what the older you get. Disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic fairy tale. I find the film the biggest of my films at the time of its release. The characters have become more dimensional than the earlier films, giving more depth to make the characters more appreciated. Cinderella itself is, in my opinion, one of the greatest characters Disney has ever created. With her kindness and a dash of dry humor she is very kind; but it's the inspiration it provides, which makes it unforgettable. Like many people is an endless dreamer and she keeps her dreams, she never surrenders. Even in the most unfavorable situations, her dreams persist and leave no one to turn her away. Her example should serve as an inspiration for all and encouragement so that your dreams never get lost.
