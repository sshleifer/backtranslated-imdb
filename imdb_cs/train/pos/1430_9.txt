He played it in our theater in Amsterdam, and the movie we wanted to see was sold out, so we went to it without knowing him otherwise than a documentary about the planet. We were very happy with our misfortune because it was a very powerful film about life and the delicate balance we all shared with other people in the Earth. This movie has some of the most beautiful pictures I've ever seen in the movie, and took my places from the desert into the oceans to rain forests and show things I've never seen in a movie, television or book! "Earth" is a movie that every student should see before becoming fools. I will encourage my niece to see this movie because it will be the legacy of the planet we will leave. This is also a movie that can be seen on a theater screen or on a very large television because the photo is so strong and exotic.
