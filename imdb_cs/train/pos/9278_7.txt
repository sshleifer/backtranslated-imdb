In The White Balloon and Crimson Gold, which I saw in two other films by Jafar Panahi, the director reveals a surprising amount of depth for subjects that seemed to be small on the surface. In the offside, Panahi's gratitude to the Iranian women who stood for their rights, I do not think he is so successful. Not that what she says is not important, of course (and it's bad that, like any other Panahi movie, the Iranians do not see it). But after a while, the film feels like a tad flat and feels long even in 90 minutes. I'm not saying I did not like it. The actors are all fantastic and the celebration at the end of the film is infectious. But, in my opinion, this is not an important job.
