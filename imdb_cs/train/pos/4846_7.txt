It's a classic British comedy-thriller I always wanted to try, but no opportunity was created for it yet. It is based on a popular scene that has already been shot several times (most in 1931 by the same director, but unfortunately this version probably did not survive in its entirety!); for the remake that was the subject of the review, the plot was updated to the war situation at that time. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I mainly met British comedians soon through Will Hay films: given the similar land of legendary hauntings, smuggling and enemy agents, it's a lot in this vein (it was actually written by Hay's regular writing team Marriott Edgar, Val Guest and Orton JOC); the jammed travel element was then a well-established pattern. This time, this star is Arthur Askey (instigated by Richard Murdoch) - none of the films I've ever watched - who is as unlikely as a hero like Hay himself and whose personality turns out to be just as potentially irritating ... but one will soon warm up and Askey will surely come up with a number of humorous lines and entertaining business affairs to justify the fact that the main character of the game (and the movie version of 1931) was split into two, and Murdoch was acting as a star is a direct partner. <br /> <br /> The unparalleled unified setting (movie events predominantly during one stormy night) provides some amazing atmosphere; The last half-hour - with the sudden appearance of a mysterious pair (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers) and finally the arrival of the car itself - is especially grasped and well-treated. Kathleen Harrison is also a stereotypically frightened spinster, with a parrot as a permanent companion, who is driven by all the excitement to get the first drink.
