First, tell me I do not like the fact that Rock has got a title that's so gay. I also feel that Regal should have his European title back, Jeff Hardy is a poor champion. Rob Van Dam had an Intercontinental title for Brock to win. I'm delighted that Storm and Christian are champs tags, the best match was according to Booker T and Big Show in my opinion.
