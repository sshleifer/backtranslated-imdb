When browsing the Internet for the previous sales price, I came across these comments. Why are they all so serious? It's just a movie, and it's not pornographic. I got this short film from my parents thirty years ago and I was always very pleased with it. I showed it to many of my friends and they all loved it too. I feel privileged to own this original black-and-white silent Shirley film in 1932 before it became popular or famous. After reading other comments, I agree that the film is "peculiar". Big deal! I just wish it was longer. It seems I have to be the only person who owns one of these originals at least for sale so I wonder how much is worth it?
