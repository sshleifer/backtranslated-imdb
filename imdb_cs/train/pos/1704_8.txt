"I'm here to get out of this sort of thing!" The sheriff of a small town laughs. <br /> <br /> "Is it a lot going on in Chicago?" His representative asks. Well, no, not really. The plot is that a group of Martians mistaken Halloween Rebroadcast from Orson Welles' world war as a description of the real invasion of Mars, and conclude that they must get to the action! What follows is a lot of misfortune involving the unfortunate attempts of Mark to conquer the city of "Big Bean, IL". They all conclude that they are really good costumes, except for the sheriff's girl and her friend, a child in a duck suit. Martians themselves are comic and you have the impression that they are not a threat to anyone other than themselves quite early. It's a fun family movie.
