Joseph L. Mankiewicz does not remember most of today as one of the best directors in Hollywood history, but this film proves he is. Already successful by doing sophisticated American dramas such as a letter to three wives and all about Eve as well as a successful adaptation to Shakespeare's life in Julius Caesar, Mankiewicz makes the amazing work that this Broadway hit film game and does in style. Marlon Brando is perfect as Sky Masterson, although he can not sing well. He is the only actor to tear him out in complete coldness and clarity. Frank Sinatra is a great singer as he expected and does a good job like Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons is also very good as Sarah Brown and her scenes with Brando sizzle with great chemistry. All supporting actors play their part, especially Sheldon Leonard as Harry's horse, very fun. Still, Mankiewicz should receive the greatest prize for bringing a fine musical instrument on his own screen so that in many scenarios he felt authentic but still a story in his own world. Overall, boys and dolls are a great musical and they work at many levels they would not normally have.
