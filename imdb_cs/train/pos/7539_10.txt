I really enjoyed this movie. like most people who watched her. I was not sure I got there. Whoopi Goldberg is a very fun comedian and she has done a lot of funny movies; ie a sister act. <br /> <br /> However, it was not really a comedy. it's a drama with comedic moments. so if you're looking for a thrill of laughter, keep searching. This film is about a black family moving from a nice neighborhood in the city to the upper middle class. I'd say more, but he thinks it would spoil the movie. this film does not only relate to racial relations between white and black, but also to relationships with black communities. I think it's worth a chance. if you really do not care about another movie about racial relationships, then this movie is not for you
