After watching the movie, I watched the trailer on DVD and I think anyone who saw it before watching the movie would be very surprised and perhaps disappointed. It made a lot of the fact that the film was "director of Cuba" and made it look like a horror film, when in fact it's an absurd comedy (IMDB's spelling does not seem to think that the Absurdist is a word, but it is) reminding Rosencrantz and Guildernstern are dead. I love the way the story slowly develops slowly, then gradually escalates. I also look forward to the fact that what is happening in the movie is not explained. This and the fact that the story plays mainly in one set is the only respect in which this film is similar to the Cube. I recommend it.
