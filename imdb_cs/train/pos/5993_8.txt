The Cure uses the voice to create an intense mood. Although the VO bills for all lines of the film it incredibly does not remove from the visual story. Using multiple movie supplies adds a lot of text to the story. The choice of a combination of black and white and color has improved a lot in order to move in time. The end will bring you a jump, even if you are able to predict the outcome. I was very excited about the excitement of the film's mood. Close up for the love scene are beautiful and reflect a tasteful eye. The bit is quite short, but it is good for it. Narrow adjustment really helps to show what a short film can do. It's worth watching more than once!
