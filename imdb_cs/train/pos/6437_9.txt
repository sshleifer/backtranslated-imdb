The famous conductor decides after a heart attack to return to the village where he was born to live a peaceful life. There comes the Dutch with the local choir choir, which will change his life. I had no expectations when I saw this movie yesterday for the first time; I like watching foreign movies that are not English, and I have seen some Swedish movies in my life, but this was the best one for the time being. <br /> <br /> Where to start? In my opinion, this film is a jewel through many things, one of which is excellent acting. Michael Nyqvist is perfect as a thoughtful, almost timid and devoted conductor, Daniel Daréus. Beautiful Frida Hallgren is enchanting with her nice smile and a fine actress. The members of the choir are all well-developed, interesting characters with their own story each. This film tells a story, a beautiful story about music, love, pain, memories, death, about a man who devoted his life to music and tried to create a peaceful existence in the village where he was born and tried to calm himself with the past and his life until then. Kay Pollack shows us that the Swedes are excellent filmmakers. Come look at Só som i himmelen, it's a movie that thinks about life and love, and that's also a bit calming.
