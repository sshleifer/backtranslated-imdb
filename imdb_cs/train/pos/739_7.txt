I have been a fan of Jodie Foster since we were both kids from her Disney years. I liked my scary movies in movies like Candleshoe. <br /> <br /> "Fears" have been so great a diversion from all this. Where other young actors of this era turned to sexual ("Little Darlings", someone?), Jodie went for a depressing and tragic story of teenagers attracted to her extinction with a powerful flavor of temptation and habit. It was not Disney. It was not Porky. This was not "Halloweed". It was a dark and powerful story about the destruction of young lives. Unfortunately, this is a story that still plays daily across the country, this movie can be played (with the current soundtrack) and is still relevant. It's not the best movie, in some parts it's tired, not all the performances are especially excellent. But Jodie Foster continued to show off her chopsticks as a real adult actor (the trend began when she was very young at Taxi Driver). <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 Boys
