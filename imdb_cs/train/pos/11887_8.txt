It is estimated that between the year 2000 and 2020, 68 million people will die prematurely due to AIDS. The proposed toll is the largest in Sub-Saharan Africa, where an additional 55 million deaths can be expected. The grim statistics are personal stories that we rarely hear. Christophe Honor√© describes one of the most moving films "Close to Leo," which was created for French television as part of a series that addresses the issues faced by young people. Although fictitious, it is a situation that is unfortunately too common - the effect of HIV diagnosis on a loving family. When twenty-two-year-old Leo (Pierre Mignard) tells his parents and two teenage brothers Tristan (Rodolphe Pauley) and Pierrot (Jeremie Lippmann) that he has AIDS, the family is devastated. From fear of their youth, they have decided to reject information from their youngest brother, 12-year-old Marcel (Yannis Lespert), but he hears the conversation and starts to move and behave stupidly. When Leo went to Paris for treatment, Marcel would marry him, but the young boy will meet Le and ask him to know the truth. Leo tells him he's sick and Marcel is sad, but he accepts. When Marcel brings to meet some of his former gay friends, the tensions between them spring up to the surface, making the podium an inconspicuous conclusion. <br /> <br /> Although I felt uncomfortable with scenes in bed with physical contact between the brothers, I feel the honesty of Middle Leo and the brilliant performance of Lespert and Mignard more than the inclination of weight in his favor. Seeing events unfolds from the perspective of a young boy giving the movie authenticity that reminds me of Quebecois's Leolo film and Truffaut's 400 Blows. Unlike some American movies that dance around AIDS, near Leo tells the hard truth but does it in a way that is gentle and gorgeously real.
