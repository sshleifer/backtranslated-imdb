This is by far my favorite film of all time. This is mainly because they are not afraid to dive into very politically incorrect topics (such as spanking and female submissiveness) that other major films are too reluctant to touch. Nothing seems to be unlimited in this movie, as the director freely develops the story without any worries that might affect the viewer. However, I do not think that anything happened here purely because of the shock value or intentionally insulting someone. Sean Young turns into an excellent and courageous performance. Most established mainstream actresses would not get this role, or some major script changes would have been anticipated before they were accepted. Other cast members do a great job. <br /> <br /> Have you noticed that this movie did not appear on paid cable television, as it required a short run after the year he got into the theaters? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it just does not fit today's political atmosphere. It seems totally ironic that some premium channels now include softcore porn (that's near hardcore porn porn), but it will not have a mainstream movie such as Love Crimes. It is sad that although this film is only 11 years old, it is probably not possible today. <br /> <br />
