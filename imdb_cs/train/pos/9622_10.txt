I just watched this movie on Showtime. Quite a coincidence. If I did not have only 6 hours of sleep in the last two days, I would not get home from work. If I did not come home from work before, I would not see such a movie. I would not know what I missed, but I would miss a lot. This is the movie. It almost plays the Kevin Bacon effect. This and causality (hence my enthusiasm). Sometimes some kind is connected in some way. Activity, reaction, interaction, inactivity. This movie is just great. I'll have to find a copy I buy.
