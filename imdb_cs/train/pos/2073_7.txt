In 1958 Clarksberg was a well-known city of fast passages. Many earnings were generated by the Sheriff's Department. Those who tried to overcome the sheriff? Well, she gave the sheriff a chance to drive them out of the Clarksberg curve with his Plymouth cruiser. For example, at the beginning of the movie, a few soldiers trying to get back to the base in time are dragged to death if I remember correctly. One day the foreigner got into town. Perhaps the coldest hot roder in the world. Michael McCord. Even his name is the name of the car, as with the McCord seals. In the eventual final hot rod. Black and white train '34 Ford coupe. The colors of death, evil and hellfire. She gets a sheriff for speed. It checks the land of the country. He is the brother of one of the sheriffs victims. He knows how his brother died. Clarksberg's government is in favor of the sheriff. There is only one way for justice to serve to kill his brother and fix things so that "it never happens - no one will ever happen": to retaliate the pursuit and heal the heat-resistant competition to death. It will come out on a curve and practice. The sheriff knows that McCord knows. The race begins ... It's a movie that everyone who has ever tried to handle maneuvering on a particular section of the road can remember.
