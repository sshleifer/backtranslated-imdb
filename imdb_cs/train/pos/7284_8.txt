When I was young, I saw only a few movies. My parents rented all their wisdom. I was very careful about what the film was, and it really did not even have a chance to watch. My brother and sister, of course, got to me, and that made me very angry. So what did I do? Late that night, I grabbed a video recorder! He kicked the TV screen and called the police and reported the vandals. I was, of course, arrested, unable to get my leg off the television before the police arrived. I had only a promise and I talked home. My parents, of course, are setting me up and doing my job to pay off the debt for television and VCR. It has torn me up, the slave job is really upset that she believes me, but I had to do it. He works all over the house. What happened at the end? We have a large screen, a DVD player and a surround sound system for your work. How did I get the money? I easily made my own movies and sold them to Disney! Remember Finding Neno? Well, I wrote the movie and filmed my goldfish in my fish tanks! They rewrote the plot, of course, and did it in CGI because they could not afford to become a real reality like I did! In the end, I've never seen the movie Head that did not die, and the rating I gave her is my life! It does quite well!
