A beautiful girl in London has lost her legs by a millionaire owner of tea plantations and is soon married and lives with him in her villa in British Ceylon. Although originated from Robert Standish's book, this initial arrangement reminds Hitchock's "Rebecca," with the head of Elizabeth Taylor, who encounters an impressive head of staff at the headquarters and (almost immediately) of her own husband, who is still under his deceased but dominant father. Taylor, replacing the last moment of ill Vivien Leigh, looks in a cream-smooth wardrobe in high fashion and her performance is quite strong; However, once Peter Finch's husband begins to drink heavily and bark orders on her, one might think that her devotion is rather masochistic (this ending ends). Still, the film offers a huge amount of soap lovers: romantic drama, a little wandering, interpreting dance, an elephant and a perfectly timed outbreak of cholera! *** z ****
