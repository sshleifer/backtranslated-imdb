The King Mask is a beautifully narrated story that prefers men's family preferences to human preference for love and society. We met in the thirties China during the flood, we meet Wang, an old street artist whose talents are magical and capture the respect of all who testify to him. When the famous opera artist sees and then spins with Wang, he asks Wang to join his band. We learn, however, that Wang's family tradition only allows him to pass his secret to his son. Teaching that Wang is childless is Wang encouraged to find heirs before magic is lost forever. Wang realizes that he has bought an eight-year-old parent to fulfill his inheritance; he would teach his new son, Doggie, the ancient art of silk masks. Soon Wang discovers that Doggie threatens rare and dying arts. Together, Wang and Doggie create volumes and experience a series of emotions that always accompany them. The story is swallowed up. The setting is quiet and easy. Overall, it is a film that wins an international award that can not help but move and inspire.
