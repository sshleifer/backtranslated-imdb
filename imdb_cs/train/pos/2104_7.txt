Who does not know Largo Winch in the French-Belgian-Luxembourg trio (three countries where the French "BD" or "Bandes Dessin√©es" are massively published)? 18 years after the publication of the first comic book, which is an adaptation of the series of novels itself, should be edited on screens. After the first and failed TV show, the real thing begins. <br /> <br /> First and that's what most fans did not get, the goal of this movie is not strictly adapted to a series of comics. Some basic parts, characters and actions of the original are missing. The film itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. As a first-class comedian, I must admit I'm surprised. The actors are good, such is the scenario, although it may seem too fast. That's why I recommend this movie to all those interested in financial / political thrillers, but that is clearly not an alternative to the James Bond or Jason Bourne series, as I could read through the internet.
