Now many would think that they will stay away from this film just for the title. If you do not have a stomach for horror movies, what do you do by reading this review? Anyway, I borrowed a video from my friend and immediately fell in love with this movie. This movie is full of gorgeous gore, plus the usual other ingredients that make b-film add up to the hell of watching experience! If you are a lover of quality experiences, then by all means, check out this great movie!
