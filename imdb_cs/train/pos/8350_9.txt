As with this movie, we follow the unlikely, ever-fitting adventure of two main characters. But while C + J avoids sex for a girl's trip back to childhood, this couple is reflected in their karmality to the point of exploring homoerotism. Most of the sex they get from reluctant partners, and yet, despite the deeply uncomfortable behavior, everyone smiles. Like C + G, through all of this, they remain innocent in the heart, revolt against cow, bourgeois, limiting. As somebody else commented, I would not want to know them, and it is a miracle that their journey brings scenes mostly comedies and very little tragedy (and what is not there that can not be placed at their door) and that's why the reason left me enchanted but sweet taste in the mouth. I dare say that only French can get away with such movies. And that's part of their genius.
