1967 in cold blood may be more akin to the "real thing" (think: do we really want to see the real thing?) But in the color world it was black and white and a lot of people did not even know what it was and there the opportunity to remake it on television. Additionally, if you redo it, you can see some things that are not listed in the original. Truman Capote's "Cold Blood" was the first "novel of facts". Truman's book was not 100% true to the real story. I thought the Canadian site was a good deal for Kansas for television. Look at the elements of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll: Dick's wife, Perry is an aspirin addict, Perry plays a blues guitar.
