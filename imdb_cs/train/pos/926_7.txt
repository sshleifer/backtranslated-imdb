I do not know why some people criticize this show so much. <br /> <br /> It's a great, funny show - it's probably not the right material for the main stream, but it still ... <br /> <br /> Family dynamics are fun and all the same as with most comic performances . Supporter characters are absolutely merry. Drawings of individual episodes and frequent bumps of Siegfried & Roy are just a little above average, but sometimes they are partial parcels or one liner that shakes you on the floor with laughter. <br /> <br /> The demonstration is worth paying for Â£ 8. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10
