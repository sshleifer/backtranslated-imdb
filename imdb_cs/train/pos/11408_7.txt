Etienne Girardot is just an actor - what a person people almost will never know by name. But again, he plays the coroner - one of the only actors in Philo Vance, who played his role more than once. I've seen him for two more days and always loved him because he was so fun and fresh air. This film is also great, because besides Girardot there are many other great actors along the way - Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Walthal, Kent Smith, H.B. Warner and Nat Pendleton. This is a pretty impressive cast and they certainly made the work easier for the head of the man and woman Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce. These great character actors are one of the main reasons why I love these old B-movies. While secrecy itself is seldom so amazing, as smooth writing and playing, the movies are really satisfying. As for this movie, Vance is greatly played by Lowe, but as I said, the mystery itself is just a post-thought - with a silly plot involving hypnosis and suicide. Unfortunately, you can not hypnotize someone who would do something like this - I was training in clinical hypnosis, and if I could do something like the bad one he could do in the movie, I would do it! Turning car dealers and some of my old bosses would be obvious goals! <br /> <br /> Overall, although it is not the best film by Philo Vance, it was very good and it is ugly damage. Lowe played this role only once. In fact, besides William Powell (who played Vance five times), the series has defended the long and long sequence of actors such as Basil Rathbone, Wilfred Hyde-White and Warren William (and many others) playing Vance. This is a similar problem that has also plagued a number of Drummond bulldogs - just too many different actors who play the lead man. It is worthwhile to see and excite - though quite impossible.
