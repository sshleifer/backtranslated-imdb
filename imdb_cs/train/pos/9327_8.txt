I write it after seeing The Perfect Son at the Mardi Gras Film and Lesbian Film Festival in Australia in 2002. When their father dies, two brothers are alive at the funeral, and after they find out the brothers are dying of AIDS, they enter a path that warms the heart of reconciliation. Two scientists are doing a magnificent job that creates the gradual warmth and respect that take place between them as the film progresses. But I have a certain feeling about the movie - while the dying brother is doing badly, it does not look like it. A person with 0 T4 cells would look pretty bad - he was not even employed to make the actor look bad, he was employed. A small animal, but one that makes it a bit less realistic. Despite being a small game, The Perfect Son is a wonderful movie and you should be able to see it. I hope that the DVD will be released in the near future!
