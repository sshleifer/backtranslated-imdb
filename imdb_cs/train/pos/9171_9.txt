I am a lover of Jane Eyre and Purist, and this version contains almost all the important details of the book and the characters are portrayed as I imagined them. Jane Eyre is a complex story of great wealth and can not be delivered in a long format format, so it needs a television miniseries. Timothy Dalton's Rochester is probably the best in history. There was a lot of discussion about how attractive he and his age are. In the book, Jane (the narrator) describes him as "around 35," not young but middle age. I think Timothy Dalton was about 38 when he did, so that's right. We also have Jane's opinion of whether Rochester is handsome. She just met him, and he worries about what she thinks. As an inexperienced and humble girl, I can not imagine she thinks she is handsome. The actor who plays at Rochester has to show us the character of man and it is filled with perfection. I love the relationship between these two people, which is a crucial thing in this story and the humor of their encounters. Other versions have blown it out, but that's right. The 2006 version of Toby Stephens (at the age of 37) is on the BBC1 and is really good, so I decide if it's my favorite when it's done. Looking at this series again, after watching the 2006 version, I decided that this version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark is the best! Charlotte Bronte's dialogue is preserved, and that is necessary for the strength of the story. Modernization just does not work - it's a Victorian story, and the archaic poetic language is the same for the characters. This version has an excellent cast - The Zelar Clark is small and the differences in height between her and Rochester is important; Timothy Dalton has a real presence and is an amazing actor. There are no other scenes that would deviate from the scenario, and the scenario contains all the basic scenes, but leaves unnecessary details to reach the point and grab it. I recommend it to all true fans of Jane Eyre.
