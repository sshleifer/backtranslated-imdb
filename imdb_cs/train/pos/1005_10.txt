Verhoeven's film was total and complete waste. It's a disgusting hack of the director and he should be ashamed of. According to his own appreciation he read two chapters of the book, bored, and decided to do the whole thing from the beginning. Heinlein would never have supported this waste if he was alive to see it. It basically steals the name, mocks the politics of the book (which is a good part of it) and throws it into some T & A, so the average idiot American moviegoer is bored. <br /> <br /> This anime is not perfect, but at least as accurate as I can best say.
