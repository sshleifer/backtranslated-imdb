It's a great movie if it's seen in the right context - it's supposed to be a parody of teen-horror-devil-worship movies (and those of the eighties saw a lot)! I saw the movie when he first came out and immediately liked it. Being a big fan of KISS, it was great to see Gene in the movie. And anything with OZZY as a preacher who hates metal can not be bad! Fastway was also my favorite, so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack. The original VHS (this was a pre-DVD) envelope for Trick Or Treat presented an illustration of Sam's kneeling, playing guitar in a fire ring with a "demon". It was a special order and the price for a copy of VHS at that time (around 1987) was $ 90! I really wanted a movie, but not for that funny price. The 'OZZY-Gene' envelope was only created for $ 5 re-release. The company that released it is likely to find that Gene and OZZY are the only recognizable people in the movie, so it's better to put them on the cover! Just like the original "little shop of horrors" - Jack Nicholson was in it for five minutes, but now they have him on the cover as if he were the star. "Trick Or Treat" and it's surprising how many people think Sammi Curr is a real person! Fastway helped maintain this myth by dedicating his own soundtrack album "Sammi Curr". Overall, it was just a good time, a rock-n-roll movie. You certainly will not take too seriously, but just enjoy!
