It is a pleasure to see such creativity on TV again. This show is poetic, artistic and good fun. Characters relate well and writing is not bad (I think they will improve as they get to the feet). It is definitely worth it. <br /> <br /> Girls steal the show so far in this series. Chuck is adorable, just like Olive. Two aunts are happy. I sincerely hope to write them in larger parts because they are magical. Well, that's all that suits the press. Come make a great bowl of popcorn and enjoy the fun in the old way. That's like Dr. Seuss for adults.
