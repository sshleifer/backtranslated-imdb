I think if the film has a spell, I do not need it to be fluid or smooth. They can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow at others, etc. The spell in this movie: the scene in the library. There are many minor flaws in Stanley & Iris, but they do not damage the overall positive impact of watching people who help each other in areas of life that seem to be most incomprehensible, the most difficult to fix. Both characters are intelligent. Still Stanley can not understand enough to work because he can not read; he can not read because he has too many adventures in his childhood. Iris, though well educated, did not have enough adventure, and so she can not understand how to move around the turn of her life. In both their mistakes and forces, the characters complement each other. It could be a bit of a stretch if I had accepted that Iris would end up in the factory every year, or that Stanley had never silenced his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better paid job. And while these "mysteries" are explained during the story, it seems that their development is somewhat conceived. I suppose no one could re-evaluate the script. Is that even a good movie? Imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would do on the screen if someone had it!
