I was too young to remember when I first saw this movie. But I saw it the second time 7 years ago. My sister told me I had to see it. Now the whole family has remembered me. We quote him at least once a day. I absolutely love this movie. Still still laughing. Sure, he is a really drunk millionaire who is irresponsible. The whole thing is that mankind is still lost in the others we see in the movie. And that he is willing to give everything for love. I recommend this movie to everyone who wants to laugh. He laughs a lot. It's skillful, sweet, and if your movie fan, it really will change your idea of ​​"Funny". Watch this with a group of your friends or your family and I promise you'll never have anything to talk to with some authurst lines in your head. It will make you laugh for the coming years. <br /> <br /> It's really hard, in my family, to find a movie that everyone likes. But this movie, I feel, has come close to us. And I know it will do the same for you!
