I've come across this Act-I with pure stupidity and it was more than ten years ago. This was not what was mentioned on the tape label. That surprised me. It was intimidating me. It shocked me. I finally forgot about it, and almost ten years later I thought it over again. Then he went and bought both actions. They were even better than I did in the first place. My only complaint is that while Police Tank goes on and on, they are in a war of crime, tank warrant and heavy artillery as if they really had a bad time with criminals. It is either never shown or is simply a lie, as it seems to be easy. If it was really a propaganda that you were in a state of war, it certainly was not proven. I do not think the original Japanese version could be anywhere as good as the American version of it. But as for the story, there certainly were some proper explanations that were lost in translation, but that can be justified.
