Scott is right. The best 2 personal combat sword ever shot in the movie is in the middle of this movie. A sword fighting with several warriors is not the best, though quite good. However, the fight on Wednesday is the best compared to Japanese Samurai films. Chinese sword scenes, in my opinion, never exceeded the Japanese in terms of entertainment value. Especially in scenes where one guy has to fight against a group of enemies, they excel in Japanese films, such as Lone Wolf and Cub. Although the duels in the Japanese cinema last only for a few seconds or minutes, the greatest intensity of those moments has improved them. But it is one example when the Chinese sword overcomes the Japanese. The scene in the middle of this film was a five-minute fight with the most amazing choreography ever. The other fights in this movie are good, but even if they soaked this movie, they would get 7 for one scene. If you did not see it, you must. John Woo is a man.
