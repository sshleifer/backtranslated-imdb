Although Shining is older than a quarter of a century, I call on someone not to lock Jack Nicholson into madness. This is a rare example of something so unique that no one could tear him off; instead of appearing in pop culture from time to time. Twins, Blood Lift, RedRum, crazy nonsense "write" ... it should be seen if for nothing else, understand all the cues about it in everyday life. The film is scary, exciting, beautiful and psychologically interesting. It has the classic secret of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller. And it has horror movies that are mostly missing: a great screenplay.
