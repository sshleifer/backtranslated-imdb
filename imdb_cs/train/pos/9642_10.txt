The film is very realistic. It is absolutely not Hollywood Cinema, where every line must be celebrated perfectly and where every move is accurate. Actors playing the role of lovers make a great job of representing the feelings and thoughts of the characters - their everyday life adventures. Overall, the film culminates in a compressed state. Here is the realism of the whole story. Not everything happens as we think it should happen. But I can say that the film does not end on a bad note. We follow, learn, experience ourselves. This is probably the morality of this story.
