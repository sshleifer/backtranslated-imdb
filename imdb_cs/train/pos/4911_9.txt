This film has become one of my favorite pseudo noir experiences over the past ten years. The three stories of history that Kazan gave us have their unique and separate pleasure. Among the households between Bel Geddes and Widmer, the movement between rooms, small gestures such as the book that Barbara put on a chair under her son to get to the table, these small confidential exchanges between husband and wife are all well-processed and natural . More than anything else I love their porch, the second living room where it is obvious that they spend most of their summer time. The second thread is the professional relationship between many in the film, but above all between the characters of Widmer and Douglas. It does not have to be completely original and a bit embarrassed, but in all, it's real, respectful and effective. The third thread, the horrifying story of Blackie and his torn little gang, gets us closest to the dark and terrifying world. Blackance Palance is cool as a block of ice. This self-appointed businessman, the person you created, of course, obviously has a complexity that we are only briefly touched upon. For me, this film is a completely satisfying experience.
