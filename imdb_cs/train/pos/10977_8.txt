I picked it out of libraries at night because I have no idea about the movie, it's culture, influence, or that it is currently acting as a musical. (!) Most of the comments are on the target, it's moving, fun, sad and yes, despite the best intentions of the creators. The extended edition of Chriterion is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out. <br /> <br /> I think you can also see in a small Edie fall class that disappeared, you can also hear it in old movies Jackie O; people just do not talk like that. I think it would be interesting as a documentary to get more information about how the home was getting worse, old Edie is at least still aware of what is happening to some extent; could she not see how the house would ever delight? <br /> <br /> The subject of the film is the life that both women have built for themselves, the real life of Tennesse Williams. It is well worth it.
