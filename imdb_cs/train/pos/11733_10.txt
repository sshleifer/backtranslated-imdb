Elvira Mistress of the Dark is exactly the fact that the camp of fun, sexual attraction, horror and comedy is poured into a black, low-bloody dress and dressed in a sky of high black bouffants. This movie will surely delight every fan of Elvira. It will pick you up and, personally, with Elvira and probes deep into her ... she will reveal her gigantic ... ancestral background. The film takes you on a journey with Elvira when she goes from TV Horror to a hostess with a mosque to her home town of Fallwell Mass to claim heritage from the deceased Great Aunt. Where he meets a depleted city, a cold cinema owner, a ghostly Big Uncle who seems to be more than her good looks. A lot of kids in high schools who love her instantly, and a city council that does anything to get her out of town, even if it means burning her on a stake! Watch Elvira welcome the kids, move the blade, avoid the ghostly Great Uncle and the thumb of her nose on the stuffed "conservatives" who have no kind words for her in Mrs Elvira the Dark! <br /> <br /> Elvira would say, "I guarantee you it will be a scream!" (Screaming in the background) "Well, I did not say it would be gas!"
