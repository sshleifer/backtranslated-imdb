I find it very interesting that the film really managed to bridge the gap between its own American culture and the originator, ie the Chinese one. It becomes a story of values ​​and causes the observer to rethink his own choices in life and loyalty to the institutions. It was amazingly done in a gentle, slightly humorous manner that only threatens the status quo in retrospective observation. I liked the movie and if I could, I could check it out again.
