14 years old in me is extremely happy that they are now able to make really good-looking fantasy movies, and that they are all raging about how much money with the Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and the Chronicles of Narnia makes a lot of money in the box office. This year we will see (and have already seen) several other, most notably the Golden Compass, which has the most amazing trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on the novel by Neil Gaiman, has appeared in theaters this week with just a little more. I did not see any previews, just a few ads. Critical reaction is something bla. I would not even see it if I did not have to wait for a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and there was nothing interesting about this weekend. Well, if you forgive the terrible pun, the stars must be properly aligned because I went to see Stardust and loved her. It's not a huge movie like the Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero is set to look for a fallen star) full of obstacles. But in this basic outline the story is alive and imaginative. It's just the goal of being a lot of fun and charming romance. And that's great. This summer, there were many big movies, but none of them were as fun as this one. It's a lot going on, but the story is well known and almost totally coherent. It is not a masterpiece, but it can certainly occupy the same land as the Princess Bride (though I do not like as much as the older film). You have a lot of fun if you are a fan of this genre.
