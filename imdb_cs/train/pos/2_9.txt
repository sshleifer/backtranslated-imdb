Bromwell High is not brilliant. Experimentally sketched and perfectly delivered, this parody, scattered by students and teachers from a public school in South London, leaves literally laughter. It is vulgar, provocative, funny and sharp. Characters are a great caricature cross-section of a British company (or more accurate, each company). After the escapades of Keishy, ​​Latry and Natelly, our three "protagonists" who want to have a better date, the show does not parody the parody of all possible subjects. Political correctness flies from the window in each episode. If you enjoy shows that are not afraid to hurry over any taboos you can imagine, then Bromwell High will not disappoint!
