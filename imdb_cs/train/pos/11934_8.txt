At first you think the next Disney movie, it could be good, but it's a kid's movie. But if you look at it, you can not enjoy it. All movies will love all ages. I first saw this movie when I was 10 years old and eight years later I still love it! Danny Glover is excellent and could not play this role better. Christopher Lloyd is cheerful and perfect. Tony Danza is as credible as Mel Clark. You can not help but enjoy this movie! I give it 10/10!
