I like the movie. Twisted Desire was Jeremy Jordan, one of my favorite and one of the most cute actors. Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress. I saw most of her films, but all Jeremy Jordan. A thing I do not like about Twisted Desire is when Nick is arrested and Jennifer throws him away. Twisted Desire is my second favorite movie. My first is The Goonies. But I still love Jeremy Jordan.
