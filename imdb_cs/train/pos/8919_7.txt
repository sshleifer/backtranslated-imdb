Who would have thought that Andy Griffith's "Helen Crump" (Aneta Corsaut) had a Steve McQueen movie in the past? But that's just one of the few weird and amazing things about the movies of the last 50s of the 20th century that would best be described as Rebel Without A Case encounters God knowing from space. Rebel is Steven McQueen (who soon decides that "Steve" sounded less volatile), a good boy with wild enough to be interesting; a very convenient and yet understandable girlfriend is Aneta Corsaut. It was bad enough when their date was disturbed by teenage hot grandparents, but they are much more restless when they encounter a gallanting, human traveler. What is it going down to the ground on its own meteorode - and it starts to move the city people right and left. But do adults believe it? Of course, no, what they know are just kids! The movie is a teeny bopper on his teeny bopping best. Actors take a very demanding scenario very seriously, with many fascinating looks in the eyes and "adult" supported acting is likely to say "kids!" very third sentence or so. But the real pleasure of the film, his creature, which is well presented, well done, and can often create a surprising degree of tension. And though clearly on the cheap side (look at those miniature sets, boys!), BLOB is actually a pretty well-made movie - and there is that catchy little theme of the song thrown in to a good scale. A crowd of 40 people (including me) will enjoy the film as nostalgia, but it does not prevent them from swinging along with younger sets on the sensitivity of all milk and white bread in the 1950s, and the film would be a great choice either for a family night or for a more sophisticated " adults only ". Create a bunch of Jello cubes for movie snacking! Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
