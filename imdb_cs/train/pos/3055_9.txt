In his first play as a director in Hollywood, Henry Brommell drove a fascinating yarn that penetrates into marriage questions with melancholy authenticity and attracts them to himself with the same absorbing subplot of father and son business. The film is nicely focused and consists of a beautifully assembled cast as well as a fast, family-conscious script (also Brommell), which brings life to the otherwise weary genre. As a bonus, "Panic" brings a gentle, hot humor - an unexpected, undeniably charming and very welcome surprise - thanks to its fearsome, uncertain star with a low key, whose still cool condition is tempting, especially because of his work. William H. Macy, who is always great, captures our hearts like Alex, an unhappy, torn, middle aged husband and father who finds comfort in the most dubious: a young, attractive 23 year old young Sarah (Neve Campbell) with whom she meets in a waiting room in the office of a psychologist waiting for Dr. Therapie Josh Parks (John Ritter) discussing the growing eagerness to leave the family business that his father built (Donald Sutherland). Alex, whose desire to lead a new life is hindered by the fear of disappointing his dictator, Sarah strikes an incomprehensible fantasy, which eventually leads to an understanding of the substance and irrevocable responsibility of being his wife's husband and, more importantly, a good father of his six- son of Sammy (he plays enthusiastically with great David Dorfman). Henry Brommell's brilliant "panic" is seldom seen in Hollywood with the exception of 2002, "Road to Perdition" since his conception in 2000 - combining two opposing genres (organized crimes, family drama) into a fascinating, warm piece of film that is equally strong in both directions, and it is he who will maintain his exceptional, rare character and shining sincerity for the next ages.
