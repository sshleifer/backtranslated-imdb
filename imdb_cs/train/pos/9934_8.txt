"Domino" has been widely condemned on this page for his frenetic editing style and "bad" photo. They are criminals who cite their superficiality and criticize their use of "style over nature". I could not disagree more. I believe that "Domino" represents the absolute height of film production by Tony Scott. <br /> <br /> After creating a dominant style of action film in Hollywood, Tony Scott gradually approached the more subjective style of the film in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Already at the time of Crimson Tide, Scott used his stylish talent to portray the inner worlds of his characters - claustrophobia and dramaturgy, part of the conflict on board a nuclear submarine, was embodied by the excellent use of long lenses in combination with an angle frame. This was subsequently transferred to the "Enemy of the State" and "Spy Game", which visually represented worlds of surveillance and espionage. <br /> <br /> "Man on Fire" was an extreme departure, moving into Expressionism for more painting aesthetics. Here Scott used an obsolete hand-held camera and flash frames to express the explosive anger of his character. Although he was not quite successful, he introduced the techniques that were to be found in "Domino" in full expression <br /> <br /> Narrated in the FBI Investigation Framing Facility, "Domino" represents the life of an infamous reward hunter through its narrative unrelated fragments of memory. It takes memories as we all do - in fragments, flashes and short abductions. As Domino transmits verbally to his story, Scott transmits visually illustrating not only the events he describes, but also the view that drives them. She has "mescalin traces" in her systems, but her individual vision is just as unusual - the woman who avoids the life of luxury for bounty hunts. <br /> <br /> When Domino begins to concentrate on the events that lead to her capture, Scott really gets ripped. Together with cinematographer Dan Mindell and composer Harry-Gregson Williams Scott, he orchestrates the postmodern screen of contemporary America. Gradually, we begin to realize that the unusual, even if it may be Domino, is no longer separate from the "90210" culture that she refused. As he walks through this cultural melancholy, Scott becomes more aware of the innocence he discovers through the disadvantaged children telling the story. Finally, Scott portrays his salvation as the only escape from this surrealist trip. <br /> <br /> Criticizing this film for being too stylized is similar to criticizing Picasso or Pollock for not representing what is recognizably human. Just like any big painting, it is meaning in "Domino" on the surface and the surface is everything. <br /> <br /> I am in no way associated with Scott Free, but I have always been and will continue to be a great admirer of Tony Scott's work
