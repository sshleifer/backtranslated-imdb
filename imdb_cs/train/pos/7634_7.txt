<br /> <br /> Okay, the movie did not get any prizes and it's a clean bubble, and it's a modern update to "It's a wonderful life." But it's just coming out as a cheap edition on DVD and it's a much worse way to blow out $ 13. You get a movie that has a surprisingly strong cast, but for most of them there are still a year or two of becoming a list of celebrity B. However, it's a nice way to get an hour and a half, you just do not think much about it.
