Now I really liked this movie, it was so funny. Akshay Kumar and John Abraham are brilliant actors, I think that after watching this movie they should do a lot of other movies in the future. Akshay Kumar gets himself into some trouble by hitting three women at the same time, but the way he deals when one goes out the door and then the other is just funny to watch, he acted really well in his movie and I hope he will do it in the future a comedy like this one in the future, John Abraham plays his best friend, plays his role really well and is underestimated, I'm glad that some of his amazing work has noticed but he's a really good actor. I just love John, Neha Dhupia has a small role in this movie and plays it well. Muse is really good, I really recommend this movie to everyone.
