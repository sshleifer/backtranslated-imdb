I have a free pass to review this movie last night and did not know what to expect. The assumption seemed to be stupid and I assumed it would be a lot of shallow plush humor. What a great surprise. I laughed so hard that I was crying over some jokes. This film must be seen for anyone who has an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor. Okay ... this is not the movie she's going with her grandmother (Jack Palance?) Or the little kids. Language is dirty, jokes are (very) rough, and sex is as graphical as anywhere else. It's amazing that the movie is still a sweet love story. My girlfriend and I loved each other. Steve Carell is amazing, but (just like The Office) supporting cast actually makes the movie work. All the characters have their defects but they also have depth and exuberance. Everyone pulls their weight and chemistry is perfect. I can not wait to get a DVD. I'm sure there will be an office space where replicas and links will be found.
