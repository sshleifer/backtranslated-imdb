Pandro S. Berman was "commissioned to produce" but thanks to this he became the so-called Line Producer. But who produced this epic film shot not only in Arizona but in the California Mojave Desert, where the attackers broke up with all the remains of the "golden temple", the Thuggee palace, the British base in Muri, the village of Tantrapur etc. Minor technical errors can and must be forgiven. What is unforgivable is the lack of an Oscar for the best music, though perhaps she did not offer such music at that time. The only theme was played at different times, including waltz, march and sweets, mood adjustments. Brilliant! One of the curious aspects of the production was the widow of Kipling's demands. Shortly before and after the battle scenes, an actor plays Kipling. In the initial release, his scenes were shot at the request of Mrs. Kipling. Later, they were included and donated the "connection" of Kipling's immortal poem to Ben Hecht's screenplay. Interestingly, this very typical and Prosrewic story was a great screenplay that the British had hated.
