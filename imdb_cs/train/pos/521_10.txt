This is probably one of the most original love stories I've ever seen, especially for a war-based film (shortly). Basically, it's a story based in two worlds, one obviously real, another fictional, but the filmmakers at first say it's just a coincidence if it's a real place. Anyway, Peter Carter (great David Niven) crashed on a plane, talking to Planet of the Apes' Kim Hunter, before he rescued and said he loved her. He had intended to die without a parachute, but somehow survived and now he sees and loves July in the body. This other place, like heaven, is unfortunate because he survived and intended to come to his world, and therefore sent the French conductor 71 (Marius Goring) to persuade him to go but obviously to be in love. Peter suggests that he summon himself to keep his life in the second court of the world. Obviously, love prevails when both lovers announce that they will die of each other. Also starring Robert Coote as Bob Trubshaw, Kathleen Byron as Anjel, short (then unknown) Lord Sir Richard Attenborough as English pilot, and Abraham Sofaer as Judge / Surgeon. David Niven was number 36 on the 50th largest British actors, the film was number 86 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for a Happy End, it was number 47 on 100 greatest war films, it was number 46 on 50 greatest British films, and it was number 59 on 100 of the biggest films. Excellent!
