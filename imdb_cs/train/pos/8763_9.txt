This movie is a cold, bare truth. We often think "no, it will not happen to me." But it can. Drug smuggling is a great deal of money and people are often unwitting (or cheated) to do things like smugglers. The story of these two girls is the story of many young people who like it, just wanted an exotic holiday - which has changed into a nightmare. People need to know that such events are unlikely or exaggerated - that is the main problem of today's society. I would recommend this movie to ripe viewers because they understood the movie. It's very emotional and raw. It is worth a lot of attention and it certainly remains in your memory.
