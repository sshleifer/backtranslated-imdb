Yeah, an archetype of a simple but inspirational film. The end of the whole crowd at the stadium rises and people lift their hands gives me coldness whenever I see it. It's just brilliant. Joseph is fabulous as a lonely and sad boy who has been disappointed by someone and nothing in his life. The way he works with Danny Glover and tries to believe him in magic and angels is fun and exciting. A very nice family film with - I admit - a bit happy ending. But hey, it does not matter, the film preserves its basic quality by acting well and inspiring themes.
