"Shop around the corner" is one of Ernst Lubitsch's great films. In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, he is filled with the amazing cast of top-notch personalities such as Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart. These are character actors who Hollywood unfortunately does not work for. The film is actually such a movie that Hollywood is no longer doing. (The creators of "You Got Mail" claim that their movie is a remake, but that's nothing but a lot of bloated self-praise.) Anyway, if you're affectionate to the romantic comedies of the 1940s, you'll find "The Shop around the corner" nothing beautiful. Just as well with repeated tours. Enjoy!
