For those who were interested in how exactly mankind came to be wrapped in large red strums that make me a grandiose garnet, there is a duo of the "second Renaissance" shorts. I'm not quite sure why they are divided into two parts, especially because they are credited as DVDs (and are these short films displayed in any format other than DVD?) But they are informative even though they have a few differences. What makes this first part a great one, the second part and the rest of the animations are also parallels that show up between the insurgent robot and civil rights. Graphic honors of slavery, fascism, concentration camps, and mass graves are mixed with verbal references to Million Man March and God's human complex. In fact, "God" has never been referred to these shorts instead of replacing "his own image of man". As for the shorts to go in the collection, the "second Renaissance: part I" is by far the most effective in raising emotions. It is a sad and disturbing view of the potential of mankind to become "the architect of his own destruction". Some can be turned off by some concepts that touch briefly on the previously created sci-fi literature, but that's basically what most of the Matrix series did and was the driving force behind its success. > <br /> --PolarisDiB
