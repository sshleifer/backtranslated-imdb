I am a college student who studies on the level and needs help and remarks from anyone who has some ideas about the subject of the mother in the movie in her mother. Whether you have experienced something similar or just want to comment and help me explore more about this movie, any comment would be greatly appreciated. Comments will only be used for test purposes and will be included in my written exam. So if you have any opinions at all, I can certainly give them to use and you could help me get A! I'm also studying "About Guys" and "Tadpole," so if you've seen these movies too, I would appreciate if you could leave the comments on this page. Thank you.
