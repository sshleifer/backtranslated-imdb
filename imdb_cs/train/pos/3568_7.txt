This film moves the Ashes story forward in the early 1950s and makes good, though eccentric, use of the island of Man as a background. Ugly sisters have become wild and enchanting girls from the upper class and together with Kathleen Turner as a stepmother, they throw themselves in various amazing period costumes. The story has changed a bit from the traditional version: it is very strange to combine it with the plot of King Lear, and in the later stages, Cinderella is more assertive than usual. He looks beautiful and works quite well, but sometimes he overcomes the top.
