Rob Roy is underestimating the epic of passion and action! Some love spoils inside. Liam Neeson gives an eccentric performance like Rob Roy MacGregor, one of the best in his career. Jessica Lange's letter-perfect as his wife Mary. They have the most passion and chemistry I have seen on the screen couple. John Hurt gives his best snotty aristocrat performance. Tim Roth portrays one of the big screen villains. This is Mary's rape and pain. He's a really great bastard in this movie. The ultimate duel between Rob and Cunningham is one of the best swords in history ever. Well the scenario ans scored and Michael Caton-Jones's direction is flawless. 10 out of 10.
