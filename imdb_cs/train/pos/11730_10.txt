What can he say about Elvira, which has not been said yet in the world press? The classic comedy Elvira delivers in his first feature-length comic book. Since the first film, Elvira has been packed with an actor punch that clearly says Film Great .... Heart Out, Bette Davis! Take a look at Elvira, see the exciting Elvira, look at the jealous Elvira, look at the murderous Elvira. You can do nothing but wonder about her acting skills! <br /> <br /> In the heart of this comedy masterpiece, Elvira is the desire for the Las Vegas show star. In spite of putting "boob back to boobtube" as a horror hostess (with a mostest), Elvira finds a small screen emotionally constrictive .... and physically! Nuff said she packed her briefcase and headed east ... in one hand a wand and a letter from her aunt, her lawyer, who on the other sketched her inheritance. movie so many times, I can almost recite it literally .... (literally it would only show off)! <br /> <br /> Take a copy, laugh stupidly, learn rows .... <br /> <br /> Why did not she get an Academy Award for Best Actress because this role is outside of me.
