This excellent independent work that is not associated with anything before or after. Brat Pack crooning and club exclusivity are not my crackers of choice, but in this lawlessness create an attractive atmosphere for the world. The film is packed with our boys, distinguished actors who distinguish this work with winning performances. Dialogue is joy. In fact, it is a new folk language. One of the few films that can be watched repeatedly with a growing appreciation. The high points include Billy Idol, British Bengali, Kyle's blasphemy, and ad hoc philosophy.
