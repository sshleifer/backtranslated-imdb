Japanese cyber-punk movies have never really done it to me, but the hand I've seen most of them was at least visually interesting and at least mostly fun. MEATBALL MACHINE is no exception. The story is about parasitic species that take over human hosts, take control of the bodies, transform them into "necroborgs" and cause them to fight each other. the only purpose of eating each other - apparently as a "game" for the use of these parasites. The film mainly rotates around a shy guy and a girl who sink each other but whose love is relatively short when parasites are infected and forced to fight each other. It becomes a test of human will and the parasite controls its physical body ... <br /> <br /> The MEATBALL MACHINE will always be compared to TETSUO (like most cyber-punk movies) and for good reason. Certainly there are thematic parallels, although the films are completely different. The MEATBALL MACHINE has plenty of fun and splash, and the creature / borg FX is definitely the pinnacle - the blend of TETSUO-meets-GWAR, both complicated and inventive. Depending on your taste for these types of movies, MEATBALL MACHINE may or may not be your thing. If you enjoy hyperkinetic cyber-punk movies with a healthy dose of spraying - it's for you ... 7/10
