This is an ancient, amazingly entertaining childhood movie with the surest most interesting novice witch ever. Unlike many of the modern stories that seem to emerge in dark witchcraft, it's just a magical story about hocus pocus, which is cute, light and charming. The story takes place in 1940 in the English village of Peppering Eye, where three children, Cockney, Charlie, Carrie and Paul Rollins, are evacuated from the dangers of World War II aircraft. They are erroneously sent to live with Eglantine Price, who studies a correspondence course to become an apprentice witch. Eglantine and a trio of kids use magic buttons to travel to London on a flying bed. Here they meet Emilius Browne, the fraudulent director of the Miss Price Writership Correspondence School. Miss Price is thinking about working on spells for life. Meanwhile, he must also deal with a dark figure called Bookman and his companion, Swinburne. Angela Lansbury is, of course, wonderfully delightful as an eccentric witch in training, Miss Price. David Tomlinson plays Mr. Browne, the head of the School of Wicked Witchcraft, who now turns the street wizard. This actor was previously cast as a child's father in Mary Poppins. In fact, it is a movie that reminds of former Mary Poppins, both wonderful fantasy stories for children. Maybe this movie does not have such unforgettable music as Chim-Chim-Cheree, but boasts some attractive little melodies. Some were critical, but the film has excellent special effects. Overall, the story is a charming family fun. It is a shame if modern children were too sophisticated for this beautiful and charming story that should appeal to us all.
