As a drunk playboy millionaire, Arthur Bach, Dudley Moore is perfect as an adult man imprisoned in childhood. As it turns out, the role is so suited to Moore that he also captured him as an actor. Soon, a lot of disappointment (including the pale sequel to this film) has appeared, but this does not diminish the charm or appeal of this painting, which is skillfully written and controlled. Some of Moore's drunken scenes are forced, parts of the film are blatant, but acting is so pleased to be a heavy film that will resist. He has a very hearty heart and gives John Gielgud the Oscar winner a funny, dry entertaining role as Arthur's butler, Hobson; his relationship with Arthur is delicious and has a miraculous relationship. Liza Minnelli (like a blue collar of love-interest) is noisy in the low-key, and Moore is brash but skillful and alive; he never shuddered with Arthur's shadow, but at least we have this evidence of a career top to enjoy it. *** z ****
