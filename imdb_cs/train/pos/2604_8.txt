"Amazing Grace" feels like it feels like it tells you about the current story about the different lives in an apartment house. The language spoken is Hebrew, but the drama can be held in every modern city. They follow family values, romantic relationships, and the characteristics of the age group with the same aplomb. He does not share figures, he presents them only straightforwardly, because they are trying to solve their individual problems in this modern world. The quality of acting is very good, and observation on the characters is clever and sharp. I very much appreciate this flowing film.
