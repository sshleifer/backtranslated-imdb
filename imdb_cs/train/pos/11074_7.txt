Not even the whole disaster criticized by the United Kingdom, nor the misunderstood masterpiece that suffered from several fans, is Revolver, at least a remarkable attempt by Guy Ritchie to add a little cloth to his chaplains. But then there is nothing more contemptuous than an ambitious film that would bite more than he could chew, especially one that used a film gangster / concert. As one can expect from the name of Luc Besson on the products as a producer, there is a certain element of "Cinema de look": set in a realistic fantasy world where America and Britain overlap, looks great, has a couple of beautifully crafted action sequences and style oozes, all of which refer to as disposable entertainment. But Ritchie apparently wants to do more than just work out his own movies for a quick buck and spend a lot of time thinking and reading about life, the universe and everything. If it's a problem, it's trying to throw too many influences (a bit of Machiavelli, Godard's Dash, lots of chess principles), motives and techniques, wasting screen citing: the movie was originally intended to end three minutes of an epigram above the bodies of the dead victims sometimes he feels as if he never read about what he should be, and he did not want to become a movie. Rather than being an advertisement for Kabbalism, it is rather a mixture of overlapping principles of trade, chess and trustworthiness, which largely draws on the difficult trick of making theosophy accessible while concealing the central (somewhat metaphysical) content of the film. The last third is where most problems are found because Jason Statham takes the enemy (literally) inside with a large number of ambitious, but not always completely successful, cross-sections in contrast to contrast with ex internal fear and anger, but that has a lot to do . It is not worth a new religion, but I am surprised that he did not get an American distributor. Perhaps they found that Ray Liotta was deliberately fake tan too damn scary?
