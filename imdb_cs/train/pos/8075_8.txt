I decided not to believe what famous film critics say. Even though this movie did not get the best comments, this time this film made my day. It occurred to me. What is a false world. What do you do when your favorite ones are deceiving you? It is said that no matter how often you milk the snake, you can never be loyal and will bite when he gets a chance. Likewise, some people are such that they are never grateful. This film is about how selfish people can be and how they all think about themselves and work for themselves. <br /> <br /> Your brother dies in the gangster's hands unintentionally. The surviving brother decides to avenge. Through this process we learn about the vanity of this world. Nothing is real, and no one is faithful to anyone. <br /> <br /> Amitabh gave the performance of his life. The new actor Aryan gave good performance. The actress, who played Amitab's wife, stole the show. Her role was small, but she played her role so carefully that her performance was taking place. Chawla had really great expressions on her face, but her role was very limited and she was not able to express herself fully. Great movie Raj Kumar Santoshi. His films always give the audience some message. His films are like the novels of Nanaka Singh (a Punjabian writer who always has a target for novels and social evil) because they have a real message for the listener. Fun and lessons are fun.
