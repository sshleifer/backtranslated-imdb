What an exciting ride! Twisted and provocative thought. Once again, Sharon Stone pulls her dead, beautiful, magical character from Catherine Tramell perfectly. The original basic instinct takes place in San Francisco. The sequel takes place in London, where Catherine moved. Both bustling cities known for excitement, haute couture ~ and a perfect place for someone like Catherine Trammel to get a place to live. David Morrisey ("Derailed") plays the smooth role of Dr. Psychiatrist Michael Glass. The character of David Thewlis plays as Roy Washburn with Scotland Yard, is a refreshing departure from his role as Lupine in the Harry Potter series. Dazzling cars, designer clothes, sex, drama, humor, tension - all "basic instincts". Myse bends. Big screenplay. From the top opening scene to the surprising conclusion, this film is really boring! Everyone in the theater was stuck to the screen.
