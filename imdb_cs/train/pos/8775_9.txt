Outstanding Warner Bros. effort Errol Flynn plays in one of his best performances on the screen. It is often cited as the best and I can not fully judge until I have seen his Dawn Patrol. However, his work in "They dying with their shoes on" takes some beating. I'm a big fan of Flynn (it's my favorite actor after James Mason - it also helps him to be Aussie) and I think it's just amazing, a great presence on the screen and also a great actor. He is the centerpiece of "Gentleman Jim" as a legendary boxer with a fantastic leg, but he is also supported by a literate, warm and fun script and Raoul Walsh's direction. Every Walsh movie I've ever seen will never lose momentum, he was a really born filmmaker. Walsh directs beautiful circle scenes as well as lighter moments and the horrific final scene between Ward Bord and Flynn. Add to these great productions ("Gay Nineties" never looked better!) And beautiful supporting cast and it's quite a perfect fun. Alan Hale usually played Flynn's assistant, but here's his father, and it all works. Alexis Smith is Flynn's love interest. Pairs are overhead in love and fight against each other.
