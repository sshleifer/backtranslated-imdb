"Hey Babu Riba" is a movie about a young woman, Marian (nicknamed "Esther" by the famous American film star) and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha and Pop, all maybe at the age of 15-17 in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia . Five of them are devoted friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans or any American, as it seems. The very close relationship between the teenagers is dizzying and finally the victim is willingly made to try to help one of the group that has come up with unexpected troubles. As a result of the changing communist politics, they move separately and reunite in 1985 (the year before the film was shot). I liked the film with some reservations. Subtitles for one thing were difficult. Especially at the beginning there were several dialogues that did not have any headlines. Maybe it required conversational tempo, but I could not read the text and take the scene, which made me not understand which character is. I was looking at a movie (video from our public library) with a friend, and none of us really understood the part of the story about getting a streptomycin for a sick relative. This Yugoslav advent of the age of film has effectively conveyed the senses of teenagers about invulnerability, idealism and strong and loyal ties to one another. There is a major flashforward, and it was interesting to keep me guessing until the end of what those figures were compared to the 1953 cast, and what actually happened. 7 out of 10 and would like to see other movies by director Jovan Acino (1941-1991).
