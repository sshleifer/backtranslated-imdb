The film dominated by barbarian Steaua, which was foolish, was seen when I was seven or eight, and created lasting images of pale vampire men and women who haunted the castle and searched for blood. Steele is an icon of horror movies and alien beauty and looks at the dead previous Romero NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD spoilers, uniting them in my mind. I do not see the link between this film and HAUNTING, which is smart but ambiguous about the forces present. LA DANZA MACABRE is a b-movie without hindrance, dare you to fall in love with Barbara Steele and suffer the consequences. There is no such draw that Claire Bloom should overcome. Comparisons with HAUNTING are superficial. And no, this movie does not have to be redesigned. It is not only a product of the 1960s, but a large percentage of hopeless cretins in Hollywood can not understand the MACABRE formulation of terror. This formula is based on one important factor: GOOD WRITING. Low classics such as CASTLE and Corman's Poe films with R. Matheson and Tourneur's OUT OF THE PAST share a strong stronger writing. It's easy. Get a real writer like Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie, and let them get into today's film mess. In addition, let Hollywood attempt some original material for change and stop using the apparently better product of the past.
