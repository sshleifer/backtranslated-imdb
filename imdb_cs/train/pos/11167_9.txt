My favorite film, telling about two feudal "characters" of New York, Steve Brodie (Raft) and "Chuck" Connors (Beery) who were trying to be "Main Guy" in the late nineteenth century. Brodie (1863-1901) and Connors (1852-1913) were real people, though this is a heavily fictional description of their anger (based on the game). Brodie is legendary (he did it - it's still the reason for the argument!), Jump from the Brooklyn Bridge (1886), for which he became famous, is shown here at the same time as the Spanish-American War (1898). Director Walsh has had a brilliant affection for the season, so beautifully created here, and includes a wild ragtime ragtime number from singer singer Trixie Odbray (young Pert Kelton). Rafa is on his most beautiful as Brodie and Beery again shows how clever the actor was, , spectacular and sometimes quite moving Connors.Pretty Fay Wray is a loving interest as boys hunt. <br /> <br /> Full of life and energy, "The Bowery" moves at a rapid pace (unlike many early "talkies"). It's not an easy movie to find, but it's worth searching for.
