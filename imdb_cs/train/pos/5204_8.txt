I do not watch much porn, but I love porn stars. And I love horror films. So when I heard about the porn-gore movie, I was really excited. Of course, it was years ago, and when I heard about all the troubles in filming and finishing the film, I never thought I'd actually see him. But I did it and I'm not ashamed to admit I liked it, even with all its flaws. <br /> <br /> First, bugs. The story takes place in Ireland and is called Samhain, but the story he seemed to mean is about the Sawney Beane clan from Scotland. So why do not you just do it and skip the third-class report on Samhain / Irish immigrants / Halloween? It also violates its own rules by saying that you are safe on the trails, but then cannibal mutants begin to run amok everywhere. It is never clear how many cannibals we are in charge of. There is a large stone castle that is obviously old, but no one noticed it before. Obvious links to horror films are annoying and they are also characters. The heroine has a retrospective set of all her dead friends that contain a character she NEVER meets. The end has no meaning. So what does it work for? Gore! I would certainly like more, but it was refreshing to see such an ugly film that was not afraid to be anything more than a gore film. Two murders are over the top, and Taylor Hayes has a pretty nasty scene. Two wild assassinations are even exposed to extended DVD images. I always thought the gore could overcome the stupid story, and the Hound breed strengthened it.
