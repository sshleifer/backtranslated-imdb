If you have sons or daughters who love action, adventure, intrigue and imagination - without having to enter the song every twelve minutes - then Disney movie is for you! My sons loved every minute of this film and I must admit that I was laughing the whole movie a lot. There are no sappy songs that would get in the way of a wonderfully narrated story and the characters are all nice and identifiable in their own right. This should be one of Disney's "classic" due to its beautifully illustrated scenery and its uninterrupted excitement!
