I have to vote on this ten out of ten in a rare chance that it happens to look at this review, I like it, brings me to Hollywood and engages me in my freaky / entertaining world. But it was really good. The first episode apparently finds out that it's legs, but it's that Silverman wonders wonderfully all the way. It's not such a comic comedy, but it's a good thing, too laughing, and that would be wrong when it laughs, it's for the audience to hear their inner jester laugh at the absurdity of all this. I can easily see this as a bizarre show by Drew Carey with his weird characters and an incredibly strong central character. It is worth an hour and we are looking forward to the following episodes. Very good chance of the usual comedy out there. <br /> <br /> Psy, Sarah? Call me....
