This is very good, made for television movie. It shows the difficulties in the suburbs around 1970 and the kind of neighbors they certainly do not want to have around. The worst and most worrying part of the movie was when punk teenagers killed a family dog. Teenagers do everything to annoy and harass this poor family. But the guy !, the main figure of revenge leads to those punk teenagers at the end. The father / homeowner certainly does not take any worsening of punk teenagers easily and quickly rewarded for lack of assistance to the police that is. They stand and protect their home and family. Very good actor .. I could add. <br /> <br /> I watched it on TV when I was like 8 or 9. I never saw it on TV and I would. Definitely good! It's such a film that can be captured on a busy night late at night and can not stop watching an afternoon slide at the weekend. They are those that do not show up anymore. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth seeing!
