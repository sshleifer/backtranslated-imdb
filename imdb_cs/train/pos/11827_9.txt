If Dick Tracy was black-and-white, the Pope would not be religious. Thanks to the new sense of the color concept in the film, we offer a unique experience throughout the world of comic stripes and it's one of the few films he has done through a serious script, a good direction, great performances (Al Pacino is stunning), and the most important is a powerful mix of cinema , artistic direction and costume design. We use only primary colors, the experience is completely different from what we have seen before. And there's also a fairly successful funeral for the entire gangster film genre, virtually extinct from modern cinema. Overall, I see this film as a new attempt and a touch of originality to the film, which increasingly relies on old and still visible formulas. 7 out of 10.
