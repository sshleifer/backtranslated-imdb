In fact, it really is not a "movie" as well as a widespread last episode; I mean, if you DO NOT make a TV series (Murder: Life on the Street), I suspect you would have trouble watching this film for the movie. Let's say "Murder: Film" is still a great patrol. I think there's much talk about TV production that every single member will come back, many years after his absence, to reinvent his characters and bring an end to an incredible program. The film brings this sense of "family" not only between characters but also among actors. It's all very hot-sweet knowing that it will be the last time we see them together under the name HOMICIDE. The story, I find that this film is somewhat lacking. Giardell's mayoral candidature seems to be particularly fanciful and I felt that his shooting could be dealt with within the parameters of his usual position as Leitutenant. Also Det. Bayliss's extreme plot plot, which remained hanging at the end of the series, is finally resolved, but I never felt that it must be; I enjoyed being kept with the secret (let's recall that the first case of the first episode also did not solve for the whole series!). As a fan of DEVOTED's TV series, I can love this movie and the fact that it even came after H: LOTS was canceled, but I would not recommend it to anyone who did not have the smallest exposure of the show. Now, if they just got it on DVD ...
