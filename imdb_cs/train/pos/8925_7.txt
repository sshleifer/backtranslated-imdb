This film is almost generational in importance for some of us who were born in the early postwar years (and especially when you were born between 1946 and 1953 and you enjoyed spending Saturday afternoons in your neighborhood), you will certainly see. And the memory of seeing you probably stayed with you. It is a style that is part of a short and somewhat exciting moment in our days of growth. <br /> <br /> It was a modern, space-based scenario for the audience of your time. The set was a city with a supermarket and cinema that would be packed until Friday midnight. He has hot rods and rebellious youth, but in the "Why We Can not Have Fun" message rather than an upset, histrionic rebel without a cause. All the characters were identifiable to us - teens, parents, old man, doctor, nurse, mechanic, boy, puppy, even the cops - were sympathetic to us. We could get in touch with them. <br /> <br /> It was a strange scary monster. It is the first victim to hear, "it hurts ... it hurts" and we were convinced and scared. This threat continues to grow throughout the story. There are intense periods of tension, color effects, wonderful lead in McQueen, and moments of humor as he intended or not. It's even beyond the sad part to make us feel more sensitive as if we were crying. I noticed this in the summer, at the age of nine, twice invoiced with 'I Married And Monster Of The Universe' and was so excited about the experience of this double feature that I came back several times before he left. Everyone I knew, he loved it.
