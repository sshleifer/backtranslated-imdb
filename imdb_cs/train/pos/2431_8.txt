The famous was "known" by his tension and relaxation in the cartoon style where the semi-main character is in terrible danger, only to save the hero in the last second. This particular Casper is the only one I can remember where death really hand. Even with death, it is still a happy ending. The constant in the drawings of famous studies is that "virtue always triumphs". Popeye always gets into his spinach at the time, Baby Huey always out fox, Little Audery always "learns her lesson". And some FS cartoons are really dark and depressing. You have to give them credit. just like I like Looney Tunes and "Tom and Jerry" I do not think anyone would give a better cartoon product than Paramount at the time. Color, animation, music (great Winston Sharples), edits, voices. They were a consistent and glittering example of the best the art form had to offer.
