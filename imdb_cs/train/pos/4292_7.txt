Before watching, they did not know anything about the movie, and I think it was a "no-expectation" factor that helped me endure at first and later, as if it were more than I expected. The setting was interesting, strange but interesting. The story had gaps / jumps that I think will throw away the audience a little. There is no great soundtrack in the background that creates a "romantic" atmosphere. But they do not matter. The chemistry between Em and Luis was simply wonderful. There was some inexplicable chemistry I could not resist; I fell in love with it and here I am writing this review. The fine portrayal of two actors was excellent and, in my opinion, it is the core of this film. The film is not a romantic comedy everyday; in fact, not all of us will appreciate it. I had to sit down for a while, and then I slowly began to understand the little things I did not catch first. I can not guarantee everyone will like it, but I hope you do it.
