If Mulder is looking for his real father, it's Darren McGavin, the first X Files, a pity that it was only one season because the producers of this show did not know they had a classic in their hands and in 1993 came Chris Carter with what I call continued Night Stalker, The X Files. Both of them will go down as a classic, in my view, that two shows bring to the audience a level of experience that only occurs once in a while and which should appear in X Files Files later Darren McGavin, as agent Arthur Dales, helps our two favorite heroes dealing with cases. Thank you, I think so, well-done Chris Carter will return the forgotten TV show in the form of David Duchovny as Darren McGavin if it was not for watching the X files, and that particular show I would never know Stalker about Night.
