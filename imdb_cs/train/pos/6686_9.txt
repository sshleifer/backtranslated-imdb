This movie was a great concept. It was original, cleverly written and highly appealed to those of us who are not really "conforming" filmmakers. Do not get me wrong - there are some great movies that have a big challenge, but when you move into watching a movie based on "everyone else watching it" - you know you're either a complement or you really do not have a view. It had a beautiful gentle humor - despite the fact that most people are probably looking only for obvious. The actors introduced their characters to the aplomb, and I thought that in this film there was a much more "personal" personality. It has an appeal for both children and adults. Esp. nice to find a good movie that is not filled with sexual references and drug addictions! A great movie that can not be overlooked on public consumption. This is a purchase.
