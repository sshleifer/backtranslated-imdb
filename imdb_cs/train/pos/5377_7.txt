"Girly Murder" is my first known writing by Edgar Wallace? and generally my first real known film "Crims" in general? and I can say that I am slightly overwhelmed. This matter is really fun, even though I never expected it to be so? stupid! The film has an exciting and pretty intricate conspiracy with a healthy dose of humor, flashy twists and quite inventive murders. Is there any kind of evil spiritual master James Bond? who always sit in the shadows and in front of a big monitor - to hire prisoners to kill certain girls at a particular school with a new type of poison. There is also a vicious whipping monk dressed as a Communist member of the KKK, deprived of the rest of the characters, such as overly taught teachers and such as a tie police commissioner who persists in resolving a case with a psychological approach. Seriously, if I knew these Krimi movies were so colorful and crazy, I'd have bought them the whole collection. The prelude story actually raises more questions than it does at the end, and overloading the comic tricks on the Scotland Yard Inspector Higgins account is sometimes a little swallow, but I do not care because it was noble fun. Even the funky 60's soundtrack stayed stuck in my head for a long time. It's like a variant on Italian Giallo, but with ring elements.
