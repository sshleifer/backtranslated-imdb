Titanic is much more than just the night you remember. It records a tragic historical event that is always spoken and never forgotten. Why was he so criticized? I have no idea. They could sometimes shoot a movie like Titanic, which moves and touches every time you watch it. They could sometimes replace such epic masterpieces. It will be almost impossible. The director undoubtedly had a major influence on the film. A simple movie about disaster (boring watching) has transformed into incredible romance. Yes, I'm not Roman type, but that should not bother you because you will never see this romance. Guaranteed! Everything in amazing effects, into music, into exquisite acting. <br /> <br /> The film creates an amazing visual and wonderful feeling. Everything looks very real and vivid. The legend "TITANIC" itself is greatly displayed in all classes, it looks too, even accommodation. The act was a real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are just the best in playing there. No one could do better. They are partly the reason why the movie is so great. <br /> <br /> I think he does not talk much about it. The story is simple, acting is great, based on a true story. Probably more than half of the consumers who watch the movie will share tears, thanks to an unprecedented end that can never be forgotten. Well, if you did not see this movie, you did not forget something Hesterical and a movie that would become a model for Hollywood. It could be better? Not at all. The most moving film of all time, do not listen to people, look for yourself, then you will understand. Landmark. (Do not be surprised if you cry too)
