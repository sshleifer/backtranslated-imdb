This film rewrites the history of the film in every direction. Nobody cares about what anyone thinks about this movie because it goes beyond criticism. Every mistake in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has experienced. It's an extremely beautiful film and I doubt many of us will see something like that. I've seen it a lot more than I've been trying to count on, and I'm still trying to persuade myself, with feelings that are hard to describe. One for ages.
