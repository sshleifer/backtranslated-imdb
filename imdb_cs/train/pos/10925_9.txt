I really like this movie. I can watch it regularly and I do not have to bother it. I suppose this is one of my criteria for a great movie. The story is very interesting. It represents 6 characters; everyone has a unique kung-fu style that is very secret and very deadly. Each of these characters is trained by the same master, but their identity remains secret. The dying master sends the 6th poison, his last disciple, to try to repair the bad things he suspects some of his students have committed. How will the last pupil find other poisons? How will he know which one is wrong? The way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie great. We also get to see poisons fighting each other in every combination. It's fun to see how their styles match each other. <br /> <br /> To find out if you love kung fu movies, it's a good movie that begins. Nothing better than this.
