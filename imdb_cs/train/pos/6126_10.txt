I saw Jack Frost at 4:00 at my local store and I thought it looked pretty good for a low budget movie so I bought it and I was right that it was good. To begin with, this movie is about a murderous snowman, so laughing something and the way to look is fun compared to the snowman on the cover. <br /> <br /> The performance was fine and the Jack Frost lines told me that I was laughing: "I just made you smoke" and "The world's most destroyed the snowballs", how funny it is and the camp? The story at the beginning was quite funny and stupid. "Jack was so busy, Jack was fast, Jack wrinkled his eyes with candles." If you're looking for the horror of B-Movie Comedy, which is a full pun, check Jack Frost. 10/10
