This is the best Chinese movie I've ever seen and, in my opinion, is much better than a hero or a chirping tiger, a hidden dragon. The film is a unique combination of several genres: It's a beautiful love story, action movie, comedy and horror at the same time. And the most amazing thing is that it really succeeds in all of these! <br /> <br /> This movie definitely makes it to my top 5, and it should be enjoyable for any movie lover. Action sequences have traditional unrealistic jumps and even flying, but the way they are shot differs from the style of Hero and years always look great and usually make sense (ghosts can fly) <br /> <br /> Look at this film, you will not regret it. 10/10
