Another very good Man's film, thanks to the combination of father and son Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart. Brennan (Ben Tatum) is often a comedy consort either Stewart or Wayne (Red River / Rio Bravo). He's there to see the younger man take a fork or bend. "You're wrong with Mr. Dunston." Jeff Webster (Stewart) gives the impression that he cares only about himself, but it is clear he can not leave Brennan. John McIntire is excellent as the Skagway law, with due respect for the rule of justice over his reality. Another key issue is to help people and people help them. The enthusiast can not do it and suffers for it. The title above is based on Tatum's claim that she can not live without coffee. This addiction to nicotine is fatal. Probably the first and last time on the screen. I recommend this movie and now own a DVD.
