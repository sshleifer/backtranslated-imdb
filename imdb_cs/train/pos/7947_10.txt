I've been watching this movie so many times that I've gotten over a baby hood that I can make the whole of this dialogue up to this day. And when I look at it, it's just happy and amazingly laughing. I think it's amazing how they have trained animals, especially cats, to the extent they can play the lead role of feature film. I watch it now, but unfortunately I notice that it was not a masterpiece, as I thought. But I'd rather remember how I felt when I was younger when I watched her on the VHS on my flip-top television that would make the picture look yellow. And since it is a children's film, I would definitely give it 10/10.
