Oh, why? "Six Degrees" is a showcase of this so-called Theory that we are all connected to someone. If I focus on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions. When I first heard about this show, it did not catch any attention at all. It seemed too ordinary. Then I saw some episodes ... and he loved it! First, characters. All are well written and different from each other. She is an alcoholic addict, a woman whose fianc√©e cheats on her, a woman who has just lost her husband, a driver who has a troubled brother, and so on ... In contrast to what we are used to, most of the characters interact with one another in the sacrifice, as in our everyday routines. Great! My most favorite are Mae, Carlos and Whitney. <br /> <br /> Then it is cast. Everyone is great. Jay Hernandez, from "Hostel", shows here his acting skills in a more 3D character than his previous work as Paxton. The others are doing great performances, especially Campbell Scott, starring Steven and Bridget Moynahan, who plays Whitney. Well, when I came to IMDb, after watching some episodes, I could not believe it was canceled. Seriously, I can not understand low ratings. It's bad that it did not have more than one season. It would be a great show to follow!
