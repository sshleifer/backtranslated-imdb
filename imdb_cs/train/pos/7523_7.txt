I saw this movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2006, and it's a film and not a movie, because HBO was probably shot to appear in the cable network this year. This film presents the site as a slave and discipline fetish expedition and a B & D riding actress who has had enough talents to become a real actress. The site was a bit more than that, and the film touches some of its other role in modeling, but it is not enough to balance the career of the fifteenth icon. This film is allegedly based on the book "The Real Bettie Page" by Richard Foster. He is shot in black and white for nostalgia in the 1950s. I have a book titled "Bettie Page Life of a Pinup Legend," which has a lot of great pictures of the site's career and I have to say that this film is reproduced in the film with Gretchen Mol as Page, many of these famous photos are very accurate. Molly's black wig and brown contact lenses Bettie Page is Bettie Page. Not only does she have the look of Bettie Page, but she has the perfect smile and characteristics of her personality who went through the camera. And her body is as close to replica pages. Great casting. The story is a bit thin and tabloid and definitely could be much better. But it's a pretty good TV movie. I would rate it 7.0 scale 10 and recommend it to be displayed when it comes to television.
