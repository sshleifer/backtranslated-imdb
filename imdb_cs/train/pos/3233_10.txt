This is the finest Finnish film this year, though Tango Kabaree is coming. Director Lampela made a few years back another beautiful little film called Rakastin ep√§toivoista naista (I was in love with a desperate woman). Joki is really a true beautiful one-Saturday afternoon shot in a small village / town. Actors may not be as cute or beautiful, but they do beautiful. I certainly hope that many will receive a statue of JUSSI (Finnish OSCAR) in the spring. I think this movie could do it abroad.
