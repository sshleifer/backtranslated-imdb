This movie is really great. Every thing seems to come from a comic book. sets, costumes, and plots are great. Clark Bartram is once again our favorite batman. He looked a bit better at the bad end, but he still pulled it out. Superman is also great. flying effects are fine. but it's a fan-film, so we can not expect them to be the biggest. the shot with the superman catching the vehicle was very plausible. it was okay. It's a movie that would surely see if it was real. has everything you want in the batman / superman movie. but one exception I would throw joker instead of 2-face ..... overall I give this movie 10 because it's a great movie.
