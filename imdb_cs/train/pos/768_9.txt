Cinematically this film smells. Likewise, he does a lot of acting. But I do not care. If there is a strong expression of what was 80 years like (for many of us inland) and what kind of hip-hop, Zulu nation and dance break was really like. Great music, great <br /> <br /> Dance! It almost seems to be a hip-hop musical style. It is also interesting to see New, which looks like a zero point from a nuclear attack. Some viewers may be too young to remember that in the 70s and 80s it was a poor city running <br /> <br /> This is the best of all dance films that came out of this time around hip-hop / break. Of course, the 80's are considered to be a joke with all the bad TV series and films, but those of us who have lived will always remember that while the music, dance and graffiti were fresh , Yeah!
