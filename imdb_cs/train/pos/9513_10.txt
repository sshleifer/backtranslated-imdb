Big gangster film. Sam Mendes directs this beautiful film, which shows another father-son comradeship. Brilliant star cast with Tom Hanks (Michael Sullivan) did a great job. Great acting. It's an acting legend. also works by Paul Newman, Jude Law and Daniel Craig. Kasting is just too good. The plot is quite good. Enjoy the movie. A gorgeous depiction of the 1930s gangster. Set in the 1930s, it certainly stands out as the zenith of all the gangster films of that time. Music is pretty good and good for the movie. A big movie in what shows what father does to protect his son. I underestimated that I liked it.
