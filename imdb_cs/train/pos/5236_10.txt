This stylish sophisticated visual game features a story in the story. The protagonist is screenwriter Bart Klever, who constantly struggles with his new text? which is also the scenario of the movie we are watching. In the film Bart plays a screenwriter writing a film script? Bart's fight with the text becomes a narrative topic, just like the environment in the apartment where he works and cares about his little girl. The intimate environment offers plenty of opportunities for illusion games including space, light, color and a few cats. The simple world of space is further complicated by the unstable dimensions of the text, which is constantly influenced by a filmmaker's intervention that appears on a computer monitor and serves as a contrast to an environment that can be altered similarly. The ever-changing viewing angle complicates the answers to the questions that arise: What is "truth" and what "illusion"? Which of the watched worlds is primary and better than others? Can something work as a basic landmark in narrative space?
