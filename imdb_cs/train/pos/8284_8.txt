This is one of those unique horror films that require a much more advanced understanding of the word "horror" to be appreciated. The most important thing is that people can not realize that this story is told from a small boy's perspective and, like most younger children, they are easily scared. Especially because he simply does not understand things like why his father is never for him. From watching the movie, you can see that the husband is arguing with his wife about the balance between working and family time and you can easily understand it, but the little boy is not. Also, one can imagine that a boy is afraid of forests, as it is at the beginning of the film, that the family comes from the city. Also at the beginning, when the family travels to the house, they hit the deer, then rise, then fight with the locals, and the little boy certainly did not find this introduction to the forest pleasant at all. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is finally what his young, innocent mind develops to explain it. There is an American Indian legend, but when I look at the scene that a young boy hears, it is explained to him as blunt and simplistic. Not because it's Wendigo, it's because he understands it. When you look at the film from this point of view, you can truly appreciate it. Obviously, it was a low budget and cheap shot, but jumping assemblies, use of light, and total excitement more than to compensate. And the final question the film is asking is: is it all in the head or is it really out there? 8/10 <br /> Rated: nausea, violence and sexual scene
