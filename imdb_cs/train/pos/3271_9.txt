I've always been a great fan of this movie, you first saw the cast, playing is excellent, and it helps move the movie very well. Cybill Shepherd has won a great award for her role and was well-deserved. The beginning of this movie begins in the past when Corinne Jeffries (Cybill), whose perfect marriage comes to a breakable stop when her husband Louie unexpectedly dies. Fortunately, Louse gets his second life when he agrees to be "recycled" back to the ground like newborn Alex Finch (Robert Downey, JR). Alex continues in her new life as she forgets her past life while Corinne tries to continue with her. But fate goes on the path of Alexa 23 years later when he meets Corinne's daughter Miranda (Mary Stuart Masterson) and suddenly is flooded with a lot of unwanted memories (that's where fun begins and embarrassing situations happen.) Music is great and scenes the hearts feel and very cute. You will not be disappointed if you give him a chance, you will like it. Very funny and sweet!
