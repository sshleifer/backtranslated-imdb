it's amazing that so many people I know have not seen this little jewel. I all turned to it returned with the same response: What a great movie !! I've never really cared about Brad Pitt (though his twists in 12 monkeys and the Fight Club show improvement), but his performance in this movie as a psycho is disturbing, dark and straight on the target. <br /> <br /> Everybody else in the movie gives great performances and the slow and deliberate motion of the movie has greatly enhanced the management. the sense of horror for characters is steadily rising when they realize what's really going on. The only thing that keeps it from ten in my book is that, compared to what came before him, the end is a bit too long and exaggerated. but that's the only fault I could find in this classical cult. <br /> <br /> If you check this movie, try to get the least chance of viewing mailboxes without evaluation. rating: 9
