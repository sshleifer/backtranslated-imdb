I give it 10 out of 10 points. I love it so much. I am a child of the 1980s and completely into heavy metals for many years. That's why I like this movie so much. It's so cool that he saw the posters in the bedroom of that boy (Judas Priest, Lizzy Borden, Raven, Twisted Sister ...) and his vinyl collections (revealing thieves by Exciter, Rise of Mutants by Champion Champion Impaler and Killing is my Megadeth business) . Also, the FASTWAY soundtrack is absolutely incredible and fits pretty well. If you are on metal then TRICK or TREAT your friend. Do not buy or watch this movie for OZZY or GENE SIMMONS because they are in the movie for a few seconds, watch it because soundtrack and a story that takes you back to the glory of the 80s. Then you will not be the same person.
