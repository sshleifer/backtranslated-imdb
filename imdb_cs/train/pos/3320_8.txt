I like this movie, cute and funny. I have found that this film is a good family film. The dirtiest part of this film was when he made references to the New York Yankees. You have to be in the Red Sox nation to understand that NY Yankees is a dirty word.Sorry to say that Yankee fans.I recommend this picture for the whole family.Of course with your typical love / comedy film there's a long moment in the movie, I'm in love and what I'm doing, but the movie looks at it with all the terrible moments. The movie show is a few moments when fans in the Red Sox (in Fenway Park) felt about 86 years of Sox, who always scrambled at the end of the season, and how love for Sox and love with another man goes hand in hand.
