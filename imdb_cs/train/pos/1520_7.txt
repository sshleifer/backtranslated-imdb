Four stories written by Robert Bloc about the different people who live in a beautiful old manor and what happens to them. The first is Denholm Elliott as a writer who sees the killer he is writing about, a revival. Some scary moments and twisting at the end were good. The other is that Peter Cushing becomes obsessed with a wax figure resembling his dead wife. The third is Christopher Lee, who has a baby (Chloe Franks) and is afraid of her. It all leads to a pretty scary end (although the end of the story was much worse). The last is a comedy outside with Jon Petwee and Ingrid Pitt (both chew the landscape) and crying that turns people into vampires! There is also a cute line about Christopher Lee, who plays Dracula. This is a good horror anthology - nothing terrifying, but the first and the end third gave me some nice frosts. Also the fourth is really fun and Pitt makes a very sexy vampire! Also, the house looks beautiful ... and very haunted. It is well controlled with some pleasant atmospheric touches. Very good and unusual movie scores too. Overall, this is a good little horror anthology that is worth looking for. Try to see it on DVD - Lions Gate looks fantastic with strong colors and great sound.
