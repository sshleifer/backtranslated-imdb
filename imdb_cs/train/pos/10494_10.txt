An excellent view of a mature woman who loses everything (even pruner has a mortgage). The way he engages in this special "business," innocence and real love that exists among people in a small town is perfectly blended to bring us a fresh, light and fun comedy. I could not stop laughing with a very fun scene of two old doses in the drugstore. I love European films and movies like this, my opinion is growing stronger. The film, which I also recommend with eyes closed, is in the same genre of Waking Ned Devine. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace, a comedy that many friends liked just like me. You will be glad.
