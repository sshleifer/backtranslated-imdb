Gregory Peck gives great performance in this movie. The last 15 minutes (or there) are great and Peck is an absolute joy to watch. The same thing, however, can not be said for the rest of the film. It's not terrible, and I'm sure it was done with good intentions, but the only real reason (if I should be honest) to see it is Peck. For the rest, you are better than reading the Old Testament.
