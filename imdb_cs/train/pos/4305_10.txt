Grand Canyon is a very special bird. It is a totally unique urban area where the relationship of the whole land would fail. <br /> <br /> It's a central theme that seems to be an inherent uncertainty that applies to people of all races, backgrounds and stations. But to say that the subject of the film will seriously underestimate its scope. Likewise, chewing on a particular genre is unnecessary. Although the film has volumes, though probably different volumes for each viewer, it says everything in such an inaccurate way from many angles that I can not even definitively define its central message for myself. Yet it is a business with such laser precision; every element, a variety of dialogues and a bar of background music contribute to his ubiquitous mood and a strong message that I am pleasantly surprised and very thoughtful after each play. He still does not feel at all. A sparkling film with great occupation and everything that works.
