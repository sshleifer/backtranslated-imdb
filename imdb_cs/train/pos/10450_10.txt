It was a coincidence that I was scanning TV channels and I found this wonderful film about two beautiful human beings that attract each other with a very innocent and virginal attitude towards each other. Ethan Hawke (Jesse) "Tape" '01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) "ER" 94 television series (Nicole). This gal and guy will warm your heart and soul and make you think deeply about your past relationships and how you really want to watch your heart string with the guy or the fool you loved and lost in the past. Jesse and Celine have great conversation and deep eye contact with a large magnetic explosion between the two. I look forward to SEQUEL for this film in 2004 and if you viewed this movie you will feel the same way.
