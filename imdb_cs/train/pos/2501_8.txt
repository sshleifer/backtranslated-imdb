I'm a fan of both actors and singers, especially Gackt, and when I first discover this movie and watch the trailer, I think it's stupid. After a long wait, I finally watched it and here's my comment. . I think everyone knows the story and does not mention it, instead, my first applause goes to acting, generally that Japanese movies are not brilliant and acting. Yet in MoonChild's cast is simply fabulous and came into it, especially Gackt reflects his characters emotion and changes quite well, I like many of his scenes as dramatic and humorous as the HYDE part, his acting is good but deliberately stays in background as an actor, like his character I'm doing all over the movie. I did not like some cinemas, especially lighting and some colors, but because of a small budget, it still has brilliant moments, but the real jewel of the film is a story. He has a few moments of affection, but it's ok for me and the film's friendship theme is really well developed and touches sometimes, on the other hand the story points to a cruel world that no one guarantees life, and with some unforgettable death scenes it reflects this subject on visuals. An interesting note is that this film has some similarities with an excellent vampire Interwiew with a vampire who also plays the most beautiful (not handsome, beautiful) American cinema actors, in fact Moon Child is somehow seen as a brother with Interwiew but original on his own. The only problem that MoonChild is sometimes I'm slow, I'm a Japanese film fan and I got used to it but it's not a change MoonChild has some useless scenes or characters. But all this, this movie is really good and very emotional sometimes as for the actors / duo singers I hope to see their next movies in the future and I recommend it to anyone who likes vampire-action sci-fi and romantic movies 8/10
