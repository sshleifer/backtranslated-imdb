Road to Perdition, an undeservedly overlooked film this year Oscars is the second work of Sam Mendes (and in my opinion his best work), a director who had won the Oscar for his highly acclaimed but controversial American beauty three years earlier. It's a terrific movie, and it's finally noisy and sad. It is a story of a relatively rich and happy family from an outward appearance during difficult times of depression when Michael Sullivan, the father of two children played by great Tom Hanks (I'm not his admirer, but he has to say) is a hitman for the local mafia boss, Paul Newman. His eldest son, Thirteen-year-old boy Michael Sullivan Jr., who perfectly played young Tyler Hoechlin, after years of bliss of ignorance, finds out what his father's job is and what his family is living. He calls for his curiosity and the desire to know the truth that he happens to be a witness to the murder committed by John Rooney, the son of his father's boss. Such discovery hits the innocent soul and causes numerous events that have changed his life forever. The atmosphere of the season, all backgrounds and decorations are perfectly crafted, editing and cinematography are almost flawless, while the story is well written. But the main line of the film, the most important moments and points of the film, and the key success factor of the film are the difficult father-son relationships in bad times. They act so deeply, strongly and credibly. Tom Hanks is doing excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a rather unusual role for him and all acting overboard is excellent. Finally, it is worth mentioning a very nice score from Paul Newman and the result is the excellent work of all the people who are involved in making this beautiful (but still more sad) masterpiece. I believe the Path of Corruption is one of the greatest successes of the film this decade and is undoubtedly one of the best films of the year. <br /> <br /> My rating 10 out of 10
