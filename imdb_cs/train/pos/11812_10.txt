These movies are the best movie you can watch in a comic book. Sets, costumes, and color are so lively that they are like a comic book. This is the movie I think about when talking about Mobi, about suits, hats and attitudes. <br /> <br /> Hoffman gives comic relief as Mumbles and you can not help but regret Madonna when he tries and fails to win Tracy. This film contains all the classic mob clich√©s - to bury people in concrete, blow up folk cars, join a good guy and try to blow up his girlfriends' house in the air. This movie is classic in every sense word, even cameras angels screaming comic book. It's so great that I can go back to the older movie and see that someone knew what a comic movie should be when it saw flaws like Spawn and Hulk. <br /> <br /> MUST SEE THIS FILM !!!!
