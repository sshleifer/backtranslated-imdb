Besides being one of the few films I've ever had (bye-bye manhood), it's one of the finest Indian movies ever made. From finely crafted sets, to those scary looks that Meena Kumari gives, no one ever forgets it. The Pakeezah music is amazing, the more you can understand the sublime poetry, and it's definitely one of those movies "OMG, 5 minutes another song". You will get a sense of how Sahibjaan is trapped among all the amazing jewels he wears and culminating in the yard that passes by. <br /> <br /> Parody of all the dreams you've ever had ..... .....
