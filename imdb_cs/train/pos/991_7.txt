I was really shocked when I saw the number of reviews that tell the story. This film was not meant to be a film of "deep thinking," which is apparently the vast majority of reviewers. In fact, it would seem that if ANY movie does not create life, changing insights, and a deep, twisted, imaginative witty conspiracy, they will rate 1 or 2. Do not throw away the movie because you do not like the genre, people. <br /> <br /> This movie was an action / comedy movie and that's all it was supposed to be. And for action / comedy it was very well done. I was really surprised that I enjoyed it the same way I did, because I had never been a fan of Jamie Foxx and he had such a used land he has. a typical criminal gets out of jail and throws himself in a bad boy as he tries to clean up his act (see Blue Streak, Hudson Hawk, 48 hours etc., etc.), but it was heated up a bit of technological intervention. Now "bad guys" are really "good guys" and REAL "bad guy" is uber-geek. In fact, Jamie Foxx plays a compelling, humorous, at the same time intelligent and serious character, and did not try to exaggerate the humor of the film. If you're looking for a deep background like "The Matrix" or a drama like "Of Mice and Men," then this movie is not for you. But if you like a raw experience, great movie with a fast pace and occasional blast of humor, this movie will not disappoint you. Normally, I would throw him around 8 (on the same level as the Die Hard Trilogy), but instead I gave him 10 to try to score the score to what he should be. <br /> <br />
