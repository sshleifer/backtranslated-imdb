We're still using Black Adder. Imagine that Rowan Atkinson continues as an assistant to the Prime Minister, played by the magnificent Hugh Laurie. Hugh is sensational as a stupid assistant George Prince and Edmund. I like the episode guest of Kenneth Connor as the British thespian. Every time Edmund Macbeth says. Two writers are doing stupid steps to turn away evil spirits. These are the most fun things you will see. Of course, none of these brilliant and comedic geniuses could be without Ben Elton and Richard Curtis, who are also behind movies like Love, Thin Blue Line, Four Weddings, and Burial. Black Adder is fun and almost too good for television. Humor can be smart, sexy and fun. I was hoping last night that Saturday night that Hugh Laurie would give his tribute to British humor. If the SNL group did some research, they knew what treasure Hugo Laurie had to have the charm of their scene.
