The man with weapons is now forgotten, but in 1955 he caused a small storm of media interest when Robert Mitchum rejected Jett Rink in the Giant (which was actually written for him and subsequently substantially redesigned) and the intended Charles and Laughton versions of naked and dead to that place. Despite some obvious production problems and harsh illumination occasionally caused by Mitch and Jan Sterling in non-threatening tones, this is an amazing dark west that is more than a comparison with its former blood on the moon when its "bourgeois" set the work on the city that never did not have the chance to grow up before they got to run away from the local bad guys before they showed up? maybe ?? to be almost as bad as the men they broadcast. Surely his way of dealing with news about family death? burned the salon to the ground and let his manager try to kill him? does not inspire great confidence in its stability. Like a good script and surprisingly good support from Henry Hulla's usually tedious, but well-played Henry Hulla, he also boasts a surprisingly good initial Alex North score that even includes an early exercise for one of his terrible emotional impulses later in Spartacus.
