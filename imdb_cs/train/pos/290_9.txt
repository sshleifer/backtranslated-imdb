Edmund Burke said, "All bad things are good for me to do nothing." Hollywood often gives us baskets because few families are going to see quality movies. This film was an uplifting story about the loss and restoration of faith. He had no violence, no contempt, and did not deserve a PG rating. The western scenery was well shot and some views were simply breathtaking. The actors were a bit young on their part, but otherwise believable and talented. The musical score was too loud, and in some places the dialogue was completely drowned. I am rarely surprised by the end of the films, but I was pleasantly surprised by this. Sometimes good guys win and win with honest effort. We liked the film and the report and would recommend it to the whole family.
