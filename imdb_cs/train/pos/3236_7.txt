Half a dozen stories about different interests will illuminate us about life in Finland. These stories are intertwined and each has a scene in which the boom sound is heard. This means that events are displayed at the same time. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a bungy jump that promises some excitement, but early stories are relatively low. The film improves to hold it. Two broken marriages in the stories that follow, provide a lot of drama, while the scene in the hospital gives us a patient who is finally sick, asking for relief from the pain. The last time with his wife is both convincing and moving. While different scenes of family life take place in Finland, topics are of a general nature, wherever you live. <br /> </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p>
