This film took a lot of wand. He was criticized when he came out and was accused of spoiling Nicolas Cage's career. A thing I do not think people get is that it's not supposed to be epic, an Oscar-winning filmmaker, it's just some great action "Bruck-Buster" at its best. Fast cars, fast editing and great soundtrack - does exactly what it says on a can. Also, for anyone who likes cars, it's pure healing. She has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, Hummer and do not forget about Eleanor! I think you would try to find a better action movie and a personally better movie! Then maybe it's just me!
