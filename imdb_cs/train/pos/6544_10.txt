I really enjoyed this movie! Even though it was nothing like any of the books, it remains a classic Nancy Drew style. I've seen a lot of ads for this movie and since I was really into Nancy Drew's books I really had high expectations for this film and they definitely met these expectations. Pretty much of all the characters were exactly as I imagined them from reading books. I'm really glad to see this movie. All the actors and actresses really acted as if they were acting like a series of books. Since I've seen the movie I wanted to read every Nancy Drew's book, it's out there. All the actors and actresses really got into their characters and it definitely turned out when they were broadcasting this movie on the big screen. Certainly it seemed that all the actors and actresses were really in the positions that were in those figures, I will definitely give this film ten out of ten.
