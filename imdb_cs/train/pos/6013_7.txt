Watching it again after a long time and remembering the flop it was during its original release, I am surprised at how well it kept it. One reason for his failure was that one generation only thought he was over shameful bulls, and the younger one was disappointed not to show the full hippy glory. It is clear that Antonioni was already aware and fascinated by the heady mix of exciting enthusiasm for change and a lacking clear vision for the future. The lead couple is excellent and it is disgraceful that so many flakes have failed in film perception. They are ideal and perfectly surrender to different opposites and show pure joy of loving. I blame others for too much emphasis on student revolt sequences at the beginning, but I have to say that from here it is one of the directors of the most beautiful looking images and surely got the best of man and natural landscapes. And I did not even mention a highly explosive end.
