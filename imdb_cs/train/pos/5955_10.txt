As a creator of "This Darkness," I admit that we have neglected 3 very important confirmations in our final credits. The omissions were shows that could not be repaired once, nor did the parties who saw the movie mention it at that time. On behalf of the excellent cast and crew of the film, I apologize to them. Obviously, some of the criticisms that are being published here are harsh because their credit is a coincidence. Our production values ​​were negligible and our "special effects" were quite odd, but the conspiracy is very strong and cinematography John McLeod is excellent. We hope that you, the reader, will enjoy "This Darkness" and the effort of those who have freely divided their backs. Thank you, Dylan O'Leary, Director.
