This movie is just amazing. It was a very sensitive affair and the film was excellent. This film did not create any discussion in India (as far as I know) and its publicity was also kept low. Originally, I thought that this film would simply be a waste of time because most Indian directors and producers changed the subject, although it is very sensitive and adds a love story in the original story and spoils the whole thing ... most Indian viewers would be on the subject Do not forget Ashoka, Mangal Pandey, LOC etc. <br /> <br /> In India, there were so many films that would become a milestone or mega hits if part of the love story was not added unnecessarily. <br /> <but his treatment is quite similar to Pinjar's movie (he also has to watch). If it counts, I would like to thank Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (the director) for making such a great movie ..
