For those of you who have read the highly acclaimed novel by Rohinton Mistry, this movie will surely impress you because it's an honest adaptation. With the exception of one smaller subplot, Sturly Gunnarson's feature-length debut is almost dead-on book recreation (down the last line). For those of you who have not read a novel, this movie can be a little complicated. It's definitely not a big movie story. Instead, he has a strong element of realism for him, but I would not have it any other way. The best way to describe such a long way to fans of the film would be to say that it is a Hindu version of "Fiddler On The Roof". Instead of Jewish / Russian milk, protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker in 1970 in Mumbai at a time of Muslim / Hindu war with Pakistan. He is forced to solve a number of unexpected problems in his life, including his ill daughter, his individualistic oldest son, a distant friend who makes him engage with some dirty money and unhealthy surroundings. The end is not happy or sad, but that's basically what realism requires. <br /> <br /> Such a long journey is a fine little movie, but if you want to see it, then it's good luck. Unlike the novel, it gets very little release.
