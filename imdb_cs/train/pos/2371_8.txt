I suggested that he bring this film to my friend and he was obliged because he saw the movie and said he was fine. I thought the title was a little camp because the version in our store was called "Fear: Halloween Night." I was expecting this movie to be some Halloween that would have gone away with a wooden killer. But he opened up with a good scene and the killer instantly murdered two victims and experienced twenty years later when his son who witnessed the killing of two people (including his mother) and even witnessed father suicide, forests with his friends and girlfriend where he tries to face his fears until a wooden statue revives his father's spirit. Good enough to continue, and I've never seen the first.
