When Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck, who just gets entertained) slipped into the life of her father (... and the speculating waitress) who dies in the explosion, she makes her way through the branches inside a bank business in the big city of Gotham. When it comes to murdering a lover who was supposed to be his next father-in-law (and Lily's new lover), the sky is the limit for Lily as she wrote her various diary relationships, and the gentleness made it clear that papers would be accepted if a certain wage did not enter hers . Newly appointed bank president, Courtland Trenholm (George Brent), sends Lily to Paris instead of whipping lots of dough, but soon after falling asleep in the City of Love, he falls in love. This causes Lily to be the mouth of water as soon as she reaches the bottom of the success of the seduction of a man of wealth and prestige brings wealth her way. Still, there are circumstances that make it a decision that threatens its successful way of achieving that wealth. Trenholm, now her husband, is charged with a jail and lost the bank. He needs the money that Lily has in his possession, or he will have absolutely nothing. Stanwyck is the whole film despite the usual gloss of Warner Brothers. Being set up in front of the code gives creators an opportunity to process taboos, such as a woman who uses sex to achieve success, and how it can lead to tragedy. A good direction from Alfred E Zelena shows through subtle hints in different ways and speech through a good deal of seductive performance by Stanwyck, how to do something without actually showing clear action. Apparently the film shows that money is not everything and everything that jazz as love comes to the heart of Lily's dead heart. The fact that Lily has achieved miraculous metamorphosis in someone who's in love did not believe me. She spent all this time before she got to this platform just to fall for a man who did not really differ from the others she used before him.
