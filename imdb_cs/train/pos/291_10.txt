Zombie Chronicles is not a shouting thing, it's obvious that it's not an award-winning film, but it's a fun movie B directed by Brad Sykes, who directed Camp Blood, which was another fun low budget. Actor is bad as most cheaply made movies, but that's what makes it fun, zombie make-up is cool and effective especially with budget, gore is also great and rough, the movie is something like a zombie version of Tales by Crypt, because we got two stories about zombie encounters in the woods, the stories are fun and let you guess the first story first. Zombie Chronicles is much better than any low budget zombie movies out there if you love low budget B-movies or cheap zombie flicks then check out the Zombie Chronicles.
