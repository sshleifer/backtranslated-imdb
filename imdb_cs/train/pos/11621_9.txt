One night I was bored and Red Eye was thinking why not. Red Eye is one of the best movies for a long time. I mean, I just got the movie is the reason it was so great. The story is new and different. The film also has two great trips in the film with Rachel McAdams as Lisa Reisert and Cillian Murphy as Jackson Rippner. Actor acting is just brilliant and you get a feel for the people in the movie. Music is simply superb, it gives you warmth and can also feel relaxed. <br /> <br /> I just love how the film was so well done and never bored. <br /> <br /> The red eye is simply phenomenal. Nothing more and nothing less. <br /> <br /> It's a great thriller. <br /> <br /> Overall, I like Red Eye so much that I can watch it over and over again. <br /> </ p> <p> If you like Red Eye, then I recommend Elektra and Cry Wolf. <br /> <br /> I give Red Eye 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Great movie
