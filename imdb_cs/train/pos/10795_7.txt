Ooverall, the movie was pretty good, a good action plot with quite a number of explosions and fighting scenes, but Chuck Norris did nothing but bomb disarm and shoot several characters. The film was very similar to the events of September 11, when a terrorist who is loaded as a bin sent the video to the president (Urich) and threatens to fire him. Judson Mills had some great acting roles, pulling out Rashid's role and various roles, but Chuck Norris was missing. Judson took over most of the action, so Joshua (chuck) with Que on his computer. But overall, it was realistic and it was not missing, but it was on the side of Mr. Norris. I gave the film 7/10.
