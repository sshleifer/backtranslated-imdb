Do not be fooled by silly titles, it's a sweet ride! The true successor of Tetsuo Iron Man and Ichi the Killer, this jewel begins with a bang and the fat head is stretched to the lap. Aliens seem to take over human bodies and adjust them to war machines, which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game for fun of their kind. The winner of the battle is alive losers. This is mostly a conspiracy, but who cares when the gore is so good? I do not know how many buckets were used, but it's disgusting to see. There is an interesting and effective use of stop-motion when taking over and loving care is devoted to all creatures and make-up effects. The CGI is a little limited, but it does not actually aggravate the overall quality of a single battle, at least for me. It was a really fun and stomach movie that deserves a lot of praise and really deserved its place in the Cult Classics pile. Find it and watch it, you will not be disappointed!
