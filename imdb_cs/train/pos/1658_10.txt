If you saw this movie, you were in Puerto Rico. I have lived in Puerto Rico for all my life and I have to admit that we (PR) are real chaos right now because drugs are the main reason for the shootings and killings that we have almost every day. These people shoot everyone, anytime, anywhere, and many innocent lives have been lost. We do not feel safe anymore, and so our so-called "Justice" is no longer affected by truth and correctness, but by money, influence and power. "Ladrones y Mentirosos" is based on real, pitiful facts and actually portrays the three major problems of Puerto Rico: the killing of drugs, money and power that manipulate our courts, and innocent people and children are damaged and even dying for this. Ricardo and his wife Poli with their realistic conspiracy and award-winning direction (**) were so brave that it all proved to be bad: Puerto Rico is a beautiful and friendly country that lives with a nightmare that does not seem to end! ** Recently, they won the Copper Wing Award for Best Director of the World Cinema Competition at the Phoenix Film Festival in 2006.
