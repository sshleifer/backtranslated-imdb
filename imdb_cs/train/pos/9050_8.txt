This is a jewel, a real piece of Americans for all that it means. If you are able to resist "life stories", stay away and leave all those who still believe. And what's really great about the cake is the fact that it's a reality based on a real story about rags and riches, there's no need to choose what details have changed to create a compact story. Chris Cooper is one of the greatest live actors and a complicated, obviously conflicting, bottom line of good at the core he portrayed could be successfully brought out by someone with his skill and insight. Simple comments, if they refuse to accept a father who attempts to set the law, and at the same time felt that he might be out of the line, reveals the limitations of the commentator, not the writers or the actors. This is not for cynics, nor for simple minded.
