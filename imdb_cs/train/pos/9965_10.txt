Ideal for families with young children who are looking for bright, non-violent films that are breathtaking and fun for the child, even if they are furious, adults. It's not a bad film to work with a low budget. Children will be overwhelmed by the work of Santa and "spell", which will allow him to enter home with chimneys that seem to be too small or houses that have no chimneys at all! <br /> <br /> The kids will be excited about Santa's success by defeating the ugly devil named Pitch (complete in classic red dress with horns and tail!). They will sympathize with the poor little girl who is the greatest desire to have a little doll to love. And the poor little rich boy who wishes to spend time with his forever absent parents. And what does a child know at school, who are just like the unfortunate boys who are put on the pitch to help capture Santa and destroy Christmas? Eventually everyone, including the unfortunate boys, gets what they deserve for Christmas! The film will be enthusiastic about making children and Santa and the message of love it delivers to people all over the world. /> <br />
