It was the best Muppet movie I've ever seen! I knew Miss Piggy's fantasy about meeting as a child was the cause of Muppet Babies. The songs will remain in my head forever. I said it just because the silly Nickelodeon shows Hey Dude's song still stays in my head. Sorry, a little of the topic. But what I like is Animal after the credits say "Bye Bye Bye Bye Bye Bye Bye Bye Bye Bye Hasta Luego!" It made me so laughing. My absolute favorite is the game at the end. I was surprised that the signs of Sesame Street appeared at the wedding. I'm glad this movie was very funny. I borrowed it from the library and now I buy it because I can not keep the library book forever. Finally, I declare that this is the best movie I've ever seen! In my case it's even better than Austin Powers in Goldmember, which was my favorite movie!
