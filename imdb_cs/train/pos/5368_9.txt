This is an amazing action movie with a great line from Arnie! It is stylishly made, with great tension to make you happy. The characters were amazing and Richard Dawson is very menacing as the main villain. Yes, he has lots of holes, but it's very fun, with a big end. It was also a great story, and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso had a great chemistry together. Character development was also quite good, with some outstanding performances. The director is great! Paul Michael Glaser, is doing a very good job with amazing color use, maintaining stylish style, amazing camera angles, and keeping the movie at a very fast pace! good work. He's a little gore. We get a few bloody guns, exploding heads, broken throats, slices of a bloody chain saw, corpses without skin, blood and manure. The act is great! Arnold Schwarzenegger is as amazing as ever, he's great in the actor department, he's got a lot of fun rollers, he kicks his ass, and as always he's a big physical presence! And it was fun to watch! (Arnie Rules!). Maria Conchita Alonso, she is doing well, she was really cute and had a good chemistry with Arnie! Yaphet Kotto, he's decent here, with what he has to do, which is not much. Marvin J. McIntyre, he's good as a guy, he was fine! Richard Dawson is amazing as the main villain, and he was very threatening and was watching fun. Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, Erland van Lidth, Gus Rethwisch and Professor Tor Tanak, all do what they should do very well as stalkers. Overall MUST see! **** 1/2 of 5
