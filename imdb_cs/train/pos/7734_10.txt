I saw this movie a few years ago and I have to say I really love it. Jason Patric was perfect for this strange role he played. Director? I do not have too many things about him ... and I do not know, the script is good, that's for sure. In a few words I have to say about this movie, which is weird, weird, even dark, but it's good. I saw it a few years ago and I have never seen it since. I want to see it again and again. I know I will not like watching it. Scenes, atmosphere, actors, story ... everything is good. The movie should take longer. I think 120 minutes should be perfect. I was hoping for part 2 for this movie. It was wrong. Jason Patric: You're the man! very good movie. end. :-)
