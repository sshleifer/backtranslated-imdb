It is a very rare film and probably the least known of Shirley's Temple because it is not in any of its collections. The reason why he is probably not having a happy end, unlike all his other films. musical, though she turns off one song called "The World Owes My Life". The film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white, the version I had in color and on VHS, I would say it did a great job because the color looks realistic, by contrast, I would say that Laurel and Hardy's color films, which they are horrible. The film is good for its age and the story was not at all, it surprises me that no one has attempted to do a remake. At times the film is a bit talkative as some scenes with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard look really drawn, in some scenes that it takes fifteen minutes to tell what they could say at five. Though not limited, because this movie has really good moments in it, especially when {Jerry} Ga finds that Cooper steals the necklace and conceals it in Shirley's teddy bear. The tension and slow increase in his actions, while his daughter sings to viewers in another room, is well-directed. Gary and Caroles nervous facial expressions when they are under control are also very good. In all it is a good film from the early 1930s, to accept it for his age.
