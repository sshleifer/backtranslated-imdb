Shannon Lee, daughter of Bruce Lee, adds to this exciting film in Hong Kong a martial arts martial arts action and proves that, like her late brother Brandon, she is a real chip from the old block. There is a high-tech stunt work to die for this fast move and film makers Bond should give a look if they want to spice up the action quotient of another 007 adventure because there are many innovative things here with some fresh and original second unit working to support already has high action content "AND NOW, YOU ARE DEB". Looking at the film in such a quick and fun way, you start to wonder how the cinema itself has survived before a martial art genre has been created. I am really convinced that films in general and especially action films were only time, kung fu films debuted. Bruce Lee was the father of a modern action cinema and his legitimate surviving Shannon descendants do not allow her to be the name of the family. Although there are some nice shows in this movie (Michel Wong for one), it's Shannon Lee, who remembers really spectacular performances like Mandy as a supreme hit.Well, maybe you can get away to whistle her matches!
