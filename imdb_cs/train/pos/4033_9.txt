Many reviewers have emphasized that Pinjar is unlike the production of Bollywood film productions. While it is true, Bollywood films are generally targeted at a particular audience and should be valued for achieving their goals in this respect. Pinjar, however, is an excellent film for those looking for a change from a normal film based on Bollywood's equations. At the time of division between India and Pakistan, Pinjar focuses on a Punjabi girl who becomes a victim of social and cultural attitudes to the treatment of women in their time. Para, a hero, is forced to choose between living with the man who kidnapped her and hoping for life with her family in Indian ruled Punjab. More than a Hindu and Muslim question, Pinjar deals with and defines the role of a woman as a daughter, as a wife and mother in India and Pakistan in 1947. Unlike the typical Bollywood films that are escaping in nature, Pinjar's film makes her audience to think about these issues during and after the movie.
