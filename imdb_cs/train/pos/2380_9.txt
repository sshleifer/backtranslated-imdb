I did not remember all the walks. People really went to local places. She lent the work of authenticity and the view of Martian technology to this period. I was disappointed with the consequences, especially the "Thunderchild" scene, which I consider to be one of the most interesting books. But I can not quite praise this movie because of its Wells story fidelity! It's time. The actors are nice and the performances are charming. Also, this movie is worth seeing just to hear a really great musical score by Jamie Hall. It was interesting to see the same acting game as a writer and his brother in London.
