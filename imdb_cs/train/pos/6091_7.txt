Like Ishtar and the King of Comedy, another great, misunderstood comedy, Envy has great performances by two actors who play basically, losers (it can be a very harsh word, I call them suburban noncommissioned officers). <br /> <br /> This movie was a dark comic gem and I'm not sure what people expect. I'm glad to see a great studio comedy that is not full of obvious humor, and I believe the small moments in this movie are worth it. Looking at Stiller's face, seeing a dog's dog disappear for the first time, it captures the moment, a moment that most people should recognize by themselves. Yes, it was a fairly simple story, but it was really interesting to explore the roots of envy. There were plenty of great scenes (J-man is a dilapidated "cabin by the lake", Corky's inconvenient funeral, Weitz's wife's role, and Walken's J-Man - all the great stuff. they do not have a clue what it means to be one. I'll take Envy on almost every single of the 10 greatest comedies of the year (except Napoleon Dynamite.) It's more, and an extraordinary, nice jewel. <br /> <br /> Do not forget these people;
