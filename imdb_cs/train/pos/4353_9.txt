So luck was to see this fantastic film at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. After joining the theater, we received a small testimonial that would be used to personalize the movie. Looking at the card I turned to my wife and said, "How many movies in your life do you think you can rate as excellent? Only about 5 for me." But then looking at the interaction between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser looking at the spectacular scenery in the New York film, I slowly began to hit the movies in the category at a time. Certainly it was a good but absolutely natural repoire of the actors and the award-winning performance of a man who unfortunately probably will remember a detective raincoat rather than a film, the film jumped to an excellent level. <br /> <br /> By the end of the movie, there were several dry eyes in the house, and my usually stoic and cruel hearts melted away just like Grinch and I finally made it beautiful. <br /> <br /> This image is a must for anyone who has a parent. No violence or nudity, but some strong language.
