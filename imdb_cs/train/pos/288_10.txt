This movie was so great! I'm a teenager, and I and my friends all love the series, so it just goes to show that these films point to all the age-old crowds. I recommend it to all. My favorite line in this movie is when Logan Bartholomew says "pink cheeks" when he talks about his daughter. He's such a great actor, like Erin Cottrell. They get together so well and have such a great chemistry! I really hope they can work together again. They are such attractive people and are very good actors. Finally, I found movies that are good to watch. Recently, it has been difficult to find films that are good and show good morals and Christian values. But at the same time, these films are not the same.
