I watched the Babysitter as part of BCI Eclipse 'Drive-in Cult Classics (featuring Crown International Pictures) on DVD. I think it's a very good movie. The film contains many stories in a very short time. You have hippies, rock music, cyclists, lesbians, sexual inappropriateness, extortion and murder, all in one place! <br /> <br /> Leading actors do a credible job. And I found a complicated woven conspiracy to be credible and interesting. Support for the cast, especially the bikers, however, delivers compressed performance, especially when asked to deliver lines with more than a few words. Maybe they used real bikers instead of actors. In particular, some characters were exceptionally credible. The musical score is totally dirty, for times, tempo, and for moving the story forward. I found the music as a real treat. In the introductory notes, I noticed that the film featured the music "The Food," I rode them; but he could not find anything ... In any case, George E. Carey, who wrote, produced and played in this film, had so many ideas resembled as many thoughts (a married spouse brought to redeem through trial and tribulation and little help - of course) produced and starred in "Babysitter Weekend".
