Philo Vance (William Powell) helps resolve multiple murders among the rich after the show. <br /> <br /> I usually hate exaggerated complicated mysteries (like), but I love this movie. It moves very fast (only 72 minutes), is beautifully directed by Michael Curtis (he uses tons of camera tricks to speed up the narration), has a very sophisticated storyline (including a blocked room that was unbelievable) and has a very good cast. <br /> <br /> Powell is very gorgeous and great as Vance - does not seem to be acting - it's Vance! Mary Astor does not have much to do but adds class and beauty to the production. Everyone else is also very good, but best is Eugene Pallette as Detective Heath. He is a very good actor with a very strong voice and some of his lines were merry. It's basically an excellent secret of the Hollywood murder of the 1930s. It's worth seeing. <br /> <br />
