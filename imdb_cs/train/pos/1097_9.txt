I stopped by saying, "Mr. Blandings is building his dream house" 10/10 because of the fact that the black man is a loyal servant (somewhat resembling Stepin Fetchit). But besides, the movie is a horn. Starting from middle-class New York couple Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel Blandings (Myrna Loy) are trying to build a home in Connecticut, this movie has something for everyone. Grant is his usual flippant I, while Loy is pretty good as a wife. But Melvyn Douglas adds some real laughter as Jim's and Muriel's lawyer Bill Cole, who seems to have more plans than it is clear. As for the house itself ... for most of the movie, you will probably feel ambiguous whether you want to live or not. Builders, contractors and others also give their fair share of laughter. Overall, it's a classic comedy. Also starring Louise Beavers, Reginald Denny, Sharyn Moffett, Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr.
