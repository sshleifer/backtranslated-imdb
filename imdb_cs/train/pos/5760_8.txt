My friend ordered this site for a while and finally I looked at it. That's rough. It is nice. It's pretty stupid ... but it's also a lot of fun. I think it was funny that we watched a similar movie since "City Of The Walking Dead". It was like you were back at the old Drive-In! One could tell the guy who liked this horror film with all the horror dubbed zombies. This one has all the clich√©s and tricks of those movies that are inserted into it, and it's neat because it's REALLY to be such. The cheeze factor is high, gore flowing and laughing! The effects range from hearing loss to good, where one breaks in half, and one where a guy gets his heart through his chest and both are excellent! The game is from terrible to really good. There are not many conspiracies, just a lot of gore. This pattern after zombie films from Italy and Spain I guess because they stay on rough scenes forever like this movie. If you like Troma movies, cheezy B-grade stuff, then you can not badly watch this. A nice way to waste the fifth night!
