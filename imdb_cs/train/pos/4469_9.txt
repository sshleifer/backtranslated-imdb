Usually musicals in the 1940s had the form - and if you've been studying the movies, you know what I'm talking about - a running length, a very "spectacular" performance that was great on the surface, but never got into the real personality of the character, <br /> <br /> THIS IS DIFFERENT - and the light summer is better and better for the nomination for the best picture in 1945 (although he did not have the chance to defeat the final winner - The Lost Weekend). /> <br /> Gene Kelly was probably in the best form of her career - yes I know about "Americans in Paris" and "Singing in the Rain". This is different. She really gets into her character of a "sea wolf" who thinks (first) that "lifting any girl on vacation" is nothing but a lark. And if you had to make a "story" to get it - so be it - until it is. Something similar to a musical man when he gets a "foot trapped in the door". Any cinematicity of the film comes mostly from his new attempt by a friend (Sinatry) to make the "story" good enough to "get a girl" that she really and unexpectedly falls in love with. You'll have to see the movie see what I mean. Apart from the fact that there are many other elements of great film in this, it is the classic story of the story, nostalgia for the time when the Second World War was almost over (the war ended about a month after the release of the films) that a man who always laughed about life can find out he's really a great human being, great songs, and probably even some other elements of classical film that I can not think of now. <br /> <br /> Why not 10? At the end - almost 2Â½ hours, it starts to be a bit long. It's a small ballet number that Gene Kelly does, which must have been perceived in 1945, but it seems to be dated and feeling as if it just added a few minutes. But overall, these are the clear winners at each level.
