This is one of my favorite martial arts films from Hong Kong. It is one of John Woo's earliest films and one of the few martial arts films he has directed. You can see his influences from work under Chang Cheh in this film. The action is good, a fighting choreography is being performed by Fong Hak On, which appears to be one of the best in the movie. He plays the Wei Pei fame "Five Venoms" and a number of faces known to fans of Golden Harvest and Shaw Brothers. The storyline is interesting, there are several decent twists and character building and their relationship is cleverly done. This film has only the VHS version in the UK. The Asia Media has released 3 DVDs and their DVD versions are available from the United States. The movie is beautiful to watch either in its original language or in its English-dubbed version. I highly recommend this movie.
