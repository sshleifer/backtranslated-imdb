The equestrian rider is an incredible documentary detailing the history and stories of three influential surfers with big waves, Gregg Noll, Jeff Clark and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta has done a great job for the director and should be congratulated for doing such a great job. The structure of the movie is greatly adjusted and works perfectly with filming, interviewing, animation and surfing. Music soundtrack just contributes to the overall satisfaction of watching this movie, so the Giants rider brilliantly viewing. Personal alerts include all comments from Greg Nollo about his direct French, Laird Hamilton's record at Teahupoo, and the end of the movie. But really this entire movie is one of the great, recommended peaks that are highly recommended if you can see. It is a shame that it is not known, but it is a gem that deserves attention. 10/10
