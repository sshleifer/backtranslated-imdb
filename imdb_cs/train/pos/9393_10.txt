Some movies you just know you will love from the first few seconds. That's one of those movies. In the footsteps of his roots back to "Double Compensation" and "The Poacher always circles twice" in the 1940s - it was a great example of modern Noir in the 1990s. Nick Cage plays the lead character "on his luck", who gets involved in murdering husband and wife - and his happiness goes from worse to worse when he tries and tries to get away from people, the city, violence, and the threat of Red Rock West. Lots of twists and turns, great performances from Cage, Hopper and Walsh, hypnotic guitar backgrounds and seamless overhead make it a real joy. Favorite Cage: When Cage looks at the empty gas meter in the leaving car, he shakes his head and says, "F *** in the story of my life."
