Kate Beckinsale is just as good in this movie, if not better than Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma, ​​although I really liked Gwyneth Paltrow in another version of Emma. Both are good in different ways. Kate Beckinsale, like Emma, ​​seems more interesting, almost so. And I liked the woman who played Harriet Smith better in this movie, too ... she was more faithful and sentimental. There are certain things I like in the Gwyneth Paltrow version, although it is obvious how funniest it is.
