The stopping of Jack Cassidy as Ken Frankin was absolutely brilliant. Cassidy embodied arrogance, trust, spell and joke - all with paleness, a grim smile on his face. In my opinion, Jack Cassidy is by far the best killer (who appeared three times) in the Columbo series. This particular (and first) performance is my favorite episode of Columbo sometimes - hands down. Steven Spielberg, with his new faces, has done incredible camera work (yes, several pictures of camera shadows on the pictures) that capture the nuances and jokes at different and interesting angles between Columbo and Franklin. Also panoramic and tight footage at Big Bear Lake, CA (Franklin's cabin home) was very impressive. If you have not seen this episode yet, then you owed it to you - it's a true masterpiece. Jack Cassidy was a very talented actor and singer. His charismatic personality was highly infectious. His death in 1976 at the age of 49 was very sad and very tragic - he certainly had his best years ahead. Relax in Peace of Jack, you will live forever through your great work.
