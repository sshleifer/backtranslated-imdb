I watched FIDO on a movie channel and I have to say I became an instant fan. The film feels like a comic book that perfectly captures the look and feel of surrealism of the 1950s, you know a healthy decade when you were dancing on Elvisa, while discharging nuclear bombs in the desert just for his heck. The people were so naive that it was scary and the idea that the clean carvers would find it normal that zombies like pets actually work. Kudos to this Canadian production, colorful silicon cinematography and outstanding cast, including Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Czerny and Child. It's a pity that this movie was not a bigger hit. They deserve more recognition. It's much better than things from Tim Burton or SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Oh, okay. It's an instant classic.
