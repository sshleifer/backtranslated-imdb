When I saw most of the Ringo Lama films, I can say that this is his best film, which has so far become the most unusual. It is an ancient porcelain piece full of martial arts, where the place of the underground lair is full of traps and dungeons that play a large role as some of the characters. The event is fantastic, the story is tense and fun, and the design is really unforgettable. Unfortunately, Burning Paradise was not available on DVD and vhs is another impossible to get your gloves on, even if you are close to the second largest porcelain in North America (like me). If you find it, do not forget it.
