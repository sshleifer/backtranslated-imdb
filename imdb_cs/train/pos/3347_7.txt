Robert Mitchum plays as Clint Tollinger in this short but tough western: The Man with a Gun. Tollinger is a professional burgher - as if the city needed someone to save; he is the one who is brought to do it. The latest Tollinger concert comes as an accident: Walking into the city looking for its former fling, hitting the city playing as a puppet by the local western gangster. But many residents of the city are starting to move the day they hired Tollinger, because his way of cleaning the city is becoming very taxed (suddenly, the High Plains Drifter seems to be less original). <br /> <br /> A man with a gun starts out as an average western hardcore film, but he's starting to get you more and more surprised as the film progresses. What begins as unforgettable and the run-mill ends in darkness and in the center. The whole movie is very well filmed and the cast is very nice. Mitchum is his usual superior I here in the Man with a gun - not his best performance, Mitchum still has his classical and effective tough presence on the high-speed screen and tapes action of full, meaningful and shocking scenes film right out of the park. A man with a gun is a nice Western Mitchum and is easy to handle.
