In this movie, I was a producer accountant and I had to do some voice work on it, so I'm not completely impartial, but if it was horrible, I would say it. I thought it was a funny movie, not a critically acclaimed masterpiece, in any case, but there was a lot of laughter on the way. The Bible says laughter is good as a cure, so watching this movie can be good for your health. So many of the actors in this film have not yet reached their peak at the time we made this movie. Susan Sarandon, of course, is the one who has since passed much more glory. Melanie Mayron was seen on television every week as a photographer in the television series "Thirty-Something". Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger, who still bothered dreams of people. One of my personal favorites at this show was Dub Taylor, who played the sheriff. He was an excellent comedian actor and really nice, honest man. We all enjoyed working on this show and I think this fun is coming.
