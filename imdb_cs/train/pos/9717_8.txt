How to lose friends and Alienate People is all right one of the best comedies I've seen this year along with Pineapple Express and Step Brothers. It's not one of those "harsh" comedies that rely heavily on fictional jokes and toiletry humor, but it's moving at a welcoming pace instead, and you'll be easily connected to the evolving narrative. Simon Pegg leans him in his coffin with his cheerful rendering of fish outside the water and quickly separates himself from the tripod that once belonged to England (the other two were Nick Frost and Edgar Wright). Getting at the top of the food chain in Hollywood is hard to do as we can clearly see with Pegg, his first strike in the lead role was David Schwimmer's Comedy Run Fatboy Run, but it got lukewarm reviews from critics and spectators alike. His second attempt is this film, he received a relatively positive rating from most, but he was a flop in the box office. I, for one, I still do not lose faith in him and I will always be there whenever he wants to take the third shot to glory. The other characters were determined by Jeff Bridges to Danny Huston and Gillian Anderson. Surprisingly, Kirsten Dunst, in my opinion, has evolved well in this film as a loving angle to Pegg's character, but the spark I saw in the Vampire Interview is still lost. She has to find her quickly, or she could suffer the consequences of losing herself in the "rom-com" country forever.
