One of the best movie dramas I've ever seen. We do a lot of meetings in the church and that is one that can be used as a resource that highlights all the good things actor can do in their work. I highly recommend this, especially for those who are interested in acting, such as "must see". There are some notes. One, the cemetery scene, when Hamlet meets Yorick (everyone knows about this scene when he goes to elementary school) and his interaction with the skull was exceptionally good. The logic used in this scene was enormous - I suppose Shakespeare is a witness more than anything else. For one moment, I was very pleased with the scene where Hamlet, Horatio and the character played by Robin Williams were discussing the upcoming duel.
