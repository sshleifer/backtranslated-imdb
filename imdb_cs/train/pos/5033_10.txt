It's one of those movies that you've been watching after you've been watching and going back even months after watching. Actor acting is spectacular when playing two kids (I usually hate movies with a whimper). Bill Paxton is awesome, his directorial debut is even better than what I expected from an actor whose most memorable line is "Play Game, Man!" (The movie "Aliens.") The best part of the film is the dichotomy between those scenes where the actors play family, and when they do their "work." It really makes the movie believable and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keep it Bill, I'll be waiting for more movies I'm sure to love!
