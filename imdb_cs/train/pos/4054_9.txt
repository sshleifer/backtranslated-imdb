For the first time I've ever seen, this movie was a young boy in the 1980s. My dad actually got it from TV. I had to watch it's more than 20 times before a relatively new DVD release. Of course, I bought and watched the DVD and was surprised how much the dialogue changed. In the first version I still have on VHS, the film's mood was really dark due to the dialogue. However, the new version introduced by Van Der Beek and others is very comical. Otherwise, it's like watching the original US release of Akira with this oak before looking at a remastered version with a literal translation of Japanese. <br /> <br /> I am not complaining, the story and the quality of the animation are not lost, but it raises the question of whether Miyazaki intended for a lighter or darker narrative and theme in his movie .....
