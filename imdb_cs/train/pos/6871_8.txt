We filmed this movie at the local film company, and the artistic crowd had the time of its cinematographic life. It's delicious, silly and very funny in the 1960s. They laughed like a maniac in the Kraft Kitchen sketch. The rest is a mixed bag, but the height definitely beat the minima. By the way, what happened to Ken Shapiro?
