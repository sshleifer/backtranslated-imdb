Well done and stylish, and at the same time absolutely meaningful, this thriller will work better for fans who are not fans to be interested in this genre than later Argento entries that go beyond all parties. For fans of these crazy Italian thrillers, George Hilton will appreciate the turn of his character and what he has gone through. The camera is fresh, with slow graphic violence and special but reasonable options and good music scores. The less you know about the story, the better it works. The only thing missing from being a great Sergio Martino giallo is that the story does not have as much sexual or psychological information as possible, or both elements to get over the top. It is rather a routine secret, characters are well defined, but they live or die according to their actions not according to their own virtues and defects. A recent DVD release (2005) is a beautiful aspect and definitely the way to see the film, unless scenes from art houses would ever appear, which seems unlikely.
