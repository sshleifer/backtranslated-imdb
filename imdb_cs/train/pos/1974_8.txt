I think the reason for all the perilous diarrhea about this movie is that most people think that Sharon Stone is about 50 years old and gets naked while playing sexy. No one cared when the Golden Girls sat around the cheesecake meal discussing their first orgasm, but to see someone after menopause get digital pleasure while riding, I think it's too much for someone. Let's look at it, it looks good, the brighter years are warmer than my mother who is the same age! It's not the first or the classic culture, but from the beginning of the century, all this is what filmmakers expect: a film experience that touches your soul. As such, he never says there is not one. It's an erotic thriller that's both erotic and exciting, and it's a sequel to a brilliant figure we all love to hate. She is the character of Catherine Trammell, who helped make way for this sequel. Fans of the first film want to see more chilly ice queens. The cinematography and artistic direction were fresh and extravagant, and they forced me to convince myself of Briti. The score is amazing as well. <br /> <br /> There is some surprise from some characters, but there is some great work from David Morrissey, who is practically unknown. There is a hindrance that the script is practically the same as the first film, just attaches a psychiatrist instead of a policeman. As well as the MPAA's criminal decision to force the film to be reduced even more, reflecting the sense of guilt that the story is known. <br /> <br /> At least it's fun and it's fun when I look at it, and that's just the intentions of the movie. So if you have beef with Mizz Stone, maybe you should actually see the movie and draw your own conclusions before you jump your projectile to vomit?
