Wow. Uhm ... no ... wow! I think I'll start doing it. The betrothed woman (Lucy) arrives in her family home, her husband (Mathurin) in France, waiting for a bishop or cardinal or someone in the Catholic Church to marry her (to satisfy the will). Lucy learns about the animal legend , which is hundreds of years old on land. That night, in bed, she began to wonder about Bešťada and his ex-lady in the house. This is where it is interesting! The plot is really quite thin (and it seems to stretch for some time in the middle of the movie), but the filmmaker rewards (?) Those who have endured it with a shocking and merry finale. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. If you are looking for a great cinema, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a movie about bestiality (which almost looks at the subject), this movie is for you! (If you have a weak stomach, do not be afraid of this. Besides some horse-riding action at the beginning, "deeds" are quite cartoonish, IMO)
