I watched it last night on TV (HBO). I have to admit that the tension in this film was insurmountable by most other films of the FN era. I liked how Chip would be the only moment peaceful and then VIOLENT the next moment. It was classical. Ahh yes. Ladies, villians, cigars and crazy cops! It has it all. This film gave me all the goods. Especially I loved the way communism mixed with the scene, which is very common in this era of film. Very daring also since the blacklist was popular these days. The rating of this movie is one of the best I've ever seen in FN!
