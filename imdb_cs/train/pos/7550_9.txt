Wow. A fantastic fantastic movie "trip" that has a lot of super-surreal pictures, dark intentions and black, quite a strange sense of how cartoons have to see the world. It is populated by a very cute group of characters that bend and flow with a curvy backdrop. Because with all the fantastic fantasies there is a swampy conspiracy secondary to visual pitfalls, and we are watching a small cat and her sister zombies, such as death, water elephants, samurai swordsmen, and swine. I have never heard of it, but now I love it - probably because it reminds me of the surrealist work of the American cartoonist; Bill Plympton. It's a delightful pleasure for fans of strange, nice things, and it puts me on the screen for fear of something amazing. Simply put, it's "Hello Kitty" without "o".
