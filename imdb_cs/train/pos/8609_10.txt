I thought it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It was a great story line and showed that people are so complex in all different ways. I recommended it to all my friends! I always like a good story line and this movie has one of the best I've seen for a long time. I saw that I had a daughter and I did the same thing Natalia did to find out more about her life and loved it. It turned out that we have not only a life with our families; but also parts of our lives that we do not share with them - because they may not be in their best interest to know all the details of what we do not do that we are so proud of. <br /> <br /> I look forward to another similar movie, and I will keep my eye out.
