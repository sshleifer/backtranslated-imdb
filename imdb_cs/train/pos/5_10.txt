I came in the middle of this movie, so I had no idea of ​​any credit or title until I saw it here where I see you did it. I'm on the positive side for this movie, but one thing really took my interest when I watched: a beautiful and sensitive score written in the Coplandesque Americana style. My surprise was great when I found out that the score was not written by anyone other than John Williams himself. It is true that he wrote sensitive and tactile scores like Schindler's list, but usually associates his name with such bombastic attacks as Star Wars. But in my opinion, what Williams wrote for this film goes beyond what I've ever heard of his tenderness, sensitivity, and beauty, in full accord with the fine and beautiful plot of the film. And another recent hit, Catch Me If You Can, shows even more joke and sophistication. As for Stanley and Iris, I like educational films such as How Green was my Valley and Konrack, the one with John Voigt and his young African American accusations in South Carolina, and Danny deVito Renaissance Man, etc. A spiritual awakening, a story that can not be said quite often. This is a great addition to this genre.
