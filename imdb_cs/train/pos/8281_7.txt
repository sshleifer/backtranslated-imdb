From the first scene I was really excited. "I can say it will be amazing!" I thought. The game was so good, I felt like I was a drifter - it fell to the lives of these people. Music was also extremely disturbing. The plot began with a sudden event and then moved forward (felt) to some irrevocable fate. The construction was slow, but I personally like such a thing if the silent tension remains on the track and will not be derailed before it is ready for a paycheck. So everything is all right. then the fireworks start, and before you know it, the credit rolls. "WHAT?!!!" it was all that I and my film night companion could tell. If you understand the director's intentions, the blunt ending makes sense (for those of you who have already seen the movie, look for a very fascinating and funny interview with Larry Fessenden on filmcritic.com), but I can not say it was not completely removed. It could have been solved with just ten minutes of material before the climax. In any case, it's bad. Those ten minutes could mean a big difference in the world. (But for those of you writing or making movies, you should know that creating a story of an arc with the right timing is a tremendous pain in the ass, and I certainly do not make this criticism from any stand!) <br /> <br /> Wendigo it feels like a masterpiece that has been resisted before it was completed. But hay, every day I would take a miserable masterpiece on the overproduced piece of dog that was over compensated by too many digital effects (much like most horror films). One more comment. Some terrible scenes left me confused if I should be afraid or laugh. I do not know how to explain it, but Monty Python was a major monster of this monster in his more crazy "monstrous" forms. Although it may sound terrible criticism of a horror movie - I do not know, it still worked in a crooked way for me. I never ever look at the deer antlers the same way again! :)
