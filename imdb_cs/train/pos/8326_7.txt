While Fred Schepisi is "I.Q." it does not really have any important features, it's worth seeing. Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein and tries to help mechanic Ed's Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with Princeton's mathematics department, Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Probably the most entertaining scene is when Dr. Frizzyhead and his friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) are trying to make Ed look like a scientist: in the end he looks like a French Impressionist. the film is historically accurate, but that's no reason. It's nothing but light comedy, but Robbins's most famous film of 1994 (The Shawshank Redemption). A film about Einstein's entire life would have to concentrate not only on his scientific achievements but also on his political activism, specifically on how he wrote a letter called Scottsboro nine and stepped up against nuclear weapons (he got to the point where the FBI kept his file on him ). <br /> <br /> It is also acceptable. Also played by Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.
