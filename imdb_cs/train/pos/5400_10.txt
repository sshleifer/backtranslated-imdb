This film is a great lesson about Japanese history that was at the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate shortly before the shogunate lost a big battle against the loyalist who wanted the Emperor back to the throne to rule Japan. I really had to read the whole story to get the whole background. Shintaro Katsu (also known as the original Zatoichi) gives excellent performances such as Izo Okada, one of four Bakumatsu Hitokiri. It is a simple samurai that loses all its wealth. In order to have a good life, he becomes the holder of Takechi Hanpei (played by Tatsuya Nakada = Ryonosuke of Sword of Doom). Hanpei is an ultra-nationalist politician who leaves Hitokiri's band to assume their political goals to assassinate a lot of prominent pro-Western politicians. Izo Okada follows his leader without actually questioning what they are doing. As long as he has money to go and drink and spend his bitch. Okada kills more and more brutal throughout the film and is proud to have a fear-based reputation wherever he goes. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful portrait about the life of a simple samurai that is captured by political affairs and it's really naive to realize what's going on. First, after being betrayed and tortured and always talking to Sakamoto (who is a samurai who rejects violence), he changes his thoughts and opinions about life. But too late .... Watch the movie to see the end of Izo Okada ... Shintaro Katsu and the rest of the staff give great performance. Every actor has a role to play. Sword-fighting is very unique and fast ... probably faster than several movies today ... <br /> <br /> Check out if you have a chance !!!
