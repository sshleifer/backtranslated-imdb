The 52-Pick Up has never won the respect that he should have. It works on many levels and has a complicated but sequential plot. Stakeholders give some of the best performances. Ann-Margret, Roy Scheider and John Glover are perfectly busy and provide deep characters. Notable is also the Vanity, which should put her in a serious acting career because of the unexpected ability she shows and Kelly Preston who have been pursuing you for a few days. Anyone who likes action in combination with a complicated story will be delighted.
