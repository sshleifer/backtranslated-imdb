Just like I liked the Hanzo Razor movies, there are definitely enough of the three: "Who's got the gold?" The Last Adventure for the Japanese Legislator with an impressive package is a pretty nice piece of Pinko Cinema, but it offers little new ideas as it takes a big step back in terms of abusive behavior. The film begins with the appearance of a woman's spirit and looks as if exploring the supernatural territory, something that could attract the series in an interesting new direction; Unfortunately, after the specter turns out to be nothing but Scooby Doo (prepared by the corrupt finance minister who is willing to keep people from the lake hiding the stolen gold), director Yoshio Inoue is satisfied with the recycling of the familiar elements from the first two films, the result is an obsolete affair. <br /> <br /> Hanzo is starting an investigation again, which requires that he listen to women with his powerful penis, cut off his enemies and abuse his superiors. On the way, we get a wild orgy, the good nature of the rape (Hanzo enforces the women who fully appreciate his will) and bloody sword fighting. If you have already seen and appreciated the first two movies, you can watch this installment complete the set, but be warned, it is probably the least satisfying one of them. <br /> <br /> 6.5 out of 10, rounded to 7 for IMDb.
