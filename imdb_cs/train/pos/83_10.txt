A few years ago, I added to the IMDB commentary on the television series "The Real McCoys". I said then, and I repeat that it was a charming, fun and entertaining show, well crafted with wonderful features. Recently, I saw four old episodes of PLUS Reunion from 2000 with Richard Crenna, Kathy Nolan and Tony Martinez on the DVD. As mentioned in another writer, it is curious that Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) were not mentioned, but perhaps they can be watched over SAG or AFTRA. <br /> <br /> The Reunion show has been well done and has given us many unfamiliar looks at the show. One of the confidential information we did not get was whether Kathy Nolan or not regretted leaving the show in an unpleasant controversy that last year left Luke "widow", which was not very good. Nolan released a comedy bomb "Broadside", which involved women's nurses in the Pacific in World War II. Understand it? BROADside? No, it's not funny. Unlike the dirty, blatant and violent TRASH on television, which now undermines our values, "The Real McCoys" have fun and decent people. And I thank all those involved, including the creator, Irving Pinko, for bringing him to my family. We never missed it.
