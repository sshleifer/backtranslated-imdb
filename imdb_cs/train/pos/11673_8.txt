When I saw Charley Boorman on Long Way with Ewan McGregor, I was very happy to see Charley in his own show. I thought Charley had come across a beautiful man who was very rooted and on the ground. It's nice to see that celebrities are fighting their weight and fitness, it's just show their human too! I do not know very much about the bikes, but this show caught me right from the start. The preparation and organization of this event seems enormous. The very event seems very dangerous and it fascinates me when I see why Charley and everyone else is doing it and how far it's going on. I like the pace of the show and fast joyful music. I can not believe he broke his collar bone, I really hope it's over, I can not wait to see another episode ...
