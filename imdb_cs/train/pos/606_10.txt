I've seen a lot of Saura movies, and I've always found the amazing way to collect music, dance, drama, and great cinema in their films. Ibira shows even better Saura, which deals with multimedia concepts and contemporary concepts of dance and music. Another thing that raised my attention is the fact that dancers and musicians, dance and music are equally important in this film: the camera portrays various aspects of musical interpretation, examines not only technical problems, but also emotional experiences with gaming. Saura's interest in the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is another benefit to making this film aesthetically exciting among its other parts. That's why I strongly recommend those who love good cinema, good music, good dancing, great art.
