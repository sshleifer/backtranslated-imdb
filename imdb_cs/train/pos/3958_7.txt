Moe and Larry are newly henpecked married couples who married Shemp's demanding sister. In her musical studio, Shemp learns he will inherit a fortune if he has married someone! <br /> <br /> "Married Care" is a remake of the 1947 "Groom Bride", widely considered to be one of the best Stooge films with Shemp. Remake contains most of the records from this movie. New scenes, shot on May 17, 1955, feature the story of Moe and Larry, who married Shemp's sisters, along with their turkey cooking, which was painted with turpentine! Several new scenes are stuck at the end of the movie (double for Dee Green was used, if you blink, you will miss the double look.) <br /> <br /> "Spice Watch" would do for a good movie, just with part of the nurse plot. Budget considerations, along with fewer reservations for two-disc chamber games, have influenced the decision to use older shots. Although Stooges still produced entirely new films, most of their releases in 1955-56 were composed of older films with several new scenes. "Spouse Care", while one of these hybrids is observable and entertaining; we see the "bride" again and new scenes are fun enough for the viewer to get through the movie. This film is one of the last Stooge comedies that feature new footage of Shemp and was released six weeks after his death. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10.
