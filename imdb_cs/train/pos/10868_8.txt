I always thought it would be a long and boring Talking-Heads movement full of static inner shots, buddy, I was wrong. "Election" is a very fascinating and thoroughly charming thriller-dramatic star that captures a deep and realistic view of the origins of Ritual triads. The characters are constantly on the move, and although you are always an outsider as a viewer, it is still possible to feel the tension coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters. And Johnnie Succeeds in creating truly enchanting images with the carefully compromised lighting and contrast of atmospheric light shadows. Though there is hardly any action, the end is still shocking in his ruthless depiction of brutality. A great movie that deserves more attention, and it seemed like a minimalist acoustic guitar score.
