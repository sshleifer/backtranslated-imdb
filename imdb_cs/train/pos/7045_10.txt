This movie is definitely getting a thumb from me. These are funny jokes and even occasional stereotypical and derogatory views on East European people that I've had in my stitches for most of the movie. It's the land is smart and 100% original and will have a guess around the movie. The only person I was interested in was filming Hilary Duff. It is clear and simple to see that she has made a leap of faith that has come out of the "chick-flick" genre she has become accustomed to. Her accent is excellent and her performance was surprisingly sharp and well done. It's the best performance I've ever seen from Hilary and I've seen most of her films. Her character, Yonica Babyyeah, is described as "Britney Spears from Eastern Europe," and this is evident in some of her manners and the song "I Want to Blow You Up ... ... ... Up". She likes her too, because her performance will really grab you, Yonica is a very complex and confused character. Joan Cusack rejoiced me all over the movie with her sometimes humor, but also facial expressions and so on. John Cusack's funny dialogue has probably smiled to you. I strongly recommend this movie.
