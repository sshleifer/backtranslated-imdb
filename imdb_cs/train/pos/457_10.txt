This program is a lot of fun and the title song is so catchy that I can not get it out of my head. I found myself older that I was attracted to wrinkles doing work, and these four are excellent in their efforts. Some of what they do are outrageous, but brilliant, given that today with the computer of the world we can never do it in real life. I always learn about the exhibitions. But if you love mystery, drama, comedy, and little forensics, you will love this show. It reminds me Quincy, ME in one direction and Barney Miller in another way they work and interact with each other. They're bad, but they do the job, and that's what counts.
