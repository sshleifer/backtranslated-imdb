A sober, reflexive piece, a little miniature, that blossoms into a gorgeous human imagery sequence that goes beyond mere screen dramatization. This quiet little story keeps you in the eye - if you do not have too many problems with different Spanish accents, from Mexican to Peruvian, and more authentic use of Marisa Paredes in the Iberian peninsula! Garcíadiego perfect adaptation of the novel: Even the magnificent master García Márquez should be proud of his excellent work. And the hats on Arturo Ripstein, who so deeply sought to be the precious gem, ruby ​​and so perfected, so elegant, so sensitive, so touching ... El Coronel - Fernando Lujan - is waiting for his retirement, while living in his bumpy wood, which lives deep in the Colombian jungle (however, the film elsewhere, not in Colombia) with a cockroach and his wife (in that order?). And that's all there is to it. <br /> <br /> But, oh, much more .... This movie is a rapsodie. I have to see this poetic little piece again as soon as possible. It is a high side 8 out of 10, which is very high. <br /> <br /> This is not an easy commercial Hollywood thing.
