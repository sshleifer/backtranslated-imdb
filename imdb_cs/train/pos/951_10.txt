I know that many people have a special hobby for the Alistair Sim version of Dickens' story, but for me this 1984 defeat. My wife and I have a copy of this movie on VHS and we watch it together every Christmas Eve. I often remark that we could also look at Halloween because it's a haunted, haunted story. Scott - typecast like Scrooge - is shimmering and ugly, making his transformation even more miraculous and moving. I think he's there with his performance at Patton. Ghosts are all effective, everyone is creepier than the last. Watching the dark, floating, skeletal form of the Spirit of Christmas Comes coming every year after three shakes. And what the cast support! David Warner is primarily in top form like Bob Cratchit, just like Susannah York as his wife. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that I recall that this version will come closer to the original story than most others - but I can be mistaken because it was several years since I read it. No matter what this is, it's a great Christmas classic.
