Writing something real and true is demanding. Knowing how to shoot it and put it together without being trivial is even better. Ishai Setton is one of those where you can recognize Life in its simplicity and beauty. He touched me on "Big Bad Swimming" and from now on I support him as much as I can. It's just a shame that I can not show my friends something (you know, like DVD ???) because we're talking well ... but something to see is better. Everyone can not go to festivals to find such pearls, and this movie really is worth it! Great THANK YOU to the staff of this masterpiece and I'm waiting for it to be distributed.
