My daughter really tells me when I talk about Drew Barrymore about being hit face to face with the pan, not to mention her Dudley Dooright chin for which Jay Leno would die. How awesome when I discovered in Fever Pitch that I really like Miss Barrymore; and Jimmy Fallon; and Red Sox; and Boston! This movie is probably best characterized as a sweet, light comedy. To be absolutely stereotypical, the girls will love the film for their romantic charm and Jimmy Fallon's vulnerability, and boys will like it for all male ties and the show of sporty mania. My sport hate wife, my teenage daughter and everyone found something in the movie. It says something in itself. It's a nice way to spend an hour and a half, and it's probably a good date.
