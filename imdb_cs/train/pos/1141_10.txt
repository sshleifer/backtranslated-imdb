Anyone who does not know the whole movie has been wrapped. I've been watching it for twenty times, and I still have tears in my eyes on many scenes. Sally Field is absolutely perfect as Celest Talbert, a faded soap star whose supportive actors are trying to swap it in the hope that their star will rise. Fields, at the age of 45, still has a beautiful and beautiful pixie quality and the perfect character that denies her that she had three children. I'm impressed, I'm in love with her. Casting "Soapdish" is full of stars that fulfill their roles to perfection. Kevin Kline is flawless, just like Robert Downey Jr., ing√©nue Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher in one of her early roles, Carrie Fisher as an over-director who competes with the actors for a small part as a waiter without a shirt on. Kathy Najimy is awesome as an unfortunate costume designer and best of all, Cathy Moriarty as Sister Nan, who leads a conspiracy to remove the Fields figure from the show, is cheerful. This film was to win the Oscars for Best Comedy, Best Director in Comedy, best man in comedy and countless other bests, including writing, directing and supporting actors and actresses. Get a DVD so you can watch it over and over again for another 25 years. You'll still laugh at him when the disc runs out.
