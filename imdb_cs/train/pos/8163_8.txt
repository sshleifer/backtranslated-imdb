Corbin Bernsen gives an incredibly intense and unobtrusive performance like Dr. Alan Feinstone, a wealthy and successful Beverly Hills dentist who is obsessed with perfection. When he finds out that his beautiful blonde girl trophy has cheated him and the IRS has begun to hunt him for tax problems, Feinstone jerked under pressure and hurriedly shifted. Director Brian Yuzna, working from Stuart Gordon, Dennis Paoli and Charles Finch in a suitably dark, humorous and demo scenario, reveals the fragile neurosis and psychosis that awakens under the smooth, clean, well-treated surface of a respectable rich America with deliciously malicious pleasure. In addition, Yuzna is further subjected to frantic steps with a poorly curved sense of black gallows. Bernsen positively shines like Dr. Feinstone; he professionally displays a really disturbing subconscious, which is just below Feinston's deceptive and veneer. Supporting acting is also excellent: Linda Hoffman as Feinstone's whip, Broke's unfaithful wife, Earl Boen as a fool, unpleasant IRS agent Marvin Goldblum, Molly Hagan as feisty assistant Jessica, Patty Toy as assistant Karen, Jan Hoag as cheerful office manager Candy, Virginya Keehne as a sweet, frantic teenager, Sarah, Ken Foree as thorough detective Gibbs, Tony Noakes, as well as Gibbs's equally wise partner, Detective Sunshine, Michael Stadvec, as a female Chinese muffin cleaner, Matt and Mark Ruffalo, Landers. First-class make-up f / x is every bit cruel, rough and disturbing to be. Levie Isaaks has a number of great camera angles and several tasty, close-up zooms. Alan Howarth's temperamental snort score also hit the site that intertwined the body. Conveniently twisted treatment.
