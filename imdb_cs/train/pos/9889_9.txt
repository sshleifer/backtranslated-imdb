Read the review again by Eric. He perfectly described his own feelings in this film more eloquently than I ever did. I'm writing here just to encourage you to look for it and see it. I've seen it many years ago on TV, I think at the IFC. It's such a unique film that I'm hesitant to make a comparison. He was filmed in northern Mexico, somewhere in the tireless badlands of Coahuila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potosi. This is not Sedanga-like Durango, Mexico (John Wayne films), but really a sharp and wild place. I must now find a novel to verify the original story. Like this place, this movie is weird and wild and amazing and weird and absolutely not for everyone. It's a kind of production that almost motivates me to study the film. I have never forgotten the film, it is indelible. Still, over the years, I have forgotten my existence. I know that no one who has seen it has never read about it, nor has anyone ever seen it. Erendira is such an unusual name, I even forgot the title. Well, now I'm going to try to buy a copy. <br /> <br /> ** Since then, the above contribution has become a huge fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and so regret that I have not read it yet. <br /> <br /> Compared with the note MsMyth below; the film was shot in Mexico, but the author is Colombian and he has never talked about the history of Mexico or Mexico, although Marquez now lives in Mexico for "political" reasons. This story is universal. <br /> <br /> I'm desperately trying to find a copy of this movie for my library. Like a movie? You have to read this story and then everything Garcia Marquz wrote. And by the way, the original place in the story was Colombia.
