I've been watching "Dick Tracy" for years and as a result has become a vital part of my life - it's been with me all my childhood and I've often seen it. She sees it now as an adult, it's still a very good movie - dark, satirical and incredibly incomprehensible. The only thing that can be said is the Oscar nomination that Pacino has received - except that he rarely discusses and provokes power when it comes out. <br /> <br /> Pacino is a timeless, top-notch, but good effect, as there is a lot of fun. Beatty is great like Dick Tracy, and behind the camera, he can capture the atmosphere of the movie comic book noir better than any other movie I may have ever seen. Just look at one scene from the movie is breathtaking. Lighting, velvety tones and smog / smoke combine to create a great effect. Some really humorous actresses, one of which belongs to Dustin Hoffman as "Mumbles," and I do not think there are any mistakes in acting - even the mandatory child-character is much better than expected. Overall, a really gentle film that has become distrustful over the years since its release and is incredibly underestimated with only 5.7 / 10 in the IMDb. Critics' reviews are very positive (look at RottenTomatoes.com) and after seeing the film again, it's not hard to understand why - it's a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic book from style to eccentricity. <Br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 4.5 / 5 stars.
