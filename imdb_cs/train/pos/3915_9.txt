I have seen this movie at least 4 times since 1984 and it's great every time I see it. It's a very impressive version of Carmen, with an amazing Flamenco dance, a set of bare bones and, of course, great music. This narrative about Carmen is a story in the story, each with a parallel other, up to a double tragic end. Of course the low budget of Spanish production, the film contains the dance of some of the top flamenco dancers in Spain. The combination of exciting opera music and the sound of dancing shoes on the wooden scene makes storytelling even stronger. It's an independent film shooting for the best and probably my favorite foreign film time.
