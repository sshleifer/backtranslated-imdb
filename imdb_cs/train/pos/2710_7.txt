This is not my favorite WIP ("Women in Prison"), but it's one of the most famous movies in the genre. It was produced by Roger Corman, who created several WIPs at this time. Obviously, the film tries to play with an established model. The film takes place in a US prison, not in a "banana republic" like most WIP films. I'm not sure if it was a wise move, but it's an acceptable change of pace. Writer-director Demme is really getting into his job and still digging new ways to present a well-known screenplay. In fact, he is too ambitious for his good. The director creates a few unrealistic dream sequences that are demanding on the border, but it's fun to see how hard he tries to place this film above your average motion of cats in chains. But do not worry, Demme still works within the podgender parameters. There is a lot of nudity and violence, which satisfies fans with hardcore. The film is a little slow, but it's very fun. Cast is good. Roberta Collins is a veteran of WIP, so she does not need an introduction and Barbara Steel is a horn as a crazy wheelchair guard. Pam Grier is, however, very poor.
