A film about Wannabee, never-was and less than the heroes to do it against all possibilities. Where have we heard before? But when the unfortunate people are Shoveller, Blue Raja and Mr.Furious you know it's not your traditional cloth to the wealth story. Eddie Izzard's classic performance as Tony P. One of Disco Boys Leaders and Geoffrey Rush as Arch Villain shows that the real idea went into casting. <br /> <br /> Even Greg Kinnear, at first glance, a special choice for the role of Captain Amazing will appear on the spot. Watch this movie if you are a sick comic-off-film stereotype. Why could not anger be super power?
