In 1943 the RAF Group of Officers, including Eric Wiiliams, decided to escape from the prisoners' camp using the Gymnastic Vault in the courtyard. In 1950, it was decided to shoot his account and began a special British film genre - a story of a military prison camp that peaked in jeopardy in 1959. A wooden horse is one of the darkest films I've ever watched. There are no great dramatic moments, but the constant story eventually builds on a climax that has more stress because the story has not left the road to unlikely drama, jumps or jumps (something that happens!) Music. It's all his time and it works beautifully. Leo Glenn, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson lead a curiously low key cast of add-ons and (I suspect) that non-actors. Without exception, they are all constantly monotonous and quiet. They make emotions out of their roles. Given that so many people have been ex-service until recently, I think they have renewed their role as "Officers and Gentlemen". This unfinished approach does not aggravate any dramatic tension. On the contrary, unlike most films from the war adventure, the story does not end with barbed wire: and that alone will keep me going.
