In fact, the answer takes up only a small part of this excellent film, Imax, which brings us to our fine self. C.G. and special cameras - with the help of Imax - immensely display the inner (and external) activities of an average person, whether they are adult men and women, boys and girls or children. Almost every aspect of a part of the human body is particularly detailed: digestion, reproduction (representing Marvin Gaye's hit), heart, etc. Some particularly revealing moments include how a child can be submerged underwater and how the brain impulses look. It's amazing how we work. <br /> <br /> The subject jumps around horribly. But we still learn a lot about our body that we * should * require * to know.
