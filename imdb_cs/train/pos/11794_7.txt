This is quite a fascinating, fascinating, tragic story. Fairly good and largely very accurate, given that it is a television film rather than a documentary film. They created some fictional characters and brought together several real people into one character, but otherwise that's a good story about a very tragic and dark story. The latest film footage depicting mass suicide / murder is almost directly taken from a sound record made by Jim Jones. This recording was made during the last 44 minutes of the existence of the Temple of Peoples. It is available in several places on the Internet. This part of the film is almost hidden in this direction. <br /> <br /> It is not a documentary summary. However, it covers most of the basic elements of the People's Temple story.
