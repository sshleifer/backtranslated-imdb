Yes, it's over the top, yes it's a little cliché and yes, Constance Marie is a full child and good to see again and again! Jokes and gags may be old and repetitive after a while, but the show is still fun to watch. Since it is a family show, humor is weakened and writers incorporate family values ​​and ideals between gag. George Lopez is funny. Do not take him seriously and the show is the winner. I'm sure he does not intend his character to be serious or that he is the virtue of virtue. His explosions and shouts of joy are funny ... I have to say that Benny is one big, dark and bitter place. I hate this figure ... so much so that whenever it's for more than 30 seconds, I'll dump the TV so I do not have to hear it. There is nothing ridiculous about her conversations or jokes. As the mother must be the worst, and I'm only shocked and surprised that George, as a figure, would suffer so much of such a pitiful person. <br /> <br /> So whenever I ticked when I saw Benny thinking: I see it's a lot better than when I look at the Bill Engvall Show. Now is a bad sitcom ...
