George and Kim travel with their younger son, Miles, to a remote cabin in northern New York when their car hits a deer and goes into a ditch. But it seems that the mere incidence of misfortune is the beginning of a terrible journey where the myth becomes a reality and spiritual spirit food, half the beast and half human Wendigo, chasing a small town ... "Wendigo" by Larry Fessenden is thought provoking a horror film often becomes a strange family drama. the characters are well developed and there is a slight bone vibration. Small footage from Wendigo is effectively solved and it's never clear what's real and what we're imagining, or even when the story takes place entirely in Miles's head. , "Wendigo" is my first contact with the work of Larry Fessenden, and certainly not the last one. Give this movie a chance if you do not mind watching something untraditional.
