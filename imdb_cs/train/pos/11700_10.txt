I have read most of the comments on this movie. This movie (and the whole series of prophecies) I have seen many times with family members of all ages, we all enjoyed and we just thought about what we already knew from reading and studying the Bible about bleeding and ending. No one was terrified or traumatized, as I have read in some places. The film is based on biblical facts only. I've seen a bunch of films in the closing time of "Tribulation," "Armagedon," and so on, and by far it's one of the best in the biblical truths. It does not have to have many great special effects like today's movies, but I believe it's a good tool for witnesses. This movie and its series of prophets can be seen on this higherpraise.com website free of charge and judged by yourself. Blessing to all.
