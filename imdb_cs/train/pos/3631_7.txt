The movie actually has a fairly good story, but it blocks in several key locations. It's almost as if the director threw the film together without taking the time to make some substantial cuts in the movie. Dennis Quaid is doing quite a decent job in his role ... but something obviously lacks a few key scenes. <br /> <br /> This 2.5-hour film could be reduced to about 2 hours of film. And it would probably be a much better film if he did not feel as if he had been dropped. <br /> <br />
