I saw this movie when I was 13 years old and I really liked the dana plaato, which later played in various moves like drummond kimberly. I do not think it's garbage. This was not the intention of continuing the document. it's just a cute children's film about three kids who go to men trying to find a rich bay. the men have hurt and the children have saved them with the help of creation. Important shots of arkansas swamps and scenery were neat. it's a good movie for kids, no real violence, a few slight horrors, but good fun for little children.
