The running person witches a tantalizing tale of the modern American media complex and hits his target dead center. It can be an easy target, but it will not do it. Without effort, RM is pushing for pro-fight (featuring some for wrestlers like Hunters), network television, Nielsen rating, US government (suggesting it's fun-oriented as well), crime and punishment, and half a dozen other trips along the way. It's far from the original novel by Stephen King, and Arnold is not even the vengeance of the novel. But who cares? It's basically Arnie, with all the well-crafted action sequences and one-off events that such a company requires.
