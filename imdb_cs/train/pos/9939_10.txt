This is a cartoon series where most of the action takes place in the human body, where actors represent vitamins, viruses, blood cells, etc. I will not attempt to explain it in more detail, you simply have to see for yourself: You will not be disappointed. I remember watching it as a child in the 1980s (with Swedish voices). I talked with some people who were children in the 1980s and loved it too! I have to admit that education - part of the episodes did not get me to a conscious level, but the whole idea of ​​raising children while having fun is amazing. I recently saw several episodes; there is humor and heart in it, which is hard to find today in other children's programs. <br /> <br /> 5/5
