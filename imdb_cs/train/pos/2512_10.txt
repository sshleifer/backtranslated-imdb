As a giant fan of Japanese singers Gackt and Hyde, I was thrilled to discover that they had taken a film together and made it to my life to see it. I was not disappointed. In fact, this film has greatly exceeded my expectations. We knew that both Gackt and Hyde were singers rather than actors, I was ready for daring but not really full performances, but I'm glad that both of them managed to keep me busy and believe the story as it went on. The baby's moon has just the right amount of humor, action, romance and serious, heart-poisoning moments. I can not say that I have ever cried for the film, and these more creative moments are admirably a couple, in my opinion, definitely demonstrating their skills as actors. Battle scenes are absolutely awesome, and although there are a few moments of uncertainty at the beginning, you quickly get into the movie and start binding with the characters. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone, especially to those who are fans of Gackt and Hyde.
