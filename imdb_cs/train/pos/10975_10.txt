Daughter's words are poetry: "I can not go to the next year, I have to get to the hotel room." "I lost a blue scarf in the sea of ​​leaves." "The marble fauna moves ... just gave us the washing machine, that's the deal." "The latest thing crushed me." "..cookers and cats are a little boring too long." ".. some small rat nest, a mouse I'd like better." And wisdom has words in her mother's mouth: "... yes, pleasure is all mine." "This little book keeps me straight, just like a dye." "You always have to do everything right." "Where the hell did you come from?" "... bring me a small radio, I have some professional music." "I am your mother, do you remember me?" The relationship between mother and daughter is in this wonderful movie. This is the mother's day.
