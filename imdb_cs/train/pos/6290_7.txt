Using Buster Keaton in the twilight of his career was an interesting choice. Maybe he was the most talented comic in a quiet age. This gives him the opportunity to show the talents in the story a little bit of time. He joins him who lives in modern times, and it is obvious that we are best left in our times. Keaton is able to make his eyes very good. I have already heard his voice. I believe he made some of the Beach Party movies, playing some empty characters to get a few bucks. Serling seemed to respect him and portray him so. It's not a bad story. It shows how one reacts when we want something that we do not have and we get this wish.
