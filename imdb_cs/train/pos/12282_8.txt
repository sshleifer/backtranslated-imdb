At first I did not like that much, even though I did. They did not include the third generation of True, the love between Blanka and Pedro was not well explained, and some actors were too different from what I imagined. Later, I realized that if the movie was more loyal to this book, it would be like five hours long and it would be a little tiresome. Now I like it very much because my favorite characters are there, as I have portrayed them. Clara really looks like a living angel and her introduction to the story at the beginning of the movie was fantastic, loyal and short. Glenn Close is Ferula. I imagined it just like that, only in the sadness of the whole thing. Esteban finds enough. I never really liked his character, and though I was curious about it, I hated him a lot, especially when he hit Clara. Just as in the book, the last part is very exciting and also has a true history. The film is really good, especially considering it was a gringo movie based on the Latin American book. It's amazing how many famous stars there are, do not you think?
