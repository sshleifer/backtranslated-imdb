I'm trying not to accept IMDb ratings on my heart, but I was amazed when I saw a rating of 5.4 for one of my baby favorites. I do not want that for 17 years, but as a family movie it's a sweet and meaningful movie. Children will definitely love and have no flaws, and adults can guess the actor for every character and admire the subliminal news of the film. None of the films were in any way a message, in fact, he has a great message that adds his sweets. I admit that the story is on the thin side and some scenes like Screweyes' death (which still scare me) can be a little scary. But animation is above average with nice colors and good character animation. James Horner's music is very beautiful and the song is unforgettable, catchy and entertaining. I really liked the characters, Louie is probably the most thorough of them, but the dinosaurs were at least eye-catching. Martin The Short Clown was both cheerful and so strong, the part when he tells Screweyes "I left!" I was in the stitch. But my favorite is Screweyes, an effective villain who is smart and I think he is intelligent. But if I wanted something, I would like the film to stay in that part of it explaining how it lost its eye and why it feared the crowd because it could have been more developed in terms of depth. The script, although not worthy of the Oscars, has fun and hearts of warmth and should have children and adults entertained. The voice for me was the one who made the film. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall, and Yeardley Smith gave a solid performance, but Kenneth Marsa's special mention was that he was as great as Screweyes and almost unrecognizable. Overall, it's a good movie. I do not get ratings, I honestly do not. Sure, this movie is not perfect and not as good as a movie of the dinosaur, like Land Before Time, but it's good fun. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
