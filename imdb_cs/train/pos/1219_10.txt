The second Care Bears movie is immensely better than its predecessor. It has a deeper conspiracy, better character development and melody (especially the final song) are both catchy and hearty. Sure, the movie has a tendency to over-stress, but go, it's Care Care Bears. This movie is a great picture to show to children because it highlights friendship, love and once again care. Not to mention the care of the bears are just too adorable!
