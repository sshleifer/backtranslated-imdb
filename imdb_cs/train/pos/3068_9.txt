From reading the previous comments, I gather that this film went directly to the cable. Well, I paid to see it in the theater and I'm glad I did it because it was visually a visual film. Most settings seem to have been created in the early 1960s (with the exception of a shrinking office that was otherwise dated), and if you leave the Neve Campbell sequence, the whole movie has a emptied 1960s. And the use of restaurants in the movie was fascinating. For the first director whose background, in my opinion, is in written form, he has a great eye. During the first ten minutes, I felt that the land lacked credibility, and so I willingly broke my distrust and set off for a ride. When it comes to acting and showing father-son, mother-son, husband-wife, parent-child relationships, the movie was spot-on. William H. Macy, with the pleasure to watch, seems to fill the emptiness left by the late Tony Perkins, if and Magnolia are some indication. Tracey Ullman, as a neglected wife, moved quite a bit. It was a three-dimensional representation of a character that society too often considers to be two-dimensional. Of course, Donald Sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable portraits. The parental image (Bain / Sutherland) indirectly reminded me that Vincent Gallo BUFFALO '66 is a bit muted! I would definitely pay the money to see a second film from this director. He has the self-criticism of the filmmaker of the 1950s (something that P.T.Anderson will never be!). Still, he has a visual style and a journey with actors who are paying attention.
