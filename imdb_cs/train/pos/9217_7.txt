This really funny movie has a horrible cast of characters, almost every sensual middle-aged woman in Hollywood and a touching, fun love story. Capomezza and Malacici are competing chefs in the New York district of Italy. They are also at the opposite - extreme - ends of taste. Their children are cast in the main roles of church production Romeo and Juliet. They naturally fall in love. On the stage! The chaos and confusion that this causes, as parents take their toy with each other and their children, takes place for us on the backdrop of the captivating Capomezza home and their magnificently tasty weddings. <br /> <br /> In addition, four of the above-average parents and charming young lovers include figures of a vaguely wise priest, a grandmother who speaks plainly, a lady waving his wand and handing over the spiritual advice he receives from the media called The Blessed Roscoe, a motel with beds in the shape of a rear seat of the car and two doves. There is no gang or punch view that does not click on this fast movie. <br /> <br /> Even the family names of both families are part of entertainment. "Capomezza" could be interpreted as "low eyebrows" and "Malacic" could mean "snapped snobs". <br /> <br /> If you are sensitive to Italian stereotypes, you may not like this movie. If Bette Midler is bothering you, you may not like it, because all the women in this movie make Bette Midler as Martha Stewart. The rest of us should love it!
