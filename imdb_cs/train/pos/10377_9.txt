The movie from which you did not expect much and just watched it go through a quiet hour - but the hour turned out to be. Roll is great if it's not too serious a little story about "land-boy-lost-in-the-city-doing-good", it's fun in the whole range, the characters are cute and the pace is right. Toby Malone is the true star of the movie with his cute portrayal of Matt, saying that the kid from the country and the local football hero Aussie Rules are coming to a big city to try one of the big teams. He is greatly supported by John Batchelor as the local gangster Tiny. Watch out for these two. <br /> <br /> We are highly recommended.
