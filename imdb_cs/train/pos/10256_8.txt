The first part of this notorious horror series is presented as if it was a movie of the snaking piece discovered by the producers and set up as an amateur videotape, supplemented with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame. He represents a woman who was kidnapped by a group of black-haired men who tortured her for a few days and eventually killed her. The unfortunate victim is brutally beaten and smoothed with raw meat before her nails are pulled out with her pliers, her hand breaks with a hammer, her eyes pierced with a needle, and so on. In the worst scene, her applicants burned her with hot water and burned live worms to burns. The series gained great publicity when American actor Charlie Sheen, who believed the series contained real killings, attempted to ban its distribution in the United States. FBI investigation revealed that movies are just what seemed to be for most viewers - ill transformations with ugly, but obvious, special effects. The basic performance of the renowned Japanese comic artist Hideshi Hin, who also directed the third and fourth episodes, is the film a way to clean all rooms that are not tolerant. But, the Gorehounds will probably find nothing special.
