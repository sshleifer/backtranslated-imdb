I have to see it on a plane to the NZ last week, and I was wondering how it will be measured for both the British film and the book. I have to say that I was kind. If something fanatical to Red Sox during the bad years works even better than Arsenal FC's original dedication to success. As a Brit I was also interested in seeing you do not have to understand baseball to get what's going on. One question reminds me - was the script written by the Sox team as a team before they eventually interrupted Curtis Bambino? Or was another team under? As a Red Sox fan I (strange I know, Brit, who understands baseball) I have to say that added it to the experience.
