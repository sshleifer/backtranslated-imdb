This is the best and most original show in years. The more I look at her, the more I fall in love with it. Cast is excellent, writing is great. Personally, I like every character. But there is a popular character for everyone because there is a good combination of personalities and backgrounds as well as in real life. I believe ABC has done bad service to writers, actors and potential audiences of this show, canceled it so quickly, and did not inform enough and did not provide a real chance to get it. There are so few shows I watch, because most TVs are terrible. This show was, in my opinion, right there with my favorite gray anatomy and my brothers and sisters. In fact, I think the same audience for brothers and sisters would like to see this show if they knew it at all. Why it's always lost shows that get so much extra time and victory with great potential is instantly discarded immediately. I'm so bad from the reality show that I do not see any of them. It was so refreshing that he had a new idea on the show and then hired great actors, this show had so many promises. The recent episode was the best, as everyone has really begun to make their shows so real. Check out this show on ABC video and let ABC know you want to have this show back.
