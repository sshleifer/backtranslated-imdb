Young Mr. Lincoln is a poetic, beautiful film that portrays the myth of one of the most worshiped characters in American history. Henry Fonda had the difficult task of portraying a mythical character while making him human enough to care for him. She's the best actress. Find out how he stops himself in the lynching. Alice Brady is fantastic as a simple farmer. Most of the last part of the movie takes place in the courtroom and there is only a negative thing I can say about this film. Most of the character from the judge to the audience gets so many humorous lines that draw attention from the serious test that is on hand. this is because humor is a trademark of Ford. Supporting parts Ward Bond and Donald Meek are very good.
