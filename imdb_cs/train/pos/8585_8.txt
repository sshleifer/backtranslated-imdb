An engaging, riveting story about a captured US military cloak that has to prove its innocence to avoid what has happened. Paul Ryker delivers friendly fire in a seemingly convicted attempt to convince a military court that he is in fact an American spy on a secret mission in Korea. As part of the classical court drama, "Sergeant Ryker" is an extremely well-crafted secret, well-guided by an outstanding actor, a keen promoter of Kulik, and effective twists and turns. This film was originally shot as a television movie in 1964, and this revision was improved with the presence of many "names" of actors and some action sequences. Dillman, who rejects her role, is a conspirator attorney, whose attention has sometimes lost to the personal situation of Ryker's supportive, yet rather distant woman, who played with apologetic Vera Miles. Joining the queue is Peter Graves for prosecution and Norman Fell and Murray Hamilton in key supporting roles. Marvin's interpretation of the character Paul Ryker is a balanced representation of a simple but determined man whose normally erect upward behavior is being questioned by the desperate circumstances in which he is placed. Marvin is perfectly reluctant to resign from indifference, to passionate determination, with convincing, often intense performance that is the pinnacle of this otherwise little drama. It is such a performance that should raise the film on a platform where it occupies the place on the best lists of drama dramas. In spite of the apparent unknown, however, "Sergeant Ryker" still remains tense and persuasive, like a book you just can not give. Highly recommended.
