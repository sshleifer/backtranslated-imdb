World At War is perhaps the biggest documentary of all time. Historical research is virtually flawless. Even after a quarter century it is the most accurate and definitive documentary about the Second World War. Invaluable historical work, which includes interviews with some of the most important and fascinating personalities of the war. I highly recommend it as a learning experience.
