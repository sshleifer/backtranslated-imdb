Good, funny, straightforward story, excellent Nicole Kidman (I almost always like the movies that are in it). This was a good "vehicle" for someone who is adept at comedy and drama because there are elements of both. A romantic comedy wrapped around two criminal stories, large closing lines. Chaplin, a very good actor, was also good at another good but unpopular romantic comedy ("The Truth About Cats and Dogs"). Maybe they're too unlikely. Ebert did not even send a review for it. Great screwball comedy, of course, was unlikely ("Bringing Baby", etc.). If you saw an unlikely comedy, did you all see them? Or maybe people are ready to move from the thirties. Strange. Birthday girl is a movie I enjoyed several times. Nicole Kidman may be a "murderous app" for home video.
