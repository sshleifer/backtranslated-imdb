Purple rain ... what else can I say, the title speaks for itself. But I think all the actors were well-chosen. The film had a great story. I loved it! Since I was watching the movie, I got stuck in the 80s and I'm only 13! My favorite part of the movie was when his father died and he picked up all his musical pieces, and Apollonia was sitting on the staircase with his ear in hand. Critics say it's a drama, but I think it's more romantic. Murphy Brown also did a great job in the movie, actually acting like him. I'm so glad I saw this movie. The Purple Rain song, beautifully sung, was so hearty. I cried more than once.
