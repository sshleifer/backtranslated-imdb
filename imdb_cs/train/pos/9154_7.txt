Very good except for the end, which was a great disappointment. The script was very good as well as acting. The visuals were often very grainy, but that was added to the film because the snowy features were in good places to help create a mood for the film. This influence was destroyed by an extremely unbelievable end. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give this movie 8 out of ten, but it ended up knocking on a 7 point because it seemed to radically deviated from the first 75 minutes of the film and it seemed quite compelled for the filmmakers to look smart. <br /> <br /> This movie was much better than movies with a much larger budget and seemed to be filmed as a home movie with some other equipment. It's not a strange way to do it, but it was very good.
