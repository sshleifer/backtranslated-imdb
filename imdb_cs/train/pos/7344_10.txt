In my opinion, this is a good example of a movie that could be much better if it was a short one a decade ago. I doubt it will benefit from modern technology, but it would look much better if it was at least 90 minutes instead of 70. Artists and animators worked great. In my opinion, this film boasts the best artistic background and one of the best character designs. Animations are very smooth and realistic. For the duration of the movie, you believe in the world you see, so everyone did a great job. She also boasts one of the sexiest female animated characters, if it is not the most sexy, it will name the typical anime girls with ease. Unfortunately, there are a couple of bad thins about this movie that does not make it so attractive at the moment. First, plotting and execution are comparable to contemporary adventure films and are truly old-fashioned modern standards. Secondly, due to the duration, it would benefit from much of the next 20 minutes of dialogue. Finally, the setting is not so popular. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: A great alternative to the next short story about Conan Barbarus, but not a novel.
