This 1986 Italian-French remake of the 1946 film of the same name reveals the heat early and does not let us air. The story is about a high school student (Federico Pitzalis) who can not keep an eye out from a mysteriously beautiful young woman (played by the Dutch phenomenon Maruschka Detmers) who lives next to school. One day she watches her and his persistence pays off. There is only one problem: It is involved in a hidden character (Riccardo De Torrebruna), who may or may not commit a sinister crime, and if he regrets, he will probably be released with wrist crying. Also a young woman is a bit "funny in her head" and this is confirmed when we find out he sees the father of a boy who is a psychiatrist. Giulia's emotional instability is just balanced by her noble sexual desires. Hot, hot, hot, the words go with nice guides and a Detome bomber performance that plays us like a yo-yo (as a boy does) from scene to scene, with enough tension to guess right now - and even after - end. Available in versions R and X (!).
