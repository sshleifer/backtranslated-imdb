"Girlfight" is more of a story than a fight. And what kind of relief we can have in a town school, naturalistic, realistic Latinos, and the credible use of Brooklyn project settings. <br /> <br /> I realized that virtually all Hollywood colleges are located in luxury suburbs or small towns. (Although there are somewhat comparable "Love and Basketball" for adolescent African Americans in the suburbs.) While these children share some of the same problems with peers, these problems are shrinking compared to other battles of these children, could be a major success of their lives. <br /> <br /> The feminist element here is riveting in its originality as you hold your breath to see if it can have a relationship - and victory - under its terms. A lot of audience sympathy goes to the guy who is invited to rise to gender-bending-expectation situation. The film stretches a bit here and there, but it's no cheap thrill "Rocky" to fight the movies, because practices and struggles have complex results and all relationships - especially with fathers and fathers - characters - occupy more center stage than the center circle. <br /> <br /> At the end, there were lots of interesting music credits, but I really did not notice the songs. <br /> <br /> (originally written on July 10, 2000)
