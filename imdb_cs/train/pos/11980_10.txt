Full House was and still is a great show. It is a good show for people of all ages and is also a good family show. Such shows do not really exist. Children are very cute and although it's a bit sweet, it's still good, especially for anyone who watched him when they were a kid. I'd like to see the occupied cast. Anyone who wants to see interviews about acting cast, whether it's what they are now typical of special DVD features, should go to the Petition website and sign a petition called Full House Reunion on DVD because there is a petition for it in Hope that the cast may want to do it. Yay for the whole house!
