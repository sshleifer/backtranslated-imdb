The only thing I can say about Necromaniac / Schizophreniac 2 is ... if you are even remotely "PC" or you do not have a really confused sense of humor, you probably will not. How is this film bad and nasty, it's really a comedy and a horror movie at all. If you can appreciate someone who moves the boundaries of good taste and political correctness into the most extreme boundaries that can be imagined, until it becomes so useless that it is comical, then you have to see that you believe it. This film is so out of control that the big movie studio can not touch the 10-foot pole (with a condom at the end). In my opinion, however, the best, the most extreme works of art come from underground. If you do not keep the same old formula that people are used to seeing, then they will refuse it. I've seen piles of horrible, boring, z-grade Indy movies that were just a loss of perfect VHS or DVD-R tapes. I also saw piles of muddy bombs coming from large-name studies that were a total loss of millions of dollars. When the movie DOES NOT LOOK OUT like these two of Ron Atkins / John Giancaspro come out and throw away all the other "shock" movies all out of the water, you really have to take a second look at the entire Indy movie scene. After you see it, you can really see what freedom the Indy movie crew have when they work alone. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is, and the other people who saw this movie and "hated" to admit that they made their way all the way. I do not think it's possible for someone to get bored and watch one of these two. So if you take everything you've seen in the mainstream too seriously, and you may be laughing to see that the psychopath who suffers from puppet psychopathy that has finally jumped must be seen. You may only see it as a separate, cult classic that is. Schizophreniac / Schizophreniac 2 is one of the most popular collections of more than 1,000 DVDs.
