Jane Austen would definitely approve of this! <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow does a wonderful job that captures Emmy's attitude. She's fun without being too stupid but elegant. It's a very convincing British accent (it's not Brit, maybe I'm not the best judge, but she's been deceiving me ... she's also excellent in "Sliding Door" ... I've forgotten she's an American! > Also great are Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law (sister and mother of Emmy Thompson) as Bates women. Almost steal the show ... and Mrs Law has no lines! <br /> <br /> We highly recommend.
