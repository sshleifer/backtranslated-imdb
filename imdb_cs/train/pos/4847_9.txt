This movie is one of those nostalgic things with me, and I really do not expect anyone to "get", but I'm delighted to recommend it and somebody enjoys it. My late father hated Arthur Askey, but he really liked this movie, and his consistent enthusiasm for "The Ghost Train" and "Old Ted" Olmes "brought me as a child.A few years later I look at it again and again, enjoying I'm always interested if it's not exactly the same, but I've never been disappointed with it It's a lot of pleasure The train order is really inspired when Askey and Murdoch continue to poison the arrogant male traveler, then the whole stretch in the station (it's based on the original Arnold Ridley game from Tata's army glory!) But full of gorgeous characters - including Kathleen Harrison as a tiny Spinster The atmosphere is as close to Arthur Askey as it is available as cheap chips in the UK at D VD, so you yourself. It's a perfect Saturday / Sunday morning or everyday lazy afternoon light entertainment. Thank you .... <br /> <br /> OLD FILMS MAY BE GOOD FILMS!
