He was not sure what to expect from this film. I like to watch Brosnan in every movie, he's always good, but it was completely different. It's a mess and it's playing very well. In fact, he reminded me a few times in the uni :) So yes there is not much violence there is not a lot of action but the dialogue is cracked, the acting is great and very refreshing and it's quite funny too :) I do not think you get out of the cinema, Wow! I blew, "but you will come enjoy a good film with a smile. You can not ask more than that. <br /> <br /> And if you are lucky, some moron will give the advertisement winder wrong and you get inverted, inversely, reverse (with reversed sound) advertisements !! Brilliant. Nothing like watching Jack Daniels, where the drink returned to a bottle of glass with the horrific American commentary "Twin Peaks" :)
