Disney film, which dares to do something else, should at least be worth the effort. The "Holes" do not make the same mistakes as would be expected from Disney's film about how tough teenagers got into the camp. For the first time, the events are not explained in detail. Flash scenes really serve purpose and represent several mature themes that can surprise the viewer. I have to admit that at first I was a little delayed by the seriousness of the film. But soon I realized we had to endure these moments to see the beauty of the story. In addition to the story, this film also does a good job of questioning some of the methods used in correctional devices. (One example, where Caveman is forbidden to teach Nero to read, because he has to dig holes to build a character, as learning to read will not contribute to it). "Holes" is a movie that is smart and beautiful. He has to watch!
