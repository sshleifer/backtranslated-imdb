Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are perfectly occupied as a middle-class couple who want to build their house of dreams. Everything starts with reasonable plans and expectations, both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and blasting the original budget. There are many great laughs (though the story is a little thin) sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late 1940s in Hollywood comedy style. The decisive emphasis is when the contractor goes through the expenses he had to be quite high for the audience of 1948. As soon as he left, he assured the client (Grant) that he might have achieved a $ 100.00 reduction of the total ... or at least $ 50.00 ... but certainly $ 25.00. Hilarious!
