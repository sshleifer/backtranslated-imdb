The first two thirds of this biopic of the Betty Page fetish are very interesting. Betty, as Gretchen Mol is frankly deplored, meets with a nice girl-type who has not seen anything wrong with what she has done (and there was certainly nothing wrong with that). Director Mary Harron, who also shot "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho," recreates Betty's America by blending an old black and white serial track with new, degraded, black-and-white shots. Once Betty lands in Florida and begins work with Bunny Yeager, the color will be introduced. Betty's renown was mostly the result of her work with Paul and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, in great performance, and Chris Bauer) as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes in which Harron recreates the photos of Betty are fascinating and frantic. Primary suppliers of fetish material are not overly ambidextrous and we feel that these people are part of a tight "community". Betty never had too much trouble with her renown, though we feel that her reputation has prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the direct acting world. Since the third film is virtually non-existent, we remain with the impression that we look at a feature-length documentary on Betty Page, not a structured drama. Going aside, it's a movie that's worth capturing and featuring another fine pen in Christine Vachon's cap.
