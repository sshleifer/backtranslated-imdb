The great and underestimated Marion Davies shows her things in this late (1928) silent comedy, also performed by the great William Haines. Davies plays from Georgia, crashing Hollywood with Haines. They appear in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great dramatic star. Great puppetry at Hollywood and his claims. Davies & Haines are a great team (too bad to never have heard) and guest shots from Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Map, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn, and Marion Davies. It must be for some serious film fan or anyone interested in the ever-accused Marion Davies!
