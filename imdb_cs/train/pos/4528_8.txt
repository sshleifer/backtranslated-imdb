Although the film is clearly dated, viewers can still easily identify with Buster's unfortunate situation in this timeless and very entertaining fairytale story. Buster fights endless chances in three different age categories: in Stone Age, Roman Age, and Modern Age, playing almost the same character only by changing the scenery that helps us identify different "ages". In this film, we see one of the oldest comedic images of the stereotype "caveman," which, by its love, does not acquire a romance, but a brute force, as well as an entertaining twist on the Roman gladiator struggle, with two comic sketches long before such spoofs as Mel Brooks " : first part". The basic theme of the film is simple yet convincing: Although times may change, we still face the same struggles even in modern times that we fought in prehistoric times to "win the girl" (keep in mind the theme of 1923 America, chauvinism still en vogue). It is interesting to look at this film eighty years later and consider how dramatically things have changed from the "modern time" of this film to now.
