I've seen The Running Man several times because I'm a Stephen King fan and have all of his movies, but now it's even better because I did not know about this page until 2 days and I did not realize that Paul Michael Glaser, he was the same Paul Michael Glaser that I grew up on Starsky and Hutch on TV. It's a pleasant surprise for me, because I can not say how many times I cried when Starsky or Hutch got hurt. The episode, where Starsky (Kill Starsky) almost died, cried so hard. My father had to turn away from the show. What you can expect from a child at age 12. Now I'm deliberately looking for movies and programs involving Paul or David Soul and all that Stephen King has to do. I'm so there !!!!!!!! Just say Happy Birthday Paul !!!!!
