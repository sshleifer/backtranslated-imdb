During this movie, you may think that this movie is for children only. Well, it's mainly focused on them, but it's also rounded enough and jokes also show adults in the audience. This time the moppet gang tries to get to Broadway, with narrow departments that prevent them from getting into production, which has led to splitting. But Kermit will not stop, and his commitment keeps things moving until he gets a deal, gets in the car and sends it to amnesia! <br /> <br /> This is partly about sending those old vehicles from the 1940s with musical musicals that are actually musical themes, just here is a lot of flamboyance and wonderful moments thrown into a pot of hysterically funny moments (Boerangese fish Lou Zealand , Gonzo's water stuntman, whispering campaign, many others), but also with a big heart. Muppet writers do not have to pay for conventions, on the contrary, they are bypassed until it is almost refreshing to see such a story "let's get to the show" where he is dense and thinks the characters will fulfill their dream. <br /> <br /> Though it's not entirely original in scope as Muppet movie, it has many catchy and unforgettable songs, excellent locations throughout Manhattan, and even some intonations of interspecies dating (and marriage)! Among the stones are Liza Minneli ("The Frog?"), Elliot Gould (as a policeman), Brooke Shields (Rat Designer), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers. So get ready for singing or just laugh a lot and romantic (yes romantic) times with one of the best Muppet movies.
