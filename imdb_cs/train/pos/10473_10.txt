When I first saw this movie, I was in the wrong mind. For some reason, he clicked on all my levels, tension in the family, loneliness, and the desire to share someone's life. It did not hurt someone with whom she shared her life was such a beautiful girl as Claire (Cyndy Preston). I also bought the soundtrack of this movie (very hard to get). He loved it, and I hope he will one day come to DV
