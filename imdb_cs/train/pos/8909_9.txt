This is pretty well known, so I'm not getting too deep into it. The basic story is about two adolescents who learn about a slimy extraterrestrial blob that gets to the ground through a meteor. Human contact with this muzzle balls burns with meat as an acid. It also absorbs the human body, thereby increasing it. No one believes the teenager (Steeve McQueen and his girlfriend), and when it finally appears that the bark can not be stopped. It's really a great thing, and unlike many other 50 years, the pace is moving very fast. The story is very unique, so you have to see for every fan of old sci-fi and monster movies. If you can dig gooey gore 80th horror do not forget to look at the remake of 1988 too.
