Possible spoilers: Late-emerging camels <br /> <br /> One movie seldom sees so many gentle and unforgettable actors (almost entirely acting). Although only some of them appear, each is a gem. The British make this mix of comedians and real-life pathos better than any IMO, so it's no surprise that most of the actors are British. Music is great; (but Leslie Caron * really * played basss so well? Maybe - who knew it?) But Clio Lane was of course herself - her warm visceral sound is still turning her handle like several other jazz singers. > <br /> As an aging musician himself, not quite old and definitely not in this class, of course, it was also a stimulating film - a great movie for anyone who cares whether he is in his profession or an avocation, what can be. And, of course, a great celebration of life on the stage. <br /> <br /> I missed a bit of opening but a preliminary 9/10 - and it certainly does, we want to see the whole thing.
