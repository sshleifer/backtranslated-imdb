People tend to complain about the number of films about mentally handicapped people. I do not see it as valid criticism, no more than complaints about too many films about some sort of people. Jaco van Dormael does a great job with script and direction. Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquenne work perfectly together, with Duquenne basically playing. The film covers a surprisingly large number of events and is not simply happy to go over what was seen in "Rain Man". The end is rather depressing, but it does not break the wonderful story that came earlier. <br /> <br />
