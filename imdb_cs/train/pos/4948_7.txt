This is a superbly performed simplistic film that examines the subject and gives the audience something else to take away from it. The assumption is simple: an unknown celebrity actor (Morgan Freeman) decides to research for the upcoming role by visiting a shop and watching people. Special interest is paid to the treasurer in the pavilion "10 items or less" (Paz Vega), which has a welcoming, strong and curious presence. Both actors will win and bring a solid character dimension to what character study is. Conventional studies; each represents the worlds. The life of the treasurer is stacked in a harsh and frustrating "real world," while the actor is so entangled in his fantastic existence that he can not do simple tasks like memorizing phone numbers. She admits easily that she dresses her face when she talks to people, and that the whole matter of exploring real people shows that she is not one of them. But not only is the actor inspired by real people for his work; we also see the reverse process. Several characters recognize "Him" and refer to how he inspired them by their film roles. Al Pasar la Barca's favorite song about how a girl refuses to hide behind beauty and who rather prefer to pay (ie to do fair work) for the passage of ships could not be chosen better. It is parallel to the figure of Vega, the only trader with any brain or ambition who is willing to work hard to succeed. (That's quite an aspiration for someone who looks like Paz Vega.) It's a strange movie that probably does at sixteen. If you do not mind slow stimulus and "talky" approach, this movie will have fun. Characters are perfectly contrasting and effective acting is cute. Nice watch.
