Shawshank, Godfather, Pulp Fiction ... all good movies. Great movies. But nothing, and I do not think there's nothing in the biggest Christmas movie of all, Santa Claus. The movie is so great and has so many reports, I cried while watching. Seriously, it's one of those movies you have to watch 10 times. When we see that Pitch says he'll have to eat ice cream, we'll see sadness in his eyes and we feel deep sorrow, and then he's wondering ... what's so bad in this ice cream? Does that mean we as humans process the ice cream just as well when everything it does is a crime? You think the movie you think. <br /> <br /> This movie has the best demo of Santa Claus at all. Unlike other Santas, he is a normal person. We see him imprisoning children and spying on children's dreams, and we wonder; is Santa really well? Also, this Santa actually mentions Christ, the whole meaning of Christmas. You owe yourself to watch this movie. We should just stop making films and air only with this epic 24/7. Whether it's Christmas or not, this movie gets 500/10. Who says this movie is bad is an unconscious fool.
