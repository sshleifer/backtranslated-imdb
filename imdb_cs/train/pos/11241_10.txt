I got it, one of my most popular DVD movies recently, and as usual I just blew the whole thing while browsing. I'm a huge fan of Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack to this movie just tears me, especially in the "Will You" track. It's a pure nostalgic trip for me back to my youth. This speed is second best for Quadrophenia (also played by Phil Daniels). <br /> <br /> A great soundtrack and a great view of Britain in Thatcherite years of the gloomy 80s I grew up in. The end is so sad that I'm a stupid child after the end of the movie. I expect this DVD to wear out of repeated viewing, I can watch it again and again and never get bored, just for the soundtrack myself. <br /> <br /> Hazel, I'm sorry to hear about your father's sweetheart. God bless you. xx
