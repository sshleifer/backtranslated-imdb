House of Games is a wonderful movie on several levels. It's a great secret and a shocking thriller. He is blessed with the spectacular performances of Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegny and the strong, strong cast of supporting players and introduces Ricky Jay, a sharp extraordinary, prestigious and historic wizard. His dialogue, written by David Mamet, is spoken of as playing behavior and gives the film (in which reality is often a question) another dimension of unrealism. On his face, House of Games is a convincing look into the unknown world of scammers and men, diametrically different from The Sting, played only for charm and yuks. At this level it will succeed admirably. <br /> <br /> However, you can not escape the test at a deeper level of female odysea than satisfying professional competence to incredible strength and self realization. The only film I know about the subject of the personal power of a woman who is a good way is a suspecting private Benjamin. The film, unfortunately, distracts its focus, jumps between several themes, and explores Goldie Hawn's subtle performances after persecution. House of Games keeps its business. As Poe once said about a good story, he tirelessly directs his conclusion. There is another ghost of films about women, embodied by Thelma and Louise, with a large budget of business bankers. the contemptuous theme that women are condemned, whether they realize their inner strength. What a trick. <br /> <br /> As usual, you should see this movie in the cinema. This should be natural for film festivals. Nominate it for one of you if you can. <br /> <br /> I bought the original version of House of Games and gave it to my 23-year-old daughter. Better should see on television than not at all.
