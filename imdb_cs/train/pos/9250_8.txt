Clark Gable plays a boy who finds himself in the life of a tough woman, Jean Harlow. She tries to exhale her while pulling her away with her tough stance. Despite their cynicism and disadvantages, they fall in love. When Gable coincidentally kills a man while he's sleeping, Harlow takes the loyal Harlow into a female prison where she finds she's pregnant. Anita Loos and Howard Emmett Rogers are excellent in a number of well-resolved and surprising figures (including the Jewish socialist puppy and black woman and her preaching father playing almost stereotyped). Gable and Harlow show their purpose as actors who add awareness of the nuances and mourning to their characters, who are sending them for the role of Gable and Harlow. And direction is much better than you would expect from Sam Wood. One fine shot was put into prison by Harlow, then led to a surprisingly snowy courtyard as the camera watched her. It is one of the best of the genres of "Jewish criminals" and "women's jail" and has some of the best hardware dialogs ever written.
