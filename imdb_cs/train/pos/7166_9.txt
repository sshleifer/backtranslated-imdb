Holes, a novel, forced me into a training course. I did not think I wanted a child's novel; and the other few books I had to read in the classroom were really bad. But because of my surprise, I absolutely loved holes. It's really one of the most perfectly written novels I've ever read. I think it has a rare quality that makes it appeal to pre-teens, teens and adults. Everyone who reads it, I think, a better person will leave. While I can not say something about this movie, I'd like to say that it's mostly okay. I do not think the film's viewers will go for enrichment, but they will certainly have fun without being extravagant when they are obsessed. It's an intelligent story and it's very well said. I think it's going too fast. The novel takes more time to develop characters. And the flashbacks get so fast they do not have much time to register. Interracial romance in the past feels more clich√©s and triti than in a novel. And the end that joins all the loose threads seems to be ridiculous. It's the same in the novel, but there's a sense of absurdity that does not exist in the movie at all. It works much better. I also do not like a lot of pop songs. I wish Disney did not feel the need to sell a soundtrack. Casting is excellent, from young children to old professionals. Jon Voight is especially awesome. I do not know why we need Catwoman and Fonze. 9/10.
