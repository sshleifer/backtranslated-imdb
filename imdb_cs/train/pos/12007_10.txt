This is one of the most important films I've ever seen. I was driving about 150 people to St. George and we saw this movie at St. George's Visitor Center. No one had dry eyes in the audience. Also some non-religious and anti-Mormon people in the audience who felt the spirit of the film and were touched by compelling music and the reenactment of the story of the pioneers and the suffering they faced because of their faith. /> <br /> I recommend this film to everyone who wants to understand more about Joseph and the difficulties the pioneers have gone through. After all, it's beyond American history.
