This is a clever drama about the way of life in Texas honky tonk in the early 1980s. John Travolta and Debra Winger show two very credible shows like Bud and Sissy Davis. This film really opens the country country scene and helps to introduce America to a mechanical bull. If you love a good romantic movie, then you will love this movie.
