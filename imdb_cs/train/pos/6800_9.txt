Although the derivative, "Labyrinth" still stands as the highlight of the middle half of the six-year show. Eventually, the story allows Welling to show how he became an actor. It is not easy to play a figure that is the embodiment of "truth, justice and the American way" weekly with very little variation. His performance allowed him to show how a person could react when he realized that everything he knew could be a lie, it was quite believable. Welling picked up occasionally. As always, Michael Rosenbaum, as a "handicapped" Lex, added, like Kristen Kreuk, as too sweet-to-be-believed by Lana. Allison Mack, the ubiquitous Chloe, also scored as a "off-her-rocker" version. Using an unpleasant buzz in the background added to the tone of the installment and made for a dramatic track.
