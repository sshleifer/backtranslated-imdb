Upon returning from Christmas Eve on Christmas Eve, an abusive suburban housekeeper (Basinger) finds himself in a struggle for survival after he turns violently into disagreement with a group of juvenile delinquents. <br /> <br /> Touched by dedication directly to the DVD release here in the UK, director's debut Susan Montford may not get the recognition he deserves. It's a shame because the standard of writing, directing, and acting is really really good and surely surpasses the quality of your average straight on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger first achieves his best performance as the husband of an abusive husband (Craig Sheffer). While Sheffer is not given anything more than a threatening presence, it is in their short common scenarios that Basinger joins - shows a painful vulnerability, and at the same time indicates anger that eventually unfolds in his confrontations with youth. It's a really great, subdued performance, its transformation from victim to aggressor is fluid. <br /> <br /> Lukas Haas initially thought I was miscast because he (along with the other three youths) threatened. However, all four of the youngsters were physically more impressive, later scenes in which Basinger turned the tables against them would not work at all. The fact that these are the four average men, though slightly unshared, is the key to why the movie works just as it does. Apart from a few stimulus issues during the second half of the film and a couple of tough lines here and there, there is a great thriller that actually leaves the viewer with something to think about when the film is over. Some may be postponed by the slow burning nature of the opening scenes or the sudden ending. Sometimes brutal violence. I tell you it's a chance he deserves time before Saw V.
