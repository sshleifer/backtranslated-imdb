The film was sub-par, but this TV pilot provides a great springboard into what has become a sci-fi fan of the Ideal program. Actors deliver and special effects (for TV series) are spectacular. Intelligent interesting scenario will not hurt. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 is currently one of my favorite programs.
