I loved this mini series. Tara Fitzgerald has done an incredible job in which Helen Graham, a beautiful young woman, is hiding with her young son from a mysterious past. Like an anglofil who loves romance ... this movie was just my cup of tea and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to escape to England in the 1980s. I also have to mention that Toby Stephens, who portrays a very magnetic Gilbert Markham, is the reason why he looks at this wonderful production.
