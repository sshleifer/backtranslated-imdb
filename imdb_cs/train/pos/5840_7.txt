While the premise of the film is pretty lame (Ollie is diagnosed with "hornofobie"), the film is a nice and pleasant little movie. It's also a bit better than the movies that followed - probably since it was Laurel and Hardy's latest film from Hal Roach. In fact, it would not be a bad idea not to see any of their recent films, because in these films, all chemistry is lost, and the boys are playing their parts purely for the pathos - something real Laurel and Hardy would NEVER do. They had a bit of an edge that they missed any later films. Stan and Ollie are working in a corner factory. Sounds nice, but it's not. No wonder Ollie is going to have a nervous breakdown with the whole rocket and has some work to do. The doctor (James Finlayson - in his latest film with the team) recommends sailing by sea. However, they do not like sailing, and Stan has the idea of ​​just borrowing a ship docked - then they can get all the sea air they want without harassing! As soon as they are on the ship, dangerous escape the criminal ship and they all randomly set off into the sea. Fortunately, this part of the movie was really good and eventually worked very well. <br /> <br /> So far there was not a big long Laurel and Hardy movie, it was much better than most of them had no annoying and distracting music numbers since then (like DEVIL BABES or BABES IN TOYLAND). In addition, there is still a fair amount of physical comedy - something you almost can not see after this movie. Part of it was due to boys declining health (and Ollie's growing circumference), and part of it was due to the overall opacity of these later films.
