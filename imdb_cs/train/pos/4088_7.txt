this is out. He does not have much to say, except that he deals with the rare subject in beard movies. I see why this film has been forbidden for so long, the themes that are being dealt with in the film are still a small taboo for most of the world, saying that the eroticism in the movie is deserved and that the film's mood is. It's a good movie that is very effective and serves the purpose ... to shock the viewer and to cross the borders we often do not see in movies. I came to a movie that I thought I could see. I liked the movie because it's provocative and somewhat erotic. Something you often see in movies today.
