Although she is little known today, Deanna Durbin was one of the most popular star of the 1930s, a pretty teenager with a perfect personality and a very admired opera singing. This year 1937 was her first major film and proved to be a box-office bonanza for Cold Universal Studios. Three SMART GIRLS are about three daughters of a divorced couple who are rushing to their long, invisible father when they are still - a faithful mother reveals that she can soon get married - with the firm intention of undermining her girlfriend and returning her to her mother. Though the story is mild, the script is funny and professional cast plays with a clean touch. Durbin has a pleasant voice and an appealing personality and such a pleasant actor as Charles Winninger, Alice Brady, Lucile Watson and Mischa Auer. And ultra-light entertainment for Gary F.
