I'm not sure I can understand where all those enthusiastic people who are constantly on their way are talking here, maybe it's just that some people want to talk about things. The film was certainly imperfect (unequal acting, some may have difficulty with time changes, actors who are too willing to go to places that I really would not like to go, etc.) but there were some things that IMHO had to overcome imperfections. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, I wished "violation of the rules". NORMALLY, when you leave a haunted house, baddies leave you lonely, giving you time to regroup, get friends and find a token mysterious paranormal type. NORMALLY (sem-spoiler alert) when you are hiding under the covers, they can only get you through the small hole you see. Normally at the end, the scarecrows have become somewhat less scary because you've found out they're simply misunderstood or dismissed or anything. Secondly, the production was exceptional. While the film was barely a special effect-loaded supernatural pieces, while the short ones were very well done. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best movie for those who think that Freddy and Jason are the ultimate horror (nothing against them) but great for those who have come to consider conventions for granted and who do not have problems with time deformations.
