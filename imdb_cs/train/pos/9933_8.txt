If you find yourself in the need to escape, something that captures you for two hours and allows you to be lost in another world, Domino will satisfy this need. That's fun after all! The plot keeps your brain moving - one of those movies (like Usual Suspects) where you want to see it a second time to solve it all. I was thinking about Domino Harvey herself, as her life became Hollywood's interest. As for acting, a lot of personalities do not appear in trailers. And every actor who forces me to forget who they are is doing well. I never thought of Kier in football uniform or pirate costume. And granted, Mickey Rourke plays Mickey Rourke well and often, but here, despite violence, shows that he is capable of caring for other people.
