If anyone asks whether a cinema is an artistic form, you can do worse than showing them on this movie. <br /> <br /> It is simply the perfect combination of story, script, actors, and cinematography that has ever made celluloid. The story of a convicted bomber pilot whose English conductor dropped out of the English mist during the Second World War, and his subsequent brushes with celestial offices (or in his head) is played with David Niven and Kim Hunter, and is incredibly touchy - especially in introductory scenes where the convicted pilot (Niven) describes his situation with the land radio operator (Hunter). enhanced by Jack Cardiff shooting and incredible production. The highest touches extend to the sky images that appear in the black and white and terrestrial scene introduced in Technicolor - even mentioned by the heavenly conductor (fantastic Marius Goring). <br /> <br /> Not only the peak in British cinematography, but the peak in the cinema, the season.
