I'm not John Cleese completist (although I thought "Fawlty Towers was brilliant), but I'm a fan and when I saw this encounter, neglected, on a shelf on my local Blockbuster, I decided to try. it was amazing surprise and one of the most amazing 50 minutes of viewing experiences I've ever had. Writing is a typical English "goon show" schtick, actually as an audio skit, it would not be out of place on the "Firesign Theater" album, but executions and timing is in place, and this promotes "Strange Case" on the type of jaw dropping that can create lifelong British comedy fanatics, a donor for combining widely satirical lampons with carefully watched "tikes" of character and timing, and the creators here use both effects. Holmes "apparently owes much to Arkin and the seller to" Inspector Clouseau, "but Cleese has such a talent for a physical comedy that but unexpected treatment here is Arthur Lowe, who plays "Watson" as a brilliant but incomprehensibly incomprehensible imbecile with such great timing and delivery that he will become the best aspect of the film. I have never heard of Lowe (his background seems to be vaudeville and musical theater), but he justifies his whole career with this performance as far as I am concerned. Some people do not have to care for a "Special Case ...", especially if the British fluffy is not their "Cuppa Tea". But I'm so glad I saw it before she disappeared from sight.
