And one more way to South Park ends. It was not such a strong episode as I had hoped but the Night of Living Homeless was a stronger finisher than Stanley's Cup, Tsst, Bloody Mary, or Erection Day. Still can not keep the candle on Woodland Critter Christmas and Goobacks, but few episodes can. The Night of Living Homeless is a spoof of a zombie genre made in the way just South Park would think of. Instead of people who eat zombies are homeless people who have changed and seem to have survived. Randy and other residents are blocked in the community center, although this time on the roof where they can explore the scene. A particularly funny moment is when one member discovers that his house is gone, and he becomes homeless, so Randy has no choice but to shoot him. Meanwhile, the four boys went on to solve this problem. the whole story of a homeless takeover that tried to convey a message, but he was seriously uninterested. South Park is in the best times when it's ridiculous. Matt and Trey played safe this week and did not really criticize the homeless problem, but they just testified. The shocking moment of an episode comes when a scientist shoots in an effort to avoid homeless people. This is the first time that suicide itself in South Park goes wrong and we watch how the poor man has missed his brain and tried to fire many times while he painfully dies. Another inspired moment of South Park. <br /> <br /> Overall, this episode was fun, but it was not great by keeping a real comment about the homeless and sticking directly to the zombie shtick. The end is a bit funny, but nothing new. Now we have to wait until October for another batch of episodes. It's a long route, but South Park must be an applause because it's running. The show seemed to have exhausted the couple in the last season, but now it's full.
