Maybe I'm really one of the few people who really joined this movie. I also saw this movie when it came out, and I agree with the last post that Up The Acedemy was ahead of us. The humor in the movie is pure magazine MAD. I do not understand why MAD is behind this feature. It was also one of the few films from the early 1980s, when the assassin accompanied the soundtrack with the punk and the new wave band, which arose during L.A. I own my own soundtrack and I keep playing it up to this day. What can I say? There are definitely the worst movies out there. I do not think Porky as entertaining as Up Academy, there are really good laughs in the whole movie, and the jokes are either stereotypes or the way they are laid. Hey, no one said it would be a Maltese falcon.
