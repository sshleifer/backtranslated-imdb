Elvira, Mrs. Temnota, is a fun, horror comedy in which the fourth wall smashes several times and jokes are often under the navel. And Cassandra Peterson's breasts become their own character. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is a horror guest who learns to inherit her aunt Morgan. So he goes to the town of Fallwell, which controls the most terrifying monster ever dressed in the country: Moral Comedy. The strong look of Elvirasu is, of course, too strong for prunes, but children from the city will kick off their different approach to life. And, of course, there is even more sinister evil, her uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard), who is after the book of the magic of Elvira's mother. Look, Elvira is a real witch, she just does not know. But what it is, Elvira is a pretty funny movie, although the script leaves much room for improvement. Most laughs come from the difference between Elvisa and people of good morals, but there are also some good visual gags. It's all right in all directions, but it never happens more than that. Overall, it's a good, deliberately camp comedy. If you like it, that's it.
