Her shame that she did not get on the screen, by far the best part in the film is the girl on the cross, the best part of the film. She had much more influence than Avril, or just someone else in the movie. Almost made S / M look like fun! She was truly credible, she has a S / M model who is afraid of her situation. Though it seems they have really messed up a kind of dreamy feeling that they are looking for a bad guy, these kits have been very well built, but they just kind of grim the surface of what was shot. This is one movie that should be available. They seem to have left much of what was shot, and almost all the really dark things that would make the movie much more dementuous. Its kind, as if it did not stop above the mark they were going through during filming. What was shot would not have been rated R, probably NC-17 or X, but it would be necessary to shoot the movie the way it should be.
