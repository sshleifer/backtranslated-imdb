Not really. But this movie is very funny. He came and saw it with his girlfriend last night and had to use "I think there might be something in my eye" routine. The film is a great combination of comedy and typical romance. Jim Carey is great as a lucky reporter who has the power to change himself and the city he lives in. In fact, all the characters are great. The film is not too humorous or poor, a good move that can be seen with your wife. <br /> <br /> All in all 8/10 .... note * I'm not an easy grader. That's all from BigV over and out!
