It must be the best adaptation I've seen that's my favorite, and I think it's very close to the book. What really does this has to be seen even though it is the cast of two major actors. Wonderful Timothy Dalton is the best Rochester I saw on the screen awkward and tragic, while Zela Clarke is the perfect combination of strength, courage, shyness and subtlety like Jane. The story (as most people know) is that, young and simple Jane Eyre is a teacher at a Charity School for Girls in 1800 who advertises her services as a governess in the newspaper. Governor in the Thornfield Hall, to teach Adele the young department of the halls, the mysterious and respected owner of Mr. Rochester. As the moon continues, she falls in love with Jane and puts into action several situations to try to find out if Jane is as madly in love with him as she does with her. However, there is a secret that is still waiting for the discovery at Thornfield Hall and when it's effects are devastating. This is a moving and well-behaved drama with a nice location and beautiful costumes plus as I have previously said excellent acting, especially Zelah and Timothy.
