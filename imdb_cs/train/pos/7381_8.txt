IVAN (Marco Ricca) and GILBERTO (Alexandre Borges) are partners in the company together with ESTEVÃO (George Freire), but the first to conclude a contract with the professional killer ANISIO who kills ESTEVÃO (conspiracy, at least in the beginning, t explains very well why). The guy does that, and when he gets his money, he starts to blackmail two partners who appear in his company and say he wants some work (like a tutor or something?). At the same time, she meets Marine (Mariana Ximenes), the daughter of ESTEVE, and begins to walk with her! <br /> <br /> In such a story, where crime, corruption, betrayal and extortion goes hand in hand, nobody is innocent or can be a victim, with the exception of MARINA who is the only person to know what is going on and nobody betrayed ? This film portrays sarcasm a sad and cruel reality that exists in a large metropolis like São Paulo, where crime is a daily presence. We feel the irony, but also the credibility of the character like ANISIO (brilliantly played by Paulo Miklos), who blacks out the people who paid him without scruples and even flirting with the daughter of the man he killed! It has to be really nonsense to do something like that, but of course I know there are people like him, in Brazil or somewhere else? <br /> <br /> It's a very good movie, cruel but true, about a sad reality? Acting is great as well as soundtrack.
