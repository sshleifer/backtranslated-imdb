All the talents Mr. Sooraj Barjatya showed in his first three films, I thought it was all an accident because his fourth Main award diwani hoon was so bad. But I must say it was not a coincidence. This guy is talented and the way Vivah was doing is just great. From the first scene it affects you. the sequences between the shahid and the amrit are amazing. Chemistry between these two actors gives a glimpse of a snake and a kajolem. As usual, Alok Nath is a good and loving father fantastic, so is Anupam Kher. But it's Shahid-Amrita movie. Amrita looks good in most scenes, although Shahid looks a little young to get married but does a good job as a shy but morally strong groom. this film will especially appeal to those who have experienced such beautiful moments of their life. Everybody's a great movie. hats from Mr. Sooraja Barjatya ...
