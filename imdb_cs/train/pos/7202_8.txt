Long before "Brokeback Mountain" (about 23 years earlier), "Deathtrap" was the first time I saw two men passionately kissing on the canvas, and frankly, I was shocked. I understood it in terms of conspiracy, and it really did not change (too much), but it was the first time I ever saw it, at least in the "mainstream" of the film. I thought it was a real step for your time, and he took the courage to try them, especially Christopher Reeve, in the middle of his time as PG-rated Superman. Male bisexuality on the screen may have struck its "Brokeback", but it is interesting to note that this much earlier incarnation.
