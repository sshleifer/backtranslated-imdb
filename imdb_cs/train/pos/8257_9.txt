He had just seen the World Prize of Fido at the Toronto International Film Festival and he enjoyed it thoroughly. Here we have a welcome overhaul of the genre that we generally consider to be a pioneer (definitely "extensive and successful") by George Romer. But it is a Canadian film by a Canadian director and it's a comedy! And, YES, actually, I think it's better than "Shawn of the Dead". A thoroughly believable, and perhaps even more important, pleasant performance by Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and young actor K'Sun Raya, which I believe will look much more in the future. However, I must admit that I kindly took Tim Blake Nelson as Mr. Theopolis' neighbor, who basically played the willing animated version of Victor Van Dorto from Corps Bride (or those who saw the movie, which is even better read as Corpse Pride ?) and, of course, Scottish actor Billy Connolly in his least animated but somewhat deep role as the titles. He just thought he would not have this role if Peter Stormare's commitments were not to Prison Break (as was evident from the pre-screening screening on Thursday night). I can not help but think that the screenwriters had to draw a lot of inspiration from the Day of the Dead zombie 'Bub'. I'm not interested in ever revealing details of the plot during the comment and I will not begin. It is enough to say that Fido is NOT one of those quiet, graphically horrible zombie films you can rely on Romero. Rather, it's a movie that will constantly giggle you, and though (and I had to think carefully to be sure) there is a fair amount of blood-leanness and violence, a pleasant humor enhanced by the surrealist environment created by director Curri and his coworkers, way to make it look like a feature that should be rated PG-13. I urge you to visit this little Canuck gem. I'm sure to buy a DVD as soon as the next summer.
