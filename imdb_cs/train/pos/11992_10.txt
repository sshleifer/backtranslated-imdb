From the moment I remember, I loved the planes and they were flying. I am now at a college with a private pilot license and I'm trying to become a commercial. I could never remember why I was so obsessed until I came to my old Tail Spin cartridges in my basement at home, and it struck me. My parents bought every cassette they had, and it was the only show I would like to see as a child. When I grew up, I remembered the subject and I can quote again today. It's absolutely awesome and I plan to buy a DVD soon! It's really great for kids and adults and it's totally timeless. I can not get enough of this show.
