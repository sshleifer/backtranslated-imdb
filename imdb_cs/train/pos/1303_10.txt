Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker reunited to play all of their songs 35 years ago when they created a trio called "Cream." It was the psychedelic days of England and America, and these guys looked like: all skinny, very long hair, wild dresses and loud music. They play a combination of rock and blues music, and it was mostly good. <br /> <br /> Well, these guys are now 60 years old and they can still sing and play at a high level as this wonderful DVD concert disc shows us. I have always been extremely familiar with Clapton, of course, who has never been out of focus, but I did not know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, neither of whom I have not seen for decades. I was surprised. When he was young, Baker was so frantic that he looked like a quick rage near death. Now it looks healthy, shaped, and the drum game is solid. Bruce looked a little embarrassed, but his voice is great, as good as ever, and with pleasure to hear on those old songs. This is just great material and plays from people who know what they are doing. Some people have criticized this show for being low profile. I do not agree with that. I have no complaints. The concert sounded very good. The second song "Spoonful" was an excellent, top concert for me. <br /> <br /> We are highly recommended.
