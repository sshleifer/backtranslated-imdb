"California" is one of my most popular films and is easily referred to as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 1990s. The film has a very stylish surface, but behind it are a lot of disturbing and sincere images of murderous maniacs and the terrifying violence they cause to others. One of the most powerful aspects of the movie is his performances, Brad Pitt is surprisingly great as a trailer-shirts psycho named Early. Pitt smiles his horrible figure almost flawlessly. Juliette Lewis plays as well as her naive girlfriend, her innocence is almost heartbroken. "California" has a very simple conspiracy that goes up evenly and slowly for about an hour, but suddenly sinks into the inborn murder as Pitt unleashes his psychotic personality. There are lots of shocking scenes, and it all stands atop the energy house that will chase you for days. "California" is a movie that should really be watched because it's an intense view of how gigantic a human being can be, not just because it's violence and gore.
