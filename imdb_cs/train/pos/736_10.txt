It must be for every punk rocker, a movie that made The Ramones household name back in the early 1980s (when it first appeared on premium cable stations). It was one of the first and best American Punk Rock movies, with a classic classical stand there with The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Originally, the producers wanted a cheap trick as the stars, but the release of the album "Live At Budakon" just made them superstars and too hot items to make in a low budget movie. Great luck for Ramones, who wanted to break out of the underground punk rock world and into the mainstream market (which has never happened until the fall of bands). The band, Dee Dee in particular, has never loved the film over the eighties but fans have always loved and could recite most of the film while waiting for Ramones to enter. This movie, like most classic, is stupid fun with some classic Ramones shots in their bloom. Do not expect more, you will not find it. It's great fun, so enjoy it. Another classic Allan Arkush in a similar way is Get Crazy, featuring Lee Ving from the legendary hardcore punk band Fear.
