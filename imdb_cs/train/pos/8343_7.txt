Australian Fred Schepisi (A Cry in the Dark) drives this comedy / romance that is fun, relaxing and set in the spring. While watching this movie you will laugh. Tim Robbins is an auto-mechanic, Ed Walters, with high IQ, with Albert Einstein, Walter Matthau (Grumpy Old Men) and his academic friends Nathan, Kurt and Boris. You can tell them their forefoot shoes. Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle, you have mail) is Catherine Boyd, Einstein's niece, who is a competent, but not so sure mathematician. Perhaps it is because it is surrounded by the whole ingenious state. He thinks that if he marries someone with a high I.Q. her children will have a high I.Q. also, but does not know what he wants. Between Tim Robbins with a cute smile and Meg's cuteness, it's a refreshing film. I love sweet stories. People of all ages should enjoy this movie. Catherine is engaged to jar James Moreland, who works in animal behavior but is very darn. It is the love that is typical of the first sight, between the mechanic and the mathematician. Funny lines and subliminal lines! The cinema is nice. Princeton, New Jersey is beautiful in the spring. With great help from all the great men, Catherine falls to Ed without knowing she's a car mechanic. Favorite scenes: Ed with choosing a crowd selection with Einstein, Nathan, Kurt and Boris. Ed and Einstein go on a motorcycle. Nathan, Kurt, and Boris left all the research animals for free! Favorite quotes: Albert Einstein: "Do not let your brain interfere with your heart." Ed Walters: "When was the last time said" Wahoo "?" Catherine Boyd: "Well, I'm sure I do not know". It's a refreshing movie, I recommend it. I have a cassette and once and for a while I'll watch her again.
