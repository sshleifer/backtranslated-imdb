It was quite a decent movie. This movie is good just to sit and watch and be entertained. Just a typical Hollywood movie. This movie will never win an Oscar or anything and certainly does not deserve it, but I thought it was quite good. It's something like show 24 but in movie format. If you like it all, we have to stop the terrorist from killing the presidential type of film, then you will enjoy this movie. I personally think the story was done too, but The Sentinel adds a little twist with a mole in secret service. Overall, this film will not leave your jaw on the floor or change your life, but who says each movie must be so good to be good?
