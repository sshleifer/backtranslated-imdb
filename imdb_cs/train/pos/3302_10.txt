Perhaps the most polished and finalized of all Indian films - Pakeezah does not fall into any trap commonly associated with Bollywood (ie, Adhesion, Frustration, Wholesale, and unsuccessful imitation of Western film themes / genres). Pakeezah is indigenous to the Sub-Continent and authentic, almost Madam Butterfly-like conspiracy. Characters are well-developed, they are heading, although sometimes they are not enough to today's standards, receptive and convincing. Urdu-speaking environment at the time of Pakeezah was a championship of underestimation and how the dialogue delivers the finesse of age! Actor's acting (especially "appearance" and dynamics between characters) are a pleasure to look at, although the nuances of contemporary audiences or those who are not familiar with the customs and customs of Muslim India may be lost. <br /> <br /> The captivating script is a beautiful musical score, complemented by a protagonist who has an excellent reputation for classical Indian dance (kathak). As with most romantic tragedies, the heroine must die, but it does not leave its viewers without the audience feeling it's part of a truly unforgettable cinema experience. Pakeezah is surely the pinnacle of what the Indian cinema produced and is unlikely to be parallel.
