This movie is great. It's fun from start to finish, you'll always be on the edge of your place for the whole movie. In my opinion, this film is highly criticized by critics. Sly perfectly suits the role of well-trained mountain rescue guy Gabe Walker. Together with him, Michael Rooker performs great like Hal Tucker. And then, John Lithgow, one of the best performances I've seen on him as a villain. And the fact that 75% of the film takes place on a mountain with a lot of bad people makes it a way for a lot of action! <br /> <br /> Brilliant movie!
