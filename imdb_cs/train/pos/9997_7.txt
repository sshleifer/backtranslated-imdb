Life Stinks (1991) was a step behind other Mel Brooks productions. He played as a wealthy man who is doing a mad bet with his "friends." Brooks claims he can live a month like a homeless. His shocked and entertaining friends will accept this unusual bet. During her "stay" at Bowery she meets a group of strange homeless people, one of whom is getting ready for her fantasy (Lesley-Ann Warren). They recognize friendship when they teach him the many tricks she has learned while living on the street. Can Mr. Brooks himself survive without the luxury of being dirty? Will this unorthodox bet win? Who are his real friends? Find out if you look at LIFE STINKS to find out! <br /> <br /> This movie was unjustly destroyed. Certainly it's not a classic like its earlier movies, but it's still nice. I liked Mel Brooks's giving to Charles Chaplin in this film. If you watched Chaplin's earlier silent films, you'll also get humor. <br /> <br /> We recommend fans of Mel Brooks.
