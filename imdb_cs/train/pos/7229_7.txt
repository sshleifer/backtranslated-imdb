Cat and mouse are involved in the usual times when Jerry dives into a bottle of invisible ink and finds it to disappear. Instead of using the opportunity to spy on a girl's dress or something, she uses her newly discovered invisibility to torture Tom. And it's quite funny and rather inventive even though it's a bit of a wit cartoon. And the action never leaves the interior of the house, which is usually a feature of the under-average T & J shorts. Still worth 7/10. However, I'm not sure how an invisible mouse can place a shadow on a wall, resists physics and the very essence of being invisible.
