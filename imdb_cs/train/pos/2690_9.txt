La Teta i la Luna describes the life of a 9-10 year old boy called Tete, who is obsessed with breasts growing up in Catalonia. I love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human, just like all the characters in the films Bigas Luna (also director Jamon, Jamon). Tete reminded me of how intuitive and exciting life can be at this age. Also, Catalonia (northeast of Spain) has brought me a lot of memories. This film shows how beautiful Catalunya is, dear people, a nice life and especially a lot of unstable people.
