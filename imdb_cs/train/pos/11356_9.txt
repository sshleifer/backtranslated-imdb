It's an excellent movie. There are many things: serial killer hunting, bureaucracy of Soviet Russia, one man's drive, and the relationship between this man (the detective leader) and his superiors. The most important thing about me is the relationship between Durok (Rea) and Fetis (Sutherland) (apologize for bad spelling, please!). For some reason he moves when he sees his development from hostility and an offense that becomes respect and chamber and cooperates. One line in the film sums up: "He would say something funny, but he was overcome by emotion." The excellent working of all occupants, even the smallest, was done with credibility. <br /> <br /> This is not a fast action thriller; in fact it sometimes moves like a slow drama, but it is worth it. Very satisfying and not abusive crimes at all. <br /> <br />
