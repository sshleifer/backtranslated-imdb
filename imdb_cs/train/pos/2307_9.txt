I must say that this movie is really amazing and heart. Reese Witherspoon is so charming and Jason London is not that bad! it's so sweet to watch Dani fall in love and break my heart and yet heats my heart at the same time as she looks at the court to fall in love with Maureen. but she is even sweeter and watches as she cares about Dani. I have to admit that I too wanted him to fall for Dani. it's so cute watching her fall for him I did not want her heart to break so badly. but the greatest tragedy I've ever seen has appeared in this movie. watching him die to cry all day. I could not believe it. however, no love relationship has ever been discovered in the film than Maureen and Dani. they really can do something. I give this movie 9 because I did not want the court to die, but it was still one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen.
