I really enjoyed this movie because I have a husband like that guy in this movie. This film is about Lindsey, who meets Ben in the middle of the winter when there is no baseball season. She falls in love, but when she comes in the spring, she gets a shock from her life when she's stepped a step further down her pedestal that Ben did her. <br /> <br /> It's a funny movie with all the baseball obsessions that Ben has. She can not separate from what she loves most, that's what makes it so funny and why so many women can relate to Lindsey in real life. Also, people with baseball games are as obsessive as he. <br /> <br /> It's a funny movie and you will not strike if you rent this one.
