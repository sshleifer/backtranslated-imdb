this movie probably had a budget of $ 750 and still managed to overcome Titanic. I rented it the day I hit my mother's mother and it was the only thing that was swearing to me! It must be tied to 'Assault of the Killer Bimbos'. Things to look for are: 1. Driving in the morning girl of the Chinese girl scene 2. Blonde blonde in a sasha shirt that will never change 3. Flinstone-like screech of the ride 4. The headset wearing a red head just before gets killed (do not worry, I will not ruin any surprises because it's so predictable) 5. Anyone who thinks it necessary to scream. 6. Mentally ill, who plays a convincing job that he is crazy by exhaling his eyes from the manicure. 7. An hour of long persecution at the end, involving teachers and priests. 8. Woman writing graphite on bathroom wall. 9. Finally, last but not least, wonderful special effects - especially ringing in the ring that caused that ... heaven help me ... popping the noise. <br /> <br /> Enjoy! <br /> <br />
