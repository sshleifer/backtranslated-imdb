It must be admitted that Dev has an eye for beauty and talent. He found a successful Zeenat Aman model as well as a former winner of the title of beauty of the competition, which made her a role adapted to her debut. Her face, a stone look and her swaying on hypnotic music, immediately loved her viewers. This movie is a charming sight, with picturesque places, ethnic people, Buddha temples and corncaps, the naughty Mumtaz, who looks quite attractive, with his ethnic dress and dance skills. Dev is, of course, adorable and this is one of his commercially successful performances. Hare Rama can keep his interest, with careful written script, editing and compelling music. Like Des Pardes, his next film, Anand dealt with the topic of young people who have become accustomed to drug addiction, and their theories of disturbed families and aggravated childhood are quite likely. A good entertainer, this film keeps its freshness up to this day!
