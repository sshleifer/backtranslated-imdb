(spoilers) <br /> <br /> I did not know what to think about the movie. It's not a kid's movie. She should definitely be watched with her parent because it includes death and dying. But I was surprised to have a little fun. I was a little disappointed with the 81 minutes we had. (even less without credits) And the trailer will make you think that the rodent is the main creature. Unfortunately, they tortured him. Even to the end of the movie. The two grips docked a 2-star movie. But I recommend the movie. Even for continuation. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br />
