Another attempt by modern Japanese directors to redefine the chambara genre. Successful and not to varying degrees. The Buddhist monk has a vision to kill the legendary (and very active) demon on the Gojoe Bridge to reach enlightenment. While not in the forefront, Buddhist thinking is the heart of this film, just as Kurosawa is "Ran". Probably what attracted me most, although it is now near the "Ran" League. <br /> <br /> Stylish visual direction and excellent photos keep the film very interesting for two hours and eighteen minutes. Leading actors are equally outstanding. Music is really good. Two weaknesses are story and battle scenes. The film stretches in the middle, which could be solved with some cautious adjustment. And combat scenes are mostly shot in blurred detail. It works for most of the movie, but the final feels like a scam. Another such recent film is "Seven Swords" by Tsui Hark, a great movie, but promising fighting scenes are disappointing. Asano does not really move like a sword with a demon, his acting is great, but he will also be in the traditional combat scene of the chambara. A good movie, it will probably be interesting not to expect traditional combat swords.
