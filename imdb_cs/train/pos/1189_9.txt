The last hunt is one of the few westerns ever made to deal with Buffalo hunting, both as a sport and as a trade and as a way to win the Indian wars. Before the Caucasian man put his foot on the other side of the Mississippi, the plains became the American bison's herd as big as some of our biggest cities. At the time of the last hunt, all were buffalo, but they were destroyed. The 20th century, thanks to the efforts of conservationists, saw the recovery of this species, but not as hard as it once was. Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger play together in the second film and this is far better than all the brothers were great. Here Stewart Granger is a good man, a kidnapped buffalo hunter, who has to return to work he hates for financial reasons. The partner he chose to throw is Robert Taylor. I forgot about Taylor for a moment, I doubt if she was ever bigger, more stupid than Charlie Gilsen, who would portray Taylor. In Devil's Doorway, he was an American Indian who fought against the prejudice caused by racist Louis Calhern. In The Last Hunt there's a racist. They kill buffalo and Indians for pure pleasure. Kills one Indian family when they steal their shells and take a widow's widow. Just as a barbarian conqueror expects the delight of Debra Paget's sexual favors. In fact, he's upset when Paget does not see it. No matter how often Russ Tamblyn behaves like a half-circle, I have never been convinced that there is an Indian part. It's the only weakness I found in The Last Hunt. However Lloyd Nolan, the old buffalo old buffalo horse Taylor and Granger brings along is great. Nolan steals every scene in which he is occupied. <br /> <br /> For those who like their western real who want to see Robert Taylor's side never seen on the screen and who do not like cheap heroism, The Last Hunt is the ideal hunt.
