Dark Angel is the cross between Huxley's Brave New World and Percy's love in ruins - it portrays the not too distant future as a disturbing mixture of chaos and order, in the worst sense. Once he conceives the premise that all modern technologies can be interrupted by "Pulse", he provides a fun landscape for exploring personalities and relationships between two main characters - Max (Dark Angel / Bike Messenger) and Logan (Rich Rebel). It seems to be uneven, perhaps the result of a number of authors, but it keeps her energetic, beautiful and charming Jessica Alba, who looks both strong and desperate and sensitive. I think Fox did it again.
