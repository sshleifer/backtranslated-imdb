It must be one of the best, if not the best films I've seen, very, very long. She had enough measures to satisfy the fans, and yet the plot was very good. I really liked the movie and I had it from beginning to end. She added blood and gore, but she brought the realistic nature of what happened to the front of the movie, and even had a tear jerker to end up for many people I should think. <br /> <br /> This has to be tracked for everyone. Many reviews have been seen, the film has reversed, but to be fair, most of the films that received bad reviews turned out to be some of the best. this proves it again. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie, buy this movie, just go out and watch this movie. You will not be disappointed.
