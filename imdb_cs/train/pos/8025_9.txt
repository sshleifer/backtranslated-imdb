I love this movie. songs and stories are very fun. and the song "say goodbye" always moves me. what a great thing you want to do to make puppets to life so that you really care about these things made of fabric and fabric and everything. great voices and great talent. why were all the other crazy movies that came after this much less interesting, moving and entertaining? it's Mr. Mr. henson is just as missed?
