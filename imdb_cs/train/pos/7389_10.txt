No awards can please all people. Sure, if your favorite movies did not get you, you say the show was not very good. That is understandable. However, the 74th Annual Academy Awards will be remembered for one magical moment of Hollywood history: <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's first appearance at the Academy Award. </ p> <br /> <br /> Allen often avoids prizes as self-aggrandizing and unnecessary, and never participated - although he won several honors. <br /> <br /> When the 74th Academy Award was that the nation still mourned the loss of life at the fall of the World Trade Centers in New York. When it was time to pay tribute to New York City, they decided to show the video from big city moments. Then the reporter simply said, "Ladies and gentlemen, the director of Woody Allen has been honored by Oscar." The site exploded in an extremely long ovation. The entertainment industry finally got its applause for a New York man who usually avoids the Hollywood scene. When the applause vanished, Woody used some of his legendary jokes about this situation. > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> he joked. "I'm panicked because the pawnshop has not worked for ages and I have no way of getting something." "But it was not, I could not fix it because my film was not nominated for anything this year and then hit me - maybe they were called to apologize." <br /> <br /> Allen also revealed why he overlooked his lifelong the Oscar aversion for this one special night. /> <br /> "I would do anything in New York, so I got tux and came here," Allen said. "It's a great, great movie city, it was a great, moving and exciting background for movies and it remains a great, big city." <br /> <br />
