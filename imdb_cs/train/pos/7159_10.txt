Louis Sachar is a convincing kids classic like Disney as Freddy Krueger. It's murder, racism, face frenzy and killer lizards. <br /> <br /> Tightly defined, it is a multilayered, interconnecting story that spreads history to reveal Stanley's own heritage and secrets behind the holes. It comes from Latvia with lush greenery to the lakes marked Camp Green Lake (help: there is no lake or green). Disney's first success is to convincingly re-create the environment of the novel - the design set is excellent and glossy. The second plus is cast. Outgoing star Shia LaBeouf (Charlie's Angels 2, Greenlight Project) does not have to be a thick boy of a book, but his attitude is right and is far from the usual pure hero. The rest of the cast is filled equally well, from Patricia Arquette as Frontier School of Marble-Reversed-Bank robber Henry Winkler as Stanley's Dad. The downside is the pop soundtrack - a clean marketing department - and the sentiment eventually reached full volume.
