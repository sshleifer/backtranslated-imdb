Everyone we meet influences our thinking, changes our ways, a little man shakes us. The "Eighth Day" deals with this theme (cf. "Rainmaker"). In this film, Harry (Daniel Auteuil), a sales psychologist, meets with Georges (Pascal Duquenne), a child of Down's syndrome who is on the run. The winning performances of both of these actors give this film its main strength. The introductory sequence is excellent when Georges relates to his theory of the creation of the world, and in the final scene we find out what God created the eighth day. In the story there are some moments that are very frustrating to Harry. For example, Georges, who is totally unlimited, requires a pair of expensive shoes and does not have enough money. It's kind of a scene where you laugh with tears. I liked scenes where Down's Syndrome group had gone to the art gallery to escape the bus and crash of Paradis Paradise Amusement Park. The most humorous of all embarrassment is the scene where Harry and Georges ride on the highway on horseback, and Georges looks back and gives the driver a heartfelt greeting. But there are some fine scenes, especially the impressive use of hand-hand details that feel the sun, wind and rain, hands reach, hands touching and clinging to love and friendship. This is a true cinema that touches the heart. There are very moving scenes where Georges suggests Nathalie, where Georges holds Harry's head in his arms, where Georges still calls for his dear mother, where Georges teaches Harry to laugh. I felt deep in the movie that life was beautiful - the very presence of grass (Did you know it screamed when you cut it?), Trees overhead, birds song, little insects - all natural miraculous creatures. Everyone is there to look forward to lying back (like Harry and Georges) looking around us and listening to ...... Beautiful movie.
