I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen, and besides being a feature film (a real fan wants to see how little he misses as much as possible, and that can only be achieved in a mini-series), it was really great. Gwyneth Paltrow really captures a slightly crazy but well-intentioned rich girl and Jeremy Northam IS Mr. Knightly with his poetry and nobility. I was not excited about Ewan McGregor, though I like him very much as an actor, but I did not feel that the film would ever spoil it. As I said, as a fan of Jane Austen there were things I would like to see including those that were not, but it would do much longer than allowed for a feature film and as it was, I felt they really encapsulated the story well. I saw every adaptation of this book and I felt it was the best!
