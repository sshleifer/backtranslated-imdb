You know the story - a group of courageous fans enter a competition they seem to have no chance to win - it's a story that Hollywood has done to death (Bring it, Karate Kid, Escape to Victory, Best Best, etc.). Now Korea is going to go with the Taekwondo team fighting for glory? and guess what? the result is predictable but eventually satisfactory. The fact that this film does not look on his face is up to a talented young cast who really cares about the characters, and you keep track of it all the way to the end. Can the fans of your typical martial arts movie be disappointed? Taekwondo does not provide the usual wound of motion and acrobatics seen in most Kung Fu films; The action is limited to (though impressive) kicking and occasional strike. But it does not matter because it is the interaction of the characters and their struggle for something that makes this film a success.
