This movie is a very clever humor, parody and tribute to the actor. After some time, however, it seems to be a style exercise (no matter how big the gag, such as Balasko going on in the Dussolier section and the very good acting of all those involved) and I was wondering why Blier made this film. Everything is revealed at the conclusion when Blier, who runs Claude Brasseur, gets a phone from his father (Bernard Blier) - from heaven and gets a chance to say how much he misses. Effective emotional and, of course, sincere. But there is not enough dramatic tension or emotional engagement to make the rest of the movie interesting throughout the run. Some really nice scenes and sequences and someone who likes these "mosntres sacr√©s" from French cinematography should enjoy the film.
