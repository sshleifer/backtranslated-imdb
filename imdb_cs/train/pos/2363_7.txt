This adaptation of MR James's Short Story "Downhill" was first featured on British television in 2005 on a small, scanned digital channel, BBC 4. I saw it was repeated on BBC 4 and decided to go, you recall the BBC's successful edits in 1970, other stories by MR James, including "Whistle And I Will Come To You My Lad" and "The Signalman". Although not in the same class as these masterpieces, "Downhill" is nevertheless a fun and sometimes exciting drama. The historian arrives in a small rural village to look at the collection of a recently deceased collector of antique artifacts. While in the countryside, he sees an abbey that has been in ruins for hundreds of years. But what does it have to do with the old pair of binoculars and the terrible legend of the ominously named Gallows Hill? And what about this situation is the swift end-captain and his servant? While I was not frightening, I enjoyed this small production, and if running longer than 40 minutes, it could be a real big adaptation. As it is, everything feels somewhat submerged and a little more exposition for mood adjustment would be welcome. I give it 7 out of 10.
