This movie is a wonderful film based on the life of a man called Gray Owl in the 1930s of Canada. I have found that there is similar riveting and hearts like "Rudy" and "Awakenings". He starts greeting Gray Owl's life and watches him during his most fervent and influential period. The film is about a Canadian Indian trapper who is in a position to promote Beaver's excessively imprisoned. It also predicts a decline in natural landscapes and overuse of Earth resources. This is a nasty concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well received. He becomes a known speaker and the masses are ready to listen. Casting Pierce Brosnan looks a little strange, but it's not nasty. Anyone want to argue that this point must first watch the movie to understand. Brosnan provides great performance just like Annie Galipeau. Galipeau is a powerful actress whose place next to Brosnan is refreshing naturally compared to forced pairing in recent Bond films. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in good drama, beautiful scenery or natural affairs. It's also a family movie, but children under 10 years of age (depending on maturity) would have problems with the story.
