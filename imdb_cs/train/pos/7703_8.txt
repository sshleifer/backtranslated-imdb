I was surprised how the film can be both raw and excellent at the same time. The Frisbee flying plate was incomprehensible, especially when it landed, and yet the special effects when Krell attacked were amazing for the film that was made more than half a century ago! Living in the Middle East I have seen the shades of Islam when JJ Adams suggested that Alta should dress modestly, and as an engineer was overwhelmed by the imagination used for "futuristic" gadgets and the gizmos that dreams of props. Overall, a fun hour and a half, I first saw Walter Pidgeon and the chance to see Leslie Neilsen as a "young" man
