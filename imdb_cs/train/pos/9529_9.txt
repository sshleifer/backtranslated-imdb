This is one of the best films in 2002. Maybe this is not the best movie but it looks the best, it works great and is perfectly controlled by Sam Mendes, who debuted with American beauty. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks), who is seen by his son (Tyler Hoechlin) on one of his works. Michael Rooney (Paul Newman) thinks it will be fine, but his jealous son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) sets up Michael and his father, leading to the death of Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and his second son. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose himself and send Harlem Maguire (Jude Law) to complete the job. Since Michael is a respected person in an organization, he's trying to get some friends who can help him, including Frank Lutti (Stanley Tucci), the head of the crowd. In the way "Road to Perdition" is a standard gangster film, but it's so good you almost can not see it. This film is good in its production design, artistic direction, sound, music and especially in its cinematography. All of these elements are able to surprise and create tension even if the result is quite certain. That Hoechlin is not an annoying child, and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act, of course. <br /> <br /> Based on the comic book, this movie is much better than you would expect, although it has the mistakes it belongs to a better movie in the genre. Sometimes there are events when you realize that you have seen it before, but for some reason you also feel fresh at the same time. The scenes between adult Hanks and child Hoechlin help in this area. Check out this movie, which looks good at times, but it is quite new in many areas.
