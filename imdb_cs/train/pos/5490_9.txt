This is a really incredible movie. Not only does it document the eternal struggle of indigenous and neglected people to gain their legitimate voice but also shows that the United States is for its dishonesty, irritability, and obvious ignorance of human rights and self-determination. Ch√°vez is shown as a very brave and charismatic leader fighting what can only be described as a contemptuous elite that has no sense of proportion or justice. These filmmakers have seen a coup, unlike anything previously witnessed. And on the hairs we see the USA, pulling the strings again and blurring all the sense of reality. It is a heart indifferent when looking at the early stages of the uprising because we were well aware that the undermining of the democracy we are witnessing is a tool that has long been used by successive US governments and their seemingly exorbitant citizens. The records clearly show that this is not manipulation with television or generic shots, but about the active documentation of the people and its government, which is fighting for its future. A great experience for everyone with conscience. These Irish filmmakers deserve our gratitude. Long live Chavez. We must embrace the idea that each country must have the power to choose its own government and develop it in a way that most people find fit. The first phase of this process is to know the reality of the situation, and this document does a great job of doing so.
