I had some reservations about this movie, I thought it would be a usual travel documentary - a movie about Christmas. When we were in the middle of the wave of hot waves at the end of June, we decided we'd be shot, maybe we'd see some snow. This movie turned out to be one laugh after another. Ben Affleck was loyal to his character, but the real star of this is James Gandofini. He made his lines with a real joke about him and made great "daddy". If you want to have a pleasant few hours, surely check this one.
