This is a film poem, beautifully presented and photographed with sensitive art. It captures the atmosphere of time and perfectly places it. (The Italian Lake District in the 1920s.) It's a love story with a twist. Characters are unique and believable. Settings are deliciously exotic. Some of the scenes - a funeral ship in the fog - a long, long shot of a chess table in the middle of a tricky-shaped tile - are beautiful paintings. And rather than the obligatory happy ending, this story is bitter sweet. If the film is an artwork, it's close to the masterpiece. <br /> <br />
