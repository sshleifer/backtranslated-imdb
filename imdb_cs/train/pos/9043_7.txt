I happened to hit the movie on TV once. It was broadcast in the middle of the day on a channel that is not exactly known for broadcasting good movies. This was nothing but good this time. October Sky tells the true story of Homer, a boy inspired by Sputnick, to become a rocket scientist. He and his friends started to build rockets. His father is not happy about his sons who found a new hobby, and would rather see him as coal as a miner, or go to college football as his brother. The story is well written. It's a little too predictable, but it's okay because it does not focus too much on those parts of the story. It is an important part, but where it is obvious that the inner action is focused on action among the characters. The story is good. It has a cliché, but it's okay. It's based on real events, so you can not just skip these clichés. The characters are really good. If the story is at a congress, the characters are out and they can keep the action and the quality of the movie high. You will recognize these characters and get them sympathy. They are well written and credible. <br /> <br /> This is a good-looking movie. The sets and style 50 are thorough and the pictures are well folded and well lit. It all sets the mood of the movie very well. <br /> <br /> Acting is really good. Jake Gyllenhaal brings great performance because Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper are good as John Hickam. As for the rest of the cast, they are also good. Everybody together makes it quite a strong occupation. Overall, I'm glad to catch this movie. It was first after I saw that I learned that it was based on real events. If I knew if he saw it, it would be even more interesting. October Sky is a good and interesting movie. It's a movie that I believe everyone can enjoy. It's a pretty good movie. That's not bad at all!
