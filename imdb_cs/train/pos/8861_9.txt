Andy says, "No one will hurt, everyone wins." Before he says, we know the opposite is true: everyone gets hurt, no one is winning. This is a new element in American films, or perhaps an old article that has finally returned. Think of "Eastern Promises", "It Will Blood", "No Land for Old Men". These films are dark, serious, extremely well done and do not care about happy ends. I love them. "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead," it corresponds to the general description, but it creates an atmosphere that is in itself. Kelly Masterson's debut screen is as close to the Hollywood movie ever to get into the Greek tragedy. A tribute to veteran Stanley Donen's veteran director, Sidney Lumet, professionally and patiently transforms the dark story into the dramatic dramatic drama of the old school. The opening shots, though the obese financial dog-styling his wife's trophy, have the look and feel of the Dutch master image. On the other hand, a drug dealer's home device looks more like a Mondrian chain. Great performance all around. Only by the character of Albert Finney, Charles feels a bit exaggerated, his eyes wide and mouth agape almost all the time. But then he is in trouble deep, deeper than all the problems that most of us ever know. To replace Marisa Tomei is super hot. But of course you do not need me to tell you that. Why would her character Gina want to be with a person like Andy, we never said, but that's okay. The action is after all. The unique and magical touch of Carter Burwell's music makes this great film a masterpiece. Do not miss it.
