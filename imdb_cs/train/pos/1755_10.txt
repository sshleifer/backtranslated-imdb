This film is a turmoil. I can not remember the last time I've seen such a great time in movies. In my time, I've seen some good comedies and most of them are quite funny. But this is a great line of wall. I think Best in Show is the last movie I laughed so sadly and so laugh. The film was constant until the end of the 5-minute sentimental plot. In addition, it is a constant flooding of one liner and cracked situations. I'd like to see it before leaving the theater, because it's like in Zucker movies where you do not have the first jokes. You have to see it twice or three times to get it all. As far as the current film is concerned, it could use better adjustments, it's sometimes shuffled, but we have to forgive it. All the characters are great. It's not like Adam Sandler's movie where he's trying to be funny and everyone else is suffering around him and it's a joke back. I think I will remember all the main characters for the coming years because they are all so nice. No victims in this movie. Also, thank God, they got a 45-year-old actress to play their girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays her and she is the darling of this film. You just want women like her to really exist. It's not "10" like one of the other leading ladies, but her smile is a bit warmer than Julia Roberts has overcome her overtime. When you see a trailer for this movie, you do not have to think too much about it. I assure you, the trailer does not do that with justice. They do not provide all the good jokes. Only a few of the strongest. <br /> <br /> And one more thing. I hope the critics put it on their first 10th list. Many of them complain that comedies do not gain the recognition they deserve and then do not list them at the end of the year. That means you are Ebert !!!
