I started watching the show from the first season and at first I was quite skeptical. The original movie was a bit childish and I was just looking for a science fiction show and I was expecting a new BSG season. But after a few episodes I became a fan. I like the characters - not as stupid as you think - is Jack O'Neill, the not-so-smart Samantha Carter, the famous Teal'c, the favorite women and children and the brilliant Dr. Daniel Jackson. Of course, stories are sometimes not serious, sometimes even ridiculous, but it's usually not about technology or the fight with the universe - it's about helping a friend and even risking life for him. It's about "not leaving anyone". It fights until the end, when all hope is lost. Of the free will and of all the good qualities that make man-human. And now it's breaking records, it's the 10th year and still doing good.
