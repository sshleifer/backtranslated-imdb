It is always nice to see that Angela Bassett gets a role in which she can actually jerk her teeth. Sometimes she is intense, funny and even sexy in her role as Lena, a "colorful" woman who is forced to make a house on a deserted mud near Cape Town, South Africa. Danny Glover is also a good partner for Boesman. Willie Jonah gives a gently graded performance as a stranger who has discovered a new residential area of ​​Boesman and Lena. It's not often that you have the chance to see an intelligent film dealing with mature themes. Although based on the play, late director John Berry (also director Claudine) opens the material by filming the film in a wide-format Cinemascope format. It also keeps things visually interesting through creative blocking of actors and shows us the things that are mentioned in the game. Like Diahann Carroll in Claudine, John Berry may have brought Angela Bassett to the Oscar nomination. It's definitely a movie that's worth looking for.
