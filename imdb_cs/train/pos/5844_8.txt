In 1948 it was my favorite film. The Betty Grable costumes were so stunning that I wanted to grow up to be her and to dress like that. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., was irresistible as a breathtaking Hungarian officer. Foolish and fluffy, as this film first appeared when I was eight years old, it seemed to me that something important about relations between men and women was going to reveal. I saw it again the next day; I was surprised that he still does.
