I immediately fell in love with "Pushing Daisies". This show can smile on your face and that's great storytelling, funny dialogue and great acting. But that's not all: it can keep you to the end. The basic idea behind the show - To bring people back to life with one push, ending the state of the undead to the other - is interesting and could be in later periods. But the experience of murderous cases, the unique appearance of the show, and the highly prolific narrator. But "Pushing Daisies" is more than its parts. She has some charm that I really enjoy and I'm looking forward to the second season to enter the world of Ned and Chuck.
