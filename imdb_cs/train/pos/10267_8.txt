A lot of information about Mamet's "House of Games" is written; most of it is good. I decided to come back to see how it took after 17 years and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The success and durability of the film is probably related to the two main components that are always fun on the film; good story and good scam. Mamet can bring his signature moods and the apparent historiology of the film while screaming, audience and branding at the same time. Then he explains the art of doing it just to do it again, etc., And in creating the story. The "House of Games", now free on cable, is worth seeing the first timers and the Mamet fans are all right. (B +)
