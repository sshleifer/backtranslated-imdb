I really liked AWTWB Tom Barman. You just have to let it come to you and enjoy it while it lasts, and do not expect anything. It's like sitting on a terrace with a caf√© with beer, in the summer sun and watching people walk. They will certainly not think you, it's true, but that's not a prerequisite for a good movie. It's just an experience during a movie that's great. I felt there were a couple of springs that could be solved a little bit more, but be a fan of Lynch, I do not really care :) :) I loved the style or the taste of this movie. It's neat but fresh, and soundtrack is beauty. Any lover of music gets his kicks from AWTWB, I can assure you. I'll give it 8 out of 10. <br /> <br /> (music-wise 10 out of 10).
