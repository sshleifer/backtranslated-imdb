Another Spanish film about the Civil War of 1936. This time we learned about the story of Carol (beautifully played by débutant Clara Lago), a little girl who comes to live in a small Spanish village in New York. It is such an initiation trip and soon finds out about the injustice of the human race, about their stupid struggles and conflicts and about their contradiction. Imanol Uribe makes the best film from "Días Contados" (1994) with such a sober pulse, beautiful pictures and a nice screenplay. They try not to participate in the conflict, they just show us some facts and we decide (ok, the facts are clear enough to decide which band we are in) and benefit from the great advantage of the presence and freshness of the young star couple: Clara Lago and Juan José Ballesta. <br /> <br /> Well-treated production. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10
