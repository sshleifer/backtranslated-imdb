But it's a great movie about martial arts. Liu Chia Liang ranks as a martial choreographer, only Sammo Hung at his best. This is immediately clear from his proud technique exhibition - than the flashing angles of the camera, etc. - during the fighting. Direction is carefully controlled not only to excite the spectator speed and movement, but to respectfully respect it with precisely displayed skills. This film is also a contribution to Liu's participation in front of the camera. Liu's introduction to the banquet scene with which the film opens is one of the highest points in the history of kung fu film. Liu is supported by the beautiful and talented star Hui Ying Hung ("My Young Auntie") and "Hsiao Hou", whose acrobatics are breathtaking and more enjoyable than any number of cabling. As for the plot, this film follows an extraordinary theme of revenge, but with character and moral development along the way and the most appropriate solution. Humor in this is also best. If you watch only one kung fu movie at all, it would be a good choice - it has it all.
