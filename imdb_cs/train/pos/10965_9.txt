Little Edie and Big Edie are characters that everyone can feel compassionate about. Although their house was dirty, it is understandable when it comes to their mental illness. On the signboard he wrote a poster that "Little Edie has the ability to handle an eight-year-old." It reminded me when in a dramatic version of 2009 Big Edie says Little Edie: "If you're stuck, it's just with you!" These women had everything; beauty, talent, intelligence, firm belief in their opinions and deeds. Perhaps if Little Edie was not so heavy on herself, it did not work for the first time, she would lose her hair, work, and love for life to do it. It is somehow associated with what I believe is her mental illness: her inability to pick up when hard times are and see that good times are ahead of us. The world will never know what happened if she did not listen to her mother's request: "Come home, Edie, let me take care of you!" brilliant, hearty and tempting, even in an extremely dirty home. These women were extraordinary and their mutual interaction brought humor and sadness. When Edie had one of her emotional breakdowns that dealt with what she might be, or about how she wanted to get out of her home because she felt like a little girl, she would have an intense urge to embrace her and tell her that " be okay!" <br /> <br /> Great documentary! <br /> <br /> 9/10
