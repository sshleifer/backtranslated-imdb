Recently, when I was shopping, I saw a box-set of American Gothic, and I thought I remember it! "I once set my alarm to come back and look at it when it was on CH 4 in 1996 at 1.30am (I was 14) .I remember it mainly because it was really scary and strange, no person would never be as frightening as Lucas Buck (with B !!) Nobody ever was. <br /> <br /> What angered me was that they did the same thing that was in the box like on television. Okay, I thought when Dr. Matt left ??? - they made it so confused. However, they are not writers, manufacturers or directors error (its TV people in the background money makers are still doing the same thing - it's enough look at exhibitions like Carnivale and Farscape do not like the originality of the studio !!!!!) Completion - If you did not see it and you call Sci-Fi Fantasy, Horror, supernatural drama .. FAN = YOU MUST Even in SFX they said the same when reviewed the file.
