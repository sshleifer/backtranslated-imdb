In the past, there have been countless animated animal films, most of which have either digitally animated mouths of animals that are almost the same as the voice, or they are ridiculously amateur. "Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is not one. This film does not need a baby, a pleasant addition to the moving dog's lips or gestation of the cat's limbs. It has the ability to make you think that animals are authentically talking to each other and you can get to them rather emotionally (just like all the great movies a boy and his dog). <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound is an embodiment of all family-friendly animal romps and boasts beautiful cinematography, inspiring soundtrack (from Bruce Broughton's genius) and an impressive actor ... <br /> <br /> Michael J. Fox. .. Sans <br /> <br /> Sally Field ... Sassy <br /> <br /> Don Ameche ... Shadow <br /> <br /> Frank Welker (voice of God) ... Various < br /> <br /> This is an upgraded version of the children's classical fiction, The Incredible Way, which became Disney in 1963. The sequel (lost in San Fransisco) is not such a good movie, but it is expanding the adventures of my favorite hairy friends and is a fun urban turn in the theme of grand-outdoor-adventure. Do you want to entertain your children with a humorous, cute mini-epic heart of warming hearts, without the idiotic and often utterly absurd comedy of modern childhood cinema? Parents, buy all three movies for your kids - now! Thank you, Disney for bringing tears to my eyes every time I look at this classic from the 1990s!
