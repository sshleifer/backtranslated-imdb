In addition to aircraft, trains and cars, and Uncle Buck, this is the funniest John Candy movie. When the playing card hypothesis (like the Manchurian Candidate) becomes a horny guy who does not know what he says, he makes two very unforgettable quotes (Both deal with male anatomy). There must be a love scene with food can not be described. <br /> <br />
