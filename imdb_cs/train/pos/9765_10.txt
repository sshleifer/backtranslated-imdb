I saw this funny little film at the age of 10/11 in 1979, when it was broadcast on CBS. I did not know it was in the theater at all. To judge her from a child's point of view, I would give him 4 out of 5 stars because he was a young boy at the time, it looked a bit "girl." The climatic scene, where Gazooks had blanched the lights of everyone, was a little disturbing at the time, but you've overcome that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> When I first discovered the Blockbuster Video in 1995, I had to visit him again! I still liked it, though it looked a bit "old". I do not know where another reviewer here was attacking that it was not on the VHS. He's out there. It could even be on DVD, at least I hope it will. I would like to share it once with my children! 10 stars, it's still a great movie for kids. (end) <br /> <br /> 09/08/2009: Finally we find a copy of VHS !! Woo-hoo!
