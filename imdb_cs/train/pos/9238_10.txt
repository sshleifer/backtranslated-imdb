Although others have commented that this video is only a modified version of two shows: "Fire in Space" and "Living Legend", if you look at the original show, you will notice that the dialog from this video editing has been modified. I found this version of the video much better because scenes and rows were added to it. I would say that if you want to see the show in the original version, check out the video version on VHS. They have something to offer to fans than the original episodes offered on DVDs. Another good video is Conquest for the Earth, which had more scenes from Galactica 1980 than real broadcasts. Overall, I rank it as 10 because it gives you more than you enjoy than what you wanted the grid to show in the time span they gave to manufacturers.
