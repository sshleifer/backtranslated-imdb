TCM keeps keeping me awake ... they still come up with movies I've never heard of ... Senso ... now Ossessione ... very soon a movie from Visconti! ... wow ... Italian version The Postman Always Rings Twice ... brilliant! he acted nicely and directed ... He never even heard of those who were excellent, Clara Calamai, Giovanna, and above all Massimo Girotti as Gino ... what a sensual person! more muscular and attractive than someone else on the screen in 1943 !!! His look was some time ago ... many male stars of the 1950s were probably inspired by him ... he should be the main world star !! The movie is much better than the Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange version and less shiny than the MGM version (which I really like) with John Garfield and Lanna Turner do not forget that it's a white outfit? who can forget .... This Italian version is different .. more realistic and with a very different end ... see how it follows ... I'm going to buy it!
