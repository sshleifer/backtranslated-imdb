At the beginning of this film, one of the commentators says he was told he had two strikes against him: black and male. Besides, he has a third strike: it's gay. "You'll have to be stronger than you ever imagined," he said. "Paris is Burning" is a documentary about gay blacks and Hispanic men who are transvestites or transsexuals. The miracle of "Paris is Burning" is that director Jennie Livingston deals with a topic that could very easily become a strange performance and allows people to be human. We will learn their views on homosexuality, men, women, their hopes, their disappointments, their dreams. Some of these dreams are so unreachable, it's tragic. Many people are seriously rejected; <br /> <br /> It's not a movie for everyone. In this movie naked transsexuals are shots. If you have a problem with homosexuality, then this movie is not for you. But if you see this movie, you realize that "Paris is Burning" is not actually about men dressed in women's clothing, it's about a group of people who are commonly marginalized and abused by a broad society and what they do, a sense of community in their lives. I watched this film four times since it was released in 1991 because it says so many things: it is a commentary on materialism in our culture, about gender roles, about the rich and the poor, about the media and about what it celebrates, about glory and enthusiasm. "Paris is Burning" is one of the most humane and one of the saddest movies I've ever seen.
