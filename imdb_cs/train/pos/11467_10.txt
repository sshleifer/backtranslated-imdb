That's the best movie I've ever met. Not only is it the best film of its kind (school shooting) The way Ben Coccio (the director) decided to make the film was spectacular. He shot it through teenage actors who were still in high school. He shot the film in his own games rooms and used real-age actors as parents in the movie. Also, actors were filming too much with their camcorders, so it seemed to be much more like a video diary. It's almost fine (if it's really a word) There are several slides, for example, when Cal calls brads (?) Ground rover range (or vice versa, it's been a while since I saw it)
