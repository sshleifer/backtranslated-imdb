I was so surprised how great The Man In The Moon really was. I mean, at first I expected it to be a sweet and predictable movie, but I decided that when she watched it, amazed (especially in tears) how great the Man on the Moon was. This movie is so fun and is so aware of its tone and its fabulous film. The acting was great especially since Reece Witherspoon was so cute and dear) and everyone else. It was nothing that really bothered me, I felt the end was a little predictable, but very well done. I also felt that some things were simple or as if it had been done before but still a great movie. Overall, I have to say that I do not have much to say about this film, not that it's bad, it's just a movie that you like or dislike. and everyone, even if you do not like these types of movies, is still a nice movie. <br /> <br /> 8.7 out of 10 stars
