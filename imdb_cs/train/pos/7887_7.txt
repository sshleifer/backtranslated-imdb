If your fan of Freddy is a hard core, you may not like it. It seems to be a spoof of nightmares. He does not have much to see. The only reason he's holding it alone is a back story about Freddy. The only thing that's always great in Nightmare is death scenes. The death scenarios were, however, very poor. The visual effects were great and the acting was fine, but the story was great. Essentially, Freddy's story comes in this circle. <br /> <br /> I read about this bad review, but despite the fact that I had many shortcomings, I really enjoyed it: <br /> <br /> 1. Nightmare on Elm street. (8/10) <br /> <br /> 2. Freddy's Dead: Final Nightmare. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 3. Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. (7/10) <br /> 4. Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 5. Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child. (6/10) <br /> <br /> 6. Nightmare on Ul. 2: Freddy's revenge. (3/10) <br /> <br /> I recommend this if you like a series. That is, Freddy is fully explained, but that's all. Another on my list Wes Cravens New Nightmare. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
