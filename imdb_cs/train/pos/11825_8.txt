Do not look for an oversized plot ... just sit down with some popcorn and enjoy this. In this live action comedy a gallery of stars appears as villains of a classic cartoon character who has incredible make-up and scenic design, not to mention the knockout performances by Beatty, Madonna and Pacino. Great fun for children and adults. <br /> <br />
