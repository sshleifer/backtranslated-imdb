What a great movie this is, I have no words to describe. I do not know how the movie rating of 7.3 should be 9.3 but no one else can make this film and Akshay's acting is just an excellent second half of the movie doing u cry, and the movie has a really good unexpected end, thanks to which the film is perfect. you should watch this movie once, I think twice good it's up u. Anyway I love this movie and it's not just sad and fun but it also gives the really good meanings and what should u do, so i think it is it's one of the best movies in Bollywood's history. but I know people like it. the only thing I do not like about this movie is music and background music is good, but the songs are not good enough. I think the music would be better if AR Rahman was a music director, but we can not do anything about it anyway.
