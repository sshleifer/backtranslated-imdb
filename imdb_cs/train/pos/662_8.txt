And the axellent second part, which can be as good as the first. <br /> <br /> Once again, casting is simply great. I like how the first and second episodes have nothing in common, except for joke and skill. The second episode is simply very fun, very stupid and very pleasant. It's the first Christmas episode, about a woman who is tortured by a serial killer dressed as Santa after killing her husband. Just like the first episode; karma. The most humorous scene is the connection between her husband's murder and her phone call, pretending to be her fear until she becomes real.
