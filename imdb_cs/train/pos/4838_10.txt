This movie reminded me that some old black and white movies are definitely worth the effort. <br /> <br /> At first I had some reservations, but from the beginning of the movie to the end I was enchanted. I was very impressed with the mix of drama, tension and comedy. Arthur Askey (Tommy Gander) is HILARIOUS and he has stitched me all the time. <br /> <br /> I'm sure to add this movie to the movie night for a slight relief from the sometimes depressing and too powerful or too "fun" films of today.
