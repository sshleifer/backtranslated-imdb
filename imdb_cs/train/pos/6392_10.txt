This independent, B & W, DV feature is constantly shocked, amazed and entertained by its ability to create the wisest of situations and then seek humor and interest in them. It's all fun and ridiculous, but just as absurd as a movie, there's a heart, and the reality that keeps the movie anchored, keeps the whole piece of constant madness and there's a real message in it. This movie is about how we all survive in a world that has gone mad. It seems to be the heart of the movie. For as crazy and wall as things get, Leon, 30 years old. an old counterpart of paper, always trying to keep it together. It is like a child who is always trying to catch a balloon that floats so that everything will work the best, so that everyone can have what they want. over the top, but the exceptional cast really keeps a bit cohesive. Van Meter is perhaps the best actress with a performance that shines through her absurd ill tics. Like the characters in the movie, we overlook her sudden explosions to see the real person below. <br /> <br /> Majkowski is a real genius here. He is interested in extremely ridiculous plot and keeps them real. It's his script and his cast that help keep the whole thing over the water. It is a true testimony to Majkowski's skill, and everyone has been involved in the fact that this film, with its grate and characters, never creates our nerves. Majkowski shot a movie that could be abrasive and abominable and somehow gave him heart and humor. This is a unique movie. We must not miss it. <br /> <br />
