Chuck Jones 'Hare Conditioned' is a fast, often cheerful cartoon. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a strange manager of a yellow-skinned shop that wants to stuff it, "Hare Conditioned" takes full advantage of its multi-purpose setting. Chase takes Bugs and his pursuers across different departments, leading to an inspired gag, in which they quickly emerge from different departments that wear any clothing associated with that part of the business. This big gag is embodied by a truly inspired sequence including lifts in which Bugs, dressed as a lift boy, is bored by the businessman to tirelessly get or unload the lifts in bad weather. It's a brilliant top song that unfortunately leads the way to a very entertaining final gag. At the time, however, "Hare Conditioned" was considered one of the great films going wild. Since Bugs is still improving in some of the other cartoons from this period, "Hare Conditioned" has shown that it can be as attractive as a more anarchic character.
