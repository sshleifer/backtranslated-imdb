More than just a "children's film," "The Holes" deals with how past incidents are still affecting us today, whether we know about them or not. When teenager Stanley Yelnats III (Shia LeBoeuf) is sent to a prison camp where he is forced to dig all day, he discovers a number of things about the camp and his personal connection with him. Through flashes, we learn that a lot of things are closer than we realize (you'll understand better when you see the movie). LeBoeuf does a pretty good job, just like other members include Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette and Eartha Kitt. Very interesting film.
