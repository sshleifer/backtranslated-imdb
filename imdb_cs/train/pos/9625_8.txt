When watching this movie for the first time, it's hard to know what's going on, but it's clearer when it comes to watching. I like this movie. Dean Cain was brilliant in the role of Bob. Lexa Doig's character was confused to understand that she was first imprisoned by Bob, but I really believe she brought him to love even though she broke her heart. Dean Cain's performance was usually excellent. He will be better with every movie he does. My only question at the end of the movie was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the child. It was left for the viewer to decide
