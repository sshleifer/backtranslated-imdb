A farewell friend of Adieu L'Ami / Honor Among Thieves is not perfect, but it's a neat and entertaining thriller who sees dishonest demobilized French Algerian war veterans Alain Delon and Charles Bronson imprisoned in the same cellar, one to return stolen bonds, another to clear two million salaries , which sit there over the Christmas weekend. Of course, things are not that simple even after opening the vault, which leads to some neat changes. On the debit side there is a very bizarre scenario in the parking lot, Bronson has a very irritated phrase called Fonzie used in the most unfavorable moments, Brigitte Fossey, who used to sport the most fabulous hairstyle of the 1960s to look like a bald woman whose wig is away from the top of her heads high wind) is something like responsibility? "I will cook spaghetti, I will learn to love well, I will read Shakespeare!" Is speech hysterical in all the wrong ways? and it's a shame on the terrible last line / shot, but otherwise it's a surprisingly fun and undemanding number that's worth finding out if you find a decent print. DVD Cinema Club UK DVD offers only English soundtrack, but since Delon is alone and the rest of the cast is quite well dubbed, that's no big deal, especially because widescreen transmission is very good.
