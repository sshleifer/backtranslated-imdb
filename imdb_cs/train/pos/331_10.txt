This 370-minute film was broadcast by Italian public television in the early seventies. It tells you the myth attributed to Homer from the path of Odysseus after the Trojan War. This is an epic story of ancient Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations that were listed 500 years after these events took place around 1100 BC. This is a 1969 movie, so if you buy a DVD version, it's found that the sound is mono and there is no other language than Italian, even a thin headline is in Italian. Damage. Many people would enjoy this masterpiece if they had a list of English subtitles. But if it's not a problem for you than I'd recommend watching this movie.
