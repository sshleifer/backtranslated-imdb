Sniper gives real meaning to the war films. I remember movies about Vietnam or World War II, lots of shooting, everyone dying, bam bam. The "Sniper" takes the war to a new level or refinement. The film definitely expresses all the emotions it focuses - the powerlessness of the jungle people, the hatred and the final trust between Beckett and Miller, and the rush at the moment they pull the trigger. The seemingly low-budget movie will compensate for any flaw with action, tension and excitement, because if it does, it's just one pledge, one killing.
