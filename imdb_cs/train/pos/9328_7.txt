The perfect son is the story of two 30 brothers who are seemingly "perfect" and others who are basically dirty, often landing in drug rehab centers. After the death of her father, two people joined after a long absence and appeared to be the usual siblings of the rivalry. Until the "perfect" brother makes a terrible revelation that he has AIDS, the irresponsible younger brother will finally try to make his life fit and take responsibility. a nice job chronicling the "return" of a younger brother, although it may seem a bit too casual (hitting drug addiction is never so easy). The film, which is so much more creative, is AIDS treatment, a topic that has become somewhat passive in the cinema for the last 5 to 10 years. And the development of the almost sweet relationship between the two former brothers is very credible and well executed. The two main actors were both very competent, if not terribly charismatic. The first solid effort of the director and writer Leonard Farlinger, whose own brother died of AIDS. The end is also pretty finished. <br /> <br />
