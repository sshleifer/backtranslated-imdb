Yes, it may be unpleasant and may not seem as fun as many high-budget comedy films, but this movie is really funny if you really watch it. Tim Meadows has always struck me as funny outside Saturday Night Live. Whenever I make this figure on the show, I would laugh. So after I saw it was Comedy Central, I decided to look at it once. Overall, I was so impressed with this movie because it was not meant to win the Oscars or the comedy of the year, but it enjoyed Saturday Night Live fans who love the character Ladies Man. This film is also packed with some highly sensitive lines that can be presented for several years.
