I just watched the movie, I was afraid it was disappointing. At the end I was surprised. American pie franchise is still in my favorite franchise film of all time. yes, it will not be true when I say I enjoyed it as a sin as I enjoyed the original. beta house together with the previous two pieces definitely lost something that the first two cakes had.it will not become a classic as the first two have already done. but what the hell is - it's still fun with a lot of good moments and I think it should be the first movie you choose if you want to enjoy a hard day at work or at school. beta house deserves 6/10, but I put it 7/10 just because I was another slice of PIE.
