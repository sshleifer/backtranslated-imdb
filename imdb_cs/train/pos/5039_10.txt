Stunning. Totally stunning. This is a film about two children who have a father at once. He says an angel visits him and tells him they need to kill "demons". They will receive instructions later and begin to round up the demons, who are just plain ordinary people. They kill so-called Demons with an ax on their heads and they cut them and bury them in a pink garden. Their father claims to see their sins when they touch them. The movie continues and ends at the end. <br /> <br /> The thing I love about this movie is that it perfectly captures the weakness of human perception. Is their father crazy? Or is he saying the truth? The audience chooses. Go to yourself and look at the movie. Now.
