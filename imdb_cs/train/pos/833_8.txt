First, tell me that the director has a great use of titles in amazing shots. I really enjoyed them. I really liked this movie, but I have to say that besides Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinear is quite faint. Brosnan melts so well in this character that it's really hard to remember that he's the same guy who played the bind. It also shows its range and depth as an actor. It's a bit indie film and it was really nice to see especially with all the major movies that flood movies at this time of year. I've found that the characters are well-crafted. The reversal in the middle I felt was especially good. I also liked the characters being lost realistically. So many times we have these cartoons of people who are not real characters, but stereotypes of walking ... I like the different approaches that this film contains. I mean, when I think about this movie, but I think it's more observable and better overall ...
