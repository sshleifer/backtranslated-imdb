This electrifying musical has more than just the blast of egotism from his star, the musical genius who is the prince. The film is about 90 minutes to represent, but in reality it's easy to understand why it's so cult classic. Just like other films that focus on a fighting young musician trying to be great, this has a touch of drama and adds the size of musical numbers. While this movie is not as good as 8 miles as the last example, it's fun and the soundtrack is much better. On the dramatic side of the story, the story centers around Kido (the prince) of a young artist and a regular place in the club. The club owner is frustrated with childish arrogance and little does Kid know he could be released soon and replaced by an opponent. One party that parents have trouble with their parents is abusing their father. During the film, Kid learns several hours of life and learns more to appreciate his friends. It's all we've seen on the arrival of the age-old drama, of course, but it's combined as a musical, highly stylized musical. Cast is good. Prince is actually quite good on the dramatic side when he does not pose. He seems to be human and thoughtful. Clarence Williams is very good as an abusive father. Appollonia Kotero makes a good debut as Princes sexy love interest. <br /> <br /> But the main strength of the movie is an excellent soundtrack. The musical numbers are well-staged and electrifying. Prince is undoubtedly a musical master, though very eccentric. When inspired, he is great, but on the other hand he often makes songs that are exclusively for his own taste, and occasionally his experimentation can escape, but that is the same for many musical geniuses. The soundtrack for this movie is great, but only Sexshooter is a weak point. Purple Rain Performance Suspension is a standout though. It's one of my favorite songs. *** <br /> <br />
