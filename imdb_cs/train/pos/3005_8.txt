This is still a standard for judging all the golden ages, and due to the limited technology and dubious ethic standards of the offices (on the screen), it is evolving against all generations of similar experiments, from film and television. Fast and angry with plenty of Warner Bros. napkins and fortunately, there was no time for a loving interest in going to him and taking a beautiful cast to the violent end. I never understood why DA had to move all around Vance, I always thought they were on the table. The palette as a detective, but above all Girardot as a doctor is wonderfully eccentric and non-PC - looking at the other victim of the murder smiles that there are too many people in the world. Of course, it's William Powell like Philo Vance (and Michael Curtiz as a director) who makes the movie what it is - when Powell sometimes did mud? The army of cops at the scene did not really do a very good job in finding a second dead body and the unconscious dog did it! The best thing is when Vance tells us about a whole series of murder events - the complicated model kits combine with the fantastic roving camera angles that create a very modern feel and surprise what has happened before. The only problem is, as usual, that the conclusion can not correspond to the total deductive processes that appear throughout the text and give rise to a rather conventional end; some of the Han's, Moto and many others, of course, could only be closed. But because it's going to happen so fast and it's ... slightly doubtful morally it does not diminish my opinion on the status of KMC as a classic! All the prints I've ever seen are KMC (in the worst case), like looking at a goldfish bowl, so if you're interested in seeing it carry with you until you're sucked in.
