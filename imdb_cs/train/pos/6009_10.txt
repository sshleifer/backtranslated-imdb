Mark Frechette stars as Mark, a radical left colleague. Mark is accused of killing a cop during a campus rebellion and he escapes to the desert. He does so by stealing a small plane at a local airport and flying alone. <br /> <br /> One of the flying through the desert, Mark carries the car out of the air. A young girl named Daria will step out and see Mark in a circle on the plane. The mark will fly a few times very low, causing Daria to bruise or get. As she approaches, she meets Darius, who is strangely enchanted by Mark's air heights. <br /> <br /> After a long hour of conversation, Mark and Daria are naked and love the sand. But when Marka avoids the law, they realize they have to continue running. So the short experience of Mark and Darye is quite noisy, because he can not develop into a full-fledged romance. Zabriski Point was Eraserhead from the early 1970s. Both films have tiny, vague quality and complex meanings and characters. Frechette was equally reckless in person because his character was in this movie. Several years after Zabriski Point, Frechette robbed the bank in real life. During the execution of his imprisonment, Mark died in a deadly death. He was killed 150 pounds. the weight that fell upon him when he was lifting. <br /> <br /> The best story of this movie was superb cinematography and special visual effects. Unbelievable and slow-down scenes of the debris that floated in the air were brilliant. Though it was not like a breakthrough movie like Easy Rider, Zabriski Point still resonated with the early 70's. I recommend to those who like avant-garde films that show disruption, a young rebellion in the 1970s.
