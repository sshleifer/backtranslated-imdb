When I saw this movie again, it seemed to me infinitely superior to the previous times when I saw it. The game is amazingly beautiful. The figures are very clearly depicted. Brad Pitt is simply great as an unfortunate son who rebels. Other actors and actors are all right. Robert Redford creates an amazing time piece from the 20th century speakeasies. The landscape is incredibly beautiful from the mountains and streams of western Montana. Overall, it's one of the best movies in the 1990s. <br /> <br /> You have to see this movie! <br /> <br />
