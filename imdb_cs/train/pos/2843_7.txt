If you are not in the mood for more than an hour long movie than this movie could give some variation. What I like is the upcoming surprise. It's not just when you want one or more short films in New York City to love you to be continued. Yeah, some short movies are curious, some of them are very short, some of them are longer, some have final results, some are not. Most stories of the sad side of the capital. It displays many different national backgrounds. Many of this makes me feel the same way I once went to the capital city of other countries all year round, from where many people come from different countries. This movie will explore many kinds of things you may know, but for all the characters it's new stuff. Maybe some of you have been traveling abroad to stay for a whole year or two to feel new, to meet new people; feel dreamy, sad, but the type of sadness you're looking for because it's just that you're bored that you're in your home. Maybe you would want to experience it again by watching it.
