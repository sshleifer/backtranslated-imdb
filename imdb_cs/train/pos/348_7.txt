These slasher pics are in the past selling by date, but this is good fun. War cards themselves are funny and well thought out. The film has one peach line ... "There is no angel ..." when in reality is Angel! Buffy tracking repeat will never be the same! Cast is a tiny representation of young talent, but the story does not give them enough depth. Denise Richards on the DVD Extras seemed to think that the girls on the show are well connected, and that would make you feel you were impressed with their character. Sorry, but not! <br /> <br /> The direction is very good, he was able to show a very small real gore and relied on your imagination of the foreseeable threat. Much can be said for the similar way that Miss Richards and Heigel do not remove their dress ... :-( <br /> <br /> In fact, the main director's plus lies in "borrowing" various other thoughts from previous flicks slasher. Psycho's showering scene is indented along with Halloween's "camouflage". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lightning , not very scary, but a couple of good jump moments. If it was a choice between the Hole and though, choose The Hole.Filma Slasher had your day, and that's just another slasher, good slasher, but nothing pioneering !!!
