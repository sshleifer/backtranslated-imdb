I first saw this movie when it came out in 1994 and just watched it recently and it's still funny. I do not know if in the nineties you have to understand a hiphop, but it will help if it does. In the 1990s, when NWA and Public Enemy were at the top, internal conflicts appeared in groups and members when they separated (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc.). There were also all the rapists who wanted to enter the scene (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Williams from C & C Music Factory, etc.). This film makes fun of everything in a way that looks like it's really a documentary film. Kasi Lemmons plays an interviewer who spends a year in the life of fictional rap group name N.W.H. The members of the group are Ice Code (Rusty Condieff), Tasty Taste (Larry B Scott / Revenge of Nerds and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence)). What's good about this movie is that it's so deep in the 1980s hip-hop industry and they like it, but if you know the 80's and 90's, you know how many of these things are true. Still, it's own, without the knowledge of hip hop, it's still a fun entertainment movie. And for all those who ask, yes Spinal Tap came first, but Spinal Tap is not even the first spoof movie. as well as funny and in some ways better than Spinal Tap, as Spinal Tap is heavy metal, the fear of the black planet is Rap and the songs are out of the hook. DVD is a chalk full of add-ons to include NWH music videos as a group and as solo artists. Brilliant performances by Rusty Condieff and Larry B Scott.
