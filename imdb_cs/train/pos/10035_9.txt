I think James Cameron can become my favorite director because it's my second movie review. Anyway, everyone remembers RMS Titanic. It was big, fast and "unforgettable" ... until April 1912. It was all in the news and one of the greatest tragedies ever. Well, James Cameron decided to shoot a movie, but to play two fictional figures to be the focus of the ship. Well, on the main show, but let me remind you that this is all opinion and nothing, and the only fact that will be present is the event from the movie. So our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They are not too uncomfortable, but watch it and find out why they can become annoying (http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn). The main villain I think is bad luck, fate, God's hand (without blasphemy), and simply Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Connect all the above and what do you have ?! Oh yes! We have a love story on the sinking ship. Supporting characters are: My personal favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber), Lovejoy (David Warner), Murdoch (Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith, Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) and many others. We got the current Treasure Hunter Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to the story, something good. The action here is amazing, especially in the second half, the drama is also good. Eventually you may have eyes falling rain storm or quiet tears. The story is simple and works. The treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean, and instead finds the drawing of a woman who wears the said diamond. He tells and tells the story of RMS Titanic. Two lovers separated by the social class and eventually the destiny of the ship. Everything about the story works and there are very few shortcomings. I give the Titanic, 86% amazing
