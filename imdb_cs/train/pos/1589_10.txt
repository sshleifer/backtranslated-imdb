I love this show. I watch every rerun every day, even though I've seen all of them like 6 times. It's about two sisters, Holly (Amanda Bynes) and Val (Jennie Garth) who live in New York. Holly goes to live with Vale when their dad is transferred to Japan. Val has a perfect life, has a friend and a perfect apartment from the Upper East Side. The exhibition basically shows all the problems Vall and Holly are going through. the main problem is the boys, but also the responsibilities and other life choices. <br /> <br /> Holly is 16 and is a completely free spirit, while Val is the opposite. She is organized must have a plan to do something else. Other characters include Henry, Vince, Gary, Lauren, and Tina.
