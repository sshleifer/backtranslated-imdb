9/10 - 30 minutes of pure terrorism. Okay, that's not scary. But it is definitely fun. The Crypto (John Kassir) tells the story of a FEAR holiday that gives us all the Christmas goose ... GosseBUMPS That's it. Bwahahahahha. You should be really careful about what AX Santa does for you. Have a scary Christmas and a happy new fear. Well, in the story, Greedy Wife (Best Ellen in the World, Mary Ellen Trainor) kills her husband (Marshall Bell, a coach who gets a towel killed to death in ANOES 2) for money. But her plan is ruined when a mad killer dressed in Santa's suit (Larry "Dr. Giggles" Drake) appears. If you look at YouTube, you can view it for free, but most of you already saw it (my third view). But if you have not seen it, I recommend it to you.
