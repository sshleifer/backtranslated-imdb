It's a good movie and nothing more. And it's very fun to watch. Certainly it omitted political questions. But what? I'm sure she did not try to do "good night and good luck" here. Do not try to do anything but what is ... light fares. <br /> <br /> And it's very nice! Do you remember what was 1984? We have become very sophisticated in terms of what we are watching or not. I tend to differ in this regard. Goldie knew it was fun fuzz and she went on and done it. As her brightest fare: Protocol, overboard, Houseitter, Wildcats, Private Benjamin, Seems Like Old Times, Foul Play, Death Becomes, Club of First Spouses and Remakes Outside Of The City, GOLDIE Knows What He Does ... Playing Every Role in the camp to get her out of it! Goldie knows herself well and she knows what she can do really well. She always laughed at me cheerfully and innocently. I loved her in Laugh-In and every thing she ever had. She has never tried to be anything but who she is ... and that's the bubbling, giggling, side-by-girl who's very pretty and has a smile and a laugh that always attracts me and reminds me that life is very short and you just had to get rid of it because before you know it ... you are old, wrinkled and suffering one of life's inevitable illnesses. If it's too late. I appreciate Goldie for what she is: a nice and comic actress.
