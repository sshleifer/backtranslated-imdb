It was one of the first CREEPY movies I've ever seen ... I was about 5 years old. I was terrified by DOBRE! But that evening I put chewing gum in one eye like a monster ... and my mom was very upset. He needs to clean his eyes with alcohol and the next day my eye felt like DOUBLE MINT! Now it's a movie! Hey, when it's time, it was a great movie. The boss sitting at the top of the lab was just as real as it was then. And if your 5 is very obvious! Children are now spoiled by special effects that show too much and leave NEVER for your imagination. Your mind can imagine things more scary than special effects! (IMO)
