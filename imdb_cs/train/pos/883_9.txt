I settled back to look at "Read My Lips," in front of me a Freedom Fries Plate. Foods were quickly forgotten when I got involved in the original and great thriller of director and co-author Jacque Audiard. Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is the secretary of a company that is building major construction projects. In fact, he has some important duties, which often do not belong to the secretary, and is capable and ambitious. And frustrated by a male hierarchy that will use it but will not reward it. <br /> <br /> Work is gathering faster than it can handle. Enter the ex-con and general layout of Paul (Vincent Cassel). He lies about his abilities and in fact has no legitimate business. After the initial serious misconception of Paul that Carl's interest in him would become allies. Special friendship begins. In a piece that would make Carl as the lead candidate for "The Apprentice," he trumps his egoistic male counterpart in dealing with Paul's consistency. Leave your opponent. <br /> <br /> Carla is virtually deaf without her hearing aid. He can hear it almost normally. Turns the hearing aid to isolate itself from unpleasant sounds and unpleasant people. She is also very lonely. A heroic makeup effort has been created to make it clear, but it is really beautiful. He has no friend. She is being watched for a friend to have a joint (it's a French film). Even worse and degrading, she goes to a friend's request to hang somewhere somewhere while her girlfriend has her in the park in Carl's bed. It's not nice. When Carla and Paul get to know each other again, the scarcely lobbied side appears not as a former criminal. There is, incidentally, a story about Paul's relationship with his pastor officer, who neatly complements the main storyline and has his great surprise. "Read my lips?" Reasonable Paul realizes that Carla's ability to read lips, even from a long distance, is more than a fun trloro trick that first seems to be. From here a bun is developing. Enough to say it. <br /> <br /> Paul and Carla are a real criminal. He wants love but also accepts money. He certainly wants it, but business has to come up with a possible erotic cheese. Together with Cassel and Devos, there are powerful actors who, to their very end, bring a very unusual story of crime. Rent it or buy it, but if you like a good story of crime, you will go to "Read My Rips". And maybe you'll want to watch it a few times: I'm doing it. <br /> <br /> 9/10
