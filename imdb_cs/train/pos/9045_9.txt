There is a bit of trivia that should be emphasized on the scene early in the movie where Homer watches the attempt on December 6, 1957 (at least it was a video used on the television he watched) that showed Vangard a run attempt that failed. He is further shown to read or dictate a letter to Dr. Von Braun condemns the failure. Von Braun was at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville working for the army. The Vanguard project was the early NASA team, which soon became the Goddard Space air center. The army plunged into Jupiter-C, which was essentially American technology V2, but worked to launch the satellite in response to Russia's success with Sputnik. <br /> <br /> This mistake may have been created by Homer because of the famous Von Braun, but his team did not try to fail. In fact, Redstone had moved from the age of 52 and was the first American man to be rated as a booster, used for Shepard's suborbital flight, as well as Grissom. That's why this movie is as good as hopefully it will inspire people to read and mark these bits of triviality, and in that process they will see what has happened and be inspired to do more.
