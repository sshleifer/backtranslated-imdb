I've been looking at this document twice - and though I'm the mainstream movie fan, most of my documentaries do not trust me. But this movie was fascinating. Almost every slide is perfect - it says much more than just a sound comment (which does not have this document). The concept of this movie is amazing, I can not praise it enough. Mardi Gras Beads - Who Would You Think? <br /> <br /> Amazing and excellent interviewing choices - China film footage - the movie brings you to the feeling that you are there. <br /> <br /> I'm politically conscious - and I've read a few books on globalization, so there's nothing in this movie that would surprise me, but it made me think so much. <br /> <br /> I wish so much that this world is a better place. <br /> <br /> Many fools to the movie - and thanks for taking this movie. <br /> <br> I wish everyone could see.
