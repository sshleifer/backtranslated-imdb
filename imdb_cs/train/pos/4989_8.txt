It's very dated, but that's part of the spell with this 1933 movie. You can say the same for most movies before the code; they are simply different and usually interesting. It was a short run, the great acting of Spencer Tracy and the beautiful face and sweetness of Loretta Young, who kept me watching and enjoying this scary but interesting movie. <br /> <br /> You would find it hard to find a nicer girl than "Trinna" played by a 20 year old young woman who was already making her 50th film! (She began to act as a young child, and that movie films quickly retreated in the old days.) The camera, though in a soft focus throughout the film, has many times touched the face and eyes of Loretta and I enchant with my beauty. Tracy "Bill" slowly turned into a loving man thanks to Trinna. Spencer added his lines with such nature that you barely knew he was acting. Though they have small roles supporting Walter Connolly, Marjorie Rambeau, Arthur Hohl and Glenda Farrell are leaving long-lasting impressions long after watching a 75-minute film. I was particularly fascinated by Connolly's role as minister / father of the figure in the camp. The story is a bit crazy, but - hey - these are movies. This story concerns two lonely victims of the Great Depression trying to survive in a "Hooverville" camp, and it becomes a very moving story.
