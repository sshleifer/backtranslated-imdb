This is a racist film, but worthy of study and joy. For the first time, it is natural to focus on Erbe & Dad. They have a relaxed and quiet thing that still gets home to her at high school, and he retired and leaned back and waited for inspiration to do something. For the second time, you realize how horrifyingly your husband's sister is given away by her friends in the blues bar. Take it, it's just what you are doing today, and the critical moments are going as if they were talking about the weather. In the same scene, the blues song of the nurse is a real tear if you are not a little sensitive and similar to music. Her performance feels like the culmination of the story; a blues story with good people who are "people of color" in their element in backwoods, SC. Meanwhile, all the white people in the film are doing what seems to be shallow, insignificant lives that are only child-friendly. That's great, long, you know it as a fiction.
