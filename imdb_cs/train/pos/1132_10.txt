His Hollywood imitate Daytime Soap Operas at his best! It's a fun we never see. Great characters and great lines. Whoopi is cheerful ..... Sally Field is so over the top ... Gary Marshalls lines are uprisings .... that's what I like about good comedies. They are never afraid to enjoy themselves !!!!!! The sets were great ... the wardrobe was in place and the backstabbing "Montana Morehead" was a devilish pleasure. Terri Hatcher as "Dr. Monica Demonico" did not have enough lines, but it's still beautiful and fun when it's on the screen. I would like to know how the idea of ​​this film appeared. I have never seen the cast people have so much fun in making comedic work! Soapdish is a must, and I'm waiting for a DVD !!!
