Frailty - 8/10 - It's a non-sensational title and the title "Bill Paxton Directs" aside, it's a pretty good old-fashioned rip that sings with the biblical horror thriller. In the end, it can only end up as an inbred Southern Gothic cousin, Kubrick "The Shining" - but hey, that's a pretty damn funny notion. It also has an intriguing plot ... and a very ambiguous moral message. This is the kind of movie that has been capturing people late at night on the basic cable and scaring the beyjos watching them. Poor director Bill Paxton had to go play the star ... oh well ... still the devil of good rent.
