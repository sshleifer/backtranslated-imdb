Sandra Bernhard is quite a character, and certainly one of the most entertaining women in the world. She started out as a comedy daisy in the 1970's, but her big break came in 1983 when she played against Scott's underrated The Master of The Comedy, Jerry Lewis and Robert De Niro. Her film career, however, never failed. She made some weird but fun shows, such as "Dallas Doll" (1994) or "Dinner Rush" (2000), but the most amazing parts were the ones she created herself. <br /> <br /> "I'm nothing without you" is undoubtedly her best effort. Is it the adaptation of her smash-hit-Broadway show, which made her a superstar? and best friend Madonna for about four years. In ten perfectly choreographed and staged scenes, Sandra turns from Nina Simone to Diana Ross, talks about her childhood, Andy Warhol and San Francisco and plays songs famous for Bert Bacharach, Prince, or Sylvester. Director John Boskovich received Sandra to perform a 90-minute tour-de-force performance that is both sexy and fun. If you are a fan of Bernhard, you can not miss this movie; it is a tribute to her (strange) beauty as well as her extraordinarily unconventional talent as a comedy. And did this influence the creator in his work? For example, "Hedvig and Angry Inch" would look a lot different if it did not exist "Without you, I'm nothing".
