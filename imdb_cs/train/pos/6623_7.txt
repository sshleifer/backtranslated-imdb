First of all, this movie is painfully beautiful. Someone who works on 3D CG films as lighter / more composite, the images fired me away. Every moment I was amazed at what was on the screen As for the story, well, it's okay. It will not ignite the world, but if you like your futuristic Blade Runner-esquire stories (and who is not?), Then you will be fine. I have to say that I felt that voice acting was particularly faint and lost to the film as a whole. I saw it in the cinema in English, but I hope that somewhere in the French version somewhere. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth seeing.
