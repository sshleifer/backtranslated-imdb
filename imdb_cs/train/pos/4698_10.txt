Like wine, "Johnny Dangerously" improves and improves every day. This clever, humorous, good-looking movie could very well stand alone - but like a parody of the gangster genre, it's really great. In fact, this is, of course, the best film of its kind ... the most entertaining spoof of the mob movies and even the period - although it is true that this position is probably easier to achieve when its main competitors are such primitive, vulgar and blunt pseudo-comedies as " mafia Jane Austen ".
