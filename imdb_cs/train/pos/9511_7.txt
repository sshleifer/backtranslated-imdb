A bloody gangster story that takes place in years of great depression. He tells us about another famous hit, Michael (Mike) Salliwan. Somehow this time the story turns to the other side: Mike struggles to save his life and his only remaining son, because the rest of his family has been killed because of his dirty boss's game. He succeeds in vengeance and secures a fair future to his son, but eventually he is killed. Such stories never have a happy ending. Mike Salliwan's senior role was played by Tom Hanks and part of Mr. Rooney (Mafia boss) was performed by Paul Newman. The film has a great impression and we hear the familiar phrase "we rob banks". This movie is still worth watching, though you might expect something bigger than Sam Mendes after his American beauty.
