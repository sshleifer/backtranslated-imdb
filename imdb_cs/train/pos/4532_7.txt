It was the first performance of Keaton, and in fact, there are three short shorts that are in the eternal triangle of romance at different times (Stone Age, Roman Age, Modern Age). Stories were different in parallel, as in Griffith's INTOLERANCE, which meant to satiate. The strengths of jokes and gags mostly rely on anachronisms, bringing modern business into an ancient setting. <br /> <br /> **** WARNING - SPOILERS FOLLOWED TO IMPROVE BEST POINTS ****** <br /> <br /> Here are the classic moments: <br /> <br /> Use the turtle as the Earl (age of stones); Wristwatches containing sundial (Roman age); Chariot with reserve wheel (Roman age); Using the helmet as a tire lock (Roman age); Morning golf with clubs and rocks (stone age); Dictation of Will Carved into Rock (Stone Age); Changing meteorological meteorologist (Roman age); Chariot races in the snow -Buster uses skis and husks with a replacement dog in a boat car (Roman age). The above are all throwing gags that let us giggle. But there are also unforgettable moments: <br /> <br /> Buster pulls out the shaving equipment to match the make-up girl; A fantastic double take when Buster looks deftly on his plate and discovers the crab that looks at him (jumping in one second to stand in a sitting chair and rocking back into the waiter's shoulders - one of the most amusing moments I've ever had when he saw it). And the lion - manicure - is really great. There is an extraordinary racism when four African-American litter-bearers leave their lady for a game of Roman crap. <br /> <br /> Print The cinema is a bit unclear and contains numerous sequences of both nitrate damage and film damage - probably at the end of the discs. The Metro feature consists of a piano and flute, and is borrowed heavily from Grieg. Lots of fun and full of laughter.
