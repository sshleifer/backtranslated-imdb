Fire And Ice is an animated film in the fantasy world. The film is about a village that is destroyed by a huge glacier, home to the evil Lord Nekron. The only survivor in the village is a young man named Larn, who is about to avenge those who were killed by glaciers. Iceberg Ice passes through the landscape of fire and the princess of the land called Teegra is abducted by evil creatures. Larn decides to find her and is also about to find and kill Nekron. Fire And Ice is directed by Ralph Bakshi, one of my favorite adult animators. He has brought us such animated masterpieces as the film version of Fritz The Cat and some of the films he has written as a big movie Heavy Traffic. I did not like the fire and the ice almost like what I did in Ralph Bakshi's other work, but I made the movie fun. She had a very nice animation in parts and the story was fun enough. The only basic complaint I have is that I wish the film was more of a story, because the story it uses is very thin and not much. I also want the movie to be a little longer because it's less than 80 minutes running. Still it's fun adventure films that, unlike Fritz The Cat or Heavy Traffic, are suitable for children from the age of 8. I just wish that there was a more developed story, and it was a little longer than it did.
