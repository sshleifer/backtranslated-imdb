After seeing all the films of Jesse James, Quantrilla, Jayhawker, etc. in the 1950s, It's quite exciting to see this film with a new perspective by director Ang Lee. The Lawrence attack scene in Kansas is amazing. The romantic relationship between Jewel and Toby McGuir is one of the best parts, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is great as a bad guy. All the time, this film causes the horror of war and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they will survive the next few hours. It is definitely worth seeing.
