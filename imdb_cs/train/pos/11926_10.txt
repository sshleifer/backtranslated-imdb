The quality of this movie is simply unmatched by some baseball title of his time. Pam Dixon develops in the film industry to gain the blue chips and has made this artistic work a must. The Oscar winners, Brenda Fricker (Home Alone: ​​Lost in New York, Time to Kill), Ben Johnson (The Last Picture Show) and Adrien Brody (The Pianist, The Village) intensify the atmosphere of the film in an anxious audience. However, dramatic performances are neutralized by the extraordinary radio broadcast by Jay O. Sanders (JFK, The Day After Tomorrow). The story is centralized around a foster child, the forthcoming actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt (brick, outlook). Sidekick Milton Davis Jr. brings performance as a lasting friend who never knew his parents. They both have not much, but what they have: Angels baseball and what they are looking for: identity. That's when Emmy Nominee, four times, Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon, Predator 2) comes to save the day as a frustrated Angels manager George Knox. In relation to all the characters in the story, they seem to have the same mission: they are looking inside to find out who they really are. <br /> <br /> In depression over the fact that Roger (JGL) is separated from his father, he desires God to reunite if angels can take the flag. Courses are astronomical, but Triple Champion Emmy Christopher Lloyd (back to the future, my favorite Martian) will come as a ubiquitous warden to work with a small magic game. Before you know it, Al (Lloyd) sits with Roger in the booths, welds on the cracker jacks and causes some of the biggest candy in baseball! Dorothy Kingsley and George Wells (DK Oscar Nominee GW Oscar Winner) The 1951 screenplay is justice under the finger of William Dear (nominated in the Directors Guild of America). It features a touching side story that focuses on jarring Mel Clark, starring Tony Danza (a candidate for the Golden Globe, an Emmy nominee) who is trying to find his place in confused Anaheim in relation to all the other cast members. Clark was named as a wash, once a big name in Cinci, but he has something Knox manages to do. Spoiling this nip-biting conspiracy would simply be equivalent to committing adultery in the 18th century. This is a diamond in roughness, and will hold you on the edge of the seat until everyone comes to rest. Did I mention that Matthew McConaughey (time to kill, we are Marshall) for all those ladies there?
