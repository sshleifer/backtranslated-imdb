They have not seen the film since the first release, but it was unforgettable. The performance of Rip Torn and Conchata Farrell was great, photos of an excellent, moving story line and everything else was top-notch. It seems somewhat forgotten <br /> <br /> Maybe because it is a special market for the UK, but I have not seen a movie on TV or video, which is sad. Is it a bigger success in the US where it could well be considered a fairly accurate historical drama? You always think that 50% of good film is music, and though I'm not sure, I think the title was a simple but moving clarinet solo "What a friend we have in Jesus." The movie then went on to overturn it! Am I right or wrong?
