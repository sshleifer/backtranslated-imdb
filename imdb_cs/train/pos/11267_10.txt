Robert Wuhl teaches film students at the University of New York, Manhattan, New York. It includes mistakes of history and truth that are no longer well known. I would like to see much more of this show. It's very fun. Mr. Wuhl uses examples and "show and tell" to gain his points. He explained that Paul Revere was not the person who actually traveled through Paul Revere's half-hour ride! Henry Wadsworth Longfellow used the name of Revere because it sounds better. I've been watching Robert Wuhl for many years since watching the floor comedy and all the way through HBO's "Arli $$". He's a good actor and good comic, but he's a great teacher! I strongly recommend watching the episode of this show. It's worth it.
