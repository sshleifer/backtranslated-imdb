Deodato brings us slightly shocking moments and a movie that is not too serious about too much. It's absolutely classic in its own special way. This film offers a refreshing view of barbarians. If you have the opportunity to see this movie do so. You will most likely have a smile on your face most of the time. Not because it's funny or so light like that, but because it's so bad, it's on the other side and it's good, though maybe not pure, fun.
