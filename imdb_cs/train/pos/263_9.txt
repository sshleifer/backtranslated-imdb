It was a powerful Poirot / Suchet, a television mysterious choice. The characters were alive and well-acting. The conspiracy and the main settings - student dormitory - were excellent. Japp was nothing special, but he did not turn the story for me. One important point, many Poirot observers do not recognize good behavior or good characterization. I also think they are somewhat cruel in their judgments of some Poirot secrets. Finally, I read several Christie novels - none in recent years - and it was unpleasant that so many viewers are upset about changes in the novel. Spectators, please, consider what we present to you on the film and not what you think should be there. This means that Poirot's secrets differ in quality, but not as much as the reviewers and reviewers believe. With the unique exception of the "Five Little Swans", which was fabulous in the plot, nature and theme, longer Poirot's films are neither good nor bad. For the record I have seen all the longer Poirot / Suchet films. Finally, movies without Lemon, Hastings and / or Jappu are neither good nor bad due to their absence. However, the presence is either annoying (almost always with Japp) or irrelevant to Hastings. Lemon is in the middle.
