This film must be seen in the right frame of mind. First of all, the relationship between the central father and the son is quite clear that the film was designed as the predecessor of his Wong Fei Hung movie "Drunken Master," not the "Young Master"; that Chan deviated from this plan and renamed the signs suggests that he himself was not convinced that the material is being collected correctly and the film really feels incomplete, for example a romantic relationship around which half of the plot turns remains completely hanging at the end of the film . The "young master" of the same period also feels underdone, but at least all of its central threads are tied together at the end. This film feels as though Chan struggled with plotting and characters trying to find his central theme just to leave effort, perhaps due to time and budget. Or perhaps the film is just too ambitious. This is an important feature film in Han's career because he has pledged to develop a central character over all the other concerns - which is why the film has a shortage of kung fu. Chan wants to make a historic romantic comedy that just happens to have kung fu in it. But both the historical element and the romantic element meet little more than a conspiracy. <br /> <br /> It leaves us a comedy. Since Chan is interested in character development, comedy is largely driven by the character - as in the conflict between the character of Chan and his best friend, the argument over the girl. But there's also a lot of scarecrow. Honestly, I find it fun enough to forgive the incompleteness of the plot. This film represents the effort of Chan's team to find a viable formula that can evolve and evolve over time. It does not work well and Chan would find this formula only after leaving the historical elements of his earlier films and creating the current action comedy "Police Story". But returning to this film is still very informative as Chan turned into a historical genre, and perhaps why he left him.
