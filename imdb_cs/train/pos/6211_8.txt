Fleet was released in 1936 during the past period of depression, when people had hard times around the world to find a job or even find a meal that could be on the table. In Europe, Hitler was on the rise along with other nationalist / socialist attacks. In the United States, the cartel seed sown by the Federal Reserve Act and the change in the income tax (16) for the interconnected financial capitalists and their dominant secret societies begin. <br /> <br /> For the average man and girl, the times were tough. Go to Hollywood at least with some promising pictures? I do not think we could rightly call them propaganda at this time, though this particular film is about military-preparatory naval exercises. The real thing for boys and girls, like now, was how to connect with the right, lead a decent life, have beautiful children, with a minimum of grace and elegance. <br /> <br /> The odds were long. <br /> <br /> For a complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my TheCoffeeCoaster.com site. <br /> <br /> Brian Wright Copyright 2007
