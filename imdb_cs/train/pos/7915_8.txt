These are "odysesses in time" through computer animation, probably the work of more than 300 artists. Made in the late 1980s and released in 1990, it was a top-class product for the whole day. I thought it was good and quite interesting. </ P> <p> Most short scenes made no sense, only forms developed into other forms, but it was fun to watch. That's all about the visuals, not the story. There were some strange sequences in which birds could hear strange birds. Everything is computer-animated, which was new at the time. Even the term "computer animated" was not well known. It's just a chance to show this new technology in short bits of cartoon-like events with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes. No words, just pictures with electronic music. Stoners must really love it. <br /> <br /> It's a nice, interesting 40 minute "candy eye" and "candy head". Thanks to today's effects of CG, it may have lost its impact, but I think you'd still have fun.
