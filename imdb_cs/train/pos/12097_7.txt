This complicated story starts quite simply when an English journalist accepts a bet from Edgar Allen Poe and his friend Lord Blackwood that he can not spend the night at the spooky Blackwood Castle. Once there, the writer travels through the dusty rooms and corridors until the music and the view of the war couple are brought into the empty room. He sits at the harpsichord and begins to play the melody he heard, and he is surprised to see that the beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood is on his shoulder. She informs him in an ambiguous enchanting / mysterious way that she has set her room upstairs and that somebody is expected sometime ... Night of the Dead. So begins a surprising series of supernatural events that disrupt journalists for the rest of the night. SPOILER AHEAD: Probably not surprising too many audiences to find out that beautiful Elizabeth is really a ghost. This does not prevent her from falling in love with the journalist, but making things much more complicated for them than for the average couple. It's a fun movie that has everything: spirits, a spooky lock, repeated visions of past events, sex and violence (though both have been weakened in the version most Americans have seen over the years.) Lovely, fascinating Barbara Steele is the main reason , why to see it. It has a strange charisma, unlike someone else you've ever seen in movies. We recommend!
