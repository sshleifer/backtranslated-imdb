At this point, it seems almost unnecessary to say that Jon Bon Jovi brings a solid, powerful, seamless performance like Derek Bliss. His ability as an actor was previously based on his critical acclaim in other films (Leading Man, No Looking Back). But if someone is still thinking, yes, Jon Bon Jovi can act. It can behave well and it is expected. It's easy to separate Derek from a guy who gets rid of VH-1. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would not watch a horror movie. I expected them to focus on the sensational gore rather than dialogue and plotting. What pleased me most was that there really was a viable plot. Gore is not enough to become the center of the film and does not have a worryingly realistic quality of films with higher technical effects. So gore fans can be disappointed, but the story fans will not. <br /> <br /> Unlike an action movie like the U-571, where the dialogue has taken the back of the bomb, we get a chance to get to know the "good guys" and actually take care of what happens to them. Several scenes remain unexplained (like Derek's hallucinations), but you feel that certain aspects are as if they should lay the foundation for the sequel. Unfortunately, with Hollywood not interested in this movie, this sequel will never happen. These few cases are forgiven because they know that vampires could be a continuing series. Is this the best movie I've ever seen in my life? No. Is this a good way to spend about two hours having fun? Yes. He will not let a man worry about horror films with insomnia, and even a horror film lover will not be completely disappointed. If you're somewhere between a horror genre and a horror genre, this movie is for you. It will achieve a happy media with effects and stories that match. <br /> <br />
