I loved this movie. It's definitely an inspirational film. It fills you with pride. This movie is worth renting or buying. It should be in every house. The best movie I've ever seen. It will be crazy, because everyone is so clever to Carl Brashear, but in the end it improves. It's a story of romance, drama, action and lots of fun lines to keep you tuned. I love lots of quotes. I use them all the time. They help me keep the task I want to do. It shows that everyone can achieve their dreams, all they have to do is work on it. It's a long movie, but every time I look at it, I never forget it's as long as it is. I'm interested in it so fast. I love this movie. I look at it whenever I can.
