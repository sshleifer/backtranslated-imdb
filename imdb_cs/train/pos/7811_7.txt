Steve Biko was a black activist who tried to resist a white minority run by South Africa, just as Gandhi tried to withstand the colonialism of the British Empire in India. Richard Attenborough's film The Crystal Freedom is not about Biko or Apartheid, just as about Donald Woods, a white liberal journalist who risked his life and tried to tell Bik's story. The film has an overwhelming view of how Biko dies in jail on susceptible behavior in the hands of the South African "police". Woods, who plays Kevin Kline, must decide whether to do the right thing and run from that country to publish books about Biko, or let his wife, Penelope Wilton's play, push him into forgetting books. In that case, Biko disappears in vain. What begins as a relationship between Bike and Woods, which changes life, deteriorates after the death of Bikon by the number of leakage numbers across the borderline. Denzel Washington, who is nominated for an Oscar, is good at his fourth film as Biko, but in a film that attempts to show apartheid matches, he is more focused on white family exams for more than half the film. Attenborough would serve his topic better by focusing on Biko's rise to prominence instead of the beginning where Biko and Woods were friends. Perhaps the black actor in the lead role in a 2Â½-hour movie was not convincing for the big box office but the film was a huge boxing flop. Film politics aside, the film still enjoys sending a message or two, though in PG a sanitary way. *** from 4 stars.
