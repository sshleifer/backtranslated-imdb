This is a wonderful film visually. The paintings of the Mexican desert, the old mansion, the figures in their picturesque costumes ... all represent a real work of art. The story looks a bit loose, but that's because it's not meant to be realistic. This is taken from a book called "A hundred years of loneliness", and it should be the provocation of an isolated, adulterous atmosphere of Latin America "so far from God and so close to the United States." The huge debt owed to her grandmother by Erendi is symbolic of the international debt burden of Latin America, although there are many layers of significance. If you can appreciate a slowly moving, richly textured movie, it's for you.
