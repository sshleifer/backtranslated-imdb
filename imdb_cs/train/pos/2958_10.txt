Comedy of epic entertainment proportions from boys who brought you South Park and most of the boys from Orgazmo. This vulgar, obscene film has a totally disgusting, egogistic and satirical content. It portrays the incredibly cruel treatment of humans and animals. I LOVE IT!!!!! These are some funny things. Really funny. Two loser friends create a game in their driveway that explodes into a national feeling. Corruption, greed, and extortion of the sporty skin and its coop will correct it. And on the way, you laugh. Many. That is all. Enjoy!!!!
