The extraordinary and rather funny sleep of two very different brothers who are not only so-called "Fire starters" (think that Stephen King is snoring a book of the same name) but also in contrast to a woman, have a rather unpleasant habit of being pyromaniac ! Good special effects (especially at the end), special performances from a handsome talented trio of actors and complete with a really interesting and strangely sound soundtrack eventually make "Wilder Napalm" a unique movie atmosphere that you can watch ... if you find it! On a personal note, I was so lucky to have taken it (I speak) from a two dollar basket at my local video store. (*** outside *****)
