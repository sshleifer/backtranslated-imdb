Greetings again from the darkness. 18 directors from 18 seemingly unrelated vinettes of love in the city of lights. A very unusual format that captures several segments that adapt to the viewer. We are so accustomed to character development during a two-hour film, it's a bit disarming that this will happen in an 8-minute segment. The idea is 18 stories of love / relationship in 18 different neighborhoods of this beautiful city. Of course, some stand out better than others and some go to comedy, while others focus on dramatic emotions. Among them are some well-known directors: Brothers Coen, Wes Craven, Alfonso Cuaron, Alexander Payne, Gus Van Sant and Gurinda Chadha. Many famous faces also appear: Steve Buscemi, Barbet Schr√∂der, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Ben Gazzara, Gena Rowlands, Gerard Depardieu, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, Nick Nolte, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Bob Hoskins. <br /> <br /> One of the best segments includes the mime, and then another mime and nerdy, yet the happy young son of both mimi. Also the role of the red trench coat, cancer, divorce, sexual fantasy, child's death and many other topics play a key role. Do not miss Alexander Payne (director "Sideways") like Oscar Wilde. The variety of segments makes it interesting to watch, but as a movie, it can not be marked as great. It's still very observable and a nice change in tempo for frequent movie visits.
