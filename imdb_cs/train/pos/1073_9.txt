We've had several episodes that have come to Dark Angel as a story and a series because we have moved from the Sopranos, a very different framework of mentality. But as soon as we got the hint of the show, we were hooked very quickly. It's a shame that the series ended just when it started to move into a good category: Dark Angelwas much more than your average TV series. It digs the butt and stones in terms of action, but the interaction of the characters and the social response to the "mutants" reminds us of the constant prejudices we face (and do) every day. The fact that the story will happen in the future keeps the mood superlative and prevents the anti-discrimination message in our faces being shaken (thus it does not destroy the "entertainment" for those who do not like to be lectured during the fun), but each event and human / social interaction remain for the present being relevant. We all make judgments, we face our own prejudices, but ultimately, the question of who are you liars: do you sit down and deny your mind, or get up and do something about it? For those who have no choice but to fight, survive or just, this series strengthens them. For those who have never met this question, this series "slips" into this message under the guise of pure action fun. It is much more well-written and well written than most television series; I am very disappointed that it was over before it really could have reached a high speed.
