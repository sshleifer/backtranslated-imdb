So I felt like watching this movie. I loved it. It was hilarious. But I felt like I was getting a puzzled look into someone's psychia and then laughing as he spun around to make an interesting point. My friend put it this way: <br /> <br /> "I feel we've gotten into someone's house and now without their knowledge they watch their terrible home videos." Another of these facts is alien to the feature films. "Groovin 'Gary," the original "Beaver Kid," is a small urban guy who appears on a nearby TV station in the hopes of getting into the movie - and it certainly does, though not, perhaps, as originally expected. With great hope for glory and significance, he invites Harris to come and shoot the really horrible talent search he held in his home town - where he replaced his own drummer Olivia Newton-Don. Director Trent Harris is doing a great job with this slowly evolving story. Some shots of a tough guy who wants to be morphs, over two more reinterpretations, into the story of freedom from suppressed sexual identity in the small town of America. At the same time Harris criticizes the attitudes of America's small town, celebrity culture, and the exploitative practices of the film and television industry. Sean Penn and Grispin Glover will perform a stunning performance. young Sean Penn is the most evocative - so he closely follows real "Gary shots," but with strong nuances to push a sense of interaction as Harris wants it to go. <br /> <br /> The end of the widespread naivety that the original Gary is what absorbed me - when I opposed these possible interpretations of the situation. A film that he should not miss. I have never seen anything like this. Jacob.
