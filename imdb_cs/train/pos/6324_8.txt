These guys are just ordinary suspects! It's the whole bunch of noble breaths you want to see how to get them, but they're so unhappy that there's only a very little chance of it. Nobody is better than William H Macy in showing a man with a big heart, but down to his luck. This is probably his best performance since Fargo.Sam Rockwell played boxer meat to perfection, and the rest of the gang was equally good.Luis Guzman brought some great comic reliefs like Cosimo and George Clooney stole every scene in his acting role. At the end, the scary scene was totally cheerful. The direction of the Russians was also on the spot. There was certainly Brothers Coen to feel the film all the time, and it would be interesting to see how they would develop their career. They have a long way to go with Coen, but it's a great start and I look forward to their next celluloid trip. ....... "Yo mutha is fuck"!
