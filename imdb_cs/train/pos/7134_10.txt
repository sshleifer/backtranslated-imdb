John Thaw is a great actor. I have to admit that I was amazed by my scope as an old bush who reluctantly agrees to take the evacuee from the streets of London (the era of World War II). <br /> <br /> It has been said, the movie is also excellent. A very moving story with a satisfactory end. Some characters are somewhat underdeveloped (especially a school teacher), but none of them is essential for plotting. Basically, there's a story about old men and boys, and the film needs something different.
