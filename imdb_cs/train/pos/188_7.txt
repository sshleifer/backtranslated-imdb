I'm a huge classic movie fan, but I'm just getting into silent movies. Many silent films do not hold my attention, but Show People is a remarkable exception. <br /> <br /> Marion Davies and William Haines are just great in this picture. Especially Davies shows a wide range as it moves from the giggle of a small town girl to a starlet she takes too seriously. Show People is a fast-paced movie with a fantastic series of cameras by some of the greatest star of the silent era. The film immediately caught my attention and actually I forgot that it was a silent film. (I know it does not make much sense, but it has happened.) The actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialog boxes are needed. Show People is the perfect introduction to silent movies. It's a fast, interesting film with the two best stars of the silent era. Adding to the satire of Hollywood and Show People should be on the 'must see' list for all classic movie enthusiasts.
