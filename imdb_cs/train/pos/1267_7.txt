JUST CAUSE is a flawed, but decent movie combined with powerful performances and some creative (though extremely predictable) writing. Sean Connery is a death penalty crusader he brought to save the seemingly innocent young black man (Blair Underwood) before the final punishment. If you want to set things right, Connery goes to the crime scene, where he has to face not only the passing of time, but also the obstacle to Sheriff (Laurence Fishbourne). Reversals, turns, and reversals of roles are tremendous - some surprising, some not - as an aging crusader tries to reveal a secret. The climatic end is a bit absurd, but JUST CAUSE is worth a slow night.
