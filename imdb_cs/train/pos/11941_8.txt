Their journalists Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell of "His Girl Friday" or witty detective William Powell and harsh Mrs. Myrna Loy of Thin Man do not resign, but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are surprisingly charming as amateurs in Scoop. Their dizzying repair is postmodern rather than depressed, Allen's writing is full of ironic self-knowledge and simple old New York. The shadows of an old joke are rare, for example, when Sid, the great magician Splendini, responds to his background: "I was born into Hebrew persuasion, but when I was old I turned to narcissism." Johansson, fresh from Allen's Match Point as a bad girl, will become a fairly good, sometimes witty journalist who seized the mystery of a London murder: a serial killer. This plot is a reworking of his recent London thriller Match Point, right up to the upper classes of sins and the "American tragedy" / place in the "crash" solar ship. In fact, Allen is reworking Manhattan Murder Mystery and Purple Rose from Cairo to name just a few other examples. I do not have to worry about working again; I would like the new material to be at least equal to the originals and unfortunately it is just a reflection of its younger size. Allen as a director and actor can not hide his love for the actor, as he did not manage for Diane Keaton, so he takes a comedy at the right place after the Allen canon, not big but fun, sometimes brilliantly satirical: A suspect murderer of the upper class, Sid (Allen) "I would be very surprised to kill one person." This is vintage Allen humor. While there are hardly any clear literary cues as in most of his film, he masks Scoop with music from Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Strauss to tell us Woodman has not lost his touch of class.
