I watched a movie that recovers from big operations. While I knew it was just "B", universe western, I loved it. Perhaps it lacked the glimpse of high dollar productions that did not have my imagination and provided a great escape. Unfortunately, our company has so much available, discounting small attempts is too easy. Likewise, I can even enjoy Shakespeare's school performance, I can appreciate many levels of success for art. I am a cop and I found affinity with the LAPD retired. Dreams, such as his persecution, that in a time of crisis we will not be able to respond to the rescue of another (or our own) life. while it was a romantic end, when Farnsworth pulled out the evil guy (predictable), I needed a bit of a happy romance where she could have a good triumph. My world is really too cynical.
