It's definitely one of the most humorous and twisted ones I have not seen. Christopher Reeve and Micheal Caine were great and let me go through the whole affair. <br /> <br /> Very stylish pieces and props really give the atmosphere to a deal. The minimalist feeling works for the whole picture. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is not in the movie itself, but the lack of a decent widescreen DVD release. I'm the owner of the whole version (which proves that I love the movie so much that it can hold a full-screen presentation), but the amazing Deluxe or "special" version would certainly have earned my money.
