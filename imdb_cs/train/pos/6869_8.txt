This movie may seem dated today, but remember it was made in 1974 - before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, back when George Carlin just got behind Hippie Dippie Weatherman and heavy satirical humor. This film is the grandfather of all. Enjoy it for its historical significance as well as for its great entertainment.
