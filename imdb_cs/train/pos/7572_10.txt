I just can not believe that these games can be much better, but they do it. Unfortunately, I had to rent Dreamcast, but even if I beat it, I can not wait to buy it for PS2. This is the only series of games I have to own, even though I've defeated them many times. I hope they never stop doing this type of game, even if the series has to end. <br /> <br />
