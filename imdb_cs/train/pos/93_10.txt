My first child was born in the year when this program came out, and then I played a record album for boys every following Christmas. When the CD came out, I bought about ten copies, and I still give them friends and relatives at the start of the family ... they always become their favorite Christmas album. I recently found several DVDs (made on DVD-R from videotapes, probably) for sale on eBay. The one I bought was a great copy and it was great to see the show after more than 25 years. There are some tracks on the show that were not on the album and some songs on the album were studio versions of the same tracks in the show. But CDs and DVDs will remain in our library as the best Christmas entertainment ever.
