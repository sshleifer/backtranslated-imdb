Takashi Miike is one of my favorite directors and he feared he was making a kid's film because I would hate to see him leaving his movies. I love: visitor Q, Gozu, Izo, killer Ichi and the trilogy of Black Sociot. Recently, it seems to be exploring the new territory and I think it has succeeded. Still, it was the first of his films I saw taking him so I was nervous. I bought it rough without seeing it, and I was glad I did it. Great Yokai war is a perfect kid film and adults should also like it. The whole movie reminded me of so many films I loved as a child: Infinite Story, Labyrinth, Return to Oz etc. I enjoyed these films because they did not like the kids as if they were stupid, not even. The dark nature of morality is there, but it's as silly as any child's film should be. Personally, I was not bothered by CGI and prosthetics. I feel they fit well and I do not think they will notice the kids. <br /> <br /> If you are a heavy fan of Takashi Miike, you may not like it. But I suggest that I try it. He proves that Miike is as diverse and talented as I thought he was. He also continues to make his signature Miike films outside of these, which is very reassuring. For those people who are new to Takashi Miike and want some light of heart or dramatic like this, I suggest these other movies Miike: "Zebraman" "Fortune Katakuris" "Sabu" and "Birds People in China". <br /> <br /> Good work Takashi Miike! 8/10 stars.
