This film seems to draw the border - on the one hand, those who love it, on the other, those who find it intolerable. <br /> <br /> First, there is a lot of comedy in this movie, many viewers are "not getting". Of course the Jet Li mask looks like Kato Bruce Lee - it was supposed to be, it's a joke. The guy who has a time bomb in his heart - outrageous? Of course it's a joke! Some readers are probably asking if this movie is so funny, why is all over and cruel violence? well, on the one hand, the tolerance of this level of violence is really different from culture to culture; and while the Hong Kong audience recognizes that this violence is extreme, it is certainly just a bit more than the average for HK action film. Also, Black Mask is really a kind of film that accepts genre conventions and pushes the end, simply because the conventions themselves are completely unrealistic. After decades of watching people who were shot without visible open wounds, many people were appalled that they saw Bonnie and Clyde and the wanderers who wandered in blood. But the fact is that when you are shot with a fast metal projectile, it is almost certain that the blood will develop, especially from the artery. This movie is a Chinese comic book. It is true that Spiderman films will never get this horror - but if they were true, they would have been! Well, despite the origins of comics, this film is true to reality. The only complaint I've got is flashing, overly stylized shooting and editing. If the filmmakers were filming a Hollywood-style nostalgia (like The Rocketeer or a recent Captain Sky movie), I doubt anyone would think it offensive. <br /> <br /> But at his stage I was still watching this movie.
