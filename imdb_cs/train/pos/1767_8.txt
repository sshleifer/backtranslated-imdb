Steve Carell made a career with a bit of a strange guy, first on "The Daily Show" and then on various supporting roles. At Virgin Carell he has found a clever and cheerful script that makes perfect use of his strengths. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle-aged man living in a quiet, lonely life. Andy is a bit weird, but some unpleasant nice guy. One night, for the first time with his coworkers, Andy accidentally reveals that she is a virgin. His collaborators David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially chose Andy's situation. But it is clear that all three have a certain respect for a decent man, who is Andy, and have decided to help him by helping him finish his virginity. And so begins Andy's search for adulthood. Andy is basically innocent and most of the humor comes from his naivete to the situation he's in the movie. Some of the humor are gross rough things, but most of them are just a good-made intelligent comedy. Moreover, I realized that some parts of the film are quite touching, as Andy finds himself in the development of both romantic relationships and friendship perhaps for the first time in his life. I'm not trying to show the movie as a love story or drama; it's comedy in the seats. Still, every good comedy I've ever seen has enough hearts to take care of the characters. A good comparison should be "Wedding" from the summer. Mrs. Virgin has a similar humor, but maybe a little more vulgar in some of his jokes. I especially loved the end of the movie, which I thought was the perfect way to end the movie. Without giving anything, she reminded me of something about "Mary about Mary." Very light and fun; it lets you laugh and smile, which is exactly what you should feel when you finish the comedy. I would highly recommend you.
