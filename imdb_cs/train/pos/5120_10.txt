Quickly and simply, I love this movie. As some others mentioned, I'm not from the South, I really do not care about country music and I never wore a cowboy hat. (I never met in a car with a dead body in my suitcase, but I love "Goodfellas".) That's just a great movie. Recorded at 2.35 aspect ratio and beautifully converted to DVD. (VHS was 1.33 on full screen). And yes, a solid 5.1 mix for your experiences from the perspective. What can you say about this movie? It's just a great story of love and hatred in Texas with great performance. Travolta is fantastic. Besides "Pulp Fiction" it's the best he did. It's at my top 5 for 25 years !! <br /> <br /> Look at this! It's 10 !!!!
