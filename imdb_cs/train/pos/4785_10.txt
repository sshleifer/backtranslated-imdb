[No Spoilers] <br /> <br /> As David Lynch's film, he might have the idea that it depicts his mysterious mind as most of his feature films do. But it is a very convenient story, as the title could suggest. If you do not want to be captured in the usual Lynch empty space, which usually occurs after viewing, such as the Lost Highway. It's a simple movie, but it's really a great movie. This is both an innovative and entertaining aspect. It's innovative because it's not Lynch. But maybe it's Lynch. He likes to twist our mind, and thus combines a movie that may seem very common and far from Lynch himself. As a very avant-garde director, he could make such a film just to keep his audience away from it because he knows what they expect, but he does not. That would be handy. <br /> <br /> The pace of the movie is slow. I would almost say the speed of the mower ... Do not expect the action orgy, but the movie is really fun for those who go with the flow of the film. Look closely at those little details that Lynch has written throughout the movie for our fun. Check out the great cinematography that animates this movie. And listen to Badalamenti's score and the main theme that really live Iowa and Wisconsin landscapes often show. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth placed one of his best performances in this movie, making him one of the most liked ol men ever portrayed on the film. He does not have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts. His merriment just shines through him, and his acting brings him an Oscar nomination. Do I have to say that his weak health in this film has not been dealt with? He was diagnosed with cancer and shot himself after the film was completed. This knowledge puts more emphasis on the film, because it becomes more of a respect for Farnsworth. <br /> <br /> All of the above are a very nice movie that is suitable for all kinds of people who like the movie the way they should be done. You could ask for homilies that are not so obvious and a bit naive, but they do not destroy the overall picture because it's an unforgettable movie. 9/10.
