I chose this from the interview and was very pleasantly surprised. A lot of tight, expressionist work with the camera, the same tight script, and two outstanding actors joined together to create one very fine film. Not for the plasma multiplex brain, but rather for the true cinema fan. If Hollywood ever got his dirty hands, he would destroy it. Choice around the neighborhood. The other posters here more than just sang their praises, so I do not have to bother duplicate their paeans; just take my advice and mine, and do not miss this gem. Say what you like; I call her two hours of fun. Read your lips: Do not miss.
