Everyone has already commented on cinematography (good to great), personality (greater than life), structure (chronological, with many references to surf culture in time). What is missing is a bigger question of sociological significance: the attraction of American culture to something more full and rewarding. In the 1970s, I was a surfer. We watched 16mm films at local secondary schools in SoCal. I remember the great feeling of surfing all day until my skin radiates warmth, applying Hawaiian shirts and shorts and watching the latest surfing movie at night. Often a narrator was a filmmaker himself, reading a paper-based script. Sometimes a surf group or a proto-punk band would add music. I've never been happier. In addition to hurrying and smirking, he saw me, "Horse rider" took me back in time. It also reinforced the feeling of living on the edge without taking care of money and climbing at the social and corporate level that it can not keep up with Jones and physically and mentally push for a moment of joy and joy - it may be the answer to the question: What is the meaning of life?" At least for those like Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton, and others, they seem to have found something that few of us are sufficiently brave or honest to ourselves to strive for life to live exclusively on our own terms. Maybe a company breaks apart if we all do exactly what we wanted in life, but it's amazing to see people who really live in their dreams. This message truly impressed me.
