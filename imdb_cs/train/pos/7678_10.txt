I just watched Holly along with another film about trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation of children called Trade at Film by the Sea at the International Film Festival. I have to say that Holly exploded the Shop from the water. <br /> <br /> Holly is a powerful and amazing movie on many different levels. From a purely artistic and film perspective, it's amazing. Mixing sound, camera angles, direction, and gaming are in place. <br /> <br /> In addition, the way the item is handled is tasteful and inefficient. It poses the issue of sexual exploitation of children in a way that is both educative and accurate. The filmmakers paid great attention to detail and actually captured the nuances of the epidemic of sexual exploitation and trafficking in children. Too often these are subjects of this kind, it is tempting to shock the audience with graphic scenes of rape and violence. Holly is able to achieve all of this without going into the typical Hollywood trend. <br /> <br /> I was delighted to see Holly at two separate film festivals, once in the US and once in the Netherlands. I can honestly say that I have never seen the audience move more. Just listening to the interviews after the screening, people are asking what they can personally do to combat child sexual exploitation. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to everyone, both for its cinematic value and for its subject.
