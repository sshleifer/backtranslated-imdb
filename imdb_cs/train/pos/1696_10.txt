This is culture. My friends and I meet once a year to enjoy this movie. It's very fun and very dry. I've seen this movement a dozen times and I still did not like it. The actors are funny, and that's better with every watch! If you like "Moroni of the Universe," you will love it. Great game about world war. I like rampage Red-Neck to get foreigners, hood bug, DOD, Heat Seeking Populous Annihilator, Mining Field, Red Camo, speeding over 1800 km / h! "I'll get a bucket!" Very funny. I'd like it to be released on DVD! Forget negative reviews to see it yourself!
