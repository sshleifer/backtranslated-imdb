California was released in 1993, as well as 3 of the 4 leading figures who have reached the level of fame they now have in 2006. This is a nice psycho-thriller that should appeal to all fans of David Duchovny for his dry and intelligent narrative , who will find their way to their work, as well as most of his episodes from X-Files, Playing God, and Red Shoe. People who have been postponed by a heavy southern accent from Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, of course, have never lost much in the South. For each "Brian and Carrie" in the south is "Adele and Early" and in 2006 it is the real horror of this film. Besides, I think the film was written with a cult film design - like Carrie's photo - is not suitable for mass consumption. But if you have a copy of this in your personal library, I think it says something positive about your taste for weird movies.
