While prices have risen much and some details have become dated, every homeowner who has struggled with house ownership problems would have made a lot of smile from this movie. I know I did it. <br /> <br /> Blandings, Managing Director of New York, decides to move his family to suburban Territory in Connecticut and build a nice house there. It gets into one joyous jam after another, from mortgages to legal disputes to building difficulties, because the cost and schedule of the construction are still out of control. I thought the funniest scenes were the places where Blandings hired the supplier to kick the water well. They dig hundreds of feet, but they never find water. Just a few days away, a few days later, in the underground of his flood! Cary Grant and Myrna Loy give an incredible performance when Blandings's couple harasses problems they have never imagined and Melvyn Douglas is even better than Blanding's lawyer and family friend. The only warning is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948. Mrs. Blandings is portrayed as a bit naive maze who does not know how many other problems she is doing, and there is a black virgin (horror!). So do not look at this movie through the social lens of 2003 and you will enjoy it much more. <br /> <br />
