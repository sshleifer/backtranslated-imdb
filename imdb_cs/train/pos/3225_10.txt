When I leased the movie to look at it, I knew it would not be a movie that would become an idea. Instead, I thought about it as a disbelief in reality, where someone is going to seriously defeat. And you know what worked. Kurt Russel did what I had, but it was a remarkable role in showing the helpless soldier who was. I recommend this movie if you are with boys and would like to watch a good action movie.
