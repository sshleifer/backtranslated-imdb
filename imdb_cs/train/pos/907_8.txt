This film is a great attempt to revive traditional Indian values ​​that are being replaced by the Western ones. It is a common family story that shows all the ethics that every person should follow when communicating with every relative around him. Shahid Kapoor gives gr88 performance as though he is about to knit a knot with Amrita Raou, who is also very desi and she is doing pretty well ... The genre of the film is the same as HAHK and such films deserve to be made in India to revive old traditional values. The movies do not get 10, because it's not very good for music that counts a lot in all movies, besides it is flawless ....
