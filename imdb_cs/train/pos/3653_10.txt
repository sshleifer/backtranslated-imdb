Why play a good actress like Elizabeth Berkley in the movie? !!! Casting gives good performance (Elizabeth Berkley as Barbie girl, Ele Keats as a girl without a mother and Justin Whalin, a guy who has fallen forever with his harassment), but the direction is extremely dull and the story is NOT so interesting and original. I can not believe that such a movie was made for a big screen! Julie Corman (Producer): Are You CRAZY ??? !!!
