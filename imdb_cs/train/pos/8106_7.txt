This film is difficult to follow in our rapidly developing 21st century culture, but it is worthwhile for the news it transmits, especially the implications and consequences of technology for society, especially when this technology is used to fight. /> <br /> This film represents a cycle of a complete circle of dehumanization and rehumanization, which is influenced by the advent of technology and the subsequent deconstruction of civilization, and serves as a warning story against technology abuse, but as the circle is finished, familiar motifs and sentiments reappear, to introduce self-business, not self-destructive ways how humanity can use technology. Brilliant for its time, picture and sound quality can be a must for some but as a landmark in the history, development and development of a science fiction genre. Finally, free will and free choice are once again put to mankind as a means of controlling our own destiny rather than serving someone else or actually serving our own society as caused by world events. <br /> <br /> Those who are suppressed by what life throws their way sometimes tend to stay that way, but still there is a glimpse of hope and continuity that remains as this film sends. <br /> <br /> <br /> As regards science as a science fiction, one of the greatest joint demoners of this genre is the speculative nature. We ask questions, what if these events happened in this way, and what impact would they have on the society or the individual in it? How would we respond? As for influence, this film projects the speculative sciences that make sci-fi as unique as it is and leaves us with the most important questions.
