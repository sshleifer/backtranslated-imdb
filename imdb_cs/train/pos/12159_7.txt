- Following their sentencing to life in prison, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winters) begin to accept threatening phone calls because someone forges their sons. The couple decided to move to California to escape the publicity process and start a new life. They start a dance school, which is very successful very soon. One of the students has a rich free father with whom Adelle falls in love. Meanwhile, Helen is busy with rabbits and becomes a bit too in love with the evangelist on the radio. It's only time before everything falls apart and women enter the world of madness and murder. I can not help, but compare what's with Helen's thing? to the one who dies Aunt Roo? also plays Shelly Winters. Where this film seemed to be abstaining in Auntie Roo's madness, there is nothing in this movie that holds Helen. It may take a lot of the movie runtime, but once it's ready, Helen is one Bad Mad Mutha. You do not want to worry about her. Winters is so remarkably demented that it was not possible for me to perform her performance. I do not want to spoil the film, but the things Helen can do is totally overwhelming. <br /> <br /> - Just like Winters, Reynolds is totally ridiculous in her role as a gold-dancer. I thought he thought he was in a movie that would nominate her for some awards. It's not Citizen Kane! End the negotiations so seriously. Hey, Debbie, you do not realize the main task is to be a victim of Winters' madness. - I just like these former women-stars-in-the-dusk-their-career horror movies. What about Helen's thing? is as entertaining as any other.
