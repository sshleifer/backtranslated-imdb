This movie is amazing. It is true and heart, but at the same time absolutely crazy. Characters are easy to fall in love because they have so many different minds, but we could all mention at least that. In Canada, we do not have many films from Eastern Europe and for the couple I've seen, Loners is one of the best. It's very fun and magical. If you want to see something new and refreshing, visit Loners.
