What a great movie it is. The concept of peoples who send people fighting against giant robots is slow. The end is not only appropriate, it is more inspirational. But I'm interested in the characters. It is a shame we never notice that the relationship between Achilles and Athena is more developed for a few kisses, and Athena fears Achilles' security. Their romance is very pleasant. <br /> <br />
