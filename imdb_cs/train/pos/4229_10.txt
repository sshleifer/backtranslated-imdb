Do not waste time reading my review. Go out and see this amazingly good episode that can really be the best of Columbo ever written! Ruth Gordon is perfectly occupied as a mysterious but enchanting mysterious writer who murders her son-in-law to avenge her daughter's murder. Columbo is his usual crumpled, furious and much smarter than it seems, and this particular installment represents a fantastic chemistry between Gordon and Falk. Ironically, it was not written by the well-known Levinson or Link creators, but it is perhaps the most dignified, the most thoroughly original and inclined Columbo plot ever. Fully satisfies almost every department and overflows with a droll and witty dialogue and reflection. The truly unexpected and inventive peak culminates with everyone. 10/10 ... watch this on Netflix!
