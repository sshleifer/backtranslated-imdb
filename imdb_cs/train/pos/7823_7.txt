Excessive but persuasive disclosure of friendship between civil rights leaders Steve Biko and Donald Woods. The first half of the movie is the strongest where we see the bond between the two men and how they help each other, but the other half is not so strong to exclude the character of Biko. Still, it's such an interesting film with great performances from Kline and Washington in a movie that put it on the map. Washington was first nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Overall a good movie that could have been a little cut. 7/10 .____________________________________
