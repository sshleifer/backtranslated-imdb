I saw it in Detroit, what had to be its original run. I literally sailed into the aisle of the theater. It was funny. I have not seen it since then, but I'd like to. Where do you get a copy? Anyone who says something about being dated or thinking is just a lot of positives for my money. Each skit is either bad, erotic or perversely cheerful. Each! There is not even a weak one. The initial sequence, which parodies, for example, in 2001, contains gorillas of go-go-dancers with pendulous breasts. Felinni would shoot if he had the wrong joke ... When you come to this film with an open mind and a blithely sarcastic heart, you'll be right on your best list.
