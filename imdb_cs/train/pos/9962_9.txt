I was a little afraid to watch this movie because of its rates. But they live in Italy such titles that have never met and I love the move so much that I have decided to try it. And how surprised me! The story differs from any other dance film I've seen recently, with a deeper meaning than just "winning". It's moving and well written and well-controlled. Raya is such a strong figure, I love the fact that she never doubts herself, she is so mature and focused and aware of her TALENT (and what talent Rutina Wesley has, my jaw dropped to the final dance scene). The way she follows her dream and refuses to prevent her is frankly inspiring. Also, the fact that she is not a typical super hot girl (see Jessica Alba, Briana Evigan, Jenna Dewan, Zoe Seldan ...) makes her really appealing and real. Seriously, why is this movie so low? You can understand between the first 5 minutes that it's a good job. Really good. I even cried at the end of the movie. And the dance routines are simply bad.
