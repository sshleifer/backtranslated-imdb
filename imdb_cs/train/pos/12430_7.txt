I usually do not watch action movies because they are usually very similar. This film had many stereotypical action film scenes, but the characters and the originality of the film premise made it much easier to watch. David Duchovny bent his normal acting approach, which was great to see. Angelina Jolie was, of course, beautiful and great. Great cast. It must be seen that people are bored with the same old action movie.
