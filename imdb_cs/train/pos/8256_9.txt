He saw this movie at the Vancouver Film Festival and thought he was lethally clever, stylish and FUNNY. The cast was ROCK SOLID. Great work by Carrie Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly and Alex Fast. <br /> <br /> I was wondering if I could see the movie for a few days. > <br /> The writers, Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomiak, and Andrew Currie have plunged into a lot of political subtext - but you have not gotten over the head. The world they created was deeper and meaningful. This movie is a carnivorous ghost. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> He loved it!
