This film does a great job showing the situation of a patient suffering from ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease). The subject is compassionate and humorous. Helena Bonham Carter is as convincing as a person with ALS that it was hard to believe he was acting alone. Kenneth Branagh, a great actor, meets expectations as they behave as unpredictable artists and are forced to provide Helen's personalities as part of their "social service" as an alternative to jail time. Monitoring the development of the relationship between the two is a treat from beginning to end. The fact that it's a fairy tale does not release wonderful performances. One is deeply concerned about the two.
