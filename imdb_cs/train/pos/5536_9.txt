Actually, I enjoyed this show. As a young man, I was interested in all sports, including races. It has always been difficult to compile a serial based on racing corruption and at the same time to get permission from the racing tracks to film a movie about this controversial theme. One episode, which I especially remember, was centered around a horse that was expected to win a big race that looks a bit colorful. A syringe was found on a standing floor, and everyone thought the drug was being given, but nothing was found in the blood test. It was too late to realize that the horse was not doped but had to remove the knee cartilage. Just as a car runs without oil and the engine kills, the horse has broken down with tragic consequences.
