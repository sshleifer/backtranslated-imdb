A really good horror film with the greatest representatives, Boris Karloff and Belo Lugosi. Dr. Janos Rukh (Karloff) is on an expedition in Africa trying to find an old meteorite. After finding it, Rukh is poisoned by his radiation. Everything he touches will die and the dark side of Rukhu makes him an egoistic killer. His friend, Felix Benet (Lugosi), found a limited remedy for this problem, and at the same time realized that radiation could be used for the good of man by treating the disease. These two buddies will fight over radiation. Pretty good special effects. Others in cast: Frances Drake, Frank Lawton, Beulah Bondi and Frank Reicher.
