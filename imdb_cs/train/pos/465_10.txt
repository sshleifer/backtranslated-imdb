Marlene Gorris has become one of the world's greatest directors. This sensitive, visually beautiful film is based on the story of Vladimir Nabokov and captures the dark irony of the writer. John Turturro gives what I think is his best performance (usually I'm not his fan); and Emily Watson is also great. It's worth seeing.
