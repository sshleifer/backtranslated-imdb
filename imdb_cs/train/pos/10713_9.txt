The angry boy, who tragically lost his parents, takes care of his grandfather. Together they will find a common ground in Gaelic folk tales that have been handed over from generation to generation to islanders. Although tragic episodes such as the Highlands appear in stories, there is a surprising amount of humor and joy in them. Everything is shot in Sky, so there's a double dose of beauty. The mountain scenery is breathtaking and it is only a rare opportunity to hear Scottish Gaelic spoken. I'm English, so I had to read the subtitles, but the sound of spoken Gaelic is nevertheless amazing. Performances are what you would expect from carefully selected non-actors - in other words, you are watching the real thing - people who are deeply engaged in Gaelic folklore and history. The Gaelic community, especially on Skye, has worked a myriad of miracles to make this film. Anyone who has the slightest interest in Gaelic, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multiculturalism or social justice should see this film.
