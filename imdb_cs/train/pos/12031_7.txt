(WARNING: smaller spoilers) <br /> <br /> I ran into this part and looked from there, did not know what it was or what it was. I was sure to catch my attention; I did not know until the end that it was based on a true story! The guy who was doing the dirty act looked like a really nice guy who was kicking an unhappy girl; I have to ask how lively is the image that is the image. Anyone who would murder a husband and wife when they were asleep can not be quite nice. Still, I had some sympathy for him because he was used and used; that it was clear. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is with the end (here comes the biggest spoiler! Skip this paragraph if you do not want to learn). Several minutes before it ended, it seemed that there was no way to discover the truth. The way it appeared was in the "sting" operation, but my question is: how did the police convince you it was going? The film did not show us, and it seemed a little too comfortable without explaining how they were convinced. I think the way they were treated was done for dramatic purposes. the omission of explanation borrowed aura of tension on a critical scene that would not otherwise be there (we would already know what the scene was about and what happened to Brad). <br /> <br /> Otherwise it's a pretty good movie; I give it 7/10. That's what I was thinking. Now I'm interested in finding out the facts about the real case. One thing: the film was completed in 1996. It seems that some reviews here are considered to be a newer film. <br /> <br /> PS Meadow Sisto is beautiful. I have not seen her before. She can act a little, too (always plus in her work, LOL).
