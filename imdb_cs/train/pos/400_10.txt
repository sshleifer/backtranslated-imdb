When Tsui Hark is experimenting, nothing and no one can resist him. Legend of Zu is probably 6 hours condensed into 1h40. One does not understand everyone, but as in 2001, "Space Odyssey" does not have to, but one feels the strength of the film every second, every photo. An extraordinary vision of the future of the 7th art and one of the most pioneering, stunning, joy in recent years. VITAL heavy MASTERPIECE! It's absolutely perfect. <br /> <br /> When Tsui Hark is experimenting, nothing and no one can resist him. Legend of Zu is probably 6 hours condensed into 1h40.
