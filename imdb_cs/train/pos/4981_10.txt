I myself feel that this movie is a rare treasure. It's not just the beginning of Shirley Temple's career, but a rare look at how our society has changed. You must understand that some things that we would consider to be sexual at the time would be considered innocent. For example, parents of children in the movie, as well as many parents who took their children to see this movie, saw it as children who imitate adults. Most people did not think about looking at sexually attractive children except teenage boys who want teenage girls. For them it was not sexual. Think it was before we had internet, television, etc. ... Most sexual offenses were not raised. Occasionally, this child would want to whisper a "witty uncle." But it was often everything that came out of it. Yes, very sad. Today, however, it is a little sad because I see this film as something other than what was intended, innocent and fun. When I saw Shirley dancing like this, and the boy's eye was passing by, I felt disturbed. I have to remember what happened! Those kids did not know what sex is. Parents knew this, both from children in the movie and from those who watched him. This idea may not even have entered into their minds. In the eyes of an average adult offspring, it was no more sexual if Shirley played the house. Even today, children enter the beauty contest, many trained extremely mature, three years old. But the child just pretends. I do not blame a child for acting like an adult. Or old movies that show this. In all the honest papers, the media caused a lot of things that seemed to be bad and bad. It can sometimes be for the best. But I really believe this movie is not one of them. This gives a rare look to the innocent mentality we have long since lost.
