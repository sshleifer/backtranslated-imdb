"Bell Book and Candle" was recently featured on the cable. When we did not see him for a while, we decided to revisit this comedy again. Based on Broadway hits by James Van Druten, which was a car for Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in the early 1950s, the film was adapted to Daniel Taradash's screen. The film was directed by Richard Quine, who turned the game into a wonderful comedy. Find out that, according to some of the comments made by IMDb, it seems that the big question is to pair the two stars who collaborated on "Vertigo" released in the same year. Viewers of the film did not think of the age difference when this film was released. In fact, most of the old male stars of this period have always been involved with much younger women. The movie in Manhattan for Christmas is a wonderful comedy that has enchanted audiences. Kim Novak was at the top of her beauty because it is clear that her camera adored her no matter what she was playing. As a witch who becomes a human, her Gillian is charming. James Stewart, who plays the publisher Shep 'Henderson, is also seen in his best form. Stewart was a great comedy actor who shows why he was at the top. When supporting roles, Elsa Lanchester, who plays Queenie, is a welcome addition to any movie, as she can see here. Nicky Holroyd, Brother Gillian, is also good. Ernie Kovacs is also perceived as writer Sidney Radlitch. <br /> <br /> This is a great way to spend a winter night at home watching "Bell Book and Candle".
