I think this movie was reasonably good. It is a little weird that the twins Olsen now have 13 and have a girlfriend and everyone. They liked it very much when the little children were in Full House. However, the casting was good and the movie was a bit funny. I had a mixed mix between all the switching points and their names. It's a bit older version of Take It Two.
