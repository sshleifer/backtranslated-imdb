I'll give you that straight ... this movie is amazing. foreign homosexual films so quickly overcome American gay films in quality of production and story. while so many American Indian gay films are grainy, bad sound, amateur acting, tributek and a surprising lack of any nudity or eroticism, top foreign gay movies appear like this from France. cinematography is beautiful, sophisticated, meaningful. the story is mature and complex (but not difficult for someone to follow), acting is intense and professional. Both are fantastic as well as all the cast. boys are more than just handsome and there is plenty of full nudity. you are following the whole year of these boys from their meeting to the end. all the tiny tones of relationships, details that fall into love and are out there are beautifully done. let me want more. Look at it!
