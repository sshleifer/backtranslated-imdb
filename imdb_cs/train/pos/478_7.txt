I am quite surprised that no reviewer has ever commented on the elementary chess mistake in Luzhin's game as white against the unnamed opponent just before the final. Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as a consultant chess expert, Luzhin is the winner of the game with an illegal move. Between quick cuts and back on the board, it is not difficult to note that after Luzhin's combination, which culminates in the queen's death, his crest on d1 is still pinned in black on c1 against his king in corner h1. So he is not able to play the alleged pairing of Rd1-d8, which would be illegal - but will show that it does so to surprise audience applause.
