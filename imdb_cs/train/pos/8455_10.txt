While I was a sensible youth when I first went through the Gundam Wing series, once again the show again confirmed her belief that this series is not only beautifully animated, but the fence, gundam design, character and depth of character are masterfully executed. While he first appears as a guy, the stylistic attraction of the figure can be partly credited only to great art, with individual figures creating clear and cute differences between the characters. As a result, it is extremely easy to build on a special character. Personally, Heero liked me because of his stoic personality. While I can be interested in the sentimental attachment of this show to childhood, I can objectively say that Gundam Wing is dealing with deeper issues of war and life in general (how can we achieve peace?) And at the same time we provide action packs in great robot suits, which is at least excellent.
