British horror film was in the late 1970s in the end of the decade, but from the darkness appeared three films that belonged to the best produced islands. The fowl, the blood on Satan's claw, and the house that blew the blood, seemed like the future looks pink, though many people knew it would not be at this point. THTDB has a type of cast that could easily create a wish list if it was not really gathered, in the impassive background of 2008 you might have come to expect that you wake up. Waxworks is the most overlooked of four stories and is naturally my favorite, Cushing's life and art are connected so tightly that you can not tell where the end of the performance and the pain begins. One can only guess how this role has influenced such a gentle, sensitive man. Death and Virgo. RIP Peter.
