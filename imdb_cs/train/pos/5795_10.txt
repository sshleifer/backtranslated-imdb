This movie is my favorite time! You really have to see Michael Jackson in this wonderful movie !! I'm always over a month and I look at it! This is a movie you really have to see, even if you are not a fan of MJ, causing this movie to write like Captain EO, E.T. and ghosts, some film and music history! This wonderful movie, from Michael's feathers, is a must! A: Smooth Criminal is really the most beautiful, exciting and amazing song I've ever heard! Thank you Michael for this movie and I love you! MJ is the best musician to hit this planet, he's a great man and he always brings you sparks in your eyes when you listen to his music! Please, if you do not know this movie, watch it and do not miss it, because it would be too bad for yourself if you did not want it! - highly recommended movie, for every film lover -
