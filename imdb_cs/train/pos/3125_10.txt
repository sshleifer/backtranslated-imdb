Bourne Ultimatum (2007) Review: After the exciting series of two, we get the last installment. Here is my take: <br /> <br /> Bourne Ultimatum has everything. We have Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) on the coattails of those who know everything. He's been running for a long time. This time it's over. Bourne Ultimatum has a great plot, amazing writing, fantastic direction, tension and some of the best summer action. Matt Damon may be adding his best performance to date. He has the conviction and the swearing of the murderer's murderer. Here is some intelligent humor and some gentle tension. Responding to some of the events, you are either laughing (in good) or a fandom. (or both) I heard a lot of intelligent laughter in the theater and I applauded a lot. The audience loved it. <br /> <br /> Bourne Ultimatum brings everything in a packed package. All goods and then some. This is, in my opinion, the best film this summer. Last word: Excellent conclusion. The best of the trilogy. That's how summer movie thrillers should be doing. I love the Bourne trilogy.
