Before reading this review, I must point out that it is by no means a statement against the Iranian people ... if you really want to read anything than hopefully you see that I am against politicians in general ... but if you are looking to be offended ... I can not help you! <br /> <br /> Not in Iran because this movie is forbidden (see IMDb trivia for this movie). Which is a shame because the movie is great. It would not be for "Grbavica", this film would win at the Berlin International Film Festival. Probably (it was the second place if you want). Why? Because it's a film about oppression. This is not a complete female theme either. It's about the government trying to keep people on the ground. Analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the film. But the ban is solved and / or can cause this movie to disappear! Another reviewer had a great summing up line: "Comedy about tragedy," which sums it up!
