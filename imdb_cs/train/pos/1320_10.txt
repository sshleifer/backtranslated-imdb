At the beginning and half of the 1970s, Clifford Irving suggested writing the final biography of Howard Hughes, claiming he had spent months preparing for a book, and dealing with interviews with the reclusive millionaire. When it all turned out to be untrue, Irving was accused of the preaching and spent several years behind bars (although he always admitted that his findings were accurate). In 20001, a book called "Forbidden Love" (published in the United States as "Honorable Lost: Love and Death in the Modern Day of Jordan") was published in 20001 by an unknown author named Norma Khouri, a Jordanian woman who died of testimony She loved her best friend, Dalia, because Dalia, who comes from a devout Muslim background, went with a Christian. This, like Irving's biography at Hughes, was revealed as a possible deception. Australian filmmaker Anna Broinowski is trying to plunge into the mud, which was Khouri's attempt to get rid of the lie. In 104 minutes, the movie tries to reveal that Norma Khouri tells the truth, or is it just an urgent liar with her own agenda / vendetta? An interview with those who knew her (including a former husband, her publisher and others) tell their story. It's a jagged and well-produced document that can show many fingers on so many potential parties. Not rated, but it contains the ubiquitous bad language and the reconstruction of the murdered scene that has been played several times (but nothing as graphic and disturbing as what it would see in the latest torturous porn epic, such as Saw: Part 84). It's not a good choice for the little ones.
