The faithful work of Pearl S. Buck, whose years spent in China as a child of missionary parents who gave her a profound insight into Chinese culture and philosophy, made this film adaptation greatly in both technical and acting. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wang Lung is a humble farmer grateful for the foundations of his life: to survive from his own country and have recently married Olan, a servant of a rich and powerful family in the village. Despite the fact that Wang Lung and Olan will make the most of their efforts on farmland, raising children, and building savings and wealth, they are threatening to eradicate everything they work for. When they choose not to sell their land, the traditional Asian faith, instead they travel to a big city to wait for famine. While in the city they are limited to begging and are just one of hundreds of other unhappy homeless families. Even though Olan is not cooked, he gets trapped in a crowd that looms in a wealthy man's house. She is assembled for the purpose of execution by the army, but it is stored at the last minute. Her luck, however, is that she found valuable jewels in her loot where she and her family allowed her to return to her farm to begin again. The newly found wealth transforms Wang Lung. She becomes selfish, egoistic and takes a look. He becomes a very wealthy farmer, but it only aggravates the situation because he is becoming more and more incomprehensible, more arrogant and more complex to understand. It loses touch with the basic things that money can not buy: loyalty, determination, trust, honesty and sincerity. As a punishment, nature turns the table on Wang Lung again by sending plague bark to destroy everything it has. On the knees, Wang Lung uses the help of all friends, former friends, workers and families. With this help he can save the farm. From this experience he returns again to humility and appreciation of the foundations of life.
