I laughed a lot when I watched it. It's a fun short piece with a fun musical act and a lot of gentleness. The characters are simple, but their simplicity contributes to the stylization of humor. Dialogue is fun and often unexpected and from the first line to the last it seems that everything looks great. There's Max, who apparently had a terrible life. And there's Edward, who's not sure what kind of life he wants to lead. My favorite character was Tom, Edward's crazy boss. Tom has a short role but memorable. Recommended for anyone who likes silly humor. And find it now online, which is a bonus! I'm a fan of all Jason cartoons and I can not wait to see what's next.
