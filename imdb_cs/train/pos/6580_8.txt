DO NOT REMOVE this production with a two-hour version released on VHS in the US, a messy and incomprehensible mess. I was delighted to watch the 6-hour version available on DVD from Great Britain, and she was enchanted. The intentional pace and the growing sense of the threat are fascinating, as well as the amazing visual and phonetic landscape; this is ancient Rome, which we have never seen before, and much more authentic than most. Director Franco Rossi was fairly celebrated for his 1968 The Odyssey miniseries and this mini-series is just as strong. Just like Bekim Fehmiu became the best Ulysses on the screen, so Klaus Maria Brandauer can be the best Nero screen. Now I hope to see Rossi's version of The Aeneid (Eneide), which was broadcast on Italian television in 1971. I am indecisive of what version of QUO VADIS is stronger, this or the Polish mini-series since 2001; each has different virtues, and in many ways they complement one another. Of course, one of them will culminate in the Hollywood camp burst that plays with Peter Ustinov.
