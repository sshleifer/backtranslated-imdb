Return to the 36th Chamber is one of the classic kung-fu films Shaw produces in the 1970s and 1980s, the genre of which is equivalent to the Spaghetti Westerns in Hollywood, and the protagonist of Gordon Liu, the counterpart of West Clint Eastwood. A digitally remastered and new print created for the Fantastic Film Fest, it is "introduced in Shaw Scope" as well as old good. <br /> <br /> This movie is a simple story of good versus evil, said 3 acts that more or less summarize the narration of martial arts films at the time. <br /> <br /> Act One sets the premise. Workers in a small village dye are not happy with their dose because their wages are down by 20% of the incoming Munchu gangsters. They can not do much about their exploitation because none of them is martial arts capable of taking gangsters and their boss. Initially, they had little success when they got Liu to act as a highly skilled sage Shaolin (one of the best comedic sequences), but their excitement was exposed when they pushed the credibility line by going too many times. <br /> </ Act Two shows the protagonist who wanted to go back to the crowd. However, without real martial arts, he goes on a trip to the Shaolin Temple to try to infiltrate and teach martial arts to fraud. After a few gloomy moments, he finally accepted the abbot (which he pretended to do!) But he is disappointed with the teaching methods - much like Mr. Miyagi's style in Karate Kid, but instead of painting fences he can build scaffolding across the temple. Nothing can keep a good man down and he unwittingly builds strength, endurance, and learns kung-fu in an unorthodox way. <br /> <br /> Act 3 is where the fight begins. With ring-like sound effects, each distinctive contactless film gives maximum efficiency. But it is rather a refreshing track of the combat scenes here, with its wide angles of shots that emphasize the clarity and detail between the sparring partners, and the use of slow motion only to show the pieces at different angles. The speed of the fighting may be too slow, with a pause between the moves, but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style using ad-naus in Hollywood movies, surely no battle scenes like before! Returning to the 36th Chamber will be repeated on Monday, so if you are playing a nostalgic journey into memory, what are you waiting for?
