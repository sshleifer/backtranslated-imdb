I love this movie so much that I've been watching it again and again. I do not understand why anyone would think this movie is not good. You may have seen better, or whatever I personally love. It's one of my favorite films, and I'm not Hindi at all, but I love it. It may be a bit like a "pretty woman," but I did not see it and I do not think it would be better. I do not know why you're all scared but maybe you have a good reason, but I think I said so much that I absolutely loved this movie and to those who say it was not good at all, then I wonder why you watched it and what movies do you consider good. As for all the others I watched with the fact that they liked it, I was surprised that so many people did not like it. As for Rani Mukherjee (I think it's your last name), she is very beautiful and she has a favorite actress at all!
