This is a story about Shin-ae, who moves to Milyang from Seoul with his young son, Jun, to start after the accidental death of her husband. Her husband was born here and opened a piano school, but she also has the ambition to own a country with the insurance money she received from death. If it was a movie, it would probably be like a Hollywood movie if he got into a local guy and was happy with his son in his new home. But this is not Hollywood. Her son is kidnapped and murdered, apparently because he is known to have money from the settlement. The sad trial, trying to continue, trying to eradicate their conscience guilt, they are all admirable and the leading actress is excellent. The only warning, and it must be mentioned, is that it is a depressive film. You have to know that you're going inside. You want Shin-ae to go through her grief and find some luck. Again, it's not Hollywood, it's Korea, and in Korean cinematography, especially drama, they do not punch. Life is what happens to you. Great acting, but sometimes a heavy movie that will watch because it does. If you stay, you will be rewarded. Do it.
