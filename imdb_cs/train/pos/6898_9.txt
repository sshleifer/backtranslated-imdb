This is a tongue-to-face movie from the very beginning with a voice-over that funsses all the French and then produces rather Naif but a very brave hero in Fanfan La Tulipe. Expressed by the magnificent Gerard Philippe, the dear young man is fully convinced of the fate of Lollobrigid's predictions - especially that he will marry the daughter of King Louis XV. The problem is that La Lollo soon finds out she is also in love with Fanfan ... <br /> <br /> Driven by good swords fighting, cavalcades, and other lively action sequences the movie moves at a fast pace and with many comic moments. Direction is perhaps the weakest aspect, but the movie is so light and so unworthy that I could not give these shortcomings a second thought. Look at Noel Roquevert, a traditional heavyweight in French films, trying to steal La Lolla and abuse him and feed him with a script that reads La Lollo's hand! And what jewel Marcel Herrand is like the magnificent King Louis XV. That's not all: So many beautiful women in one movie will make me to be in France and the set in 1952! The film could come out of that year, but its warmth, face, excellent narration, perfect photography and unforgettable Gerard Philippe ensure that it remains modern and joyful to watch. I would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren, let alone anyone who loves movies in general and especially swashbucklers! You see it!
