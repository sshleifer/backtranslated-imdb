The title says everything. <br /> <br /> I'm not a film critic, nor will it behave like the other snob people who comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie does not have a million million dollars budget, but the plot was very well done, playing was awesome and cinematography was great! It seemed like you had a lot of fun filming this movie! I voted 9 out of 10 because the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both, but I imagined it could be a mistake when recording a DVD. <br /> <br /> I will definitely check out other movies made by Brain Damage Films! <br /> <br /> Dylan O'Leary, cast and crew, thank you!
