In his directorial debut, Denzel Washington takes a true story that will also become a very difficult story and brings him to the screen of honesty we had expected from Washington's efforts, but now we see this touch as a director. <br /> <br /> We've recently seen some catastrophic results for children who have fallen into public protection cracks. This story tells of the existence of a nightmare that leaves terrible scars but indicates the victory of the human spirit in the end. We can choose from the first problems with too much effort with too many weapons and not with the best editing of these scenes but the simplicity of other scenes that show such power can not be underestimated. If the Academy looks through this movie, it will be a travesty. This film does not make any strikes and comes to the cold, tough facts of the story with a purity that usually will not go beyond the novel on screen. This is, of course, a tribute to the director. <br /> <br /> This is a dandy, so go ahead and tell your friends to see it too!
