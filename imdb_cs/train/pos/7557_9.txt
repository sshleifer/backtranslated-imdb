Gender Bender Limerick: <br /> <br /> Man or woman? Who knows? <br /> <br /> It turned out to be both. <br /> <br /> Sleeps in the clay <br /> <br /> Then they all go <br /> </ b> In one of their UFOs. <br /> <br /> Gender Bender is another great season 1 episode. I like that because the story is the sort of thing where you're never sure what's going to happen. It is completely original. Teaser is very entertaining due to the close-up of the eye and reflection of the disco light. I really have to learn that that thumbs trick to genderbender heshee does. I love the atmosphere in the small village of Kindred, and Mulder and Scully are passing by the night. It's very exciting. This is one of my favorite episodes of season 1 in fact. I think what I like so much is how they eventually turn out to be aliens and leave crop circles. Many people consider it an extraterrestrial non-mythological episode, such as "The Unnatural" or "Space", but I think it could easily be seen as a mythology. Maybe that genderbender was just like a hunter of extraterrestrial rewards and looked like he looks like everyone. Huh? Anyway, I'm giving an episode of 9 out of 10.
