I can tell you how bad this movie is. I was in the movie and I did not see it yet, but I was thinking that someone really would pay to see me drunk. Especially with regard to what we did that year. The point is that they probably changed them. Especially on the scene where my roommate snorting coke breasts Mexican prostitutes (they probably should follow him around). We did a couple of additions and performances, but besides, I do not know anything. I was a MC in several scenes (what I was told.) What I can tell you is that everyone has been avoiding the cameraman since they want to be remembered as the guy he was throwing or the girl who showed her goats in the world (or a girl who lost her virginity). The whole journey itself was crazy, but people behaved differently as soon as the camera was on them.
