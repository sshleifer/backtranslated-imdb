When I watched this film strictly based on reviewers, I was pleasantly surprised. Although it is clearly a low budget, it carries signs of clever ingenuity. For example, when Julia wakes up in a strange house looking out the window, I find that her sense of isolation will be enhanced by an exterior shot focused on her face, and then she moves backward to include the house and its isolated position. And behold, the next scene was the last shot of the house that stood lonely on a cliff at the edge of the water. There are other examples of how a clever director can raise his movie to the level of a very thriller. The amusement spectators will surely see, but they should be sure they will not be disappointed. As for the performance, George Macready is his usual creepy self, barely keeping his peace while designing the capacity for unhealthy violence. Nina Foch was surprisingly good as a girl who is not boring, who does not fight without a fight. But Dame May Witty, oh boy, she even had to doubt my eyes, and she believed she could run away with her malicious schemes. This is a real diamond in roughness and you should not miss it.
