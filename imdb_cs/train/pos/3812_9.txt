This is a real eye candy. World of floating islands and flying ancient cities. Huge monsters whose preferred method of attack is to throw cathedrals on their opponents ... Who can resist it? Ancient prophecy, lots of nasty heroes and a cute princess looking for her hero ... sound familiar ...? Yes, we have already heard this song. But forget it when you look at the magnificent scenery. This movie is fun when you can watch it. But after leaving the cinema, you will want a little more story. What is the thirty-year-old circle? What did the knight drive a fool? Who built all these wonderful monuments, castles and cities ... and why are they collapsing? And besides, one group of farmers, where are the people? This picture really looks so interesting, but it's not the Lord of the Rings.
