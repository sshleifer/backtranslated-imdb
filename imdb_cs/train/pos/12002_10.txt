Despite reading "initial comments" from someone who did not like the movie - (WHY IS THE ONLY NEGATIVE CONNECTION FIRST TO LIST) It was very nice to note that virtually everyone else loved it! The Church, of course, wanted to emphasize certain points and portray the Prophet Joseph Smith in a positive way - that is the whole idea. And in fact, these points were very effective. We already know that Joseph Smith was a man ... but despite all the terrible negative attempts he had made by the adversary, it turned out to be able to complete a remarkable, divine work. I recommend it to everyone!
