Nobody really understands the logic behind the numbering of Italian zombie-flicks, but? honestly? why would we bother? Each movie in the Zombie series brings great entertainment, ugly gore and unreasonable shocks and "Zombi 3" is no exception, despite all the manufacturing difficulties that occurred during shooting. This film started as an interesting project by Lucio Fulci, who had to further develop his success "Zombi 2", but eventually became a typical product of Bruno Mattei with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films. The script is hopelessly awkward and ignores all forms of continuity, every acting idea of ​​George A. Romer's "The Night of the Dead" and "The Crazies" is reckless and the acting is really miserable and painful. Still, it did not hurt me for one moment, for the sovereign supreme gore compensates everything! At the secret military base of the Philippines, the scientists completed the bacterial warheart "Death One" and prepared it for transport. After an unsuccessful attempted theft of the virus, the infected corpse of a terrorist is burned and zombie-ash contaminates the entire population of a nearby tourist village. The last group of survivors has to fight with hyperactive and inhumanly powerful zombies, as well as white trousers who have received instructions to kill everything in the contaminated area. This film is comparable to Umberto Lenzi's "Nightmare City". Really bad ... but incredibly fun with fast action sequences and some very creative situations of zombie-madness. The undead birds were original and the whole sequence of zombie births in the abandoned hospital was also cool. Hateful head-hitting scene is not as horrible as it does, and belongs perfectly to this cheesy and thoroughly enjoyable Italian zombie. Recommended for fans; do not mind negative reviews.
