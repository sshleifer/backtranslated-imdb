The attorney is drawn into the deadly cat and mouse game when involved with femme fatale in this adaptation of the novel Grisham. Altman creates a gripping, gothic atmosphere, but the script is weak. Sports Southern Draw, Branagh is convincing as a lawyer, and Davidtz is tempting as the goal of his desire. Downey is a sympathetic private detective. Duvall has a small role that does not allow him to do much with his strange character. Hannah and Berenger will take on an impressive cast. After an interesting arrangement, the film is filming and really does not fulfill its initial promise, but Altman is always worth a look.
