Richard Attenborough, who has already made great films like A Chorus Line and Gandhi, again surprised us that we created a beautiful hymn of nature. Indeed, the vast and (at that time) unexplored Canadian territory helps to create the amazing beauty of landscapes that is captured by a movie camera. If the film is really based on a true story, it becomes obvious that "men of sight" are in fact men who live for their time, with a historical perspective, that it only gives them time. Cinematography is spectacular, like the cast of Pierce Brosnan, whose performance is caused by the main hands of Attenborough. Pleasant surprise is the look of Anna Galipeau as Archie's beloved. A film that must appear in the list of those who really love nature ...
