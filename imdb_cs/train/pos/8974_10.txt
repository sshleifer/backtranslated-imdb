Jiří Trnka made the last animated short accusation of totalitarianism, which caused him trouble in his native Czechoslovakia. The elements are few, the symbolism is simple and its decorative stamps almost do not breathe, allowing the viewer to focus on the fable. The man in his room is devoted to pottery and cares about his only plant. But suddenly a huge hand enters the room and orders him to create the statue alone. The man refuses and is persecuted with a sinister glove in his glove. These days, when it seems that the impression of a real factor is erased from most animations that are trying to replace the real world, it is refreshing to watch a movie that makes his technique a part of entertainment.
