I just saw this movie, the first time I saw it when I was 7 years old and I could only remember the end. so I saw it 10 minutes ago and (maybe it seems like a baby because I'm 12 ha-ha), I started crying at the end, I forgot how sad it was. I think I was particularly sad for Anne-Marie because she said, "I love you Charlie" and also: "I miss Charlie, just really screamed ha ha, it must be one of my favorite films of all time, it's just WATCH IT ha ha, this is all I can say XD <br /> <br /> but I love this movie, its true classic. <br /> <br /> xx Maverick xx 10/10
