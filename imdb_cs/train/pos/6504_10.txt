My wife and I have been watching this whole series at least three times. I can not imagine how it could be better. It is not a "complete" history of World War II - no library can have such a history, but it is the best summary of this history. Lots of detail, lots of personal stories and still retains the overall picture. <br /> <br /> Olivier's narration is greatly written and, of course, great. Interviews are from all sides, except for Russian, because producers have been unable to talk to many Russians. It is very important to have this complete program on DVD. We made our copy. The producer is an excellent worker in providing paintings and events where there is almost no archive. For example, there is almost no film of convoys and submarine battles, but still an episode on this topic is very well done.
