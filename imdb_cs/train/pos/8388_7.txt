Maria Braun is an extraordinary woman who has been fully and faithfully presented despite being so dull that she borders on improbability. She does her best to make her marriage work, including blatant opportunism and sexual manipulation. And so under the jagged exterior reveals a relatively sweet value system. The film suffers from a sudden and unexpected ending, which then feels totally inadequate, with the familiar ending of your school art writing practice "and then I wake up." This is also the book ended at the other end with the most eccentric title sequence I've ever seen, but do not let it get you out of it.
