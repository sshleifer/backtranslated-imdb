The Irving Berlin musical talk gave Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers another top-class musical for Top Hat if possible. Although in this case, like Jerome Kern, Robert's candy where they are, Follow the Fleet leaves Randolph Scott with another singer, this time with Harriet Hilliard. Randolph Scott is Navy CPO's career and Fred Astaire is an ex-vaudevillian who joined the navy to forget Ginger Rogers's former partner. But now there are two on the coast. Fred and Ginger step in right where they're done, and Randy happens to meet Ginger's ugly sister Harriet, who has blossomed into true beauty. But Randy is a typical love and leaves them a sailor. <br /> <br /> Again, Irving Berlin wrote a full-score hit with him closely supervising production. Ginger makes a really excellent vocalization with Let Itself Go, which she and Fred later dance on. But the real show experience is Let's Face the Music and Dance, which is a Navy show number. He first sang Astaire and later danced, Let's Face the Music and Dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen. Their dance on this is an absolute charm. I'm sure that when I mention Harriet Hilliard, some younger people might ask who it is. But they will know instantly when I kiss her in connection with her famous husband, Ozzy Nelson. That's right Ozzie and Harriet. It's a mystery to me why Harriet stopped singing when she just became David and Ricky's mom on TV. Then she did not keep her own name again. <br /> <br /> Neither Ozzie nor Harriet sang on television. Ozzie was a crazy imitation of Rudy Vallee as a singer, but Harriet could really wear a melody. Satan and Moon are singing to me and I'm here, but where you are, they both have a real feel and class. I recommend that you see the Fleet Watch if for another reason you hear the Harriet Hilliard dimension unbelievably forgotten today.
