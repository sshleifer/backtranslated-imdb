Yeah, these movies are peaks. Increase to recommend more. Gay or the strait of his great doco for anyone who likes the movie. Very funny, sad and interesting. Never boring. Great access. A movie created with passion and interest in the subject. Some performances and just awesome. If you find this movie on VHS only, it's still worth watching. Great. 10 out of 10. I had seen part of this doco ten years ago and did not understand what I was watching. The interviews are very revealing about the egos of the artists who are like heavy boxers trying to leave the ghetto. The director was probably the first timer, so it was a success. Cold. Watch it.
