It's been a long time since I saw this mini-series and I would like to say that her memorable merits have endured a time test. <br /> <br /> Most of the ingredients of "Perfect Spy", adaptation of the best novels of LeCarra, in my opinion, is the highest drawer. Outstanding aspects are the music script and master script written by Arthur Hopcraft, who was, in my opinion, a scriptwriter for "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy" with Alec Guinness some years ago. <br /> <br /> The actors are usually very good, some are excellent, such as Jack Brotherhood by Alan Howard and Ricky Pym from Ray McAnally. Peter Egan is fascinating to watch because his face varies with every angle of the camera. The course of time and the effects on the physical performance of the characters is very faithful. And so much that I realized exactly how Peter Egan was at the time of filming. The only blow comes after the character of Magnus Pyma is transformed from the very capable hands of a young actor named by Benedict Taylor to the character of a seemingly too old Peter Egan, just fresh from Oxford. But that's a small and unimportant seam in the whole. <br /> <br /> Egan has difficulty persuading only when the text becomes melodramatic and must be "disturbed" emotionally, ie crying. None of the actors has a very easy time with these moments except the great Frances Tomelty, who plays Peggy Wentworth for all that is worth and steals the episode with ease. Jane Booker is annoying like Mary Pym. She has part of her character under her skin, but she often shows an amateur cunning that reduces her as a harsh diplomatic housewife who is Mary Pym. Rüdiger Weigang is beautiful as Axel, fun, ironic and brilliant. I also liked the Sarah Badel camp as baroness. The British view of the Americans is vividly rendered in some dry merry scenes. When the Americans arrived abroad to meet Bo Brammell (Director of the MI6), the American contingent was portrayed as a prince with an empty head, which seems to remember a lot of long words from the dictionary and refreshes it freely with American jargon and psychic mud, a lot to the confused contempt of English. <br /> <br /> Humor and sadness are gently mixed. LeCarré has a tendency to mix incontinent elements in his stories, and Hopcraft has captured the melancholic but quiet atmosphere of the original. It's not perfect production (what is it?) And yet the best of the LeCarre adaptation to achieve a movie or television to date. <br /> <br /> We highly recommend all fans of the espionage thriller and especially LeCarré fans. DVD available from Acorn.
