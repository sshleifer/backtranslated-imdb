Bewitched television series of 1960 owes his idea of ​​the film. This is a film that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak did when they were cast by Alfred Hitchcock in Vertigo. This is not as obsessive as the one, but Novak is just as enchanting. This was Jack Lemmons's 10th film and he's good at supporting here, just like Ernie Kovacs. The movie has many good things. Hermine Gingold is very good in this movie, almost as good as supporting The Music Man. The casting is very solid. <br /> <br /> This movie has a late 1950s New York feel and a cat that is like hexing like any cat in any movie. It's well worth watching because it's a love story with all the emotions of all, and little magic too boot. <br /> <br /> It's not Vertigo, but I think because that was followed by the movie, the audience then did not deserve it-I'm sure it's like William Asher saw it to be a series of 60s of the 20th century . I'm not so glad that what Will Ferrell did on the big screen, this movie is much better than this one.
