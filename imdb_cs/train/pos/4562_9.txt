He saw this movie on DVD yesterday and was frantic and raucous. Unchanged acting DDL just fired my mind, and I was surprised by the actor and his great acting. The whole character was so authentic to me, I really took DDL for Christy Burns and Brent Fricker for his mother. Go and see! You will pay off your heart, but you will experience amazing catharsis! In addition, he teaches you one important lesson: Determining everything. Maybe you are a cripple in the poor suburbs of Dublin, but when you're pretty harsh you will have no problems at all. If you can only control your left leg, you are still good at being painters or writers. The worst thing you can do when you are mentally handicapped is to indulge in self-esteem. I will never get you and the only person who will regret being alone.
