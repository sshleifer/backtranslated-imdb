Though I have seen this film years ago, its impact never left me. Stephen Rea's depiction of the conversation is deep and moving. His suffering in not being able to stop death is tangible. Everyone in the cast is amazing from Sutherland, who tries to accommodate and provide ways for the police to co-ordinate their efforts with troubled citizens x. Every day, when we are bombarded by stories about mass murderers, I think of this film and the exhaustive work people are doing trying to find murderers.
