Such garbage is on the channels of motion pictures I've been biting with. From the beginning to the end, it caught me and deserves top marks. The father of two sons hears news from "God" to kill people who are said to be "demons". <br /> <br /> When opening credits showed the director as one of the cast that can often be a bad movie warning; exceptionally, it's the opposite, because the drama is non-stop from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> And there is no time in the movie when one is not fully enchanted because there are no unnecessary or unnecessary sub-graphs in the first class. <br /> <br /> All the actors give a totally convincing performance, especially the leading children's actor, which is exceptional. <br /> <br /> This movie is at least as good as the 'Silence of the Lambs'.
