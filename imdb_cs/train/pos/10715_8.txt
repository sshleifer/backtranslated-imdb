Teresa Pavlinek was a favorite member of the Toronto Second City. She has made many guests and ads in Canada. Finally, somebody has the sense to create a show for her. The supportive case seems to be quite good. Now I've been watching the pilot several times, and it still seemed refreshing. Although I'm not sure why the show is listed as The Jane Show 2004. But if I'm aware that the concert was conceived in 2005 and appeared at Global TV in Canada in early 2006. It's a new idea and Perhaps it does well. It was a pity that it was not possible to pair with a corner gas. Now I know the corner gas is on the CTV, but the two performances would be great accompanying pieces.
