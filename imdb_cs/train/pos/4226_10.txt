I have a lot of time on all Columbo movies, but this was especially well written and the solution at the end very effective. However, my main memory is the opening of the scene in the middle of the film, between Columbo and the killer (sorry if I just forgot all the details). It is the most remarkable picture of Columba I have seen: the look is from inside the darkness of the wardrobe where the victim was murdered and the room behind him that shines with the daylight. Columbo sits in a chair with a high backrest that stands in front of the door (and we), considering the closet and almost in the silhouette due to the contrast in the light. There is no sound. The camera moves slowly from the room and towards it. He is deep in meditation, gently puffs on a cigar, cigar smoke swirls slowly upward as he thinks. Then the dialog begins. Splendid.
