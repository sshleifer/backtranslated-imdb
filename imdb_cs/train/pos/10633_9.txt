This movie is as unique as it is overlooked ... The different story is that it shows how to survive or preserve the ability to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind. I first saw it on the cable in the late 1970s and really related the limitations of the gay community at the time. I believe that this film was some time ago in the form of a small slice of a dark way of life. It is really a classic in the sense that it is the forerunner of what is now viewed as an extended family. This film should be available on DVD / VHS so that it can not only recognize Meg Foster & Perry King's extraordinary performances but show how far we have come and we still have to go where relationships are concerned.
