This review comes almost 30 years late. However, it should be noted that at the beginning of 2008, I sometimes made a copy of this film and watched it repeatedly for 4 months right now! I had to write about it! I was defeated and I forgot that after seeing this movie there was something else. How ironic is the worst male protagonist of the literature portrayed by the most beautiful man! yet, what a welcome irony! I was perfectly fitting because Timothy Dalton was fully in charge. He got a stunning and triumphant performance! I've never seen anything like that! All other actors are also very good. The whole movie was beautifully assembled. I do not care what someone says about this movie. I love it and I love it! I was happy and happy. It will crush me a bit, but I prefer Jane Eyre 1983 to A & E's P & J, which is, in my opinion, the highest mini-series. <br /> <br /> The excerpts from Jane Eyre scared me a little from school. I have never been able to read the book seriously when I knew the story so well. When I saw this particular production, I told the story of life and made me furious. The scenes and the voice of Mr. Dalton persecuted me endlessly and eventually forced me to read the book seriously, which is, of course, a masterpiece. Bravo the whole team and especially Mr. Dalton! This film is now part of me. <br /> <br /> I give it 10/10.
