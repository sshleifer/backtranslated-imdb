Three girls (full-fledged media crew, including cult actress Barbara Bach, no less) attend a small town to cover the festival, end up renting rooms in the house to avoid being a plague. He has done a little shock, suffers a bit from some redundant dialogue scenes, and rather a thin fence line (this is not hiding secrets). One of the main topics is particularly worrying (as in: vintage shock) and that's basically what the movie thrives on. Performances and cinematography are basically above par (compared to many other films of the late 1970s and 1980s), but what I really recommend is this film a relatively long highlight in the basement. From the moment the "Keller Junior" was introduced, his performance caused my jaw to open and it did not stop until the end of the film. A very pleasant surprise when they saw the actor Sydney Lassick (who was humorous in "One fly over the cuckoo's nest" and now totally demented in "The Unseen") has taken on one of the major roles.
