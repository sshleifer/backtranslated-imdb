Tom wanted to make the film for a long time, and he did it. it's as if he saw a dirty and worn notebook full of big little ideas he filled and worn for 10 years. no transformation of the grant nature, no Hollywood ingredients simply life and a little magic. equilibrium, speed, strangeness in comedy and drama is perfectly matched. this movie will guide you through a journey that ends before you realize how nice it was. the music is great and your eyes will be just as happy. the fact that this film is about nothing but a sketch of the sketch of people who are mainly associated with one of the characters is very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining is great because it is empty. between the lines that are happening. to see or not to see, is it?
