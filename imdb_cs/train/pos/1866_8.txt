A great story based on a true story about a young black man and all the road problems. Since this is Denzel Washington's first film, which he is going to point to, I must admit that I was skeptical, but who would not be ..? But again he is a great actor with rich experience and the end result turned out to be great. The story is splendidly telling you through your childhood with difficulty and young adulthood. This will hurt you hard and let you know that you are not the only one going through hell. Overall, this is a touching story about the young man who is developing in this world. (The story is based on the life of Anthony Fisher, born August 3, 1959, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, who was also the author of this film) Strongly recommended. 8/10
