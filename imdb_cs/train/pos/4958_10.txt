Full publication: I'm a cynic. I love my end sad and my hankies dry. I did not cry when Bambi's mother was shot dead. Will Smith's new film Happiness looks like a desperate request for an Oscar. Basically, I was born without an artistic soul. <br /> <br /> So why did he like "10 items or less?" Maybe it was twice the espresso that I hit before the show. Or (probably) maybe even the most stubborn film fans can use occasional sweets. <br /> <br /> And sweet it is. From the moment that "Him" meets "Scarlet" (an event far away from Nora Ephron "Meet Cute"), the view of an intimate journey with two strangers teaches care of where their lives are at the head. (He helped beautifully Cameraman Phedon Papamichael). The main argument for the film is that it is too good. Is the film far-fetched? I do not know. Tell me that. I've met Adrian Brody in the market. (However, not because of a lack of experiment). Do I like to think about the adventures that could happen if this important event took place? I darn directly. . . That's where most reviews "10 items or less" is inadequate. . They do not take into account that even we cynics have fantasies. Hell, sometimes it's worth accepting that I'm alive, 82 minutes at a time.
