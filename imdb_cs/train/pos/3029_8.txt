The novel is easier and the best parts of the film are direct translations of what Greene wrote; such as a silent but sad humor that breaks into scenes with Boyer and Lorr or the obsession of a murdered child that takes over a plot. Where the film deviates from the novel, it tends to mix. However, I do not want to suggest that the film is by no means bad. It always seems that the part and story remains in the mind as good. Some of the tiny characters were actors' composers who could turn to anything. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible shame that the movie is not available on DVD.
