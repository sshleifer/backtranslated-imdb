One of the best, if not the best rock'n'roll films ever. And it's not just a soulless pastime. In fact, it was a lot of funny jokes. Of course I like Ramones. But with all the topics of "anarchy" and "I hate middle school", the film does not really cover too much, which is what is great. I first spotted the film in the spring of 1980, and I saw it again recently. Since I went to high school in the late 1970s, it seemed nostalgic. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is not serious and not as demanding as so many other teenage travelers of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. And talking about it is neither dirty nor nasty. Only PG rating. This is rare for a movie in this category. Great classic culture and a truly incredible time capsule.
