Made in 1946 and released in 1948, Lady and Shanghai were one of the great films created by Welles after returning from a relative exile for becoming a citizen of Kane. Dark, thoughtful and expressing some early cold war of paranoia, this film stands tall as a film-Noir crime film. The cinematography of this film is full of Welles' distinctive features of special angles, fast cuts, long pans and ominous lighting. The use of ambient street music is the precursor of an incredible long opening shot in Touch of Evil, and mysterious Chinese characters and sequences in Chinatown can in many ways be considered inspiration for Chinatown Roman Polanski. Unfortunately, it's Welles obsession with a technical film that hurts the whole movie. The plot of this story is often lost to the sometimes incomprehensible disorder of filmmaking techniques. However, despite this criticism, the story combined with the awesome performances of Welles, Hayworth and especially Glenn Anders (laughs) make it a joy to see the movie. Orson Welles pulls not only the Irish brogue, but the torn identity as an honest but dangerous sailor. Rita Hayworth, who was married to Welles at the time, ceases to play a role as a sexual goddess and plays a role of real depth and contradiction. Finally, Glenn Anders's strange and bizarre portrayal or partner Elsa's husband is nothing but a classic!
