This game show lasted only one season but was interesting to the audience because it required visual talent and a stable hand. One false move would exclude the competitor from the win, though it was clear that the competitor knew the correct answer. It was always exciting when a competitor began to draw, wondering if he would finish the drawing or explode; allowing other contestants to easily win the competition. It was a reckless show, but it was obvious that the contestants were often embarrassed by a stupid unintentional mistake. They rarely saw that the game show did not survive a single season. Only an experienced game show remembers this show because it turned out to be quite unpopular, although the gaming shows came back on the TV screen after returning to the game in the 1950s. But it was a unique concept for a game show that has never been seen before.
