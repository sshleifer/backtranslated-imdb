Well, this is probably one of the best movies I've seen, and I really like that I remember most of the script (especially the scene in the store when Jerry Lee breaks the wind) and even the script in my head that I still want to watch for Jerry Lee's German Shepherd Dog is hysterical and is actually being tested to see who's smarter. The line of the tag is also true. Not to mention that acting is great, although Christine Tucci sounds different in the noise (Check out the CSI movie if you do not know what I mean). It's a bad thing that this film contained the only problem with which Dooley and Jerry Lee had to work, it would be nice to see the tricks that Zeus and Welles had in their sleeves.
