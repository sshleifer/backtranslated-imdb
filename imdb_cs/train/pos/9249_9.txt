This movie is funny, observable and absolutely touching. And now you often see that Jean Harlow (or any actress of this time, in this case) gives another woman a quick blow to the jaw? (Twice!) After Harlow's Ruby is sent to the Reformer after contacting Gable's Edward Hall (who is a cheerful, though seemingly distorted smile), it's more difficult to find that she is pregnant and she is convinced that she had left her, but in fact, her love changed, and he would come to visit her despite the fact that he would be arrested and, with the help of the minister, he would be married. <br /> <br /> The amazing relationship that Harlow shares with his roommates is the second only to his electrical chemistry with Gable, who was her most frequent leader. Her cynical character is the perfect match for Gable's smooth-talking cheater. What do you want? "" You know, you would not be a bad-looking lady-if it was not for your face! "Ruby cuts Cigans, its competitors." If you get so close to me, I'll have to open the second window! "<br /> <br /> Infinite!
