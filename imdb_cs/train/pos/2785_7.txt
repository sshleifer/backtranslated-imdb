"Bend Like Like Beckham" reminds me of the best of John Hughes' eighty ten-year films. Everything takes place in a colorful world where everyone is attractive, there are some easily solved conflicts that sometimes deviate from most happy events and a huge amount of conspiracy is summed up in monts set to bounce pop melodies. There is nothing wrong with that. "Bend It Like Beckham" is an absolute treatment from beginning to end. My wife and I found ourselves totally out of chest, although we were talking about it, and finally it's embarrassing to admit it, applauding (and we saw it by the way in our living room, not in the theater). Watch this movie and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Mark: B +
