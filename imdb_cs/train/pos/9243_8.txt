Do not listen to the many shy and stinky comments that have accumulated on this movie ... Simply put, when it comes to ninja movies, my friends are as good as they get! <br /> <br /> Yes, it's stupid, yes, acting and script are definitely absolutely cruel, but rubber - it's so bloody fun! In fact, as is often the case for B movies, terrible "acting" (which is really the worst I've ever enjoyed in the case of the movie), and the ridiculous "plot" only serves to raise the level of delight tenfold. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that combat scenes are the main attraction in this although, and to a large extent, I am glad that they are very well choreographed, especially the final settlement (during which we see that the ninja is not seemingly limited by normal gravity laws ... <br /> <br /> Believe me that you are a fan of ninja movies and have seen Sakura Killers so far, then I really miss what is, in my opinion, one of the real jewels in the crown of the genre.
