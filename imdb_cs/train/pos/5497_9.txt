A remarkable documentary that gives a vivid representation of a country that is deeply divided (for further evidence, look at some IMDb comments ...!). It is very good compared to Oliver Stone's "Comandante" (which is mainly deep-bodied examination of Fidel Castro's hair). I do not know if Chavez is all he represents himself or another in a long line of populist Latin caudillos. I do not even know if he can heal the enormous expectations he has clearly built among the poor majority of Venezuelan citizens. It is hardly reasonable to expect such a film to be able to answer such questions - but I have pretty good ideas now about what is at stake and what it is like when you are going to attack in the midst of a coup. Someone says in the film "We Do History," and that's exactly what the film feels like capturing. Excellent things.
