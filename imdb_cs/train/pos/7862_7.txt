Here's the proof why Mary Pickford was "American darling". In this rather complicated drama Mary plays a young daughter of a squatter who dares to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the "hills." Scenes where they steal a kiss and fall in love are just gorgeous. She is even willing to bathe. The fact that Mary could take this role at the age of 30 is simply amazing and somewhat due to her lengthy character (5 '). Tess has to face many physical and emotional problems. It does so in many heroic seasons. Tess packs up and is not in danger of fighting someone. Why she agrees to help her daughter from the top of the hill is behind me, but she sacrifices her own happiness to keep a deep secret. Pickford's close ups are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Jean Hersholt, born in Denmark, is just as great as a villain. A scene in which manhandles a small child is enough to throw vegetables (or whatever) on the screen. If Forrest Robinson (played by Daddy Skinner) wore a beard, would it be a match for the model used in the First World War to collect Uncle Same posters? I wish you! <br /> <br /> While the story is somewhat predictable and slow at the beginning, it is worth investing in your time to see a piece or pure 'Americana'. The film draws attention to the choices we have at our disposal, which include the fact that someone else is happy and what a real Christian should be. Recommended.
