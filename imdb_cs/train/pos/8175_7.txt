Before we start, I'm afraid of dentists. This movie gives me creeps and even makes me cringe. That's what I love about this movie. The film is a little boring. That means I have three stars! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler Alert * <br /> <br /> Alan Feinstone, who just found his wife cheating him. Soon he will start hallucinating and start torturing his patients, killing co-workers, and even torturing his wife to death and killing the man with whom he has a relationship. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The film is very bloody and bloody. I would recommend it if you are in gore. I give this film 7 stars of 10. Dr. Alan Feinstein is not your regular daily dentist!
