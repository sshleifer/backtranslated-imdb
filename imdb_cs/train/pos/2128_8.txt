I just watched Turner's classic movies last night when I first saw it and I loved it. I like a lot of older movies, especially due to the absence of all dirty language and excessive violence, nudity and sex in most of today's films. I also think that in many (but not all) cases it was much better. Jimmy Stewart is my favorite favorite. I just thought this movie was a lot of fun to watch and I enjoyed it. If you feel older movies have the same relationship, I do not think you could go wrong with it. I believe "You've Got Mail" is a remake of this movie (though a bit different and also a nice movie). For a relaxing evening with a movie, do not be ashamed whether your kids or someone in your tour walks, you get it, or catch it on one of the classic movie channels.
