Yes, Keaton looks like he really likes doing this movie. With skipping in your step in your sewing pins you will be reminded of Jimmy Cagney! Johnny (Keaton) is a young hood who does just to pay for her expensive medical bills for her mother and sends her younger brother (Griffin Dunne) to a law school. Nobody even knows that Johnny Kelly is Johnny Dangerously, later in the movie. Joe Piscopo is Vermin and Johnny does not like one bit (& I do not like Vermin). Marilyn Henner has a nice singing / dance routine while Johnny likes it. I love that part when they are in a constantly changing escape! The policeman who "calls all the cars" is the Skipper of Gilligan Island! Look at the gangster laugh! Gags in this movie are funny, but you have to catch them or you will miss them! Look at the background of each scene.
