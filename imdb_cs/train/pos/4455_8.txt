Although I liked me, I liked her. I'm new to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Even though I've heard of them, I've never seen anything recently with them. The first one I saw was Singin in the rain that made me Gene's fan. I think it's better too. But I thought this movie was good and like all the movies there are some parts that are better than others but in my book it's a great movie and I love it. Frank and Gene are doing a good team. I've seen them together. Take me to the ball. But I hold my guns, I say that I really enjoyed and that I like it!
