I think this movie would be more enjoyable if all of them thought it as a picture of colonial Africa in the 1950s and 1960s, rather than as a story. Because there is no real story here. One mark on the other, like small points of light that do not mean much, until you have enough painting. The first time I saw Chocolat, I really did not "get it" until I thought about it for a few days. Then I realized there was a lot of things to "get", including the end of colonialism that was just around the corner, just no plot. Anyway, it's one of my favorite movies. The scene at the airport with a short shower and beautiful music was pure poetry. If you love "exciting" movies, do not look at it - you will be bored with tears. But for some of you ... you can thank me later for recommending it to you.
