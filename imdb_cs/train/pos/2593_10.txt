It comes from the left field and it's really not what you expect. But I like it. The most memorable experiences of the film come from surprise when you ask me. If you have not been denying the mysterious "thing" that makes these brothers so strange ... you are on a favor. Cast is fantastic, but it's not so stretched that it's tangible. Special effects come from nothing (seriously, it's like a strangely dark romantic comedy until they do it - then WOW) and they are great. Total cinematography is easy for the eyes, editing and sound are very good, and the twisted story develops without a clich√©. While none of these aspects mean it's a "blockbuster," "what the hell?" factor ALONE makes it a movie treasure. People who bash this movie do not make sense. It's one of those often faded flicks of the 1990s that you've never heard of or you love so much about jumping to mention your title. <br /> <br /> I'm in the second group.
