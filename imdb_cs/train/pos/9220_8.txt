Romeo and Juliet's beautifully simple broadcast. Access without expectation except that you have a good time and enjoy. A talented group of comedy actors left to go and recover in this reckless car. Bad reviews were due to snobbery about Shakespeare's treatment. Some people feel that the whole movie must be "important" --- If you share these views, do not bother. The accomplishments featured the "introduction" of Angelina Jolie, who is not so close, but she is stunningly beautiful as the Julian character, and as always, her acting is amazing - and given the age at that time even her dialect is quite good. Restoring this classic story to feudal Italian families in New York's catering business has resulted in great entertainment. See it in the right frame of mind and you will laugh out loud.
