We do not have to lose this movie, it's one of the biggest I've ever seen. Jean Pierre Leaud is amazing (more than usual) and the film is one of the most memorable of the new game. Jean Eustache is no longer on this country, we only have these black and white paintings to remember one of the greatest and most underestimated French directors. You just have to love this masterpiece. I'll never forget it. <br /> <br /> P.S: I'm sorry for English ...
