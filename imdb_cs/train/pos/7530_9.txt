This is so to say the sequel to Batman Animated and it's quite as good as it and for all the same reasons it has a lot of action in it It's a good voice over the actors are really good like Kevin Conroy as Batman, Mark Hamil as Joker etc The villains are really good like Joker, Two-face, Catwoman, Clayface, etc. So I'm sure you will not be disappointed with the new adventures of Batman because it's really good. So make sure you can watch them on TV or borrow or buy a collector's edition because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Total score: ********* of ****** **** <br /> <br /> **** of *****
