It's not a good movie, but I still like it. The Clovis cat is golden in a glass, as well as the premise of the cats themselves - the truly opposed evil Sleepwalkers. I think there's more to this movie than people realize, basically it's very rough, but this rate can sometimes be good. It has nasty lines, a sudden ending, and a comedic element carried by a policeman who is overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> Someone found an incestuous element a little worrying? In the end, this film is randomly and accidentally difficult, which is quite effective, it resembles that of Psycho - relationship between mother and son, change of protagonists. I think it also works suddenly, it's not the movie you want to prolong, it only works when it's short. I'm still not sure whether the director got the depth, or whether he did these things with intent, we know that Stephen King has the ability, yet I have not read his books, he has seen only some of his films. Anyway, I liked it. If you like harsh horror movies with 80 moods, just look at them. but do not expect too much. It's really bad.
