Here is my first film David Mamet. Installation because it was his first. <br /> <br /> The story here is uneven and moves just like any movie, from small infidels to big drawbacks to the ubiquitous horse. It's like "The Grifters," but without this level playing the movie. (In this film, John Cusack was gentle, but that was the character of his character.) Actor's acting is very flat (sometimes I was wondering if the ruthless effect of Crouse should be some attack on psychoanalysis). At least at the beginning. It's never really good, but after ten minutes it's developing out of painful reading. At the beginning of the film, some lines of Lindsay Crouse - as they read it - sound as though they were internal monologues or narratives that are not. With the arrival of Mantegna, you will pick it up. <br /> <br /> The dialogue here is not as fun as it should be. I expected ring rings that are rotating in tongue, but you did not. Everything is more read than spoken. Perhaps Mamet has evolved and released after this film, but if not, then he should let others control his words. It is too valuable to them, and as a result, loses rhythmic, jazz quality. What's stranger is that other than this, the movie does not look or feel like a game. The camera is very cinematic. My only problem with "Glengarry Glen Ross" was that it looked too much like filmed theater, but in this film the actors were not only fulfilled but relaxed and free. Everything was flowing. <br /> <br /> I would not care much if it sounded like movie characters talking with movie lines - or even playing characters talking about the game - but here it sounds like movie (or even books) of speaking characters. It's a special theater and a movie that just does not work. This does not mean that the film is bad - it is not, it is often very fun. The best piece is in the middle. Standard Concert: Newcomer (in this case, girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) gets involved in the underworld. How she is involved: she is a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a compulsive player. He wants to help his gambling with the debtor, so he enters Domek Games, a bluish gaming room where the men in the back room work. I admit that setting is quite unlikely. (They just expected Crouse to come and they would expect to write a check, Billy was there, but one of these questions is finally answered.) <br /> <br /> There are some disadvantages here. I found beginners - those who are few students - to be the most amazing. We will get a lesson in the art of Kona, just like Crouse. <br /> <br /> We see the end of the arrival, and then we did not see the other end of the arrival, and then I did not see the real end but maybe you did. The ball is still jumping back and forth, and the last scene in the movie lets us realize that the second Crouse has entered the House of Games, finding her the right call. I forgive annoying opening, unlikely bits, and weird reading, because there are many good things here. If the first part of the movie seems terrible, stick with it. After a half-hour mark, a pulse really gets. If you want fun with the movie, then it is here. If you want Mamet, look again at "Glengarry Glen Ross" - James Foley did it better. <br /> <br />
