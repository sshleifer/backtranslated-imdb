I absolutely loved this movie when I was a child. I cried every time I watched them. I was not weird. I totally identified myself with the characters. I'd like to see it again (and I hope I'm disappointed!). Pufnstuf rocks !!!! I was really drawn into the world of fantasy. And for me the movie was a lot. I wonder if I ever saw a series and confused them? The game I thought was strong. I loved Jack Wilde. He was so dreamy that he was ten years old (when I first saw the film, not in 1970.) I can still remember the characters alive that the flute was absolutely believable and still can feel the bad forests The witch was scary - I would not want to cross her path.
