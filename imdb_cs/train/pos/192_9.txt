Before I saw the Show People, my impression of the silent comedy was basically scary and terrible. I could not imagine how screen comedies might be, without relying heavily on the spoken word or the numerous pratfalls. But this masterpiece showed me that I was wrong. Davies, in my opinion, was probably the greatest comedian actress who came in front of Lucille Ball. I mentioned Lucy mainly because Davies's maneress and facial expressions reminded me that I was curious whether Davies was one of Ball's primary influences. This comes from 21-year-olds who have never seen a silent comedy before, and I have to say that no matter how many time-specific links you really get (apparently I did not), you will not bore the movie. You'll probably even laugh than you should on most talkie comedies. This is not only my favorite silent comedy, but maybe even among my ten favorite comedies of all time.
