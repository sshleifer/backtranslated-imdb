This game is awesome. You really should get it if you do not have it. Even though it's old, it was amazing when it came out. I believe this game will always be classic. It's just as good a Super Mario World or something. When I was young, my friend and I would sit and play this game for hours and try to defeat what we did in the end. It's not as advanced as the Super Mario Galaxy, but if you're a Mario fan, it's necessary. It's fun fun and challenging. Everything you might want from a fantasy game except good graphics (well done in 1996.) ROCK ON 4EVA MARIO LUIGI AND YOSHI !!! Nintendo is the best!
