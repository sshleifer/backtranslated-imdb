I was really surprised by this film. When I got into the picture and did not know anything about the movie except one trailer I saw, I thought it would be a bunch of fests. I expected bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character that will eventually be put, because that's just how movies work. Instead, I got a clever, surprisingly original film about a decent, average guy who just never had sex. Yes, the movie is full of jokes and vulgar sex and casual hey-look-and-nipple! But it's more like Bad Santa than Sorority Boys. All the characters are people you probably know in real life who can redeem who just try to raise their brother and live their lives. I thought that this movie would be a complete twist. I was very surprised. Yes, it's quite over the top (c'mon, it's a 40-year-old virgin movie!) But it's very cleverly done. In the end, you're really trying to put that guy down, which says a lot about the movie, since frankly, I really wondered if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?
