DIG! is funny, fun, fun, interesting, stylish and very well done. Since it is known that this has been done on such a smart budget for seven years, it is amazing that such a story can be said, especially with such a style and essence. If you are a fan of music or a fan of documentary films, you have to see it. Focus on the films Brian Jonestown Masssacre and The Dandy Warhols over the years is a brilliant way to show the contrast between a decent band that meets with moderate success thanks to perseverance and ability to compromise and the genius megalomaniac singer singer has supported the diverse cast of characters that sabotage their own success through drugs, alcohol and madness. If I did not know it was shots of real people, I swear it was an incredibly well written and imaginative script. The story is convincing, brief, and just amazing.
