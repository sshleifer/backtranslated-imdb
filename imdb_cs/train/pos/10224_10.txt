... and I think so. If not literally (after all, I did not see any movie ever created!), At least obviously among those, many to know. 5.3 ??? The IMDb rule is this: sometimes movies rated very high (for example, a piece of Kannes-Kompetition-Krowned-Korean-Kraap called "Oldboy") may be really bad. But rarely the movie worth watching is actually rated below 6. This movie, a lot worth watching, is. Shame. <br /> <br /> It's true, I'm giving it on protest 10. The film is not perfect. Her real rating should be 8 or 9. She has some actor mistakes (especially Belafonte), the script sometimes wanders. However, what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all time, Czech Jan Kadar, who directs two of the greatest actors of all time, the beloved, bigger than-life Zero Mostel and the noble Ida Kaminska in an acting / poetic / moral tour. A couple from Heaven! It is true that this film, with little deficiency, does not concern the average audience, but those interested in watching an outstanding movie of an incomparable director who gave us the "Best Street Story" (the best film about the Holocaust) should not be missed just because some stupid IMDb the rating system decides that "American Beauty" is better than "The Angel Levine".
