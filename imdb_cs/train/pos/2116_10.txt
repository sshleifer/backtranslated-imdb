Was there ever a movie enchanting than this one? One reason why everything works so well is that a group of actors seem to interact and have an impact on the lives of others. Its center is James Stewart's "romance" and Margaret Sullavan's, who work together and can not meet face-to-face but who associate with each other as anonymous. But there are also supportive characters, and unlike many romantic comedies (including "You've Got Mail", the recent "Shop" update), they are not just exhausted to support both companies and their needs. Everybody becomes a complicated part of the rich charm wallpaper by Ernst Lubitsch. One of the most powerful scenes in the history of the film takes place when the almost tragic Frank Morgan scorns disgustingly and humbly someone who has a Christmas dinner. You must see! **** outside ****
