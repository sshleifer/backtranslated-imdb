Oliver! musical is my favorite. Music, characters, story. Everything seems perfect. In this translation of the timeless classical novel, the music scene has become, director Carol Reed brings Broadway's hit screen. Moving from musical to film music is not easy. You have to have the right voices, the right set, the right script, and the right game. All signs point to this game. It almost seems to have been written for the screen! Our story takes place in the merry old England, where a boy named Oliver manages to escape from an orphanage. He traverses the countryside to London, where he meets a group of juvenile delinquents, led by Dodger, an intelligent, fast-handed gesture. The leader of this group is called Fagin, an elderly person who sells all stolen goods. But everything is not good in London City when Bill Sykes starred Oliver Reed and his loving girlfriend Nancy tangles with Oliver, Fagin and his young soldiers and law. The result is an amazing story of love, affection and great musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Whether you like musicals or not, listen to these melodies and have fun all day long. Oliver! is a triumph on and off the stage and is a timeless artwork.
