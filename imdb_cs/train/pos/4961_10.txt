Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are pairs who do not show up to get into the car and do their jobs as needed. Morgan Freeman is famously human, linked to one and all, while Paz Vega is a sharp cashier for "10 items or less," which controls his customers and intimidates his customers. Together they explore, discover and learn from one another. Of course, they must be vulnerable, interested in change, and have a sense of humor both of them. I wish that this film was realistic, I wish that this type of story became more frequent, I wish we did not have to go to the movies to realize that we can really get together even if we come from a very different environment. The message of the film is based on an open heart and thinks of the possibility of another world from which we come from - a world where peace could be possible.
