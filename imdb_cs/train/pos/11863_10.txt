Maybe it could be the best movie ever shot and if it is not, it's definitely one of those burned on your pupils like what Brian De Palma is doing is a great cinematographic work of art. At first, Brian De Palma's director, who has proven himself to be one of the best directors, is the great performance of Al Pacino, which delivers the immortal hero on the big screen (Tony Montana). many different (violent) scenes you will never forget (the chain saw in which Tony sits in a bathtub that is as big as most of the people's dwellings), there are many great unicorns that many times use the word "f * ck") , there are splendid details (a pan-American globe that screams "The world is yours") or a great interview with Giorgio Morodero. Can not be named here, which is not noble here, and it's easy with the Godfather, Good Guys and White Heat, one of the best gangster ever!
