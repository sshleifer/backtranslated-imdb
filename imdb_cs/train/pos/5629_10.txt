I loved this great movie. Farrah Fawcett played phenomenally and with a good heart. He plays a woman who is controlled by extreme measures to protect herself and her friends after being attacked by a stranger. After the police refuse, she realizes she is alone. <br /> <br /> Then one day, when at home, the alien penetrates her home and regains it. You do not intend to call the police or bring her out, she is forced to spray her eyes and imprison her in her fireplace. I think there is a need to wake up to the laws of the country. They are too easy for these criminals. Time for harsher punishments.
