GOJOE gets used to getting used to the beginning, but the end result is very satisfying. The story of a murderous samurai trying to redeem against a feminine but dangerous samurai is more than a watch. There is a lot at stake, from physical survival to soulful salvation. The film may seem a bit like other Samurai-inspired anime-inspired films, but eventually it will eventually dive into the mature / adult territory soon after. <br /> <br /> Do not forget. GOJOE is one of the best samurai films that appear around post-Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p>
