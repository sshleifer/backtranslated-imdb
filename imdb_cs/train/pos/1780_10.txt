My mother and I were on their way home from the road to the northeast (mainly in Massachusetts) when we decided to take a little detour to visit the Boston Film Festival. Now I do not know much about the movie, so I thought it might be a little educational. The first movie we saw was ROMEO DIVISION. Now I do not know about it, but I thought it was great! I'm from Texas and where I come from, we do not see too many movies, so it was a pleasant surprise. My mother insisted she was too violent, but she said I did not know much about what she said, but it was a great picture. I was shocked by combat sequences that were great. I'm also a big fan when good guys win, so I was thrilled when Romeo ladies killed all the bad boys. That was a real brilliance. I'm not sure when the video is released, but if you have a chance, you should look. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. The word for the wise, however, is rather violent and there are many cuss words, so you might not want your children to watch. It's more for adults.
