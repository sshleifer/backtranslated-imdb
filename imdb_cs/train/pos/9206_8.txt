We can not see movies about brother brother's sister relationships in an Indian cinema or other language or media. This relationship has several aspects that have not been used in movies or novels. Typically, the sister is represented as a heap that can be used to redeem at the top. This film treats the subject entirely differently. <br /> <br /> It is inspired by George Eliot's novel "Mill on the Floss". The brother is very prosaic, all-good, blue-eyed boy, who is usually a good son and favorite with his mother. The nurse is romantic, wild and defies against unwritten rules of society. Despite this, the brother's sister's love is the winner. This film is about the love of two siblings who are separated in childhood and a revival of the same feeling when they meet years later. It is also the effort of a subdued brother to reconnect with his sister, who has decided to be wild to defy the world. Although the film and the novel are set in about three centuries apart in two distant countries, the sentiments are the same and still apply.
