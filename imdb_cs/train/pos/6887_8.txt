It is a unique and courageous film. It is energetic, with highly developed characters. Very good performance. <br /> <br /> I love directors who are not afraid to ask viewers to think ... Bret Carr dares to look in, ask questions and dig under the surface. Depending on the nature of the movie, it actually requires the viewer to look inside. It can do some courage. I see some of the close people consider it very worrying. However, I considered it provocative, much more than just entertainment. Bret Carr is a truly original filmmaker with a vision. I'm curious to see what he's going to do next. Watch him.
