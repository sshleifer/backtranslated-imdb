I left it again, it was a film box of what I thought I was renting, I did not know until I came back home, and I watched it all the same. Absolutely fantastic! amazing movie and one of my best three favorites of all time, I recommend it to all! The story is nice and easy to meet, it could be easily confused, but the actors and the director do a great job of keeping it. <br /> <br /> The actors themselves are fantastic, they show a wonderful character and they do a great job. <br /> <br /> You have to find a copy somewhere ...........
