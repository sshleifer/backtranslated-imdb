This is a very entertaining Ealing comedy about a community in central London that, due to an unusual situation, finds out that they are not English, but they are an annex to the French province of Burgundy. comic actor Stanley Holloway (best known as Alfred Doolittle at MY FAIR LADY) as well as a number of other classic comic season actors. The story was apparently based on intelligence at the time when the Canadian government "officially" provided a hotel room to a visiting European parent. The idea really reminded me of the real case of the Hutt River province in Western Australia where the landowner "detached" from the Australian government due to the wave quota dispute. (Australia's Australian Government has never said it). <br /> <br /> This is a great screenplay that plays with many political and economic issues, rather like the TV Show "Yes Minister"; as well as a very small eccentric character.
