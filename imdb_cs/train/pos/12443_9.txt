I like this movie. It was a pleasure to see the version so close to Peter O'Donnell's vision. Several people did not like this movie, but it must be seen in connection with the story of origin, it is. The film uses flashback to show the young modesty and the events that shaped her into the woman she had become. Before the network. Before Willie Garvin. The tempo is a little slow, and for my taste, there is not enough tension in the current scenarios. However, it is only acceptable to get such a loyal version. <br /> <br /> If you like Modesta Blaise, you'll enjoy it even with your mistakes if you just want action action with the pursuit of cars - forget it. </ p> <p> <br /> It feels like it's the first franchise, but as I have never seen it being promoted anywhere, I suspect there will be no more. Unfortunately.
