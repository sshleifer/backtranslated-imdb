I followed the movie and watched it 20 times before I took it back to the store. Bill Paxton hired first-class talent to make a good thriller with some interesting twists. The story is original and well written. Powers Booth and Paxton bring good performances. The story is interestingly narrated with both memories 20 years back, then they appear in the present, alternating back and forth. This style of narration makes a good thriller that can not be boring. Bill Paxton, please do more horror movies, you have talents for it!
