In the Roseanne final season, the rollercoaster ride was crazy. This last episode does exactly what the previous comment says and tells us that just as we might think we know the characters we did not do. Roseanne returns to the first season and tells us that this show is her rendition of her life. He says in this last episode that he has changed events and people as he thinks fit. Scott was not really with Leon, but he existed. Mark and David married their wives in real life, and Dan died when he brought him to life. As the events happened in her life, she changed them into her writing. We would not all want to do it. We should not all have a time when we wish we could use the rubber and change our wishes. That's what she did with the whole episode. And for another note, I would say that I do not feel cheated, the family was real in my mind, just changed the way events happened in their lives. A + ends at the A + !!!!
