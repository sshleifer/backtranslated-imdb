This movie is good. It's not the best of big CG kung fu flicks, but it's pretty good. The first thing is that the story is really good. The whole idea of ​​gods vs. fallen gods that deal with superpower is pretty cool. My problem is too many characters! It was very confusing when switching to the scene! Special effects were INCREDIBLE! Battle scenes were very fast and complicated. This movie was practically the whole computer created. The game is great as expected from such high-profile players. Ekin Cheng is an outstanding hero, a female figure. Zhang Ziyi did not do anything in this movie. I thought he would have a bigger role, but he did one fight scene and a lot of curbs. The criminal, the whole skull army and the whole age of blood are dreaded. Music is also excellent. For me, this story deserves at least a miniseries and not just one movie. It's too many stories that accumulate in 2 hours. Perhaps if there was a book or something, I would be able to keep up with all the characters and details. This film sacrifices the story of integrity for action. I recommend Storm Riders this day every day.
