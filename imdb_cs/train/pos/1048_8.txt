For Muslim women in West Africa, married life can be very hard in the hands of abusive husbands. The community does not have to explicitly support this behavior, but it does not have to be prepared to treat it as a criminal, an attitude that, of course, allows it to continue. Fortunately, the letter of Cameroon law promises equality to everyone, and this document follows the real life practices of various female practitioners in the Cameroonian legal system because it seeks to ensure justice for many women and children. What is remarkable (apart from the uplifting central story) is that, despite their informality, the courts are indeed pragmatically progressive when the case is actually purchased. The program also gives a fascinating insight into the whole lifestyle of Cameroon, which, in addition to the terrible crimes committed in selected cases, seems surprisingly emotional and joyful in comparison to the people of Europe or North America. And although I admit that I can betray this comment on naivete, it seems that this attitude is captured in the beautiful pidgin-English she is talking about. Overall, this is an amazing little movie and much more fun than you can imagine.
