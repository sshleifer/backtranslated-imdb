Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel Starship Troopers has been confused around with in recent years, in all of which Paul Verhoeven is a 1997 film on a television series, for a number of games. But none of them, in fact, has captured the spirit of my novel. Games are usually unrelated, the TV series was more of a reflection, and the less they liked Verhoeven's movie, the better. They know little, however, that an animated adaptation has already been made in Japan, released the year of Heinlein's death. And believe it or not, despite the differences, this 6-part animated series is the epicenter, the most dependable adaptation of Heinlein's classics. The most obvious addition to this series is the presence of a powered armor exoskeleton, something we got rid of in the movie Verhoeven. Like the book, the series focuses more on characters and their relationships than on action and space travel, although we see a fair amount of everyone. While events happen differently than in the book, there is a feeling of a book. Rico and Carmen have romantic entanglements, but it's just a little more affected than in the book. While some may believe the dialogue and character interaction are somewhat lower than the book (it gets a bit of anime treatment, but what did you expect?) But it is far better than the movie. Heinlein's political views are only cut out, unlike the film where they are reversed. The big success of the series is, of course, the climatic battle of Klendath among soldiers and bugs / aliens, which is a type of action from powered armor suits we would like to see in the movie version. <Br /> <br /> Overall, I liked this series because I wanted to see the Heinlein vision. And I think they've done a good job with this. If you find this series, give it to her.
