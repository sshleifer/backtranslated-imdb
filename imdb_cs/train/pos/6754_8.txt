Director Otto Preminger reconnected with his stars Laura Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney in this rough and ready to ring the movie Noir: Where the Path ends. This film is complete with a well-written crime story with interesting characters, unexpected turns and clever conversation, and a glamorous view with great camera motion and a dark and shy film of noir illumination. Dana Andrews plays as Detective Mark Dixon, a part of a gangsta and a part of a cop who has the reputation of being too physically tough with the criminals. After one case, Dixon sees suspicious and answerable answers, is much more involved than he wants. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is awesome in her role - hard and nervous, Andrews' Dixon is ready to knock everyone and their heels if they get to his wrong side. It's a perfect movie noir against the hero - it's still not very nice, but we still have a root for him. Gene Tierney plays a solid role, just like Dixon's sweet shoulder. Perhaps not too much of Tierney's role, but of course goes beyond what others could do with the role by knocking each member of the audience with his kind smile in a gentle way and a flash of his eye. Support for cast is not too bad - Karl Malden is the most memorable, joining and giving good support as Lieutenant Thomas. Where Endwalks Ends is not Laura, but it's a great movie noir full of great characters, story and image.
