- SMALL SPOILER HEREIN! - When I looked at the "Creep" votes today, I was surprised that so many IMDb users rated this movie "1". I wonder what people expect from such a movie? Are there so many people watching the movie without knowing it? <br /> <br /> "Creep" is a HORROR movie and it's pretty good! This automatically means: it has an absurd story full of holes, outrageous dangers and simple one-sided characters. So why complain about it? Just take some popcorn and coke, soothe yourself in the seat and then ... ... to enjoy being afraid of death! The first 60 minutes, when there's almost nothing Kate and the lonely metro station incredibly scare. In every corner of the screen there is fear and fear and I will give you a little sadness just because of the sudden sound of a flashing neon lamp at the back of you. (In my opinion, the sound editor did the best work in this movie.) When Kate meets her pursuer, the quality of the film is falling, but it still does not make a bad movie. The second part of the film is not frightening, but the gore effects are well done and the story is pretty well developed. (... if you remember that it's the horror movie you're watching, not Discovery Channel!) So if you want to do a big, very horrible hour. Just watch the first hour of "Creep" and then leave the cinema or turn the TV. You know the rest of the story, right? The evil man will die and Kate will be the only survivor. But even if you watch this movie to the end, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> ... and if you want to shift anxiety to the next level, do what I did after watching this movie: leave the cinema on a dark night, go to the next subway station and take the last train home ...
