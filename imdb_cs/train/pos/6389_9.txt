The transfer of stones is definitely one of the best comedic independent films ever. You have a sense of humor to enjoy this. For some reason, this movie did not get its credit. First, let's start with the story, everyone loves a good treasure hunt. When a dead father leaves letters for advice about a hidden treasure, it brings not only two families, but a whirling adventure begins. They mix with a Polish translator, a comatose mother, a broken head with turret syndrome, twisted homosexual hypnotist, and one dear queen that money not only makes the world but can turn the family into enemies. My favorite character in this movie would have to be a sister / crack addict with tower syndrome, her sudden blast will cry you and imitate for weeks.
