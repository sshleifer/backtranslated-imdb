I love this movie. My only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed. It is true that Frank Sinatra does not have the chance to sing so much in this movie, but it's also nice that it's not just another Frank Sinatra movie where he usually does singing. Actually, I thought it was better to use Marlon Brando's own voice because he had a voice that fits in, and I did not see anyone with this great voice that made the gangster feel his voice. Stubby Kaye's "Sit Down, You Rockin 'ship" is a foot-tappin', singing-long that I just love. It's a tough action that will follow with its version and I still like its best. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is excellent in this section and "Adelaide's Lament" is my favorite of her songs. <br /> <br /> I really thought Jean Simmons was perfect for this part. Maybe I would not have seen it first, but when I saw it in that part it made sense. Michael Kidd's choreography is timeless. If it had been reworked in 2008, I should not change anything. <br /> <br /> I found out that many times something was lost from the stage version of the movie version, but it kept the feel of the scene, even when it was on the film. I thought the movie was well occupied. I played in regional versions and it's one of my favorite periods.
