Farrah Fawcett is excellent in this powerful 1986 drama, starring Marjorie, a woman who can escape the links of a potential assailant. Well done by Farrah for the Golden Globe nomination "Best Actress". When her friendly Joe (proudly playing James Russo) comes to her home, sharing with her two roommates (who are comfortably out!), Marjorie has to play along with Joe's terrifying demands. When her roommates come home, they are overwhelmed by Marjorie's actions and the great performance of Alfred Woodard, who desperately tries to convince Marjorie to do the right thing and turn him into the police, makes the film even more nail biting. I think Diana Scarwid is quite irritating, but when Joe finally admits that he came there to kill them, it makes the movie a very emotional piece of drama really. Overall, Extremities is a greatly thought out and well-played movie and I have been watching it for hundreds of time! Good work for all involved.
