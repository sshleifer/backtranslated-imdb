There has been a lot of crap out of Hollywood recently. <br /> <br /> My girlfriends still make movies as a surprise, it's amazing. <br /> <br /> He could not stop watching, it's a drama, but with a strange intervention. Imagine that Romeo, like Shakepear, had a great performance. It's sad and poetic at the same time. Hollywood should take note of the new Russian cinema, tell stories that do not relate to big explosions and cgi. It is a simple basic premise and tells a story without a spectacle. This is much like an Asian film with a dark Russian twist. I realized it was not perfect, but nothing was wrong. You know what power is, but it is never explained or fully realized until the end. It becomes a secondary aspect of the story's emotions. I do not want to see the remake, it's too cold as it is, the Hollywood system would slow down as usual. Efficiency is the pinnacle all around. Direction and camera work are far above most of the crap that are out there. Kudos to all involved and I will bring a lot of people to this independent epic. A +++++ <br /> <br /> If you can find it, watch it.
