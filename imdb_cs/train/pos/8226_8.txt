We are talking about a low budget and it is understandable that there are certain weaknesses (no spoilers: one sudden expert on explosives and one insignificant alcoholic); but in general your story is always interested, most characters are nice and there are some original situations. <br /> <br /> I really like movies that will surprise you with some people who are not the one they want you to believe, then turn and turn the plot ... This time I'm glad. <br /> <br /> If you know what I mean, try to see the movie "Nueve Reinas" (Nine Queens) from Argentina.
