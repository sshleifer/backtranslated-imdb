I love this movie, Jouvet, Arletta, Blier, Carna ... almost everything was already told about the film, but there's one detail I'd like to cast some light: no shots of a real, still-standing Hotel du Nord I've heard that it's supposed to be destroyed ...) was used for the movie - the whole scene was rebuilt to the set, the main reason is that they could not stop the St Martin channel for several weeks.
