Great movie. The negotiations - from the doctor to the artistic walkway to the prostitute, with very few exceptions, were amazing; I thought that soni razdan (mrs.noble) and vrajesh hirjee (saurabh) were the best of lesser known actors. Even Kurush Deboo (Tehmul), who could be accused of overturning, was quite credible and well-known. Another great thing to do was work with the camera - and the way she captured the energy of Bombay streets, a gusta calm that said his prayers and life inside the tiny apartments. I liked the story of the wall that will become a shrine and then it decays - and the philosophical artists will accept it. <br /> <br /> It's great to see good movies on Indian themes.
