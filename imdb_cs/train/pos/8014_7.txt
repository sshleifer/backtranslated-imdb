But if you like muppets, I resist you not to like this. Basically, the same plot regurgitated (this time New York, not LA) is equipped with lots of camera fun and muppet hi-jinx. Many muppets leave the movie very soon because they focus around Kerma and Miss Piggy. It happened to me that I enjoyed it very much. Fun tracking with your kids.
