LAUREL & HARDY Comedy Short. The boys come to sweep the chimneys in the house of Professor Noodle, a mad scientist who perfected his rejuvenation serum. Stan & Ollie continue their DIRTY WORK, expanding destruction inside the house and on the roof. Then the professor wants to try out his new elixir ... <br /> <br /> Very fun little movie. The end is somewhat sudden, but much of what leads to it is amazing. Especially good is that Stan & Ollie has a will on the opposite ends of the chimney. That's Professor Lucien Littlefield.
