"day time is over" is an incredible picture. in some respects it is better than a "close encounter of the third kind". (I prefer raw independent moves with a big budget.) Special effects are bizarre, but that's a big part of the fun. davis gives them excellent performance in this movie. it's probably one of the best roles he ever had. The musical score is very good. the story does not make sense. BUT THAT IT IS ONLY ALL MORE INTRIGUING. Like many of the best works of art, "day time is over" is not afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. "day time has ended" can be a low budget indie film, but it is not too much to compare with "existential" European films of the 1950s and 1960s. (many of which were low budgets themselves).
