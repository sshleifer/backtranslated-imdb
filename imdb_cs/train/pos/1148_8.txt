It's one of those movies - like Dave, an American dreamer and a local hero - that keeps the audience interested again and again. Light films seldom win Oscars, but one who casts a cast on Soapdish deserves one. Even after someone has seen the movie and knows what's coming, it's still nice to watch the different aspects of the fences evolve. True, all drama is melodrama; but it is perfectly suited for a film with a soap opera background. My favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: "Why can not I write like this?" I think it is unfortunate that television and censors of the website insist on this unnecessary hygiene.
