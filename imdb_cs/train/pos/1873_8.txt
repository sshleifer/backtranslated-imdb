Violent and rebellious 25-year-old sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) is sent to three sessions for evaluation with the naval psychiatrist Dr. Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington) after another explosion and aggression against a superior sailor. Reluctant at the beginning of treatment, he gains confidence in Dr. Davenport and reveals his childhood and reveals the painful traumas generated in his foster home. Meanwhile, she meets Cheryl Smolley (Joy Briant) and they love each other. Solving his personal problems, Antwone becomes a new man. This real family drama is the touch and positive story of a person who finds a friend and is sent back to everyday life. The direction of Denzel Washington is excellent, it is sensible, attractive and with good taste, a story about child abuse. In the hands of another director, this can be a very difficult story. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): 'Voltando and Viver' ('Return to Life')
