I loved this film since its debut in 1981! I lost track of how many times I saw it! It never makes me laugh or enthusiastic when I feel. The three guides are fantastic and the script is invaluable, plus how will you not become a nostalgic hearing of the thematic song? I think I quote this movie without realizing it. I basically know the entire script, so when someone watches it for the first time, I have to stick back to saying something about how funny the next line is. I can not even narrow down, though Sir John's figure probably gets the most memorable. The famous "I will alert the media" when Arthur announces that he is interested in bathing is still invaluable, but the list is really endless. The scene at Arthur's soon to be a father's fianc√© is a scream, especially his lottery interaction. Make a favor and see this movie!
