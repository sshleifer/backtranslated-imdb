I like this movie. Andy Griffith did not see his age, and he felt perfectly suited to this role. I put him in a comedy, but I'm glad he's ubiquitous. I was not worried that Dotty's "anxiety disorder" might not be literally a psychiatric textbook. There are zillions of anything-phobia and neurosis, and they can accept a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative forms. She is clearly sensitive to extra-sensory powers, as understood by local Indians, but no one else Anglos. No wonder this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric. Although it is a light "family film," it is more sophisticated than it seems. Also, Hiram's twist at the end seemed like a pleasant surprise, and all the previous events were tied together in a bundle. It is fun to think of the possibility of such spiritual guidance.
