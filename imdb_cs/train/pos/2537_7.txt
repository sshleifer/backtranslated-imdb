Boris and Bela work well in this film, whether they are against each other or go to the same ship. I saw it in 1972 and just bought it from the borders of this year. This time I watched with children, I took note of two things: drew attention to 3, 4 and 5 years; and I caught a few things I did not have when I first watched them. A very fast story with an unpredictable end. Must for film lovers !!!
