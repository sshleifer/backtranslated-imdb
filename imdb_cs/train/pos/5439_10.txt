Apparently a film that had a big influence not only on the genre of a friend but also on the action genre. George Lucas had to be a fan of this film, because so many of his Star Wars series seem to be the honor of Gung Din. The characters played by Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks are just the predecessors of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca. Even Sam Jaffe Gung Din has turned into C-3PO and R2-D2 and like him or not: Jar Jar Binks. Today, this movie is considered a non-PC, but there is a speech by Eduardo Ciannelli as the Guru leader of the Indian opposition to the British paradise that could be repeated in today's days. <br /> <br /> The young boy was a great movie. Three powerful men are leading and just a hint of romance. It was a time when young boys thought the kissing of a girl on a Saturday matinee movie was just humming. Not as today, when more skin is pleased. Too late to lament the lost innocence. Hopefully, this movie will not be forgotten and some who are surfing the channels will stop at TCM and catch a movie with action, adventure, and casting thousands of CGI actors.
