I did not expect much, and to be honest, this movie did not like me for the first time, but I looked back at him again and realized it was a bit cool. Sure, it's a joke movie, but it's a funny gag. Someone posted that it could be better written and it could be. I think this movie had the potential to be superior to my cousin Vinny. But with a host of horror instead of a lawyer. Unfortunately, this is an unnecessary opportunity. With a little writing it could be a classic. Children are not being used enough, there is no reason why they should get to Elvira. Except for obvious reasons. It would be great to see their relationship flourish. I know it's a comedy, but there are few differences that separate good movies from brilliant. <br /> <br /> Elvira is always fun and attractive. Not to mention flirting. Every time he smiles, you will. It's hard to knock a movie when the main character is so charming. And it's really her magic, do not let her think you think there's a cake. Well that is. But she's pretty. The kind of person you care about your kids. He would not let them cook, though ... <br /> <br /> I recommend that I do it. <br /> <br /> Just do not expect too much. <br /> <br /> It's more than just a great set of breasts. It's also an incredible pair of legs.
