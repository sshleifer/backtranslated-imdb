Well, Tenko is undoubtedly the best British TV show ever, performances, direction, casting, tension, drama ..... all is fantastic. a little later in the final season, this final movie picked up the rolls nicely and had a great story for show fans and novices. I can not recommend this movie anymore, find it and watch it. But I recommend watching the series first, because the first 2 seasons are even better than this fantastic movie. Obvious (10/10)
