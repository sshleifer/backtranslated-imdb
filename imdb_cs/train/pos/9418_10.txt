I've been filming this movie for years and I saw it again this morning (when I was waiting for my laundry - as ironic!) Mainly because I once again wanted to hear Benjamin Franchell's title music. Finally, I sat down around the first half hour, willing to make a great assurance of direction, writing, and performance. The film is like any of the 50s of British stars: Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lamont, and especially Ernest Thesiger, great as a dry old giant of textile mills. Not to mention Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood, not the characters as such, but the charming, charismatic leadership. It's science fiction in its purest form and droll comedy as well. Classical classic, and I hope no one ever tries to revive!
