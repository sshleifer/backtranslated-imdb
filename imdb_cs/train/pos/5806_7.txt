If you see this movie, you know you will see an extensive music video clip. But you'll find more. Unbelievable FX, great music and a pleasant time to enjoy with kids. If you compare this movie, you have to remember it's pop extravagance. Clips of "Man in Mirror", "Leave me alone", "Smooth Criminal" and "Come Together" by Beatles.
