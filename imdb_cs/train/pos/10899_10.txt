During this movie I laughed so much that my face ached. Ben Affleck was cheerful and reminded me of a pretty child Jack Black in this role. Gandolfini gives his typical performance A. The entire cast is fun, the story is pretty good and the comic moments are amazing. I went to this movie without waiting so much, and that's why I was so surprised to start off that I was very happy and faint. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy, be able to stand apart during holidays and / or meet relatives. The best part of this film (just like me) was the fine pieces of humor that completely concealed me and I had to laugh a long time after the rest of the audience stopped. In particular, a scene including Christmas Tree Lighting. Go for it and try to laugh!
