Mitchell Leisen is the fifth feature of the director, and he shows his versatility by managing musical, after his previous films were heavy drama. He also plays as conductor buddy. <br /> <br /> You can say it's a pre-code movie, and nothing like that was made in the US for some time after (like 30 or more years). Leisen recorded the musical numbers to resemble what viewers would see - no wide-angle images from the Busby Berkeley album. What I find fun or interesting is that you will never see the audience. As others mentioned, leaders are utterly devoid of letters, and Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan play their normal movies. Gertrude Michael, however, provides some sparks. The musical numbers are interesting and some good (Rhapsody's special rape is fun), but the drama was not fake and false - the three murders are too many and have a minimal emotional impact on the characters. This is where this movie could be much better.
