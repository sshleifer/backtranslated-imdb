Have you ever read Jim Thompson? It's a stubborn noir with the most frequent fatalism and misanthropy I've ever encountered. In his work seldom private detectives - only losers, psychologists, and little cheaters. This movie has Thompson loaded - "If God made any real mistakes in this world, it was that he gives us the will to live if we do not have an excuse for it." Each figure in the film balances at the edge of the razor between unreal and haunting realism. There's a dirty, captivating Uncle Bud playing Bruce Dern and George Goldman and Doc Goldman. Jason Patric gives a beautiful, often heartfelt scream like Kid Collins, a not too bright, shy former warrior who is more afraid of himself than someone else. Rachel Ward is Fay, a sexy femme fatale that we can not completely invent ... It's not your standard film noir, it's not meant to be. After Dark My Sweet along with The Grifters there are two great novel adaptations by one of my favorite writers Jim Thompson.
