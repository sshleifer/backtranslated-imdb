Ulysses as a film should by no means be compared to a novel because they are two completely different entities. However, it is said that the film still retains many of the elements that made the book of work, but because it is a visual medium, it is harder to pull the flow-consciousness. I think it's the best movie they could make with this material ... and it's from somebody who routinely talks about movies that are not like their literary counterparts. I recommend the book, but the movie is still fun.
