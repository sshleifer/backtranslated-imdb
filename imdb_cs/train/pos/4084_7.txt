I think it's some kind of reworking or updating "Beauty and the Beast," but I can not say I've ever been watching a movie that started with a few minutes of a graphic horse. Wow. Anyway, it looks like a young woman and her ... a girl? You have traveled to this castle in France where the married son of the castle owner is to be the man who takes care of the horses to reach their rocks. It seems there are legends in this area of ​​beasts that were more, uh, whispering, I think you could say with ladies or at least one. There are all sorts of links tucked away in this regard, but every time an early-to-be-blushing young bride gets her curious little hands on one groom's father she will remove it from her perspective. By the way, the young bride goes upstairs while the family waits for a cardinal to go on a wedding (according to my family member) and when she dreams she dreams of a beast in a forest that has her with her. The effects in this situation are a bit desirable, and any attempt at eroticism (not that I know too much about it) is a little laughing, especially when some selected pendants seem as realistic as beds or baseball bats. It has a somewhat strange and sudden, yet twisted end, without even doing it, because it was a good fit, but it was quite appropriate and definitely not what I expected. I do not know, it's a bit difficult to go through, but it has its moments and it's definitely weird. 7 out of 10.
