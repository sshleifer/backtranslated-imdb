If you're a fan of film noir and you think they do not do it like that, it's your answer - you just do not do it in Hollywood. We have to turn to the French to remember how satisfying, gentle and amazing a good film of this genre can be. Read My Lips is a wonderful little gift for the faithful from director Jacques Audiard with sharp narratives and subtle performances by Emmanuelle Devosa and Vincent Caselle. The basic plot could have been written in the 1940s: stupid but attractive ex-con and intelligent, but dowdy femme fatale (who prove to be ruthlessly ambitious) appear each other when they live the lives of desperate despair and desire, manipulate each other to fulfill their own goals, develop a complex relationship of love and hatred, a criminal scheme involving robbery, double crosses, close calls and a lot of money. All actions take place in tricky, dirty and / or ill-illuminated places. <br /> <br /> Of course, Audiard has made some modern changes. Femme fatale is an underestimated office that is almost deaf and uses its ability to read lips to avenge those who marginalize it. And where you could expect to have loving scenes, you will find that both characters are sexually clumsy and immature. Add some modern technology and music and it looks like a contemporary movie, but do not make any mistake - it's an old movie noir. It's as good as any film of this genre, and it's one of the best movies I've ever seen all year.
