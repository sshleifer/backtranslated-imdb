Finally, I met the infamous "ice age". Besides, he may not have been as sad as I hoped that after seeing the brilliant journal, it's not the bad word I can say. Sure, it's not as charming as Disney's production (besides, it's Fox's first attempt at a full-length CG movie), but he has a huge heart and on some occasions (like a look in Manfred's eyes when we see a sad look at his past) my tears continue. But when they meet the baby's father I could not hold them. A film that has no trouble walking on a thin line of sapples and clich√©s and can bring more than the best of it; the end result is one of the most moving animated creations I've ever seen. Great funny characters that grow fast (and great voice talents too) and many funny memorable scenes, especially from Scrat's name, make the film more than enough to do it. Plus Dodo scene, which is my personal favorite funny scene of 2002. I honestly do not get it, but for some reason it really looks like CG animation will be in the future. But if it just means that there will be more films like this (and who can forget about Pixar's creations), then I really do not mind, at least for now. 9/10
