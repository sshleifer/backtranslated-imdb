He is a modest, comedic comedy starring in Brazil with a low budget. The premise is known as well as in Danny Kay's 1950 film. ** In Court **: someone who, as a joke, has the impression of a famous person is then gifted to be a true person. <br /> <br /> The contrast between the two wires is highly efficient. Raul Julia as a German Parador secret policeman is tall, cold, threatening and Latin. He delivers deliberately blond working colors. Richard Dreyfus, animated, short, Jewish New York, is fun and compassionate. There are many links and jokes about show business. <br /> <br /> The setting is clearly modeled on Paraguay. Paraguay was indeed ruled by Gen Alfred Stroessner, a non-elected military dictator whose father emigrated from Germany, from the early 1950s until the end of the 1980s.

Furthermore, in this sense, Mazursky cast comics Jonathan Winters as an American retired, who in truth is C.I.A. the head of the station in Parador, and the figure so strong he can give the country president a frantic outfit. <br /> <br /> In fact, the US has little influence in Paraguay, which is largely free of social and racial tensions that has appeared elsewhere in the region. This is due to the fact that in the 19th and 20th century it struggled against long and costly wars against much larger neighbors. The male population was almost exterminated, but the society that emerged was patriotic, racially homogeneous and heavily united. <br /> <br /> On the next level, feminism appears in the form of a Madonna character. It is played by Brazilian actress Sonia Braga, Madonna is a former nightclub dancer who is a pregnant girl at the start of the film but is seen on TV as the president at the end - now politically and cosmetically correct, without makeup, drove to the office with a velvet revolution . Once, such an event took place in Latin America, the administration of the Argentinean Isabel Peron (a non-beloved Evita who never maintained the function) insisted. two years after the death of her husband, the legendary ** supremo ** Juan Peron.
