This is a very dramatic and exciting film. There are many drawings and turns. The story or director opens question marks about death or alleged crimes committed by black people. This film is very well controlled by Arne Glimcher and the gentle sound of James Newton Howard is excellent. Strong performance by Sean Connery and Ed Harris. If you like, do not miss "TRUE CRIMES" or "THE HURRICANE". My wife and I gave 8/10.
