Hard to Categorize Movie - Perhaps it's an avant-garde spy thriller? Mother Night is a very good novel by Vonnegut, and certainly one of his simplest novels that adapts to feature film. The film adaptation is very original. Indie's approach to how this movie was produced is probably far more effective than its funding by a large Hollywood studio. Nowadays I doubt an intelligent novel like Mother's Night would sometimes get the green light from big Hollywood blockbusters. And this is usually bad, but not in this case. Mother Night has a firm direction and a fixed cast. Nick Nolte, who seems to get a better role when he gets old, still has "every" persona who lets him take a wide range of different characters. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and great as ever. I always thought she deserved better than she got out of the entertainment industry. I think your debut as a Twin Peaks with little time to play is not the most appropriate of the roles, even if the TV show becomes a minor phenomenon. Anyway, this movie is absolutely nice and you do not have to read a book to understand the movie. In fact, given today's geopolitical reality, the novel's hypothesis may well be dated, and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be totally confused by the events that are evolving (I speak to you, to Americans who are students and record the lowest industrialized world in geography, history and master knows what other items!).
