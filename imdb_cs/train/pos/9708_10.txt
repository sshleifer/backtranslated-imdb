I have never seen this program, although it has been highly recommended by my family members. I'm sorry that my girlfriend lives in Hadfield (instead of filming) and pointed to a couple of landmarks when I first visited. That brought me an interest, so I bought the 1st series on the video and sat down on my watch. Besides recognizing some places, I found myself in the least surprised. The BBC was again responsible for another example of the best comedy in the world. TLOG can easily fit with Red Dwarf, Fawlty Towers and Monty Python as probably the best. <br /> <br /> Just tell me I'm addicted to the program now. The characters are excellent and show an unusual depth, while retaining a terribly realistic edge. The look and feel of the program are perfect and sometimes reflect a grim feeling in the north (I do not think of Hadfield, which I found a very nice and warm place). I hope it will continue the originality during its run (which is based on the second series that ended yesterday's rerun in the UK, it surely is). Well done BBC!
