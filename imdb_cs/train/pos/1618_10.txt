This movie is great in every respect. It touches the complexity of loving relationships in a meaningful way, but never lectures. The screenplay never shows any character, nor the unfortunate Johnny. It also benefits from spot-on direction, production design, casting and performance. The fact that Cher is so perfect in the movie and is more than "Cher" than she ever was is a miracle for me. I look at Moonstruck at least once a year and I saw her again on this Christmas evening with my 16-year-old twins and he loved it too. It has something for everyone with a heart and at the end will fill you with joy.
