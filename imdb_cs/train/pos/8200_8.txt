Clint Eastwood definitely produced better movies than this, but that does not make him worry. Dirty Harry takes everyone's attention, and if one does not want to watch romance, there's no reason why he will not like it. It's fine because it's dirty, it's great because it kills without big thought, it's perfect because it gets a bullet across your heart and a hero because it does not care. From what I have seen in Eastwood's films, the nature of the lead role always captures the audience. In White Hunter Black, he is a crazy director, he is "old" in a "fiery line", while he is "almost" out of work, that is, doing work for himself, he does not care for one of his superiors who practically send him on holiday. Based on the victim of rape, this film promises to all movie observers who do not make sense. The film has nothing to turn away from the central conspiracy. However, what is a little worse than Eastwood's better films is that although the character of the lead role is breathtaking, the story is not because it is too obvious from the beginning. This is not a movie that makes you sit on the spot without moving. There are too many people far dirtier than Dirty Harry.
