It is true that the idea for this TV series can come from the huge success that Ally McBeal enjoys all over the world, even here in Germany. However, this said, Edel & Starck is very different from Ally McBeal in many ways. The two main characters work together beautifully together. Felix Edel (Felix Noble), starring famous German actor, Christoph M. Ohrt and Sandra Starck (Sandra Strong - Noble & Strong, Get It Out), played charming Rebecca Immanuel, swapping fast romantic repartees and constantly spying on each other , while dealing with crimes similar to sitcoms in Berlin and its surroundings. It is also helped by the magnificent cast of stars, most notably their secretary played by Isabel Tuengerthal, a precious jewel with great comic potential. Also the shadowy Otto stroller and the noble child friend Felix Frank work very well, do not forget about Sandru's best friend and friend, Patricia, played by beautiful Barbara Demmer. <br /> <br /> Everything-all-the-joy to watch on Monday nites: no wonder the series and its stars have won several awards. Will Felix get Sandra? I hope we will have to wait for the next episodes to find out ......
