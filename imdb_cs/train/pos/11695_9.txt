It's such a great movie! It does not matter on the low rating. I really do not know where it comes from then she has to discuss another movie. Because I totally loved it and found it to be a hidden treasure. <br /> <br /> It's a story so original and charming .. I really can not think of anything wrong to say about it. Perhaps it must be "your type of thing", but I saw it with my sister and mother and we all accepted it. <br /> <br /> Negotiation was also very good, and it's hard to do in a movie like this one. But all the characters I found were very interesting and sympathetic. <br /> <br /> I always liked Dougray Scott and found his new '' dark '' role very interesting. It's really hard to get me to act like a bad guy, but this time I absolutely had no problem with it. I adored him even more. Anyone who loves a good thriller / drama, which also has a good dose of love and tragedy, should definitely go into this movie, not at all! Anyone who wanted to see a movie with 80% bloodshed should borrow something else, though .. But I think the title is already far away. This is a love story, not Saw 3. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4 of the five stars !!! Good work! <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
