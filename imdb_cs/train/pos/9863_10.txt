I thought Ice Age was an excellent movie! As a 30-year-old woman, without children, I seem to be looking forward to these humorous, humorous animated films. Sid is the best character I've ever seen, better than Bartok in Anastasia (though he was really humorous and I did not think his figure could be even or even beaten) and even more humorous than Melman in Madagascar. I have seen the film at least 15 times (I own it of course) and quote the film at work (on many occasions ... yes, still). My favorite scene is where Sid says, "Oh, oh, oh, I love this game!" and Sid and Manny continue to find out what the squirrel is trying to tell about "tigers" ... "Set of wolves, teddy bear, flea package, beard pack, nose pack, derm pack, luggage pack, trouble pack, wallpaper, bird pack , a package of flying fish ... "or that's what it is! This is the most fun part of the whole movie, although I really enjoyed the humor of "putting lanes on the map" and many other parts. The only animated movie that can be compared to Ice Age is "Bear Bear".
