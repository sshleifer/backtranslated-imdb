I have to be honest, I expected such a bad failure because it sounded like they were trying to dip the original film to get the money. But this was not the case with this really fun (sometimes strange) movie. I loved telling the story of Timon and Pumba, the Simba story and his sleeping problem was fun. Whirlpool bubble and when Pumba leaves, the bubbles stop. It's harmless fun, good for kids and some adults. I think this movie will take a while, because it's pretty good for a movie on DVD and DVD. While the movie seems a bit weird and a kind of track towards the end, it works. 8 out of 10
