Without "mental anachronism," this film, which I would like to find on DVD, offers an extraordinary scuba diving in the life and mental context of people's thinking before "disillusioning the world." It's thirty years, the director and writer of scripts could try one such empathy and such a romantic truth as to leave the masterpiece of it stunning. It would be necessary to see and re-examine it in order to better understand the time and cultural distances, to lose the ability to be understood / analyzed, to analyze, and ultimately to accept such or such an example of "primitive thinking." Because this idea, which maintains almost impossible feelings in the secularized world, contains some keys to our behavior that will be able to analyze only future generations with sufficient relevance. If anyone knows where I then get a digital copy or VHS to me or DVD? Thanks in advance.
