The young and seemingly promising school graduate (played by Blair Underwood) is sent to prison for the murder of an innocent young girl and sentenced to death. Sean Connery plays a "happy lucky" lawyer whom the young man's grandmother watches from retirement and asks to take the case in the hope of freeing her grandson. Laurence Fishburne plays a police officer who was well involved in this case, and hell is determined to reject the theory that Connery could kick off to try and free the boy he and the entire police department swear he is guilty of. Ed Harris, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and Late Lynne Thigpen play in this very intense dramatic thriller.
