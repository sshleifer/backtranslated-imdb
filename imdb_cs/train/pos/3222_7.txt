The first two sequences of the film created two conflicts: thematic - the conflict between Todd's soldier and his suppressed humanity and physical - the conflict between Todd and his biological engineering replacement. Both sequences are quite fascinating in different ways. <br /> <br /> The folk scenario will recede a little by solving the first of these arcs half way through the film, which means the other half is a little more than a straightforward action. <br /> <br /> However, where do the creators create a genre action piece with a heart and even a little soul, and especially Kurt Russell, who has very little. <br /> <br /> It's not a great movie, but it's worth seeing.
