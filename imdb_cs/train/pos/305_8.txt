Screwball comedy about romantic disagreements in New York. Peter Bogdanovič is obviously in love with all the women in his film - he's worshiping them - but Audrey Hepburn (naturally) gives a notch over the others because, after all, she is Princess Bogdanovičová, who probably fell in love with films Thirty years ago. She shoots her in loving detail, gets straight into the sheets between her and the extremely hard / soft cooked Ben Gazzara and allows her room to sparkle all over. The love of the filter is fast and fun, even though I've made my face from John Ritter's television slingshot. Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and the earthly, earthy-sensual Patti Hansen are all exciting to watch. But it's really Hepburn's valentine, and she's shining. *** z ****
