I really liked Antz, but he loved "Bug's Life". The animation that was inserted into it has paid off. I will definitely have it on DVD. By the way, Disney should make a wide-screen version of this movie on tape. (I have heard that all characters are on screen in standard video format). Most will have to agree that the final credits were the most fun! I saw only one of two sets, but I can not see the other!
