As a native of Bolton, this film is an obvious challenge to me. Location shots are fascinating and show that Bolton is very transient - there are a number of obvious neglect scenes, but it shows that the city has been rebuilt - and the idea that the old one has to retreat to the new one is right in the heart of this film. Slightly dirty James Mason leads a pleasant ensemble in the story of an uproar over a slew that spiraling into a full-fledged generation conflict, then it is a pleasant schmaltz solution. Although I'm too young to remember it, there are all the details of life in Lancashire in the 1960s: Friday's making, piano songs, Sunday constitution, good neighborliness, anxiety of affection, massive importance of self-esteem, and I was pleased, that I see Naughton's most fun lines from the game that has remained untouched. There is no doubt that this movie should be available on DVD - it is well-created and most of the performances are well done.
