In today's digital world of production, there is no computer that could replace actors and writers. Unfortunately, this type of movie "driven by nature" is nowadays too rare. Duval's performance and James Earl Jones are loyal to the high expectations of their audience. I wonder if this movie was made for television? It has "close" personal qualities for narration. It's an understatement that says the performances are all Outstanding. The only thing that keeps her like the Masterpiece cinema is the lack of a great cameraman, but pretty pictures are not all. How can talent like Jones and Duvall continue to produce such subtle work at the age when actors act as digitizers?
