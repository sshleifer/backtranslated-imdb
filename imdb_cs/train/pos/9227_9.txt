Post-feminist depiction of suffering and sadism. <br /> <br /> Spoiler alert! This understated jewel of the film tells the story of Flavia, a girl of the early fifteenth century, who was born in a monastery, after defining her father and indeed a whole medieval Christian society, looking at the fallen Islamic warrior as a human rather than a demonic figure. It is impossible to accept the patriarchal rule of the monastery (explicitly mentioned in the scene where the bishop arrives accompanied by soldiers and monks) Flavia begins to explicitly question the society in which it finds itself, and by relying on the whole system of deception, repression and violence inevitably brings a tragic end but to everyone around her. far from the truth. This is a film depiction of the consequences of violence, the effects of patriarchal dominance, the nature of the insurrection and the corruption of the human spirit. In the title of this work I described it as post-feminist, "and in the end Flavia's triumphs must always be damaged, threatened and overturned by men. Even the dreadful end of Flavia is committed by men for men (women are turned away and only monks gaze without horror. This is an illustration of the effects of violence and the horror of a world crazy religious surplus that would reduce the impact of the film, reduce the film, and allow it to be assimilated in the patriarchal discourse it exposes, plus a realistic portrait. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot, greatly acting (notably Florinda Bolkin and Maria Casares) that feature great scoring and still demanding after all these years, Flavia is a classic European cinematography.
