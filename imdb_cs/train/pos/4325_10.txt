This version of Bleak House is the best adaptation of the classic novel I know. Representation of Chancery's court as a "character" in the drama is magnificent. Actor's acting is amazing, from the ominous Tulkinghorn to the Dedlocks, Smallweed, Crooke, Miss Flyte and two young lovers. But it's a spider that keeps the whole thing together, and the cinematography is excellent. What is the BBC's copyright mistake, which means that this version has not been seen in the UK, the video or the DVD for many years? I tried to find out, but faced the stone walls. Eventually I got a DVD from Canada.
