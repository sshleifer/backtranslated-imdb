A great movie and a great example of how it can be a haunted film without showing the viewer anything. It's a set of four floors that rotate around the tenants of an ancient house and their terrible and terrifying fates that are linked by the story of Inspector Scotland Yard looking for a missing horror star. It begins with the story of a mysterious writer whose main character becomes a bit too realistic, followed by a story of two old romantic rivals who become obsessed with a wax figure in the museum, then the story of a sweet little angelic little child who is nothing else, and closing a story about what happened to the missing movie star and what she does to the inspector. It's an amazing press that will truly allow you to appreciate Duffel's work and what he has achieved with a very small budget. Add Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Denholm Elliott, Joss Ackland, Ingrid Pitt and Jon Pertwee as well as a movie that you can enjoy again and again. Do not accept the phone if someone from Stoker Real Estate invites you to offer an advantage to a beautiful house in the English countryside?
