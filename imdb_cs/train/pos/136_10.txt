This movie is a great way to finally end the series. Peter (puppeteer master III) has grown up and is now a puppeteer. Well, this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn Toulon's secret, but instead listens to the story of the meadows. Most of this movie is footage of Puppet Master II, Puppete III, Puppet 4, Puppete 5, Curse of the Puppeteer and Retro puppeteer (I'm sorry ... But I think Paramount would not let them use the scenes of 1). Personally I wish Puppet Master Vs. Demonics toys would eventually be made, but the way this film ends, basically say, "This is the final movie in the series ..."
