This episode is a bit confusing. Some people say you have to start right from the beginning, but I have to say that I was a little confused from the beginning! Clark gets a blow to the head and wakes up on the floor of the Fairview Mental Institution and makes fun because he believes he is a superhero. Clark says the life he knew was all in his head. Abuse. She also finds some things that are unusual: Martha married Lionel; Lex is bound to a wheelchair with his limbs cut off after his accident on the bridge; and Lana is dedicated to Clark. But he finds one acquaintance; someone else who is dedicated to Clark: Chloe. He also found that the mental patient is also from the well-known Smallville world. And the doctor is a Phantom Zone striker. <br /> <br /> This episode reminds me right back to Buffy's episode, "Normal Again," where Buffy begins to have vivid sleepiness about psychic asylum. The doctor tried to convince her that everything she knew was the result of her fantasy and that she was actually crazy. Her parents still married, they still lived in LA, her friends did not exist, Angel was never her friend, and she did not have a sister named Dawn. Demons and vampires also did not exist. Both episodes are a little sad because doctors not only tell the characters that it's all the fiction of her imagination but tells us what it is: fiction, and that brings us back to reality. But it's nice to have a feeling of reality after a while, but we watch these shows to escape reality. It's nice again, because the characters have to overcome the new challenges.
