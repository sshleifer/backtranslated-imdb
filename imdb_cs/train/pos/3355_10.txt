May 1938. Hitler in Italy. Preparations for a historical appointment with Mussolini. Emotions, tensions and forms of self-determination. an empty city, a housewife and a journalist. Meetings of two different worlds. Escape for a mother with a sad life. Short fulfillment of the classic sacrifice. The story of solitude and silence. The form of life and desire as a form of struggle. Great character - a book gifted in the spring afternoon. This film is a poem, remarkable for art, which describes the shades of common loneliness. Promoting an unspeakable relationship with reality. And with your inner world. Pictures of Il Duce, Antonietta's clumsiness, patience and weakness Gabriele, the art of a director who makes sense to the scene of grace two great actors, makes this film noble, precious fine delicacies, a wonderful film about hypocrisy and any statement about the essence of life and repulsion of any tyranny . Loren and Mastroianni are masters of wonderful intelligent acting. Clear masterpiece.
