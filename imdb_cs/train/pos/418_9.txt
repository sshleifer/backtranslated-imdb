That's what's going on in the west, and I've been watching and playing it on every level. However, if the truths of such legends as Hickcock, Cody and Calamity Jane look elsewhere, as John Ford has suggested, the truth becomes a legend to print a legend. The story moves in a dark step and there is a large pair of very observable stars between Gary Coopter and Jean Arthur who help make this film. The sharp eyes between you could only find Gabby Hayes as an Indian Scout, and also a very young Anthony Quinn, who debuted as Warrior Cayenne, actually married one of the daughters Demilles in real life. The Quinns sign, which informs Cooper about Custer's massacre, and when the credits spin, joins the American West with American history. So please pay attention to this classic western.
