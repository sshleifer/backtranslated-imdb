Yeah, the poster is a pretty awful piece of work. I thought the movie was okay ... nothing really great ... I just hoped it would be hardcore druggie and totally spoil his life. <br /> <br /> Oh, but can not it become rich kids now? Not a wealthy merchant's son who has big party parties and has a nice lawn on the front of the mini castle. No ... the baby is too good for his life to be completely torn. After all, who will drive a brand new SUV and who will go to law school? <br /> <br /> Oh, poor little rich children ... in their quaint little house, with their schools of ivy baths, ultra-clean houses, and social parties ... what will the world do without them? I hope everyone gets to drugs, they give them life and end up in jail ... so maybe we can see movies that do not turn around the poor little rich boys and girls of the unreal world.
