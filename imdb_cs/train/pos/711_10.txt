"Rock 'n' Roll High School" will probably have to go down in history as the ultimate rebellious flick. Starting with a bunch of high school students who use Ramones' music as an inspiration to rise up against their despotic director (Mary Woronov, from the fame of "Eating Raoul"), the whole movie is miles per minute. It's basically a big excuse to have fun, and I'm sure you'll do it. Bullying guides? Control. Adult Music Teacher (Paul Bartel, also from "Eating Raoul" *)? Control. Exploding Mice? Mother. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is something that makes life alive. Even for someone like me who does not know Ramones music, it's pure pleasure. With director Roger Corman and Joe Dante co-director, how could we expect something less? It is a pity that director Allan Arkush later degenerated into prizes such as "Caddyshack II". Also played were PJ Soles, Vincent Van Patten, Clint Howard, Dey Young, Dick Miller (who appeared in each of Joe Dante's Movies and many Roger Corman's), Don Steele and of course Ramones. Real treatment. <br /> <br /> * It seems that Bartel and Woronov have always played together. They also starred at Joe Dante's "Hollywood Boulevard" and the "Cutting Mall" (also starring Dick Miller), starring in "Eating Raoul."
