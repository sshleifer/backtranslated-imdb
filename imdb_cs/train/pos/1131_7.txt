It's a really funny movie. One of those you can sit back and watch without hesitation as the conspiracy becomes more distorted; more and more funny. Sally Field, Teri Hatcher (in her heyday), Kevin Klein, Elisabeth Shue, Robert Downey, Jr ... All the well-known actors act as if they were the stars / producers of soap opera. If you've ever watched a soap opera and thought, "How did you get that idea?" LOVE this movie. I've seen it several times; and every time I look at her, the more I respect humor, the more I realize how well it works. Do not expect the quality of an Oscar. It's a fun movie that's fun, not some artistic attempt to find an "inner man," etc. Sit down, relax and laugh.
