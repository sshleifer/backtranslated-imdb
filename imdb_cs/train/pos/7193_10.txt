God! Zorro has been the subject of about as many films as Tarzan and probably has so many actors in the title role. <br /> <br /> This series is one of my personal favorites, and as I said, it's one of the TOP 5 audio series. It's a strange production that came out in 1939. * At the time of this production in 1939 Zorro was really known as a literary and film character (Pulp). The film opens with a brief remark about the history of the Mexican struggle for liberation from the rule of the European monarchy, namely Spain. The story welcomes the comparison with the American Revolutionary War. The story focuses on the mythical province of San Mendelito and her "advice". This is solved by Benite Juarez ** on the relationship of his gold mine to the new Republic of Mexico. Gold shipments must go to Mexico City. Don Francisco Uncle Diego Vega, says he has organized a group of patriots to act as a protective force for gold convoys. Oro crowd, will go on and challenge Don Francisca in a fight with swords and Don Frascisco escapes. Suddenly, the masked swordsman will appear in a sword struggle and after carving the mark "Z" on the face of a bad guy, he will take him down and Don Francisco declares with his dying breath Ramon (William Corson) that Zorro is his nephew from Los Angeles. is also telling about the true identity of Don del Oro but it expires before he completes the statement. There is a big reception for Diego at Hacienda in Don Francisco, where Diego disappoints Ramon'sister (also the department of Don Francisco ) With his shy act, "FOP !!", she declared, later Diego and Ramon slipped away and joined the volunteer meeting when asked: "Who will lead us with Don Francis now dead?" Ramon said, "Zorro, we are Zorro war legion! "Well, Legion is a big battle, now all dressed in gray, with masks and capes protecting the golden train, then it seems Zorro is trapped in a man-made bench for a convoy when, that the end of the first chapter is going on. That was a lot of writing for one chapter, but like most other series, the opening is longer and has plenty of ground to lay down to create a story line. Just say there are 11 other good, well done actions of filled chapters. <br /> <br /> ZORRO FIGHTING LEGION has all the elements that have created top-notch action. We have an unfamiliar leader of evil, which incites problems between different groups. There are a number of suspects who were really behind the mask of "Don del Oro". We had soldiers, white renegades, enemy Indians, and legion. In short, it is safe to say that there is everything you might want, and then some in this series. And by the way, they wisely decide that the actors will not affect any Mexican accents. As for what's here, which means ZFL from others? What is different or unique? Well ........ <br /> <br /> First it has a much more complicated and exciting music score and underlines drama and action on the screen. The opening theme even appears in the piano performance of the flamenco in Cantina in Chapter One. This is probably the only time that such highly specialized innovations appear in a serial soundtrack. And yet there is one more feature that actually sets the Saga Legion against all the others. This means that the movie has not only a heroic musical theme, but also sports Lyrics, yes, legionaries are singing! We hear them singing in the initial data and in several chapters! It really works well and adds to the feelings we get from viewing. When the series was first shown on our local television (around 1955), all gangs immediately recognized Reed Hadley's voice belonging to "Captain Braddock of RACKET SQUAD, a television series." Hadley had a very distinct and deep voice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Mendelito, since Juarez was about 18 years old at this time, and although he was later the greatest individual in the history of Mexico, it has certainly not been achieved so much so that his inclusion in the story was probably paid for the release of Warner Brothers JUAREZ that year that starred Paul Muni in the title This is not just my selection as the top 5 serials but also my favorite Zorro movie. <br /> <br /> * We remind you that the year with GONE WITH THE WIND, MR.SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, CITADEL, JUAREZ, THE WAZARD OF OZ, MONTHS AND MEN, ONE MILLION BC, ZENOBIA, We want our MUMMY to count all the performance year. <br /> <br /> ** Again, Juarez did not enter the national significance of 1850, about 25 years later. Also, political subdivisions are referred to as "provinces" in the story. In fact, they are called "States". Just as we call the United States of America, south of the border, they call their United Mexican States the United States. *** Reed Hadley was prominent in some very "A" pictures in which his rich toned voice is used to perform well. Watch and listen to his narrative at HOUSE ON 92nd STREET (1945) and GUADALCANAL DIARY (1945).
