Corny! I love it! Corny - just like television 40 years ago! Adam and Burt recall the same chemistry on the screen that has never stayed! Again, the old memories come to life, and the actors who have played them since the 1960s show some backstage things that are quite interesting. Televisions from the 1960s were so cruel for so many of us, and this DVD is no exception when you are familiar with the original TV show. Battle scene with Boofs and Bams or what's fantastic! The cinema scene shows the clip of the dead who died. In the end, Frank Gorshin will appear. Soon I was gone as soon as this DVD was made, I think it is his great merit that he returned to Adam and Burt again, much like Batman and Robin many years ago. He did not lose his touch! Thanks to Julia Newmar who lives again like a villain, too. Finally, I think this DVD is great memories and I would like to thank both Adam and Burt for coming back and remembering these memories for those of us who remember the original - !!! Thanks guys !!!
