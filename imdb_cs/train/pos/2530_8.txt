One of the pleasures of lifting the recent collection of Bela Lugosi is to see beautiful films like the Invisible Ray. Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi are collaborating in a movie that submerges in meteorites and radiation, and while science is totally absurd (especially the Karloff camera technique, used by Janos Rukh to determine the location of a particular meteorite) and totally ridiculous, I did not care about renting, is absolutely pleasant. The effects are fine, the game is great and the surface is particularly strong. It reminds me of sci-fi comics and the novels of the forties and fifties, complete with rays and ridiculous science. You have to watch this movie!
