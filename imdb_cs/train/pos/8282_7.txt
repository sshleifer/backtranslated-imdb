** POSSIBLE SPOILS ** <br /> <br /> The biggest part of the movie that does not work is Wendigo and when your title character fails, your movie is usually not far behind. The artistic interpretation of Wendig's movie is interesting and can be rightly compromised when shot properly - for example, when a fugitive assassin sees Wendigo in the rearview mirror - and the tree form was actually very good. However, as a monstrous figure, it never really comes alive. We do not get much explanation for his behavior, and what we see from him does not start with the narrative narrated in the film itself or any Wendigo traditions I've ever read. <br /> <br /> I think one of the main reasons why the monster fails is that it's not enough in the movie. When you shoot this movie on bones, it's a passionate thriller with a bit of a supernatural element instead of a monster movie. Cinematography is good, though a bit cheesy; filmmakers use scenery, lighting, and daylight to get more atmosphere and mood. The character of Otis is really dangerous and unpredictable, making him a real monster in the movie. It could be more effective to explain his behavior, as the hungry Wendigo would keep him, which would also be a more accurate idea of ​​a real legend. I have heard unconfirmed reports (from the newsgroup) that the reason Wendigo does not do so is that when the monster was built, it wraps up so hard and uncomfortable (to imitate the stand standing on the hooves, the artist had to walk on his fingers) that it is almost impossible to run, walk or otherwise perform in it. So, many flashes of the creature of standing and obvious accelerated shots. I emphasize that these reports are not confirmed.
