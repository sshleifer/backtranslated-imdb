While on a plane that goes through a large selection of films, I came across Live! almost randomly. Oh no! what choice. I remembered seeing a trailer more than a year ago, and I forgot all that she was expecting nothing more than another bent, nonsensical movie about a silly reality show. Now I can easily say that it was hell. I do not remember being so excited, terrified. I'm not sure if it was high altitude by playing with my senses, but the tension is gradually developing through the movie until it reaches the peak when you can not turn away from the screen, literally sitting on the edge of your seat and biting the remaining nails " > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < then get to know the contestants, their motives and start guessing, then watch the competitor pull the trigger one by one and get enthusiastic, even if you know the first candidate is safe, good acting, good director, with a movie experience that reminds you of those old movies where you knew what would happen in the next scene but still longs for more. Spoilers * a few things that would ch changed: <br /> <br /> - casting contestants. I really had a farmer and we were a little bit like him. The idea of ​​a wealthy writer who wants to be famous is a little stupid, as if you did not become one of the contestants. Although it could be done purposefully, I think viewers should contact most contestants. - Rules of the game, a major defect: what happens if the 5th competitor does not disappear when he pulls the trigger. you seriously think that the last standing guy pulls the trigger and makes himself! they should give a chance to all competitors, ie if the fifth is also empty, then no one dies. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, I did not bother with these bad points because I really have good times. I just wish I had some popcorn with me!
