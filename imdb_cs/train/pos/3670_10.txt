I chased this movie on DVD without knowing what to expect - and when I'm going to study film making in Canada from all places, I'm sure to put it in the classroom. The story, centered around the most unfortunate film team in the history of the film itself, is famously written, and highly talented actors manage to deliver each game for a while. If you just could not laugh during the Hollywood North I suggest that I immediately visit a psychiatrist - you might have serious problems. In addition to the wonderful script, I also noticed the great chemistry between Deborah Kara Unger and Matthew Modine - where do they really work? Jennifer Tilly (playing a cheerful bad actress) and Martin Landau also delivered a very irritated yet fun performance. Big film, even better cast.
