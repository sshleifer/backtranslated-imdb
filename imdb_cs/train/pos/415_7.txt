Cecil B. De Mille, owner of the film, heads west. Using three legends from the old West as his protagonist (probably never met), Gary Cooper portrays Wild Bill Hickock, James Ellison as Buffalo Bill, and Jean Arthur doing a pretty Calamity Jane. The story serves only De Mille to hang up some amazing action sequences like a great Indian attack. Such estimates are extremely well done. If you do not mind somewhat over-the-top cast performance, it's very Fun Western. Try the very young Anthony Quinn, who plays the role of the Indian brave who participated in the Battle of Little Big Horn. That part got him at least in Hollywood.
