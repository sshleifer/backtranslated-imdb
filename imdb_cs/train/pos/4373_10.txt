I'll ask someone who says she does not care about this movie. Some reviewers said they did not have enough action, some said it was too long, etc. Do not listen to them! If you like Shawshank Redemption and / or Braveheart, you'll definitely love this movie! <br /> <br /> The performance is excellent! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lang are allsuperb and Liam Neeson doing admirable work and being very impressive due to their size. Cinemaphotography was great and breathtaking. It's one of the few movies I've seen in my life (along with Shawshank), which was virtually flawless from casting, directing, writing, acting, etc. !!! <br /> <br /> I was amazed at the top 50 or 100 rated movies. I felt so passionate that I had just registered to the IMDB to let everyone know they knew about a real meadow. I've seen this movie about 10 times (always with someone else) and everyone loved it! You have to be up and pay attention to the first 30 minutes, because at the beginning they represent relatively few characters. If you have a span of longer than most of these young kids write reviews on movies on this site before you love this movie! Let's ... all 3 films Lord of the Rings in the Top 9 and the Matrix on # 32?!?! This should show the age category of most reviewers here! <br /> <br /> This is the top 50 movie !!!
