The unlikely duo Zero Mostel and Harry Belafonte have brought together interesting performances and themes in The Angel Levine. It's an interesting focus on topics from "It's a wonderful life." Zula is married to Ida Kaminski and two of them belong to a special class of older Jewish poor in New York. Mostel was a tailor and proud of his business, but his back and arthritis prevented him from working. Kaminsky is mostly in bed. It is reduced to a request for welfare. In despair, like Jimmy Stewart, he calls God for some help. Now maybe if someone like Henry Travers got something else, Stewart had trouble accepting Travers. But Travers had one thing for him, he was over 100 years old from this deadly coil, and all his ties to earthly things were gone. God sent Mostel something completely different, the recently deceased Harry Belafonte, who should have at least some basic training for the angels before being assigned a task. Belafonte did not accept that he had moved from life, he still has a lot of questions. She also has a woman, Gloria Foster, who does not know she moved, hit the car right at the beginning of the movie. You have put his problems and Mostel questions and you have a good conflict, starting with the fact that Mostel can not believe the black Jew named Levine. This was a farewell to the Polish / Jewish actress Ida Kaminsky, who won her nomination for Best Actress on Main Street a few years ago. Another important role played by Irish actor Milo O'Shea, who plays a pretty Jewish doctor. I remembered O'Sheo's verdict from the Verdict, and I was really surprised to see him and hear that he had taken part of the doctor. Angel Levine raises some interesting and worrying questions about faith and race in this society. It is brought to you by stellar cast and, of course, created by the acclaimed writer Bernard Malamud. Make sure to catch him on the broadcast.
