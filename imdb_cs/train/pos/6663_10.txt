This film is about a dysfunctional family, but not a dysfunctional family. This is the family of the father of our nation (India), although the film focuses primarily on the alienated relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his eldest son, Harilal Gandhi. It shows how Mahatma had to kill M.K. Gandhi, how he had to sacrifice his family life to achieve our freedom. Every time Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son tried to get closer, Mahatma would come between them. It's a beautifully shot movie. Akshaye Khanna turned out to be the best actor. He spoke emotion very naturally. Darshan Jariwala, who starred at Guriu Desai's attorney in Guru, portrayed Gandhi amazingly (as a real human being, unlike Ben Kingsley who made him God) Shefali Shah Monsoon Wedding girl also did a really good job showing how Kasturba Gandhi divided between father and son. This film touches and so his soundtrack "Raghupati Raghava" sings in a very unique way. I saw this movie just 3 hours ago (it was Dubai the day before - second) and when the movie ended, it was "Pin Drop Silence," and when it came out of the theater, no one else asked (Can you imagine the Indians did not push us ?) NEJEN! It was sacred silence ...
