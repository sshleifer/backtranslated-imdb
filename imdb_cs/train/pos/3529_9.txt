Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is unjustly accused of killing his unfaithful woman. The night she was murdered she was outside with a mysterious woman who refused to give her name. After the murder charge, the police will visit all the places that were with her, but people remember that she is alone. He is sentenced to death and his secretary (Ella Raines) is trying to find the killer himself because he loves him. This was made as a B movie from Universal (look at the cast - all of the feature actors and one star - Franchot Tone - to bankruptcy). The budget was small and the cast is mostly unknown, but what has emerged is one of the best movie noir of the 1940s. He is beautifully directed by Curtem Siodmak and has a fantastic script that comes from the excellent book by William Irish (Penile Name for Cornell Woolrich). It's moving fast and it looks fantastic. And there is an infamous jam session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr., which is coming from a screen with incredible sexual energy (I am surprised that the censors did not cut). There is only a few mistakes that prevent it from being perfect. The tone gives awesome performance. It looks creepy and it's terrible. Curtis, like Henderson, is also stiff and dull. You really wonder why Raines loves him - he's so unbounded. But Raines is quite good in the lead role. She is pretty and full of life. Also, the last scene when a murderer after her is never paid. It is hardly a physical threat and her reactions seem exaggerated. Still I'm giving it 9. Really great movie - it's a mistake.
