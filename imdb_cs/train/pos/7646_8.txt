This movie is one of my favorites because it reflects on all the choices I have made and on how my life will change if my decision differs. It plays directly into the theory of "multiple universe". The only thing that does not mean to be true is how Larry Burrows (James Belushi) so hard to understand what's going on, that everything has changed. <br /> <br />
