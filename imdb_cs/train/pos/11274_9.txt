One of Tarzan's best films is also one of his most active action (and graphic). <br /> <br /> After a long year after Tarzan, the girl of the monkey asked a wealthy friend to fund the safari back at the elephant cemetery to collect ivory. His friend also comes carrying the clothes and perfumes Holt hopes to use to get Jane back from Tarzan. Before Holt can find his map stolen, it will become a crazy dash to try to capture a competition expedition. When they finally accept thieves, they find the whole side dead and surround themselves. They have no choice but to go out and soon find out that they are from the pan and the fire. Eventually Tarzan and Jane will appear and they are all on other adventures. The infamous film was heavily censored to reduce graphic violence (its graphic even today, probably gaining PG 13) and removing all the hints of nudity (there is a few minutes long naked swim scene involving Jane, who is filled with the front in his nud, was only recently restored). His clear tracking of the restored version of why this picture was reduced by 20 minutes in his time for running for television. As it is in its restored version, it is a very mature movie that is romantic, touching, performing events and everything else that should be a movie. It's an amazing film of almost any standard. The best of all kinds of movies that play well as a separate adventure, one does not have to see the first film he likes, but also a film that deepens the characters and themes that were created in this original film. It's an amazing thing. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie a lot. <br /> <br /> If there are any shortcomings to the film, maybe the film did not stop. The back screen is often very obvious, for many apes there are gorilla suits and some other effects are rather quaint than convincing. However, at almost every other level, this film is the pinnacle. <br /> <br /> You really owe it to you to see it. Make a large bowl of popcorn and head back onto the couch and let yourself be carried back to a simpler time. This is one of the great adventures.
