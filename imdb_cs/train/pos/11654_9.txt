I agree with the above commentary, I love realism in this and in many films (not just about eating disorders), it seems that the manufacturers have forgotten it. They take their everyday problem and create a huge dramatic scene, and then the end of the film is all done, which I do not like because it is not its reality. It does not mean that things can not get better and it does not mean things they do not have in this movie, but they do not spend most of the film creating all these problems and the end of the movie is all perfect again. When people suffer from eating disorders, people not only admit it and they want to improve, then life is peachy, it takes a while, and I like how we grow up with characters in this movie, we are going through problems better and worse because it is very an important part of the film. It comes to the minds of people with eating disorders and shows complications and pain in a very realistic way and I loved it. I also love it, as it shows, The secrets and betrayal people feel when they suffer from eating disorders, it is scary to see how people respond when they find out, especially if they approve it. I thought this movie was very moving and beautiful and he said well, and defiantly one of my favorites.
