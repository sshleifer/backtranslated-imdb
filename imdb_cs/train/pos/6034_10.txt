Last November, I was able to see this movie at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say it was a lot of fun. Several technical mistakes aside, it was a great experience. I loved writing and acting, especially from the one who played the lead role. There is a lot of heart in this movie, a lot of joke. I had a chance to talk with some creators after it was done, and it seemed really nice to me. The entire movie was just a positive experience and I certainly recommend it. The story was fun and cool, like a woman I've been through a lot of the same problems as a guy, so I really understand his problems. The film does a great job that gives us the people we can compassionate with. Friends in the movie are really well written, they are realistic. I know people like it, I only want Imy's friends and when we talk I can sound as cool as these people. The whole movie is really great, I wish there were more films like this. <br /> <br /> - Jayden
