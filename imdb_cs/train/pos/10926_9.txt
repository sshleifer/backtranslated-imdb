If you love kung-fu movies and you have not seen this movie, you are cheating. This movie is one of the only cheap kung-fu that could be recommended for fans of all types of films. Under normal circumstances, a fan of a genre needs to see something in these movies, but this has it all! The story is well spoken and complete. Battle scenes are great and tend to end up bored with them (unlike Crouching Tiger). Take some secrets and torture and you get the hell of the movie. Look at it at all costs. Heck, my wife enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Wu Du to! <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span>
