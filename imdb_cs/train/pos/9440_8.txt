"Deliverance" is one of the best movies for exploitation that comes from the wonderful 1970s, from which many other exploited films appeared. A group of friends embarks on a canoe trip down the river. to the south and become victims of a group of toothless hillbillies who are largely trying to destroy their lives. It's amazing. <br /> <br /> We have treatment for anal rape, malicious beating, killing bow and arrows, shooting, broken bones, etc. ... Many times, like the "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" of 1974, saying that "Deliverance" is credible would be immature. That would never and never happen, even in the dark years of 1972. "Deliverance" is a very fun ride and full action. This is one of the huge masses of exploitative films that have been coming since the early 1970s and that (probably) sits on top of a pile with great acting, excellent cinematography and excellent writing. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, kids.
