Spoiler This is a great movie about a horse. He goes through quite a lot of misery and tries to return to his owner. He learns a lot of his way and meets many other beautiful birds. If you love birds like my wife, this movie is for you. This movie also has some sad parts that cause tears to run. Eventually everything works for Paulie and his Russian friend. Rent it for the whole family, everyone enjoys it.
