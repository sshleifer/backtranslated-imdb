I have long been waiting for this movie because I saw a trailer, which seemed like a political drama that played three of my favorite actors. Al Pacino, John Cusack and Bridget Fonda. And despite the fact that Harold Becker, who did the unequal work, managed to join together with Pacino at the LOVE SEA, which is one of the best jobs. But the interference at some level (for beginners, several scenes in the original trailer does not appear in the movie) and the change of tone (subsequent tags make it look like a thriller) to keep it observable, anywhere closer as it may have been. <br /> <br /> Which is too bad because I really wanted to like this movie. There was a great potential to be a film about how the government can still be useful despite all the corruption, and make a complicated statement about this corruption, not the usual good guys against the bad guys. And here's good acting. Pacino and Cusack are both very well, and Danny Aiello gives one of the best performances of his career. But Fonda is lost in her role, has nothing to do, and while there is merit in the central storyline when it turns to a thriller, the film loses its way, briefly recovers in the last scene between Cusack and Pacino, and then drops completely down to end. I wish I could like it more, but not.
