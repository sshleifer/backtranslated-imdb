Four teenage girls in suburban Los Angeles get into a variety of issues: parties, drugs, cops, mixed parents, elderly friends. Jodie Foster, as the mother's hen pack, tries to keep everyone together as a "family" (as a family unit she never had), and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can not. Slowly everyone grows up and leaves. The exact drawing point, though stressed throughout, is unfortunately disturbed. Did we really need a long succession when Scott Baio made a full-blown car on the skateboard? Or even a longer sequence - also with Baio - where Foster has a strange soliloquy about "illusion pain". Some of the dialogues are in fact totally unsettled and I did not care much about adjusting late in a movie that is clumsily reflected from the death to the wedding. But these are the tricks in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of tight bondage. And Jodie's face in the end speaks volumes. If the audience gets to an end at the end, the movie made it. He does not cry to tears and does not ask for sympathy. It shows us an example of friendship and hopes we understand. *** z ****
