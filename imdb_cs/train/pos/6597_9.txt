We always look at American films with special accents from each region (south, west, etc.). We have the same thing here. All foreign people have to watch this film and have an open mind to embrace a different culture, except Americans and Europeans almost dominate the cinematographic industry. This film tells us about the parallel world, even for those who live in a big city like São Paulo. All actors improvise and are very realistic. The camera gives us an idea of ​​its confused world, the loneliness of every character, and invites us to share the world. <br /> <br /> It's really a great movie and the worst thing is that it's even at home.
