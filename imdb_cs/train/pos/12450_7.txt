I hired and watched this short work (<90 minutes). It's by far the best treatment Modesta has got in the movie - and its creator, Peter O'Donnell, agrees to participate as a "creative consultant." The character and we who love her are treated with respect. Spiegel's leadership is the best thing he has done so far and casting has been done very well. Alexandra Staden is almost physically perfect as a match with original illustrations by Jim Holdaway of Modesta. A great find of the one who threw it! Raymond Cruz as a young Rafael Garcia was also excellent. I hope Tarantino & co. will continue the series - I am particularly interested in who would decide to be incomparable Willie Garvin!
