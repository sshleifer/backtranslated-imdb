Master Blackmailer, based on the story of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, "The Adventures of Charles August Milverton," is the first story of Sherlock Holmes with Jeremy Brett I've seen. The story is interesting and dark. The film has a somewhat sad, sad feeling, but it's quite fun (with some especially fun scenes). Spoilers Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson is attempting to uncover the identity of an illusive blackmailer who has destroyed some of England's most prominent families by issuing private letters destroying their lives in a way. Finally, he finds out that it is Charles Augustus Milverton, an art trader, after several tragic consequences for the victims he could not pay. Our heroes must then help Lady Eva Blackwell, who has to pay an amount that is out of her means or otherwise her upcoming marriage will certainly be revoked. The scene in which Holmes and Watson attack the Milverton House are intense. Although the film has a pretty happy ending, the tone is sad and regretful. Outstanding performances by Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (as usual) and Robert Hardy as a notorious villain (most of the audience are likely to recognize him today as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter), Serena Gordon as Lady Eva Blackwell, Norma West as Lady Swinstead and Sophie Thomson as Agatha (the scenes that relate to her and Holmes are rebellion). I give it *** 1/2 off *****. My only complaint is that Inspector Lestrade is not enough. (I wish they were added to the scene at the end of the short story, describing two thieves, one of which corresponds to Watson.)
