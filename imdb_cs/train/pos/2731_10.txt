Sorry, I do not have much time to write. I'm not a psychologist but I know 25 years. She said Scott Wilson portrayed sociopathy (unconsciously) extremely well. I agree! She also said that Robert Blake portrayed the man with anger and impulse control that had a conscience but could not control himself. I agree! What a cool and huge film. I have seen more than 2,000 movies and I plan to place it in the top 100. My lifelong friend regularly deals with such clients. My only criticism was the preaching of the narrative at the end of the film. Many people grow up in less than ideal situations, but only one in a million will behave, because these two defeats have done so.
