While I disagree with Bob and Tammy's decision to take the child Jesse and it's something I never did, they tried to do what was best for the baby. The way this film is written, you see that you identify yourself in the story and ask yourself what you really believe of all the other aspects. Patty Duke? Antagonist? Almost unheard of when it comes to me. But she really believes in the film that she's psychotic or, at least, she's really serious about her. Her character is the meaning of "emotionally disturbed". The movie seems to end quickly, so things are somewhat unresolved. But besides, this movie is really great. It really thinks you. It's not a movie that you should watch when you want to come back and relax and watch something cute that laughs at you. But it's a good movie you see when you want to attack your own faith, see things from the perspective of others and discover a little something about yourself. Warning: You can even grow when watching this movie! And finally, it's all worth it.
