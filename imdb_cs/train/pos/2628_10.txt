I think Lion King 1 1/2 is one of the best sequels, as if it were not the best of three Lion King movies! In Timon and Pumbaa, they tell us where they come from and have trouble with others like Timon who have trouble coping tunnels with other Meercats! Timon and Pumbaa travel to their dream and find it and they will soon find it, just like Simba who rises but soon has to choose between their dreams or help Simba face his evil Uncle Scaru and proclaim his right as the Lion King of Pride of Rock! Filled with wonderful new characters such as Timon's Ma (Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). I think my favorite character was Uncle Max because it was very entertaining and was pronounced by comedian comedian Jerry Stiller with Ben Stiller's father. Disney was smart to cast Stiller in this role! Filled with wonderful characters, animations and a story and music, Lion King 1 1/2 is, in my opinion, the best of any sequel and better than Simba's Pride, although I admit that I really enjoyed it! Lion King 1 1/2 is a great Disney sequel that the whole family can enjoy! It has a good story and is very fun! 10 out of 10!
