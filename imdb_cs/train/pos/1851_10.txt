He saw this film in August at the 27th annual conference of the National Association of Black Journalists in Milwaukee, WI, is the first public screening. THE FILM IS LARGE! Derek Luke is great as Antwone Fisher. This young actor has a very bright future. Real Antwon Fisher did a great job of writing a movie, and Denzel's lead is right on the money. You see that opening weekend. You will not be disappointed.
