Prepare for it: This is one of my favorite films of all time. I'm rather ignorant of other works by David Mamet (writer and director), but after watching this movie half (it's always a joy to watch), I can say without hesitation being brilliant. This movie is extremely well written and quickly attracts you to your environment of scams, concert art and backstage. The feel of the film is very similar to The Sting (1973) and is also honored with the film's novel. It's quite a psychologically complicated film, and it surely thinks about the different plot and motifs of conspiratorial shadow characters. It's sometimes predictable at times, but the shocking peak is always exciting to watch. Overall, acting is great - especially Joe Mantegna - but someone who watched the movie remarked to me that it's not a good idea to have a heroine (Lindsay Crouse) who is not just a player, smoker and thief, but also sports a bad 80s hairstyle. I agree, but I think it is in this role however. <br /> <br /> The less you know about the plot of the film, the better, as is the latest film Mamet, the Spanish prisoner, because the end will be even more impressive. Just sit back and get ready to ride a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance.
