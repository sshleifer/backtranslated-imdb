Well, I saw this movie as a child and really loved it. My parents never bought me a movie, but I think I'll go and buy it now. I'm crazy about animated movies 2000 years ago. Anyway, the current review. What I Like: It was a true representation of heaven and hell, one of the few I've seen in animated films. Character development existed! It's easy to classify the characters in this movie (ie Charlie's selfishness, Itchy is cynical, but he believes Charlie, Carface is probably a relentless villain, etc.). I also loved the song of King Gator. I've always loved loud, angry, glamorous boys. This song may have been random, but it was so fun. Finally, the animation detail was beautiful. You could say that Charlie is all unhappy and things and the background are beautiful. What I Disliked: My Own Heaven: The way Charlie responded to "no surprise at all," did it really look very boring. He refused a place in heaven, and eventually he had to come back. I remember some lines of some songs like "you can not keep a good dog down", "we're making music forever" and "we're welcome to be dead," but I can not remember most of them. The songs were not so catchy to be honest. Whippet Angel: It's unpleasant and the neck! AUGH! What parents may not like: Several frightening (depending on the view) images of hell appear during the movie. Carface is quite threatening. Beer is also implied but not really DUBBED. Playing a game is a key element in the movie. A good boy dies. TOTAL: I love this movie, although it's sometimes a little forgotten. Animation of scary children is always my favorite. This was created at a time when producers and writers were not afraid to make the children afraid of that moment. Nowadays it would probably be labeled PG. Children under 8 (or easily disturbed children) should not look at it. Besides, I'm giving 9/10. :) <br /> <br /> Happy Viewing!
