In the Old West, there are always men who live, breathe violence and women who hold their breath. The famous ¨town tamer¨ named Clit Tollinger (Robert Mitchum) will hire the citizens to get rid of the gunmen (Leo Genn, Claude Atkins, among others), the Baronland madhouse. There he meets the smith (Emile Meyer), his daughter (Karen Sharpe), her boyfriend (John Lupton), the marshal (Henry Hull) and the owner of the Salon (Ted De Corsia). As a legislator, Clint is appointed as a peace-making representative and states some of the cartels that say the following: ¨ Warning, wearing weapons or other weapons in the city is forbidden. Check all the hardware in the marshal's office. Clint finds her ex-girlfriend, local madam (Jan Sterling), who cares about salons (Angie Dickinson, Barbara Lawrence). But the city council was worried about Clint's crude methods. At the end, the landlord appears and tries to kill Tollinger with his own hands. This is an incredibly exciting story of the Sheriff for rent, which had one more killing. It starts as a slow Western, but it follows to surprise us with dark characters and a solid conspiracy. The story is almost grim, the pacifier comes to the city just in time to make sure its citizens, but later the events get worse. The most important are salon burning and climate clearance at the end. The phenomenal and great role of Robert Mitchum as a revenge angel and a bitter shooter, it's a show. Live and live score by Alexa North (Spartacus, Cleopatra), Atmospheric Cinema Black and White Lee Garmes. The film is surprisingly accomplished by Richard Wilson (Al Capone, Three in the Attic) who made a good western theme like "Invitation to gunfighter" and "Zane Gray" episodes. Traceable results for this offbeat Western.
