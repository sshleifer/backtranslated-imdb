I think it's a great version, I came here before it helped me find out which version I should use and went to Jane Eyre 1983 and read comment comments from the users and then helped me get this version. I'm not afraid I chose this version, and not you. I tried to keep track of all the other versions and nobody liked it. There is nothing like a book and TRUST ME if you read the book you want something to answer with it. When you're looking for something real and moving after reading the book, it's hard because you want something to do with it. I would say that God personally led me to this version. It shows true love for people. I would say that God's love is greater. If there is anything better, I would like to see her. but there is nothing similar yet!
