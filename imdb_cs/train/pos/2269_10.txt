I have just read the novel "Nightmare", I have owned the DVD for some time and have watched it so often. Several of the films I own and saw made me think and question as much as Mother's Night, I am amazed at the brilliance of Vonnegut, but also by translating his text onto the screen. do not lend or watch this movie on VHS, it must be done on a DVD and must be accompanied by a film's commentary by the director. To see how they have experienced a fairly simple story, yet complicated in their essence and dialogue and have done so well, I think every viewer will be amazed. The omission in the film is very little text, and it should not be too lost, the film could also be a book and it is the best adaptation I've ever seen. I strongly recommend to books and films together that it does a bad job just to say, go for it.
