I liked Longstreet, which was followed in successive Ironside TV series by Raymond Burr and was supposed to be a competitor. But this show was canceled after one season because it was decided - I think it was bad - that Longstreet was not able to compete with Mr. Burr Ironside. I add that the pilot for this show was particularly well done and very memorable. I hope a box called Longstreet will appear. Writers should note that this story has only been briefly explored and that much more could be done on TV.
