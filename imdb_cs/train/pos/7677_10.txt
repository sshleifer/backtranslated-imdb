Wow, this movie has had a huge impact on me, moved me. It's an amazing story about a girl in Cambodia who sells to a sex shop. I can not stop thinking about the fate of a little girl named Holly. The film's setting is realistic, the film was the opening eyes, I can not imagine anyone going out of it without wanting to help change with this terrible problem that existed. The content of the film was very moving. It was one of the best movies I've seen this year. The girl who plays Holly is doing a fantastic job with her character. Ron Livinston gives a fantastic play. The film has moved me to tears, explaining an important message that has to be heard all over the world. Everyone should see this movie. I think this movie will make a difference, I loved it!
