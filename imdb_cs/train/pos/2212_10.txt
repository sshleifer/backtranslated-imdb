E! TV is a great channel and Talk Soup is so funny, you can watch episode changes in a flash. We want more funny writings by Stan Evans best writer .. Patron of the Holy Powerless Masters ... He is a truly gifted talented writer, actor, comedian, producer, director and creative advisor. Anna Nicole loved him, but he was not a billionaire, so he left him for billionaires. Many superstars wanted to shoot movies with actor Stan Evans, who has an acting style "Humphrey Bogart" (Clark Gable). He should do a lot more movies. Maybe with Stephen Spielberg, or perhaps many other talented producers. We wish him a moment of FAME with great luck to win. Has he created some fake dramas? or maybe some docudrama ??? The Bernie Madhoff project would be a great TV movie written by STAN EVANS. How many scripts did he write? It is under the price $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$) $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$- millions of dollars ... He could also write a television film about the late king of POPs. Michael Jackson. We want to see a lot more in Stan Evans's film and television. I really thank you very much. Elvis left the building !!!!!
