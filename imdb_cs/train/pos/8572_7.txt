The first movie was nice, but it's not as good as a beautiful animated classic that I found much nicer and more cute. This sequel is bad, but bad at all. Surely there is too much stack, the script has its weaknesses and the story is unstoppable. But dogs are very cute here, and Eric Idle is cheerful as a parrot. The film is nice to look at stylish cinema and costume eye (especially Cruella) and the music is nice. Acting is mostly very good, Ioan Gruffudd is appealing and Gerard Depardieu as he gives better performances as entertaining as Cruelin Complices. Best of all, as was the case with the first movie, Glenn Close is a wonderful performer, like Cruella, even worse than before. Overall nice. 7/10 Bethany Cox
