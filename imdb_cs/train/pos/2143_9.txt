It's not the same as other dance films. Some normal people found themselves dancing. Unlike the Hollywood dance films, the characters in this movie are not nice or hot young people. They are someone you can see every day in their offices. They are depressed about their lives and finally find themselves and dance their dreams. This is very profoundly touching me.
