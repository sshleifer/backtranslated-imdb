I liked this movie, although halfway through, I was able to tell who the secret admirer is. I also wonder if it was based on a true story because it was telling the "real" at the end of the movie. I think I'll have to explore it and let it know. Does anyone remember what happened? I believe they moved to North Carolina if I'm not mistaken. <br /> <br /> Of course, states could change to protect the innocent. <br /> <br /> You would think this man might have realized it as easily as I did. Was it stupid or what?
