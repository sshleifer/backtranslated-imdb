I really really love this show! I have always liked the 1990 Space Ghost! This show was cheerful and I can not believe why the Cartoon Network is an adult swimming would such a fun show like this in the air. I hope to put this performance on DVD or something. The show is about Brak (from Space Ghost cartoons, SGCC and Cartoon Planet), who lives every day with their mom and dad and his best friend, who likes to fall a lot, Zorak! My favorite episode was where Zorak gets this really good singing, and then his voice does not give any money Zorak sang at all. Another episode I like is where Brak and Zorak did not finish their homework, and then they came back from Sunday to Friday and they just disappeared and then went back to the day's work that was invented and then when they returned homeworks did not exist! Another episode I like is where Brak's Dad and their neighbor neighbor, Thundercleese Robot, get into this agrument, and then they get a giant worm. Another episode I liked was where Zorak became an intimidating stand, and then a new kid stood up. I also like lots of other episodes! One thing that never smiles me is when Zorak is beaten, burned and ignited!
