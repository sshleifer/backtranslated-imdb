I've been a fan of Pushing Daisies from the very beginning. He's a great thinker, and Bryan Fuller has the most remarkable ideas for this show. It's unbelievable what television needs a creative, original show like Pushing Daisies. It's a tremendous relief when you see a show that is unlike any other where, if you compare it with some newer shows like Scrubs and House, you will see similarities and within a few moments you will find lengthy seeing shows so close in your identity. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the magnificent cast, beautiful scripts and festivity in each episode, Pushing Daisies is one of the most remarkable television shows.
