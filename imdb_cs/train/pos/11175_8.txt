Often, with Stephen King's adaptations, you get a collection of characters that call off dialogues from books. It really captures the heart of the book. Maybe because they do not use a lot of text directly from the book, but it's a bit more of the improvisation of events in the story. Much of his success is Miko Hughes as a child Gage. Dale Midkiff and Denise "Tasha Yar" Crosby really acts like his parents. There's a scene where Ludwig took Gage and they're very natural. Fred Gwynne is WONDERFUL. Maine perfectly emphasizes the accent without falling into parody, being wise and warm, just like Jud. (8 of 10)
