Wow. I loved the whole series and I was shocked to comment on people who thought it was bad. Perhaps in the 4 & 5 season he was a bit weary, while on TV he was better than anything else. But 6 and especially 6b were beautiful permutations on themes created in the muscular first three seasons. <br /> <br /> 6B started with this incredible mood, and Janice was always interested in family anxiety - the doom-filled line that Tony understands sitting and staring. Anyone who missed the consequences for the rest of the series does not know Tony. Melfi's discomfort over psychiatric studies and his references to the self-deceiving sentimentality of pet and animal sociopaths returns to the first episodes of the series, such as Tony's panic attack on the ducks leaving his pool, and resonating with Phil "to get into Chase's dark humor. br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I just add that I thought the final show - starting with opening Vanilla Fudge to give you an ironic precursor ("You Keep Me Hangin 'On") to the end moments, when Tony falls in peace with his family, or blasts such as AJ SUV or Phil's head were totally PERFECT, the best TV channel. <br /> <br /> Pretty good in a dying medium pathologically delivering "far from fantasy" AJ derides (and then into who instantly recedes.) Chase pork cake tip.
