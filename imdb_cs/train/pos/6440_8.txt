I have never been able to write a review of IMDb unless I'm surprised how good or bad the movie is. This film falls into the first category. Every year I try to see all the Oscar-nominated Best Foreign Films, even those I know I do not like. "As it is in heaven" seems to fit into the law. The story sounds sweet and sentimental and slow ... For my taste, which is more about original, dark and courageous foreign movies (Michael Haneke, Francois Ozon, a very modern Japanese / Korean cinema) "As It Is In Heaven" Interesting .... It was not allowed in the US so I sat down to watch the VCD I found in Singapore and was about to "remove it from the list". After a tedious start, "Like in Heaven" becomes the precious film that really inspires what's happening on the screen. Weaknesses: The characters in the movie are pure "stock" characters - a wounded dreamer, a bully out of the city, a battered wife, a kind woman longing for love, a suppressed minister .... Fortunately, they are mostly a sympathetic bunch, as well as being well written and well-behaved. Ingela Olsson, as wife of Inger, would be nominated for an Oscar if her performance would be in English. Strong points: music is beautiful and the main song sung by Gabriel is really dramatic and unforgettable. And beware of the horrific 87-year-old actress who plays Olga, who is keeping up with the dance steps as well as the younger ladies! I will not discuss the end, but I will say it makes sense. It's a lot of emotional things happening in the last hour of the movie and you're not sure why it's happening. Though nothing is explained by the word, everything makes sense because the movies come in the shape of a creep. **** outside *****. Probably the most powerful Swedish film I've ever seen.
