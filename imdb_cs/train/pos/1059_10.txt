I love this show, it will definitely be the winner. Jessica Alba is doing a great job, it's time to have a girl with a kick-ass that is not pious. The entire cast is beautiful and all episodes have good grounds. Everything is well distributed and thought. To put it together had to take some time, because it was not someone in a hurry that just slapped something together. It's really a great show.
