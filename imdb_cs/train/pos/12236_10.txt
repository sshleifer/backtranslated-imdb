I saw this film in 1959 when I was 11 years old in the theater with my family. <br /> <br /> The way I thought it was very fun. . . even though I was too young to understand 90% of what makes this wonderful movie such a joy! This morning I saw it at Turner South. As I watched, I was totally confused with laughter! "Pair Play" is a unique classic of the past. If you are too young to experience the magical period of history that produced this film, I am very sorry. There is no way you can watch such movies and understand how they can (and today) deliver so beautiful a slice of heaven to "old timers" like me. <br /> <br /> After what I can do, let the young people refrain from commenting on movies like "The Matching Game". Movies like this were created for the generation that preceded the current group of your people. And as such, these films speak a very different language than any of you can understand. In other words ?? if you do not understand the issues the film is interested in, please do not be ashamed by offering comments that? honestly? does not make sense.
