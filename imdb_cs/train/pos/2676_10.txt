Every day we can watch a lot of movie, soap ... on TV. Sometimes a miracle is happening. A great movie, with real feelings, with great actors, with a great director. There are two films for me to see: Pacula first? "Sophie's Choice" with Meryl Streep. The second is "The Way of Hope". As human beings, we must learn humility, love for others, accepting another civilization, a different way of life. We must also fight racism and fascism. We must avoid judging, criticizing; we only have to love our earthly companion. This wonderful movie helps us achieve our dream: Imagine that all people living in peace live. These two movies are hard to see: observe them, but you will be injured, but better. Great movie, great actors, horrible story, pain and cry, but also a better understanding of others. Enjoy it.
