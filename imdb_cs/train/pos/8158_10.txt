"Fear of a black hat" is all that (much weaker) "CB-4" should be. Engraved Cundieff's satirical eye is ruthless when it consists of spindles and cripples all aspects of hip-hop trends and culture. "FoaBH" reminds Spinal Tap? Yes, a little bit. Is it a Spinal Tap derivative? No, not really. The goal is more focused, satire is better focused and is more sincere, it's more fun.
