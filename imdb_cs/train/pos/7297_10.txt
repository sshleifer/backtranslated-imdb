I really enjoyed this movie. The hearing was amazing as it was a conspiracy. Jeff Combs has more talents than he is recognized. The only part of this picture that I would change was the end. The death of the creature was too hideous for Sci Fi Channel. There were interesting religious news in this movie. Jeff Combs apparently played the character of Messiah and the creature (or shark, if you prefer) represented the anti-Chirst. There were some particularly frightening scenes that felt the end of the world. I noticed that after a third tour of this classical work. I know that many people will not have references to Christianity, but if you look closely, you will get it.
