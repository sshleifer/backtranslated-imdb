This show is a great historical story. It is all from slavery, the way they have been treated, religions, the ways in which Jews were sent to shelter, the Inquisition, faith in the Orthodox African gods, the way women are treated, including daughters. Even to homosexuality. The way the characters are linked and that Violante, the character sad me. She is so desperate that she is loved to destroy everyone around her. I'm so glad they decided to re-issue it t.v. again. Even though I would like to see the untrained version. Xica became my hero. I look at the way she uses her power to help those who are looking for it. I love all the characters and I have found that they can relate to many people in this century. I look forward to my Xice every night. It would be great to copy it in English so the Americans can love it.
