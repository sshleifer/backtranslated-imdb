Robert Stack never lost the loss of best Oscar-winning actor for his role as Kyle in "Written on the Wind" to Anthony Quinn for a 12-minute performance in "Lust for Life." Stack plays a deeply disturbed alcoholic son of an oil tycoon. Life lived in the shadow of a friend with whom he was raised, Mitch, played by Rock Hudson. Both of them like the same woman, Lucy, (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kyle's wife. Kyle's sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone), is a drunken whore who is in love with Mitch. Their story plays in a famous color under the direction of Douglas Sirk, who actually dominated the melodramatic field with some incredible movies, including "The Imitation of Life", "All That Heaven Allows", "The Magnificent Obsession" and many others. br /> <br /> Do not make a mistake - it's a potohiler, and Stack and Dorothy Malone are making the most of their roles, Malone winning Best Actress Oscar Actress. There is one amazing scene mentioned in other commentaries where she wildly dancing to loud music when her father collapses and dies on the stairwell. We are convinced that Marylee is sleeping with everyone, including a person who pumps gas because she is in love with Mitch. Mitch has nothing to do with her. She is so in love with Lucy that from loyalty to Kyle he wants to go to work in Iran to avoid the temptation. I doubt he would have gone so hopelessly today, no matter how much he loves him. <br /> <br /> Hudson and Bacall have less interesting roles - Hudson's Mitch is a good kid who has cleared Kyle's transformation throughout his life and Bacall is Mitch's wife who finds himself in the nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of sobriety. Sirk focuses on more unstable players. <br /> <br /> In the hands of Sirka, "Written on the Wind" is an effective film, and the big scene towards the end of the castle is particularly exciting. The director had a gift for this type of film, and although he had many imitators, he never played an equal role.
