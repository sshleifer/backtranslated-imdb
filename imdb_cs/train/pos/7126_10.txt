This movie resonated with me on two levels. As a child I was evacuated from London and planted on reluctant hosts in a rural village. While I missed the bombing and had experiences that raised valuable memories (such as Hearing a Chimney sing one night for the first time) and enjoying a life I never could have in London, I missed my family and was afraid of them. Tom is an old man whose wife and child died and live alone in a small village village. As an old man who is now without a wife whose children marry in another province and live far away, I am sometimes lonely. The mother of a boy is a religious fanatic with very special thoughts about child upbringing. Since Tom Oakley and the young boy have grown deep in affection, Tom looks for him and eventually rescues him from very special and dangerous circumstances. There is a lot of tension at the end of the story because, because of some bureaucratic decision, the child seems to lose someone who has created a loving relationship with him.
