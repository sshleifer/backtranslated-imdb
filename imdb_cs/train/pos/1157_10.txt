This is one of the best comedies ever! Writing this parody of soap is brilliant and occupied, take a good look at the names of the cast and understand why it is so great. If you are a fan of Kevin Kline, he does (as always) a fantastic performance and Robert Downey Jr is perfect. If you are not laughing when you see this movie, you have no sense of humor.
