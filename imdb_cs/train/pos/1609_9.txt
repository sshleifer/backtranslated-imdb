"Moonstruck" is the movie I liked the first time I watched him. I really liked it a second time. This time I loved her. Now it's one of my favorite times. <br /> <br /> Humor is gentle but really good. The film offers a lot of warm humor. The story takes place in the old Italian quarter of NYC. Chero's quest for love is nice to watch. This film is by far the best work Nicholas Cage has done in the film. The old man is fantastic. The wordless screen lights up. The scene with my dogs on the Moon was fantastic. But maybe the best way is Olympia Dukakis. Around the movie is the scene where the main heroes have a breakfast of oatmeal in family kitchen. Exceptional direction and wrap.
