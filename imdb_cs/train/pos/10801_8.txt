Honestly, when I saw this movie years ago, I immediately wanted to turn it off. When I sat there for another 10 minutes, I realized that the actor who played Navin stole the show. His face expressions and comedic behavior make me shake my head why he was not in comedies. He had this "Marty Feldman" thing that happened to him, but much more talent than Marty to turn away. The film really shocked me as to how close she was to the original Jerk, but then again, it was much more. I really think that if this movie was released first and I saw Steve Martin's 2nd film, I would think the other was a cheap reflection. I know it sounds like BOLD, but it's true. I really like Steve Martin, but his performance is second to the actor in The Jerk Too. I wish I had a copy for my collection. I urge you to see her if you find her.
