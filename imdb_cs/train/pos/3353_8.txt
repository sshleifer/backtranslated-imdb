This film strongly comments Italian people at the time. The use of mirrors to enhance the revelation of the characters is beautiful and I can not mention the beauty and grandeur of Sophie Loren and Mastroianni. I love them both. Their way of interacting is so beautiful and natural that you can ask whether the camera is actually or not. Her husband is also very well portrayed as a fascist who runs his wife and children, but his own loving father. The initial scenes with Hitler at Piazza Venezia with all the Italians are unbelievable and historically really place the film in history. I loved the film and I also agree that it's funny it's not more.
