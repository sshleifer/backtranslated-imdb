I'm neither a writer nor a critic ... I'm just a student who saw this movie a few minutes ago ... And I would like to thank the people who worked on this film! It is not the best or the most ... but it touched my heart ... why? I would like to understand it myself ... it's easy and accessible ... it's a movie that felt good after a bad day without any regrets about the time spent watching it! It is about love and care, about the life we ​​have, but sometimes it is lacking because of material things ....... Look at what we have but it is missing us. ... why do we do it? We need to live like dying ... take care of every second and remember: if we do good things - good things get to us! . and has a special taste in New York ... I love this city and the world we live in !!!! Thank you very much for the movie and sorry for my mistakes (English is my second language) ...
