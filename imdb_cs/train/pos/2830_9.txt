The extraordinary Rosemary Forsyth is the main reason why you look at it. Why it never became a bigger business, it may never be known. But she is exceptional and steals every scene she's in. Garson Kanin drove this piece of fluff and the cast is the first speed, with Robert Drivas and Brenda Vaccaro particularly memorable. A "9" of "10"
