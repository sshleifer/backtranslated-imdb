Yeah, that's joking, it's not Zombie, but it's not that bad either. He has Beatrice Ring, which is a huge bonus and it's fun. I was lucky to meet Fulc√© later in his career, and he stayed philosophical about this experience because he was never completely satisfied with him. It is worthwhile to look for, especially for fans of the genre and Fulc. It's a movie that's too often out of hand.
