Until the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars Saga, which ended in 2005, I have always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film from a long series. Various action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, a furry forest creature, etc.) make this film a particularly attractive film. None of the events, which sometimes focused too much at one point, was never too great. For the last half hour, it is the most important thing because the scene switches every few minutes from the forest to the battle between spacecrafts and individual laser battles between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vademer. Another nice feature of this film that the two previous were not the absence of fighting between the two stars. It was a constant harassment between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see. In the end, it was just a great adventure story, more than anything else.
