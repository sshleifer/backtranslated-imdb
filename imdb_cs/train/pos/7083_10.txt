Great addition to anybody's collection. <br /> <br /> 12 monkeys is a movie that you do not see every day. He has great actors to go with an excellent story. This is not a normal role for Bruce Willis but holds a role like John McClane. Virus-kills everyone on earth and leaves a few hundred surviving stories is not new, but the story (Bruce) is sent back in time to get information about the virus that destroyed most of the human being. <br /> <br /> The actors in this were amazing. I have to mention Brad Pitt, who was cheerful when a mental patient, James Cole (Bruce), meets in a psychiatric hospital. The Director did a terrific job when he brought us a disturbing idea of ​​a future desolate man-made virus. The animals seen in the world of viruses have made them feel that they are driving the world when people get into the underground. This movie was excellent and must see it, and it must be its own. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. <br /> <br />
