Too many sources stemming from this dramatic period-based idea, partly based on the historical fact, along with the superficially "nuppolitating" that was the backbone of the 1970s European refuse cinema, overlooking the righteous anger that drives all the effort. Perhaps it was also a unique attempt by director Gianfranco Mingozzi to shoot a film outside of many well-received papers. <br /> <br /> FLAVIA is safely set in the historical context and maps the rising uprising of an Italian nun from the early 15th century (Florinda Bolkan's Career Performance, even surpassing her sterling work in the devastating Lucio Fulci DO NOT WANT DUCKLING) to lock her in the monastery a father who is not so aristocratic, in a desperate attempt to stop the girl's exciting sensual nature. Wondering why women are placed in secondary roles in the best life, such as in holy script, is confronted with ways in which male domination can interrupt female lives inspired by a rebellion driven by the morning sexist by older sister Agatha (the indelible depicted veteran actress Maria Casar√®s of Marcel Carna LES ENFANTS DU PARADIS) and - more constructively - the invasion of Muslims. When Flavia connects with the oppressed, and perhaps unwittingly manipulates them to take up her offerings, she will actually become the culmination she has already felt, with the expected tragic results. With the captivating Alfio Contini's widescreen compositions, which fired Michelangelo Antonioni's POINT OF DEFENSE, it is a rigorous and austere description of how the woman was mournfully but eventually fighting unnecessarily against a patriarchal society that had no rights to childbirth or pain, as Sarah Agatha guesses. The long phantasy drug-induced sequence was clearly modeled by Ken Russell, otherwise more prominent, DEVILS, even though the film in the leather department is rather furious. It is a serious work that deserves to rediscover and restore its unjustly damaged reputation.
