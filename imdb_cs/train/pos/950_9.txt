Meetings and actors make this television movie the best interpretation of the classic Dickens story for me. George C. Scott is very credible as well as the rest of the cast. His Scrooge radiates to the very end of the movie. Then his character changes to the one who really repents. The nineteenth-century English city that has been selected for setting up creates the atmosphere that Dickens adapts to and contributes to the credibility of this film. It's a movie that I watch every Christmas together with real Grinch and it's a wonderful life.
