In an era of such horrible cartoons I'm rather shocked when I see a movie with such good morals that we get into the IMDB for animated films. This movie contradicts the first. I do not deny it. However, when I was in the target group for this movie, I did not even notice it would not matter if I did. The people who did this may have used the "new generation" to notice that this is another way to get started with the Care Bear family. Perhaps we have decided ourselves as the Care Bear family really started. <br /> <br /> This was my favorite movie at the age of 3-6 years and it did not scare me or change it at all. > <br />
