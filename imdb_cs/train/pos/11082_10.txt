I watched this movie when I was almost a boy, and of course, this story of a fox family was moved into tears. The fantastic scenery in Hokkaido, excellent storytelling and, last but not least, the amazing soundtrack provide extraordinary intimacy with the protagonists. I'm still looking for a copy of a wonderful soundtrack. For German viewers, it would be useful to know that DEFA-dabing is the only one worth listening to. I reached both (DEFA and BR), but I'm still only looking first.
