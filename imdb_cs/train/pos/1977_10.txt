I really love this movie. I remember when I was in the 2nd year, the teacher showed me a 16mm film. This movie, however, may be a bit frightening for second-tier stages, such as the scene where Bill murders Nancy and for the first time sees Fagina's face on the screen. One of my relatives is trying to see this movie because she studied in the music. If I were a teacher and I could appreciate the people who produced this wonderful film, I would give them A +.
