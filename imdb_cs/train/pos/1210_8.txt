And my kids love it now! I can watch it now and realize that the animation was not so great and that the plot is skillful. Hi, if every villager introduced himself with the words: "I am DAAAARRRKK HEEEEAAARRT", I think they might laugh at them, but for young children it is a moral story with catchy music. The music so catchy that I still remember the words after seeing this movie in twenty years. I would definitely suggest it for younger children.
