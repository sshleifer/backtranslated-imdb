I've always been watching Hong Kong movies but everyone has failed to meet my expectations ... until now! BURNING PARADISE does not contain flat humor, which has the majority of HK films, or the second story line that has been dragged into the film. The story is not complicated, but there are never scenes that would just fill up some "smart" space (the only really smart film about martial arts I've seen is CROUCHING TIGER but since Hollywood is involved, it's not no real HK movie for me). There are some unbelievable battle scenes in this movie, from the first (which is one of the best I've ever seen, yet so short) on the last major scene! But you think there's also a lot of blood flowing (people in half, decapitated, etc.). Production is quite good and special effects show that fantasy writer can be fulfilled, although some shots must be quite technical (note: a sheet of paper that fits and gets into the wall!). Yeah, that's not Tsui Hark or John Woo, who became my favorite film in Hong Kong, it's Ringo Lam! And I'm sure he's looking at this director more! Ace.
