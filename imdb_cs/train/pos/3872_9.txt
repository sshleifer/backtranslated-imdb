After you've seen this little fairy-tale and comic movie, you'll feel better. Thank Yves B. Pelletier for giving birth to this gorgeous film moment, which I think will be recognized as a brand-name movie for Quebec in 2004. Actors Isabelle Blais, Emmanuel Bilodeau, Sylvie Moreau and Stéphane Gagnon give a touching performance. I would like to compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives to those given to me by Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain. So if you like the wonderful film Jean-Pierre Jeunet, I would say you should also look forward to the first film by Yves B. Pelletier, Les Aimants
