I'm glad it's now available on DVD. This film is an excellent example of a triumph of content and style over blinking lights with an empty head and a steady loud noise. Basically, if you have a short attention or lack of joke and fantasy to engage in a literary story that you will not like this movie. The reasons for this are relatively simple but rarely achieved: Matthew Jacobs has done a fantastic job of successfully screening the story of Catherine Storra's novel "Marianne Dreams". An independent task, like anyone who has seen a movie, will undoubtedly know. Casting is excellent, allowing director Bernard Rose to use the actors in a way that is rarely seen; they enjoy the craft of acting! I know that I know the actors are doing their job, and instead of resorting to the impassive attack on camera lens, kaleidoscope car chase, explosions and fire blasts around them is really scarce, but it really does happen in this movie. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the final reason that it's a movie for imaginative thinkers, not a tabloid reader who nursed them with a spoon. In addition to solid scenario, direction and acting, he relies on the atmosphere, tension and implied horror. If it is to be classified as a horror, then the presentation of the "paper house" is in the Sophocles veins rather than Tobe Hooper. Finally, if you like plenty of loud sounds, blasts, constant cuts and bright flashing colors, you should better watch "Transformers," but if you like a thrilling story that evolves with skillful and evocative use of narrative without insulting your intelligence the power that gave you cacophony nonsense, then it might just be your thing.
