This is one of Jodie Foster's best films and is mostly ignored due to the misconceptions of the general public about how he is moving in adolescence. She has a great performance, especially the fight scene between Jodie and her mother played by convincing Sally Kellerman. The three girls playing Jodie's friends are a little amateur, but I think it's worth seeing.
