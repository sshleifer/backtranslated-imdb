This is several times you look. Outstanding writing shows that they had to live this story or know someone they did because they taught him. Freebird transformed me and laughed at my poorly satisfied youth. The title was a great choice. Great movie, setting, story, soundtrack and characters. He's a biker, but it's a pity the pigeon is doing this. Funny bones, a bit like Trailer Park Boys in the US If you've never seen a TPB, make sure you enjoy this movie. Thank you. I hope that in more films I will see more of these characters. Continuation? It could happen. There is much more to the world that I want to see through their eyes.
