It was a high-end top-notch movie. Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and especially Christopher Lloyed are in this enchanting real-life angel movie that helps the Angels Baseball Team. You never know it could happen. I loved Lloyd's role in it. It was funny. The story is about a change of life because the child's faith in the angels helped turn the angry, hardy and impressed manager Glover to see the best in humans. The film was well made, and also that he saw the best of people and reached his dreams. It was funny, charming, touching and sad, all very nicely done. You will love it (or you will love it). I guarantee. <br /> <br />
