It's a comedy that once was, and it compares it to two remakes, THE PONE PIT, AND WE ARE YOU, just showing how 40 filmmakers have a taste for a comedy that has since disappeared. <br /> <br /> I was 15 years old when I saw it for the first time, and even at the mixed time there was a lot to laugh at. Now, of course, I'm familiar with adult frustration, I see a lot of what I missed as a youth. Three main actors ... Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... but the core of the film lies in the frustrations we face when we get a dream. It is never so easy and without the invisible complications of imagining yourself. Overall, this is a classic comedy that still stands over attempts to remake her.
