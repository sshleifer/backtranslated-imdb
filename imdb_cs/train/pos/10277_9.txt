It's almost perfect film. Ideas would repeat Mamet, but they never said so. It is really a failure of trust, human condition. The film shoots the idea that we are all criminals, no one is innocent. Is anyone alive today who has not seen this game in our own society every day? The film is highly structured as a Hitchcock thriller. Besides, there are no innocent characters. The world is now completely polluted, destroyed, and everyone is participating in the horse. Could it be more true? <br /> <br /> Do not miss a musical accompaniment. That's amazing.
