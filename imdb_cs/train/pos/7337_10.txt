A good story and excellent animation. The influence of Frazette and Bakshi is obvious and that's a good thing. Anyone with Conan Barbar or Dungeons and Dragons should enjoy it. The battle between good and evil is clear, though it may seem that our hero is sometimes neutral. Most often in fantasy movies Elves are usually portrayed as white skins and blond hair and elves and orcs have dark skin and hair. Anyone familiar with Frazetto, Bakshi or even with Tolkien's work knows they are not racist. Anyone with fantastic movies should enjoy this movie. They are not for young children due to violence and sexual intercourse. Casting was well done and the scenes and music are the first. I hope someone gives this gem to DVD soon. I think I'm happy to have a VHS copy in good condition.
