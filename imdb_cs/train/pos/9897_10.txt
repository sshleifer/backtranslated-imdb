Well, I'm sorry, but I loved this movie. I like the 80th year of this type of movie because you can not see much of it anymore. I would like to ask you all the people who say that this film is just a renunciation, or a cheese imitation, what imitates it? I have never seen another movie like this, and not so awfully. It's basically a popular school group who likes to make everybody a hell of a living, so they chose to choose a nerdy boy called Marty. It becomes fatal when it really hurts one of their little jokes. So, like ten years later, and a group of friends who hurt Marty, he gets letters from reunion to college. But ... they are the only ones who accepted them! So they go back to the old school and one after the other they get rid of ....... Yeah, you know what's going to happen! The only part that disappointed me was the end. This could be omitted or thought better. I think you should try and try to be critical! <br /> <br /> </ span> </ span>
