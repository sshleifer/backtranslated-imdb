Intelligent, smart and exciting, "The Invisible Man" appeared in the year 2000 among the usual science fiction series, balancing the fantastic artistic direction of "Farscape," and sometimes a melodramatic script with harsh, cynical screams and modern New Dialogue. The show sat between "law and order" and "Doctor Who" on the metrology of credibility, but there was no denial of the fact that I-Man figures went over the cartoon. Even signs that have cast doubt on predictability, such as the Keeper, the Official and the Eberts, have been dismissed from the wording. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and elegantly shifted, an even more remarkable team of revolving doors for writers and directors. Effects never make it possible to overcome the conspiracy, and science has only sometimes slipped on absolutely unbelievable. The low points of the show are still fun and I have never seen such tense pilot episodes. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi should be honored and fans have the right to request a comprehensive DVD release of this show. Each time I hit the science fiction marathon "Hercules: Legendary Paths", I turn my eyes and my sighs, mourning the excitement and the possibilities of science fiction television that she represented "The Invisible Man" and his ilk.
