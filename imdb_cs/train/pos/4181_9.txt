It's been so long since I've seen this movie (at least 15 years), and yet it still loves the vivid image of terrible consequences that prisoners of war can face despite the terms of the Geneva Convention. <br /> <A unit of Australian underwater demolition experts is captured in an archipelago near Japan after a successful mining mission in a Japanese port. Once in prison, these men expect the same treatment as all the other prisoners, but due to their horror, they will soon realize from a friendly Japanese prison guard that they are tried as spies because they were not in uniform when they were captured. The consequences of such an offense, the Japanese code of warfare, are executions per head. Despite the reasons and concerns of a sympathetic prison guard, the clearing day is coming closer to being a tough bomb. The tension is so high that you can actually hear ticking, although it can only be your chest pounding with a percussion marching team. In fact, the end is too painful to write again here in my head. But I can promise you - you will never forget it. Good luck finding a video in the US
