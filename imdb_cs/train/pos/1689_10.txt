This movie is about Halloween, which is a funny "Christmas Story" for Christmas: Both are relatively low budget, movies without big names and stars ... and both are two of the absolute greatest and funniest movies available, both seasonal KLASIKA !! ! "Spaced Invaders" come right from the very beginning with warmth and humor and great character ... with all five miserable Martians, Klembkemer Real Estate, Russell Deputy, Vern in the "Fuel Storage" and many more! You just have to see this movie to believe it and as a "Christmas story" it's just getting better and better with every viewing, and you'll pick up fun little things every time! Most often ten!
