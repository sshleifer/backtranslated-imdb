An outstanding example of the spectacular Busby Berkeley musicals that arose in the early 1930s. The viewers had to be very surprised to see James Cagney in this type of vehicle. Pretty contrast to your "Public Enemy" 2 years ago. Cagney adds a spark and interest in somewhat routine tired formulation and plot. But the top of the film is three complicated production numbers at the back. First, with the conservative number "Honeymoon Hotel", followed by the very impressive eye of the brilliant "After Waterfall" followed by the final "Shanghai Lil", Cagney only takes part in the last issue that kicks him in the bar with Ruby Keeler. "Shanghai Lil" with Cagney is an excellent but a bit comedown & anti climactic after the exciting and incredibly grumpy boggling "By Waterfall" choreography. If I was a director I put the number "Shanghai Lil" in the middle and close the "waterfall" that blows another two numbers from the water, so to speak and in my opinion the best of three numbers. 3 production numbers are cake topping and James Cagney's performance is added to the cake. Excellent musical success, 4 star movies, perfect musical, worth watching, you will not be disappointed !!!!!!!!!
