I try to watch her every day for most of the time, and although I've been watching her for the last 4 years, I have not seen every single episode. The show is about Danny Tanner, who is the person who makes news for sports. His wife is murdered by a drunk driver and calls Jesse, Elvis's motorcycle maniac and obsessed with his hair. Joey, an adult boy who makes a comedy and constantly performs in movies to take care of his three girls, Donna Joe, called her DJ, Stephinie, who is the second oldest and Michelle, the youngest. <br /> <br /> They all live under one roof and no one can help them. Later in the show Jesse gets a friend and later marries her and has twins, Nicki and Alex. (this is starting to happen in new seasons) This show is amazing if you like The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, That's So Raven, Boy Meets The World And Designing Woman You Will Love. (Begin to improve in the final seasons) Watch it, you will love it!
