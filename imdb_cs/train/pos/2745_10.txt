I've seen a lot of movies, but "In Cold Blood" stands alone in the classroom. It excels in every department. The fact that it contained several big stars helps push over the top because you pay more attention to the characters and their story than the name on the stand. Blake and Wilson star in the duel killer. The fact that most movies are filmed in real places where a crime has occurred, even inside the house itself, adds another fever. The black-and-white photo darkens the mood and the shooting is spectacular. There are plenty of excellent cinematic works, but if I could only vote for one who would be at the top of the list, he would probably be "In Cold Blood".
