I lost faith in Sooraj R. Barjatya after the Main Prem Ki Deewani hoon, then a year back I saw a promise for Vivah who looked good. But I did not want to watch my hard earned money at the cinema. When the movie first came out on DVD, I leased it and looked at it and I loved the film and took back the words for Sooraj. I just saw it yesterday, and this time I thought I had to see this movie. Sooraj R. Barjatya This time it's true, I was not a huge fan of Hum App Ke Hai Kaun. But I always loved Mania Pyar kiya, after Mania Pyar kiya to me I think Vivah is Barjatyas the best job. I hardly ever cry in the video, but it felt like crying. If you've ever been in love before, there will be many moments touching you in this movie, the movie is just too sweet and you fall in love with it, my opinion is a much underestimated movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is happening nowadays, a lot of people do not believe in marriage, but I do it. The journey between betrothed and marriage, which will always be exceptional and this film clearly shows. When Prem first meets Poonam, they show how it is and it's reality, and parents say they get married and show it in a way that is so real, yes, as in this movie they meet Prem and Poonam, as most marriages happen. It was very sweet, you feel nervous, but the enthusiasm, the song "Do Ajnabe" shows it very well. When you get back to the story, it's a way you'll soon get stuck between Prem and Poonam (Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao) and the families there. This film has a twist that is really good, the last 30 minutes that you all get into the tissue box. What makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between Prem and Poonam, everybody else is too sweet. Simple Boy and Simple Girl when they meet for the first time during and after the song "Do Anjane Ajnabe" It's very sweet to watch, barely telling anything and Prem does everything she talks about her about her past and the girl he liked smoking. Then it leads to the fact that everyone has a family trip and then they really do fit each other. It does just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have. Another factor is the fact that Poonam chichi is really excited about her and you apologize for Poonam because she is treated badly and makes you see her happy and when she finally finds happiness, you will also feel happy with her that the movie basically makes you love the Poonam more than just Prem. When she finds happiness over Prem, you want her to remain happy and also hope that nothing changes because the figure is portrayed as a sweet simple girl. Which brings me to the show, and Amrita Roa as Poonam is awesome in the movie, her best work until you fall in love with this innocent figure and rotate it to find happiness. Shahid Kapoor as Prem is also amazing, she is in Poonam's film support, it's her film luck, they share a great deal of chemistry, and I've never seen a better pair from Hearts and Kajola. If Ishq Vishk has not touched you to tell you how cute they are together, it will be. "Mujhe Haq hai" song and before that is the amazing chemistry they show. The scenes that touched me were when Prem takes Poonam to his room and shows her where he lives, and he opens it and they have a lot of taste among them. Again, if you've ever been in love with someone, what could you do with these scenes for a long time? The film is just the sweetest thing you will ever see. Direction is in place, for me a good film is basically something that can attract me and stop believing the time that is seen here is fake and there is a camera filing it. For me, this film drew me and I felt really connected to the movie in those three hours. Songs that you'll really love only when you see the movie because the songs are in the situation after seeing a movie in which I played non-stop songs! The music is amazing, the story is just amazing, what else can I ask for? What I can say finally, we rarely get a movie that will make us feel good, this movie after you've seen that you will feel really good and want to be a better person. Is it basically the sweetest route at all, in essence, it shows you are traveling between engagement and marriage, and many people say it's the bestest part of your life? Does this film really show how people actually say it? Why people really say the way is so great! Watch this movie and find out why the journey is amazing!
