I believe I got this movie when I was young. I remembered watching her as a child, but I never found the movie. I remembered Good Rage Ann, Andy, Babette, Greedy, King Koo Koo. I was looking for this film high and low, and I still have no luck. But one day, when I moved from a child's home, I found it. We were again. I'm 17 years old. I'm still looking at it. All the time in reality. It's one of the funniest and best movies I've ever seen and enjoyed. And personally I think they should go on. Mmm, yes, really. Now I'm considering how to get a bird's captain a tattoo somewhere on my body!
