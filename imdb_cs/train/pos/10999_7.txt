This movie is about this clever person who decides to become a spy for a charming high-tech company called Digicorp. This unfortunate guy, Morgan (Jeremy Northam), is unhappy with his unhappy suburban life and his demanding wife, so he decides to become a spy. It is supposed to go to conventions of other top technology companies and find out what plans all companies have. Instead, Morgan finds himself in the love of a beautiful woman (played by Lucy Liu) and to the point of being double crossed by the two companies that make him double agent. How does Morgan get it? Can he rely on the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster (played by Lucy Liu)? More importantly, can Morgan live? Wow! What a clever movie! After 15 minutes watching this movie I was completely soaked up. It's very exciting and you can feel Morgan's fear and confusion when he does all he can to stay alive. The scene in which Morgan has managed to think of this wise effort is greatly scary and terrifying. Morgan is slowly passing through the transformation of a personality that is not so obvious until you think about it after the film finishes. The hairy guy with bad hair and glasses turns into a person who is actively fighting for his life. The end, that's the end is incredible! Twist is so much fun! He let me sniff and breathe like a fool! Good performances from all sides, especially from Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett. I highly recommend this movie!
