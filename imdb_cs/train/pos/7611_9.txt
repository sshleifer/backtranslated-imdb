"I looked in the eye on this island and what I saw was beautiful," says one of the main characters in ABC TV show "Lost". The series could be summed up as a dramatic story about a group of survivors who were stranded on an unknown island, but that would make the show a bad service. "Lost" follows a large group of characters who come into conflict with the island, each other and ultimately themselves when they fight their new life and dependence on themselves. The situation becomes more complicated when it turns out that it is not an ordinary island - and that it may not be alone. <br /> <br /> My first fear of listening to the concept of this series was the lack of new stories that can tell us after a while, but this proved to be unjustified. The story goes naturally, the dialogue is funny, the characters are unforgettable and the executions are excellent. The island is a figure in itself, and for understanding this comment you should see a series for yourself that only shows its originality and size. At the time of writing this text review, only the first two seasons are broadcast and are full of powerful episodes. My only slight criticism is that the second season will slow down a bit, but then, fortunately, it will return in an admirable shape for the final episodes. If I can recommend one TV series, you should be fine now it would definitely be. If you like excitement, adventure, nature-driven stories, extremely strong cast and crew, beautiful locations and an island that looks more spiritual than natural, "lost" is for you. Just make sure you start at the beginning.
