Love a TV show. It was turned on for the first time I saw it. I wish I could deal with them. It touches on the fact when you love someone and you think you want to spend the rest of your life, and then at the turn of events you meet someone else, and that person is more with whom you want to be with. You are in a situation where, when you had to choose one or the other. Someone gets hurt, it's not a stop. The decision is hard, but you want to be unhappy when you could be. Why go on and live the life you thought you wanted, or you think you're doing the right thing and you're both unhappy. The other person will not wait for life, waiting, my life is good. The decision you really want will ultimately be better. Using the best you have is a good thing. Money, cars, homes, etc. They will not make you happy, they have one person you really want to be to share them.
