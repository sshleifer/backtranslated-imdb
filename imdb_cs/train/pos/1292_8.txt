Preston Waters, an 11-year-old boy, has problems with his parents and brothers, especially because of money problems. He is crazy to have his own house and his own rules because his brothers have always stolen their saved money and his parents neglect his wishes. One terrible day was Preston's lap; On the same day, the colorful story, Quigley, tried to escape the police and accidentally ran to Preston's lap. Because of the need to be far from the police, Quigley is in a hurry to check the damage to Preston's bike. The problem was: It was a blank check! Preston is a smart boy and decides he will have a high price for this check: $ 1 million! All this money gives Preston the things he always wanted, like a castle with a pool, plenty of toys, and even a limousine! Problems begin when the FBI and Quigley want to know where the money is, making Preston a difficult situation and facing many problems. The film was one of my favorites during childhood. :)
