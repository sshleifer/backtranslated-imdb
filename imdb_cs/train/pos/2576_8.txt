I'm from Christopher Reeve's generation, it's fair to say he's the best actor to play Superman yet, but that will not stop me from using other actors in this role and George Reeves is a pretty good offer to knock Chris off the top, hardly gotten. It does not stop me from enjoying this movie, but it is a lot. It has all that the film needs, a conspiracy with the beginning, the environment, and the end, and all these parts are intelligently written. The film is sharp both in acting and in the story, something of a movie noir but with stockings. The story is exciting and meaningful, it is a movie with a message that is not very precious. I am still amazed that it was shot in 12 days, oh the fame in Hollywood, when we did not have to wait five years to see if the film would fall into hell of development ... The film is polished and professionally produced, directed by Lee "Roll" em "Sholem, best known for both speed and efficiency. It never lets technology slow down, in fact there are some creative things that would create a flight effect, including putting the camera on a truck boom and shooting high and fast to make it look as if we were seeing from Superman's point of view a few details of George in process work and a long shot of animated Superman. <br /> <br /> This is now available on DVD as another feature in the first season of the television series George Reeves. A DVD that deserves itself is the inclusion of the film as its original whole, the icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Give Blood Today God bless!
