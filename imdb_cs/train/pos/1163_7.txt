This movie was released by Roger Corman, so you know the filmmakers did not have much to do with it. <br /> <br /> Although some viewers may lose the finesse in this movie due to a very typical "obsessed killer," there are unique differences about this film. <br /> <br /> AMANDA, as of course the talented Justine Priestley, is a complex character. Some people like these films just because violence can be accidental, but there are consequences of past abuse (solved in a realistic but tasteful way) that make up the AMANDA psychology. Surprisingly, Amanda sweeps at the end with love, where most of these films turn into a typical struggle for death, and the evil figure dies as well as the evil at the end to begin. <br /> <br /> Some rough edges in this picture, but I have to give 7 out of 10 stars based on his thinking and yes, originality compared to the usual - especially the budget.
