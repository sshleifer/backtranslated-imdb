Many reviews explain the story and characters "Opening Night" in some details, so I will not. I just want to add my comment that I believe the movie is a terrific claim to life. At the beginning of Myrtle Gordon remembers how easy it is to act when she was 17 years old when she had youth and energy and felt she knew the truth. Experience left her emotionally fragile, she wondered why she was her life, and if she could even continue her life. A tragic accident causes a personal crisis that almost overcomes it. Almost - but not quite. At eleven o'clock, he finds out the strength of his art and reassures himself ("I will bury that bastard," says a colleague of actor Maurice as he goes on stage). It seems almost sadistic when Myrtle's director prevents people from helping her when she comes hopelessly drunk for her first performance. She knows, however, that she must have the courage to do it alone if she should do it at all. Some critics are wondering if this triumph is just a temporary break on Myrtle's descent route. I believe it's really her "premiere night" - it opens as a flower to new possibilities of life and action, but she sees the way forward. Gene Rowlands is excellent. The film is excellent. Thank you, Mr. Cassavetes, wherever you are.
