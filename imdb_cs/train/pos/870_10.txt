"Read My Lips" (which probably has another idiomatic resonance in her French title) is a skilful, twisted, contemporary story about office politics that unexpectedly becomes a criminal because unusually identical characters move up and down the ethical and sad sliding slope. The two guitars are magnetic, Emmanuelle Devos (I never saw, despite her lengthy curriculum vitae in French films) and even more disheveled than Vincent Cassel (who brought a sexy and / or threatening look and voice in some American films). The first half of the film is on her grass in a competing real estate office and it's unreal. The other half is on its lawn as ex-con and its soothing adaptation to this environment. Writer / director Jacques Audiard very smartly uses a woman who isolating hearing impairment as an input for us to perceive it (so it is even more unpleasant than usual when talking to listeners), using visuals like sensory reactors. <br /> <br /> None of the characters act as expected (this is not such a difficult sacrifice from "Men's societies", not in individual interactions, not in scenes, and not in the overall arc of unpredictable story lines (well, until the last but the listeners were waiting for this fulfillment) when we move from a hectic modern office to a hectic disco to romantic and criminal works. There is a side story that is thematically superfluous and useless, but it does It just takes a few minutes to catch my breath. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite years! <br /> <br /> (Originally written 7/28/2002)
