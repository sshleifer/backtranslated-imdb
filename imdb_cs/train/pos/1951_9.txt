Separate mother (Diane Keaton) finds she is working with a few minimum wages. When he shoots, he finds out that he is unable to support his sons (Michael Seater and Colin Roberts), the other with asthma. Then he goes to his friend and starts selling drugs. He soon becomes addicted to the drugs he sells. Her life is declining, especially when her children, her eldest son, find out the truth and threaten to leave her. Then he tries to redeem himself with the help of his children, but can he protect his family from the drug gentlemen for whom he worked? <br /> <br /> Wow! This lifetime movie has some of the best games I've ever seen! Diane Keaton survives a lot and her character has gone mad, but she was very convincing. She is a much better adapted drama than a comedy. However, the best performance in the movie comes from Michael Seater, who plays her eldest son. He is perfect as a responsible son who is still young but trying to be grown up in the family. His acting was particularly great in the scenes where he and his mother met with drugs. Colin Roberts, who plays a younger son, also does a great job. The film is worth watching, especially due to the acting Michael Seater and Diane Keaton!
