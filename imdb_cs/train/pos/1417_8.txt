I saw this movie with my family and it was great! This film is more than just a documentary film (which offers more than cold facts) with long mono / original and lots of charts ... The complete "power" of this film comes from impressive pictures filming underwater, air or Arctic. This movie you can learn more about our planet than just reading the book shows that we are embedded in the circular flow of life. This film is not just for "environmental fanatics", but people who want to look like a good news movie should watch it. This movie taught me that not only we live on earth ... we live through the Earth and all plants and animals grow and die with us.
