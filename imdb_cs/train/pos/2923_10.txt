Eddie Murphy really made me laugh at this HBO comedy show. I love his impressions of Mr. T, Ed Norton and Ralph Cramden of "The Honeymooners", Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson too.The Ice Cream Man, Goony Goo Goo is also fun. I saw it for the first time since it came out in 1984. I laughed so hard, almost falling from my chair. I still think it's very fun. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy, when he was on Saturday Night Live, made me so mocked, is one of the best people to come out of Saturday Night Live. "Eddie Murphy Delirious" is his best performance next to "Eddie Murphy Raw". <br /> <br /> I give "Eddie Murphy Delirious" 2 inches up and 10/10 stars.
