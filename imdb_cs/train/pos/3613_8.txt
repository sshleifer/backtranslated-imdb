When "Girlfight" appeared, the reviews were commended, but I did not see it. Finally, I saw it when it was released on the video, and understood that glowing reviews. The film opens in high school in the middle of the ghetto. We will quickly meet Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). He has a frantic expression on his face, and any idea of ​​Diana that we can derive from that expression will soon confirm when he comes into the fight. Because Diana gets into trouble, we meet a father, an aggressive type that is in itself; we can clearly not blame Diana for her attitude. But then the movie really rises, as a new idea spins in Diana's mind: boxing as a way to escape this cruel existence. Her older brother has already gotten into the box, but her father will most likely not agree. Only Diana itself can decide what to do. During the first few minutes, I discovered that I was a very plain, non-Hollywood film, but the short look of John Sayles in a real supporting role confirmed it. Even before they get to some boxing scene, you feel like you get into the face looking at the ugly life Diana lives on. And when they finally come to the main story of the movie, there will be no aversion. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie. I admit that using boxing as a means to show someone trying to do something on their own is in the cinema for many years ("Rocky", "Million Dollar Baby"), but I still think they did a great job here . In fact, it could bring the genre to its pinnacle. Really good. It's a shame that Michelle Rodriguez has missed her in Hollywood movies.
