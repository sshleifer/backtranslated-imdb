I will make it short and sweet because I do not think there is much you can really tell someone about this show that has never seen it except its funny, funny and unique, perhaps the most entertaining show ever. <br /> <br /> You really have to watch to understand his humor and it took me several episodes that really got into it but when you do not get back there. For example, the way Hyde's character always wants to see his friends get into some trouble, the more it happens, the more fun it will happen. His all around the classic I mean the cast, the writers, the director, his recipe for success. One actor I think is always a tough time is Ashton Kutcher, but I think he's great at this show, I do not think it's possible for Kelso to be played by someone else, stupid. All the main characters are great and it would not be worth checking out if I did not mention the stone cold fox Mila Kunis, now it's a spicy meeting with a ball ha ha all joking about a wonderful show.
