So I borrowed "Still Crazy" instead. When I described the Hardcore Logo to a guy in the video store, he said it sounds like Still Crazy. So I rented it. Was I disappointed? Well, yes, because Still Crazy is more focused on a classic rock band than a punk band, but that's fine. Still Crazy tells the story of Strange Fruit - a rock band that in the 1970s fell to the top of its popularity at a big rock festival. Twenty years later, members of the band are trying to make a living, and they are offered a concert at the twenty-year anniversary of this festival. They take the offer and decide to permanently reform and travel to Europe. Some pretty funny hijinks to follow, and all characters undergo fine changes. By watching this movie, you feel more like a viewer of a carefully edited document than a participant. And that's not bad at all.
