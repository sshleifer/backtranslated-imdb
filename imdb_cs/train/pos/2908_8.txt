The Journey of Discovery, this film follows the lives of a single family living in a sleepy, island town in British Columbia. Negligible and dreamy, the residents are happy to allow their lives to run around them until a young teacher with a fresh face, with new thoughts comes in and brings life from the mainland. Slowly their excited state awakens, father (and director of local school) looking for excitement, mother for stability, the oldest daughter for love and the youngest for power. While not an incredible or breakthrough cinematography, the film is quietly pleasing and fit for a tiring night when the wind blows. Unfortunately, I doubt anyone outside of Canada will be readily available.
