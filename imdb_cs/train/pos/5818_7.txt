In fact, this film has silly moments, both in the clay part and in Joe Pesci and the children's section, and is much worse than other MJ films such as The Wiz, Captain Eo and Ghosts. But like a heavy hard Michael Jackson fan for nearly eleven years, (Yeah, that's half my life, you guys!), I can not complain too much. Just seeing this beautiful guy and listening to his wonderful music is a trip to heaven for me. But like a movie, it's not good at all, and I'm afraid it would be much less for me if my dear Mike was not the one who played it. But since none other than Mike is a moonwalker, he has to get me out of 7 out of 10.
