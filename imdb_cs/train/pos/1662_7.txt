Artemisie can be considered a treasure or a real artistic license. <br /> <br /> Which could be average? <br /> <br /> In a documented history, Artemisia Gentileschi subjected herself to a bolt screw and still confirmed that she was just like Mary Garrard and Gloria Stein had eloquently assured. In a film under another torture she refused to condemn her lover / guardian. How can the film deviate from the accepted history, yet still inform the human heart? <br /> <br /> The answer is not so difficult to find. In the film, the director and the cast filled the hole in the record with the power of imagination. This led to a conclusion that is different from the record. <br /> <br /> So be it. I think the record and the movie are convincing. In both films and (seems) in history, Artemisia was a painter, in front of others. <br /> <br /> That vision, framed in amazing (sic) movie, I am really grateful. <br /> <br /> I rarely saw a movie that forced my eyes.
