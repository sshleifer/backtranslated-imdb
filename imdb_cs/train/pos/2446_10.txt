From the beginning of the show there was Carmen. She was one of the best characters. Why did they get rid of her? The show is not the same as before. Their way is worse. The best episodes were with Carmen in them. You can not replace anyone from the beginning! It's like South Park without Kyle or a children's game without Chuck! That's not right! The niece who replaced her is just, ugh! Sad. It does not fit into a thing at all. She was one of the main characters and her niece can not replace her. She was a wonderful actress. The way is better than niece. Lose it back or lose a ton of viewers.
