Higher learning is a weak face for those of us who have been in the closet for too long regardless of the ethnic background. it is a topic that most of us would like to ignore, but we can not afford to see if there really is a progressive change in the way we can be able to accept and understand diversity. Some have criticized this film as hateful or stupid, the matter is, ignorance rules the highest in the world, and some further help to control our society. Everyone involved in this film has done a good deed by showing what steps he needs to continue doing so he does not have to make movies like higher learning. Sure it sounds like a dream pipe, but we have to start somewhere and that will help.
