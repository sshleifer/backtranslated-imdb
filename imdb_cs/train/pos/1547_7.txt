Just like everyone else who commented on this movie, I can only wonder why it never appeared on the video. I remember seeing at the age of 12 at "The Late Show" around 1972. I also remember a poisonous gas attack and strangely dressed horses. (I do not remember the worst bits I've seen here that have been described here are probably off for a TV audience.) But the scenes I really loved were those that included the death of Lord Kitchener on HMS Hampshire, 90 years ago . The scene of the convicted cruiser approaching the sea field in the storm was really cool, as I recall. Remember the music score, but the comments of others are now curious. Get this on the video!
