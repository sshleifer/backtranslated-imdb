I enjoyed watching Brigham Young and found it to be a positive and largely true picture of the LDS faith. I think the remake of this epic journey across the plains would be beneficial because many people today are not familiar with the exams and persecutions faced by the early Mormon Church. It is an incredible story of a strong and devoted people. As a member of the Church, the most important aspect of the film (most of the historical inaccuracies did not bother me) was a portrait of Brigham Young as one who "deliberately deceived" church members to believe he was called to be Joseph's successor as a prophet. Although I understand the dramatic reasons for this story line, it gives the impression that his doubts in this respect are a historical fact, when in fact both Brigham and most members of the Church understood and firmly believed that he was called to lead the church. Brigham deliberately deceived the saints; rather, he was inspired intimately. It is important to the Mormons because it depends on an important aspect of our faith: that God really speaks to the prophets today, and that Brigham Young as Joseph Smith was the inspired God's prophet. or do not believe this or not, just know that the film does not accurately portray what Brigham himself believed.
