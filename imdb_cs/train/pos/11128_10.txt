First I would like to say how great it is. It is stunning and sometimes shocking. And at least 11 years, and that's my favorite movie, I can definitely become a boring movie, but this is all boring. It's like a trip of humanity. His extraordinary realism proves this monumental masterpiece. This is a story of two far-reaching stories (VOIGHT and Hoffman) who build friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT) - A naive Texas dog arrives in New York City to become a rich entertainment for women. Soon he will meet Rico 'RATSO' Rizzo (HOFFMAN), who is a poor man who barely can pay rent. Ratso becomes Joe's "manager," but soon both men can not find Joe's job that results in theft of food. As they try and survive in the streets of New York, we realize how difficult it is. Joe can not get a girl until she meets a lady at a party. Joe makes some money and Joe soon takes Ratso to Ratso's Dream Place, Florida. The final five minutes are the heart of breaking some of the greatest moments in the movie. From MIDNIGHT COWBOY we get a lively and sometimes disturbing urban look at life.
