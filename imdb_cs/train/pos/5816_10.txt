The first time I saw this movie, I loved it. When I was 11 years old, I was interested in music and dance. As I grew older, I was also more interested in acting. While the first half is just a retrospective of Michael's career (from Jackson 5 to "Bad"), it was still fun to watch. The "Badder" sequence could be omitted although the children were pretty good. "Speed ​​Demon," and "Leave Me Alone," were funny, especially when the policeman tells Michael, "I need my autograph here," when he stopped him because he danced in a dance-free area. But it's "Smooth Criminal," which is a cherry on the cake. Joe Pesci did a great job like doughie (and that his hair was wild). Dance is perfect as well as special effects. The only thing I could do without spiders. Every Michael fan should see it if you have not done it yet. I'm giving it 10+!
