When I look back over the last 28 years (from my first show show), I can only say: Once you get it - it will stay with you forever. I remember that my first reaction was: 1) unpleasantly exaggerated, 2) made 3) unsurpassed characters <br /> <br /> But two years later I watched some episodes again and found it almost as unpleasant. A year later, I was able to capture the entire show from the beginning and quickly became involved in his hot-blooded tale of human error and the prospect of happiness. Yes, the show has a style that is not for everyone, and I'm sure it would be difficult to cope with the dated production value. But I'm still thinking about the show at least once a month with vague tears that long for what looked like the simplest times ... <br /> <br /> BTW I'm a married man ... (for all, it's a show for women)
