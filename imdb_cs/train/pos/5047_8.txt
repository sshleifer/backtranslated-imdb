Actor Paxton made his directorial debut with this cool, dark and competent thriller about a widowed mechanic (Paxton himself) who accompanied his two sons to wild murder killings and claimed that the victims were not human beings but "demons" and that they were chosen to destroy these "demons". This is all in the memory of one of the sons, now grew up (Matthew McConaughey) to the skeptical agent of the FBI (Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> It is difficult to automatically forget this movie; better than most of the serial killer's features, it's a nasty and disturbing story narrated straightforward and with a minimal amount of movie tricks. Paxton, praiseworthy, barely shows any blood at all until the end. Everyone, especially two child actors (Jeremy Sumpter from the recent "Peter Pan" and Matt O'Leary from "Spy Kids 2" and "Home Breaking Up") acted well. The only reason I removed all the points at all is that I can understand that some people can find it all hard to stomach. In any case, it's an atypical thriller with a decent script. <br /> <br /> 8/10
