When I saw and loved Greg Lombard's last film "Knots" (he also wrote and directed this song), I decided to look at his earlier work and this film deserves effort and hiring. Macbeth in Manhattan is a tongue in the face, excellent to take Shakespeare's favorite, update and move to NYC. I was overwhelmed by the intelligence of the screenplay and was amazed at how the production story in the film mirrors the story of the game itself - and very cleverly. The trials and misery of Manhattan's life play Shakespeare's play in parallel, and Central Park was rarely used better than the forest around Macbeth's Castle. Mr. Lombardo seems to have his heart for stories in New York and New York (Knots is a funny and warm sexual comedy about sixty thirty New Yorkers based mainly in the charming Brooklyn Neighborhood with Manhattan offices and a good athlete in the center of the city) and spent a lot time around Shakespeare's play. The film is well thought out and the story reflects a deep understanding of the essential drama in the Macbeth core. Al Pacino reminded me of "Looking for Richard" - another wonderful Shakespeare play in the movie. "I highly recommend that you take a look at Macbeth in Manhattan.
