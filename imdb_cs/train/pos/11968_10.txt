Full House is a great show. I'm still growing up. I started watching her when I was 8, and now I'm 12 and I'm still looking at it. I fell in love with all the characters, especially Stephanie. she is my favorite. she had such a sense of humor. if there are people who are watching the show hard on this point, you should have it because you look at it. I started this after the first show I saw, which became the first episode in 2002. It's a really good show. I really think this show should go down to many generations in families. and it's also great because it's a good show for all ages. and for all parents, teaches children how to continue with their lives. nothing terrible will happen, like violence or swearing. it's really a great sit-com. I give it 5 out of 5 stars. What do you think? Oh, and the best time to watch this is when you're at home from school or even from an old office. You will feel much better. Trust me that I am hard at home, but still knows you will feel better. and everyone who thinks the show is silly is too bad for you because you will not be so far in your life, even if you are happy with your life. you really should watch it and you will join it. I'm just telling you what happened to me and everyone else who started watching this amazing show. well, I have to go for some lunch. remember, you have to start watching the whole house soon!
