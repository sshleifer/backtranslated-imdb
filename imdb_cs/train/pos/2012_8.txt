This is one of my favorite times. Great music and some fun bits. Every moment I laugh at Millie, a friend pretending to be d√©butante, keep her elegant hankie while chatting and inadvertently polishing the furniture with her while she chates. I simply can never overcome her French accent without it being a problem when they try to take her as a boss's daughter. Seeing teenagers Mel Torme and a very young singing by Frank Sinatra is such a sensation. My mom saw Frank Sinatra in the theater at the same time when this movie came out. She said they can not clean up "bobby-soxers" between movies (you did not have to leave the showings in those days). This film will show you how attractive and attractive young Frank was, and also allows you to appreciate his early talent. And Victor Borge gets into a bit of his routine, which is a bonus. <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie with a sweet, simple story. Very pleasant.
