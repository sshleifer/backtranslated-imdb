I have to say that Uma Thurman is the northernmost woman on the planet. this movie was ugly cute and I think cute cute. It had all the "sex" content that most of the comedies of Ivan Reitman, but with some other, CHEMISTRY. Uma and Luke both have this hostile but credible chemistry that seems to be overcome in every scene. It seems that they both create this strange, twisted and interesting relationship with the powerful "sexual" tension in which you laugh until you feel your face. Anna Farris and the rest of the cast seem to play a perfect role, and even the little role of Wanda Sykes will make you laugh. Although these comedies are not for everyone but I have to say that I went with a man who usually does not make these films and laughs like a fool. This film is certainly not for everyone. especially younger children, because some moments are too few ... and they say ADULT for younger audiences. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this film, the hard end I found was a bit weak compared to the rest of the movie. (3 1/2 * of 5 *)
