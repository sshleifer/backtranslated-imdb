The first 50 minutes of this movie was pretty boring. She focused on the personal problems that Doyle had, including his sick woman, threatened by the death of a fan, a hearty publisher, and guilt about his mentally ill father. Although these items had a significant impact on Doyle's life, I was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were excellent. Finally, we looked at the head of the doctor as Holmes created and why he had to "kill" Holmes. The actors are excellent. Includes interesting Selden, played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, the convincing role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as a "role model" for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell. Places are good, especially for TV movie and camera work is nice. If the first 50 minutes were so good in the last 40 minutes, it would be a small masterpiece.
