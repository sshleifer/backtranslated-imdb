I really miss the production of good old fashion scary movies. If Ismail Merchant and James Ivory were given the task of making such a film, it could be this movie, except for the lack of an internationally-known, top-notch cast. This is one of the movies you can watch alone on a dark pizza dinner and some popcorn, and you do not even bother making meals until morning because you just want to hide under the covers. Bravo to director Herbert Wise, writers Susan Hill and Nigel Kneale, designer Jon Bunker, Art Direction by John Ralph, and excellent cast that shook me and I felt so isolated even though I live in one of the most populated cities in the world at the beginning 21st century. I gave him "9" out of "10", because with the production and budget constraints of the television they really did a great show.
