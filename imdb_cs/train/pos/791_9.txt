When I did not know about this movie before I saw him on the Rialto Canal, I found it a pleasant, sad and enriching film. <br /> <br /> Casting was excellent. I loved all the characters, they were a bit exaggerated in places (but that's a movie). The way it looked, and the pleasantly skillful drive of the main character lasted until it changed, like real life can and does. Yes, I thought Andy MacDowell was great. I really wondered if this movie would start to play because people so often joke about her acting skills (in my opinion, it is totally weird, because in my opinion there is always a solid actress). the end when Andy's character said, "I sometimes feel he's never been here", etc., it was as completely as he really is in such a situation (with which I can personally identify), then there was that gorgeous classic "Nocturne" I think Chopin, which was a beautiful way to end up (the light comedy bar at the end, which was probably unnecessary). I said "well" to filmmakers - I saw 1000s with worse movies!
