You will not be darker or more tragic than "Othello," and this film captures the game quite well, with excellent performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob. Fishburne expresses contempt for Othello's viewer because he is overwhelmingly overwhelmed by Iago's lies, even giving a realistic epileptic episode. Jacob is a loving and faithful woman who becomes either instrument of Jago's revenge against Othello or the object of his anger (it is not clear as no motive for Iago's behavior is offered). Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) Shows his usual talent for Shakespeare in this film, he is somewhat marginalized. The characters of Cassia and Emily also blend in and out of the scene, even though, like Iago, they seem to be decisive for the plot. I did not check the movie against the game to see how many lines were cut, but I know Shakespeare tends to develop his characters, even seemingly unimportant, very well. If I had a critique of the film would be that the story is developing too fast and that relationships between some characters are not more outlined. The director had a great cast and no one offered poor performance. The relationship between Cassio and Othello and the relationship between Emilia and Desdemona must be further developed in the film. I feel they are closer to each other than the film suggests, although you feel it very late into the movie. Othello and Desdemon also need more time together. Although their suffering is convincing, their interdependence seems to be as if they have just met. On the other hand, they might have met just like Romeo and Juliet. <br /> <br /> Brief: good performance, too short. <br /> <br />
