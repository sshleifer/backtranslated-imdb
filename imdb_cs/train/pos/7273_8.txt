Carlos Mencia was excellent, it's special hours. He worked hard to show everyone that it was a real deal. I know people said he stole the material in this special, but that's not true. Carlos brings comedy the way it wants it, not how someone else wants it, so it's so good. People say it's not funny because Dee dee dee says too much, and they still do not realize it's part of it, and they do not want it, but it still brings about and succeeds in making people laugh. Because all the hatred there are messages, Carlos is here to stay, you do not make sense to try to bring him down.
