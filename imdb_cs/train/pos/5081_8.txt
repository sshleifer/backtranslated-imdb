This movie was amazing and even with less than a convincing end, it is worth seeing. The film begins as Claudette Colbert is about to marry Robert Ryan. When the minister asked if anyone had any objections, the guy jumps up and announces that Colbert CAN NOT get married because he is already married! Colbert insists that this is not true, but when they investigate, he finds that the justice of peace and many others remember her wedding and there is a signed wedding license! It slowly turns out that Claudette's mind is slipping, and the people around her seriously doubt her sense. Then, when the first husband is reportedly murdered, all the evidence and suspicion will fall on Colbert. The film is an exciting mysterious mysterious movie, because what I have described so far is only the first half of the film. What follows is incredibly intelligent and captivating. The conclusion, however, is a bit disappointing, as the leading force in the background all of it turns "right from the left field" - and is disturbing because it was so unexpected and impossible to guess based on the information provided to the spectator. And yet the movie was so good, I can even apologize for the end. In particular, Robert Ryan did a great job as a "boy-busting" fiance, although other performances were also outstanding.
