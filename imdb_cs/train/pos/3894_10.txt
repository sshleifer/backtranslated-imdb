I wish I could laugh again as if I had seen this show for the first time. I have not done so since then. <br /> <br /> It's special that I laughed almost as hard after watching the show again and again. <br /> <br /> Eddie Izzard is cultivated, tenacious, she is the man of the world. He is quick to talk about politics and still feels he does not need to "engage" in political debate. It's over. I'd like to contrast it with George Carlin, who uses his comedy to try to persuade people about their ideas, and does not seem to enjoy being entertained. The funniest guy on earth
