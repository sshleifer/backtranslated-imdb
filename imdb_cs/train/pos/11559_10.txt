A special couple is a comic jewel. One of the funniest scripts ever made of celluloid - only Strangelove, Spinal Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matthau are best friends: obsessively compulsive Felix and careless, irresponsible Oscar. Oscar's wife has already left him because he can not live with his irresponsible attitude. Felix's wife leaves him at the beginning of the film and moves to Oskar's friend after trying to suicide. That's when the fun begins. The entire script is great and full of brilliant one-time ads. You are probably already familiar with "F.U." joke, but it still works brilliantly due to Matthau's comedy timing. My favorite moments are when Lemmon tries to clean up his sinus in the dining room and when the sisters' pigeons are enchanted by the very complacent Matthau and Lemmon is entirely from his element. This requires repeated viewing!
