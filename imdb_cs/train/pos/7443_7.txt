Old says: "If you think you have problems, visit the hospital." This has been updated over the past few years to "If you think you're having trouble see the TV talk show ... and especially Jerry Springer!" This movie is one of those that is so bad, it's good! That's why I gave him seven - that's fine, but not great. It's a great way to collapse 95 minutes, just like a daily talk show is reported as "an hour of your life you will never be back!" All the familiar themes are here ... unfaithful spouses / friends, the wildest TV viewers, women blinking Jerry etc. The shocking one watched Molly Hagan, who normally plays sweet characters ("My Name Is Earl" ) as her equally exhausted daughter who performs sexual favors practically for every person with whom they have come into contact. Men (including employees) were presented as essential lunkheads who deserved what they had gained. I do not want to spoil or reveal anything but the film is played as a day show. Here in Phoenix it turns out every two hours back and forth and everything else seems pale. Again I give this movie seven ... that's good, but not great. Jerry Springer is best used in small hourly doses.
