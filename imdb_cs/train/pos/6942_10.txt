In the 1950s, age restrictions for movies in Brazil were as follows: no restrictions, 10 years, 14 years and 18 years. Usually, Westerners were allowed for a period of ten years when they had a little more violence than they would for 14 years, but seldom have seen the Western restrictions for under 18 years of age. Winchester 73 was one of them and I think it explains very well how this film was considered to be different than average. Hero James Stewart fought against his brother, who killed their father. He sought revenge and seemed quite traumatized, far from the average good. Anthony Mann has experienced changes in this type of character in other films he has made to Stewart. Shelley Winters, the leading lady, was far from the virtues, still watching the man who remained with the rifle. Dan Duryea as Waco Johnnie Dean is one of those great villains who will always remember. The story of a movie that always follows the man who remains with the rifle is one of the best for the western. It was Fritz Lang, who did not come. When it was offered to Mann, he made a point that started again from scratch, and did not accept anything to prepare for Lang. With Winchenst, Mann created a different Western concept, but he kept all his traditions. Winchester is still a great movie that can be seen over and over, but nothing will be comparable to what they did when they were originally released.
