This is your typical cheerful and varied MGM musical from the early 1950s and it is definitely the best of those who will be there. The film was directed by an expert on the Vincent Minnelli genre and Gene Kelly star lead. They both made a bunch of films together in those days that are probably their most famous. <br /> <br /> The film itself actually won the best Oscar for the whole year, which meant they were winning movies such as "Place in the Sun", "Queen of Africa", "Quo Vadis," "Blue veil "," Death of a trader "of that year. True achievement of course, but also a bit of abduction for this beautiful, light and fun movie. Looking at this movie will surely make you entertained, which is also due to the film's beautiful color look and many nice characters in this movie. The musical numbers are also pretty good, which is not a big surprise when you have workers like Vincent Minnelli and Gene Kelly. But really, could not all have been told less than half an hour less or so? I mean, we already know where the film is heading, but still it can be extended for as long as possible. It's not that the film is dragging in all parts, it's a little longer. The movie could also be definitely made with a few less musical numbers in it. <br /> <br /> One of the better MGM musicals that is not without its flaws though. <br /> <br /> 8/10
