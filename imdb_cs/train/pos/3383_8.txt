Especially when there was not much science fiction (1973), it's a great vision of the future when everything went wrong. Too many people and nothing works. The only people who can live in comfort are wealthy. I meet in New York in 2022 and remind you of the worst vision of Calcutta. I have to appreciate the acting of Charlton Heston after seeing him in Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. He was (perhaps) able to portray a number of heroes or semi-humans. Here he is torn between being a policeman who is just a little spoiled (with isolated meals he treats the rich), and he is utterly corrupted (he actively rejects evil). <br /> <br /> The film seems to be happening at night and drops every drop, except for one of the rare air-conditioned apartments. Even though I have not seen it yet, I have known the famous end (which will not be revealed here), but the end is certainly a precursor. Great scenes with Edward G. Robinson: Going into a council (composed of older Jews with heavy accents, it seems) where the truth is revealed. And then you go to Thanatopsis to see. <br /> <br /> Gritty, the dystopian science fiction Star Wars.
