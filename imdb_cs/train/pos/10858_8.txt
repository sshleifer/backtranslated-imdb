enjoyed the film and an effective Confucian criminal path, the old line will survive the threat posed by the inconspicuous young greedy man who undoubtedly represents modern society. I thought the last scene was weird and could not understand if we should believe that the big D was punished for being greedy or part of the plan long. I loved the scene and once in the Chinese film, violence was not a choreography of martial arts. The things I always have to do about HK movies are that the British influence seems to have a "yes sir" and "sorry" performance in the local language and its fun that long after we left we are still push.
