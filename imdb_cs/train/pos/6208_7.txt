India's drammer Henry Fool in 1997 seemed to be a safe choice of films that nobody bothered to come back again. The disappeared, scattered drifter (Thomas Jay Ryan) goes into the city. His anarchist rumors and delusions inspire a crazy garbage collector (James Urbaniak) to write poems while Henry tries to pamper his sister's fellow (Parker Posey) for a long time. As the poet thrives, Henry refuses. Nothing special about any personality or story. The span for Harold and Maude's Spirit would be quoted as being more likely to happen on the screen. But Parker Posey is not the semi-official Queen of India for nothing. "So when the writer / director Hal Hartley came up with a new incarnation for his cast, the film was born, though we have been composing the same characters for many years, in a totally different kind of dark comedy; Henry could be an international spy-and maybe a double or even a triple agent-years before meeting others, either dead or hiding from agents and offices in many countries, all wanting their tiny, incoherent diary that can to contain an encrypted secret that could destabilize peoples and economies Posey's Fay is either the wife he left to go to lamas or his widow according to whoever tells the truth Fay's efforts to find Henry and / or feverishly invasive magazines include globe-trouser gloves of multinational hit-lovers and followers at every step Never knows who to believe or whom to trust. While these unlikely characters in Jason Bourne / Jack Ryan are rescuing, Hartley's screenplay retains the ironic humor of a first appearance that is thrown out of threats and exposes them to physical threats. His frenzied puppet of paranoia, duplicity, and alliance of today's geopolitical chairs will begin to crumble to the end. Yet fans of the first film will be pleasantly surprised by Hartley's novelty recycling methods. (18.5.07)
