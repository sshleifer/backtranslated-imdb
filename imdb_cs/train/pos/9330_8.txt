"Dangerous Offender" is the story of a seemingly antisocial girl and how she got it. It is based on a true story, and though I was irritated by the description of one note, ie, Sometimes frowning, about the title character and the difficult character of my lawyer, I am forced to accept that life imitates art and that there are people like this. <br /> <br /> The film is good for me, because although there is a little softening of the title of character title to the end, one is gradually shifted to sympathy for her because the film shows how she got to her present state - which is proved to be self-destructive, rather than antisocial. A truly moving film that will bring a loose throat when you think about it - which will be often. Despite many shortcomings (including the fact that it's hard to watch, sometimes due to body functions and suicide attempts), it's another production I'm proud to call Canadian.
