For anyone who does not know what a movie is with an actor, this is the best example. This story is ridiculous and really does not make sense. It's full of clich√© situation, hackneyed lines, melodrama, comedy ... you name it! However, Amitabh Bachchan can do something convincing, and this film is by no means an exception. Everybody turns into decent performance - Shashi Kapoor, Waheed Rehman, Ranjit, Om Prakash, Smit Patil ... But Megastar is ubiquitous with the ubiquitous presence. Without it, this movie would not be a starter ... The story is about seclusion / mistaken identity / misunderstanding / love / hate / loyalty / good vs. evil - everything, really! Amitabh is a great performance on all sites in an otherwise silly movie! And did I mention it funny fun?
