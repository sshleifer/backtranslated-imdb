Professor Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) has discovered Radium X - a powerful force that can be used for atomic energy. Unfortunately, Rukh was contaminated by Radi and begins to shine in the darkness - and his touch causes immediate death. Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) will develop an antibody - but Rukh is going crazy about Radi and the antibody and wants to kill everything he thinks he's hurt. The "effects" that cause Karloff to live in the dark are ridiculous, but it is still a fun little cooling unit. It moves quickly, it has a great atmosphere (it points to Rukh's "house" and the movie starts in a dark and rainy night), and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) are doing great performances. There is also a good acting by Frank Drake (as a wife's hand) and Violet Kemble Cooper (as his mother). So it's okay, but it's just a fraction below all the other Karloff / Lugosi movies. This conspiracy is too exaggerated for me. I still liked it. I give it 7.
