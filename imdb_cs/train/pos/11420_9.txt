This film is about the subtlety and difficulty of navigating with ever-changing boundaries of morals, racial relations and desires. Sure, it's not a movie for everyone. There are no chasing cars, no buildings exploded, no murder. Drama is based on tension-induced views, minimal gestures, space boundaries, lighting, and the remaining things - sometimes very seemingly - unruly. This is identity, memory, community, affiliation. Different parts of the film work together to reinforce the leitmotifs of themselves and others, identity, desire, limitations, and losses. Rewarding attentive and sensitive viewer. He does not want to be angry with those whose tastes require explosive, massive, spicy actions. It's a beautifully rendered human story. That is all.
