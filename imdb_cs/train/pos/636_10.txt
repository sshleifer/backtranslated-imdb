Why are the previews so foolish for a movie that's so great! Everyone should know what a great movie is. It's fun and entertaining from the moment, original and well acting. I wish that the film would be a good print it deserves! <br /> <br /> For anyone who loves a princess bride, labyrinth and other really fun and original fantasy adventure, it's one of the best. Robert DeNiro is hysterical. Relative newcomer Charlie Cox is an incredible lead man. Claire Danes is fantastic as always. Michelle Pfiefer is a pretty splash with her last return to the screen. There are also many wonderful moments from tiny characters ... even to facial expressions.
