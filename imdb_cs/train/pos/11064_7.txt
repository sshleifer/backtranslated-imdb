"I will take you there", tells of a horrific man who loses his wife to another and finds an improbable ally in the blind time. Unlike most romantic comedies, this little India is mostly sitcom with a tongue in the face where Rogers and Sheedy play with little emphasis on romance. A trip along the road with lots of fun and some ugly moments is still moving, it remains fresh and is a valuable watch for indie lovers.
