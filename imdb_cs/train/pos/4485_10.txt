This is my favorite older cartoon Tom & Jerry from the early 1940s. The original version of Mammy Two Shoes is Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection 2, disc one, and features a great, detailed animation of early cartoons. Gags on this site are not a slim Avery style, but they are softer and they focus on someone who has sometimes watched scary movies (or radio programs) late! Tom listens to scary radio shows, and Jerry decides to play a lot of tricks to scare him. These nine lives are well done and I do not know how many times I've been trying to make a vacuum and a sheet that I was terrifying. When Tom's owner awakens the hostages - Mamma was not a doll, it was her house - she would come up with a nice surprise, with great laughter. Prepare a break, it's worth it!
