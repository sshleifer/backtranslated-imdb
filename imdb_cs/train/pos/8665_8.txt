I urgently got this title with Grindhouse Vol. 1 collection of clean Euroshow films. But this movie has a nice mark of approval and should deserve better transmission than what is out there. Stupednous it is not ... satisfying it is! When watching this movie I could not wonder ... how did Sergio Martino not do it? It has its signature all over the world and interrupted Edwedge Fenech (not as well known as it should be, but in Hostel II she got a nice friend). Double crosses and triple crosses to bind and cement this film from start to finish, with Lee Van Cleef chilling cold under pressure from 1st second. Had this guy gone to Italy to finally reach his potential, or let the studio system let the guy slip through? Besides Lee's most widespread movies, film visitors should try out on a scale and see how if Sergio Leone lowered his epic scale to Once Upon a Time in America for half the run (and a 1/4 budget) that's what would turn out to be . So refreshing, it should be taken during the day at home and make it on the sofa matin√©e
