Another reason to watch this wonderful film is Florence Rice. Florence who? That was my first reaction when the opening credits were on the screen. I soon found out who Florence Rice is, a real beauty that turns into just a great performance. Like everyone else is doing in this file. Since 1939, his time has been different, but there is a spell. It takes you to another world. It starts as a light comedy, but then it becomes very serious. Florence Rice is in the range of comedy and heroine. She is absolutely gorgeous, at the same time strong, vulnerable, evolving from girl to woman. Watch her expressions on her face at the end of the movie. She has made more than forty films and I'm looking for thirty-nine more. Alan Marshal is from Flynn / Gable and proves the perfect match for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel provide some great comic moments, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fans of 30-40 year olds, Do not miss this!
