I have seen this little Belgian jewel two days after I saw an American teen. Make no mistake, adolescence is a roller coaster, be it American or European. Naissance des Pieuvres (or as the US Water Lillies) is the story of a young 15 year old girl (played by Pauline Acquart, who occasionally reminds young Scarlett Johansson) is doing fine; a girl who wants to be in a swimming school team is removed just to be close to another attractive girl (Adele Haenel). It is more than obvious that Mary is more than attracted to Florian. Among all these things is Marie, who is rather crazy, uninteresting, Anne, who only wants her boyfriend like any other girl of her age. Along the way, we show the usual amount of teen entertainment (broken hearts, lifting shops, alcohol and / or drug use, informal sex, etc.). This is a silent little movie that lasts longer than it works, it's up to your system (Michaela Baye fans, note: motion is slow so it's clear) but if you do not have a problem with it, Water Lillies is a magician . No rating here but lost a hard "R" due to language, nudity, adult situations.
