I enjoy watching people doing breakdance, especially if they do, as well as in the best scenarios of this movie that will take you to a discoteque called "Roxy." Especially at Christmas time, because "MC Santa Claus" will also appear. Even though it's an old film and even when I shot it on television, when it showed the Finnish state film archive in summer 2004, I went to see it on my own big screen. It's much more fun on the big screen than on television. Though many people think that watching it on the big screen is wasting money for ticket costs, I disagree with it and I think when I paid a ticket, I got the money when I saw it because it's on the big screen, especially sitting on the front of the cinema, an unforgettable experience and much better than just a video.
