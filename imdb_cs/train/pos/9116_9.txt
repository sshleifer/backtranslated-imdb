The idea is a very clever title from which the film has a serious feeling. But it's so fine you do not know how to read it! Are these guys a full-fledged comedy or something else? The little dialogue that the film has is not too delicate, and it adds to the strength of the film. If the whole sound was turned off from the movie, it would actually make nothing of the movie. Physical activity or artistic expression is so powerful that it itself carries the whole story. <br /> <br /> I'm blessing and the blessing of emotions is followed by shame. I first call this film as part of the "black" film festival. After watching the movie, I was so impressed by the work. But then I asked myself what else? Where can anyone see this job? There is no common association of art without purpose. Design intent you see from start to finish. The use of African-style casting music all looks like planned and for some reason. The evolution of the character is amazing. Casting is, in my opinion, the strongest aspect of the film; characters are easily defined within 2 minutes after 6 minutes of real movie. We need to see more of these films, and we really need more support for the development of short films around the world. board.
