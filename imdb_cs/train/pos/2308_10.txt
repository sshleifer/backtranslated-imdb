I tried it as an impulse to go through the movie store and could not be pleasantly surprised! My mother and I watched this movie together and we enjoyed it. This is not a typical "cat" with a loving story of love and tears all the way, but it definitely touches the nerve in the twist at the end. It is the end where, though unexpected and tragic, the overall effect of the film does not hurt. I think Reese Witherspoon was a great actress in this film, her debut, and definitely worth watching! I did not recognize many of the supporting actors, but they all play well their important supporting roles. "The Man on the Moon" is such a credible story about how a young boy fell in love for the first time. Most women can definitely concentrate on everything - from Witherspoon's words, her fine looks and her not so subtle emotions (furious as a typical teenage girl). While playing the character confused by love, he does not find her as stupid and immature, which has been greatly appreciated today due to many films.
