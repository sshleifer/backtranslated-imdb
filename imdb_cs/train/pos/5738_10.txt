I just bought and viewed the DVD of this movie. The DVD is from 2001. This 1988 film is really a great little movie. Overlooked by most people. I saw it in the theater in 1988 and loved it since then. I love an introductory shot from Pittsburgh (not Baltimore, as another user commented). It seems that Pittsburgh looks like one of the most beautiful cities in the world! And I must say that the Pitts tour with Nicky is very scenic, interesting! Tom Hulce, as everyone else says, gives a remarkable, amazing performance. DVD is a good transfer, no accessories, but with a wide format. I recommend it to those who love film.
