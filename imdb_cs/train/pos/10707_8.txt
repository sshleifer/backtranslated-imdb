For a movie that has little publicity and what few people heard, it was pretty good. It's another of the current British crime films that are special ("Snatch", "Sexy Beast", etc.). It's not wild as "Snatch", but it's interesting and has some rough characters. It also has a terrible and somewhat predictable end, but soon in the show - not too late - it has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the first viewer. Basically, it's about a British low-key man who sends a Russian "bride to order" who, with the help of two Russian men, comes with two big surprises. <br /> <br /> Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman are very good as well as Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman's Russian cohort. It's another type of movie and it works well. Kidman again proves that he is far more than a beautiful face.
