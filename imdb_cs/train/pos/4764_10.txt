There are some comments to this movie that say he's a bad and stupid and such a great actor as Pierre Fresnay should not accept to act on it. I think, on the contrary, that even though the movie is strange and has some weaknesses, the performance of Pierre Fresnay is so great that the film translates into something excellent. Its performance is probably the best in history. <br /> <br /> The film itself has a very polemical scene about initiating wine in the cabaret. For someone who does not believe the priest? even one of them? they can convert it into Christ's blood, the scene may be bizarre. But for someone who was raised in the Catholic framework, it is very emotional, although it is quite unpleasant. The scene of the death of the younger priest is extremely shocking. But it is very good. Pierre Fresnay turns the crazy act of murder into something that is understandable in the time madness of his character, the tortured Morroanda who has returned to his duty in this awful way.
