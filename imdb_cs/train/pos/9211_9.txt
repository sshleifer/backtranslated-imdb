Action, horror, sci-fi, director of explosion Fred Olen Ray shows that he has some talent as a director. The character actor William Smith is one of the best proud and bad guys in the industry. He captures the viewer with the best acting performance of his career. As for Randy Travis, he gives his best impression to Lee Van Cleef. It's not bad in the movie. Smith and Travis are making a movie. As for the rest of the cast, none of them really look. Ray did a great job when he directed this movie, Smith and Travis were good, we would have this B west on a scale of one to ten (ten best) seven.
