To be fair, I expected a car to be chasing in this movie. It really did not matter, but besides, "Freeway" was a great movie that I'm glad to own on DVD. The only really big names in the cast are Richard Belzer of HOMICIDE as radio psychiatrist and B-Movie villain Billy Drago as a revelation - quotes Freeway Killer. But the rest of the cast usually provides good performance. I liked how Darlanne Fluegel gave her character, Sunny, a little courage. It could have been a helpless victim, but it is completely rounded when she is looking for Drago with the help of Lucky Hunter James Russo. Russo, I'm afraid it's more like a wooden one, but again, the character he's playing, Frank, is not very well perfected, except for the mysterious Sunny story given by his former commanding officer. The threat tone is greatly maintained throughout the movie and the atmosphere of the lonely LA highway at night, when a murderer goes through his "length in his sinister gray sedan, is an excellent way to build tension and music underlines the film is properly folded." I do not know why some people, I'm assuming different moves for different people, but I absolutely enjoyed the "highway" and I can strongly recommend it.
