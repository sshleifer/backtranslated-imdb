A wild, shocking intelligent work by gifted British writer Hanif Kureší, who wrote "My Beautiful Laundry" (this is the best thing he has done since then). These are intelligent people whose lives do not add much. They have exhausted what has been given to them and are largely empty craft. The only figure on the screen that is alive is the mother of the title, yet she feels inside the dead until the harsh hairdresser shows her some affection and wakes her up to the joy of sex. He has his own motives, but Kureishi treats him with great sympathy. This is a movie in which people and places feel familiar where the characters are beyond the edge of the screen. In some ways it's a bit like "Sunday, Bloody Sunday", but it's a harder job. Director Roger Michell instinctively creates scenes. And she is beautiful acting. Because the mother of the same name, Anne Reid, is betraying her useless life in every gesture. There is no fake note in her extraordinarily lively performance, and the very fine actor Daniel Craig shows the shadows of his character before even Kureishi has not. If the movie strikes a fake note, it may be in the character of a hopeless daughter trapped in a disorganized relationship with a man her mother deceives (or it should be the opposite) and even a more sophisticated life, but she is so well played by Cathryn Bradshaw she no way. The film is also immensely beautiful to look at (DoP Alwin Kuchler) and must be considered as the best British film of the year.
