This movie is definitely a weird love story. Although this film does not have to be too screaming, Nicole Kidman carries the film alone the rest of the cast can be quite easily forgotten though Ben Chaplin does a pretty good job of Hertfordshire's life with St Albans & Hemel Hempstead's city center shots showing the true nature of the area. What sets out to act as a regular episode of the popular British television series Heartbeat will soon turn into a scenic gangster escape. In this simple little movie it will not become truly unforgettable and will end up as a decent weekend fun. A good observer, and if you like a hero, John is lonely thirty, you can find something to identify.
