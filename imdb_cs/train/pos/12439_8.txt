While the main story is to be held in Morocco, this film was shot in misty Romania for 18 days on a very small budget. But their cards may be broken, actors and the crew play them with remarkable skills and determination, so I finally found the result both touching and kind. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau provides impressive performance as a bad guy. Scenario and direction provide some gems. Whether you like the movie or not, it will probably depend on taking over the title role of Alexander Staden. Other reviewers pointed to the lack of Staden as Modesta Blaise. They can make sense, but I found her interpretation wonderful and very appropriate. Modesty can overcome terrible chances through discipline, innate talent and courage. Staden seems to be doing the same thing here.
