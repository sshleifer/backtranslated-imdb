To judge this movie fairly, you have to think about the genre to be: childish. They had more instructions to follow to make this film (meaning it could not get away with some humor or a language of 1), while everything in this movie was fun and enjoyable to watch. Sequels usually make themselves nervous, but that was pretty good for themselves. They knew he did not have the stellar power of Fraiser like George that they used humor and I believe Showeman did pretty well as a lead. The plot is easy to follow, and perhaps campy occasionally fits well for a younger audience if you want to watch the movie and hope the academy will not do this, but if you want to watch a simple, fun movie with energy, you should make a good choice with it.
