I praise photos that will try something else. Many movies seem like a repetition of old ideas, so it's a great reason why I strongly recommend Passport to Pimlico. The film is set just after World War II, and it seems that post-war scarcity and rationalization is driving the London "Burmese". The film focuses on a small borough in London called Pimlico. They too are sick that they are unable to buy what they want, but they do not see any way out. Until she accidentally encounters a hidden treasure and a charter that has officially recognized her as a sovereign nation many hundreds of years ago! They understand this document, they can bypass all rations and coupons and live the way they want, because it turned out they are NOT British subjects! Where the film takes place from here and how the crisis is finally resolved, it's something you have to see for yourself. Let this brilliant mind Ealing Studios come up with this gem!
