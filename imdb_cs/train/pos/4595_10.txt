Jackie Chan's name is synonomus to stunts. This movie will never disappoint you. Opening the best scenarios and the last shot of a scene from a pole is as risky as one wonder if it knows the sense of fear. This film is close to Jackie the Best, which is PROJECT A. But the main difference is that PROJECT A contains three stars where, as in this movie, Jackie carries the film completely on his shoulders. This is perhaps the main reason why Jackie made this greatest martial arts star followed by Bruce Lee. The film also has nice comic touches as well. What makes this film works Howie's ability to show his respectable side that is in agreement with a typical action hero of martial arts. This film was followed by a sequel that was good, but it was quite tame compared to its predecessor.
