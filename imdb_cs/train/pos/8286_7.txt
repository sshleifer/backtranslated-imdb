Larry Fessenden has cast most of the comments on this forum. Well, the worst mistake is probably marketing marketing and the way the DVD could be targeted. Obviously, this is not a real horror film, at least not for people who expect something that will be cruel and immediately satisfying. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is basically a movie that seems to be told from the mind of young Miles. Things that children can not easily understand tend to stay in their young minds and eventually dominate their fears and threatening world they can not comprehend. It is obvious that Kim, the mother, is a psychologist, but she does not have a clue about what is happening in her son's mind. This is also a story of theft. It is clear that Father, George, is a distant figure, perhaps a worker who seems to be living in another world. Miles's fears will reach the crisis point during the week in the country. That part of the state in New York, with its winter landscape, infertile trees, playing on the imagination of a little boy. It does not help to meet a strange figure in the city, creating even more doubts in the young mind. Eventually, the Miles world collapses, and he can not do anything, nor even incite the spirit of Wendigo. The film is well performed and acted. Patricia Clarkson is excellent, no matter where the movie is. Jake Weber is perfect as a distant father who has the opportunity to approach a son he does not understand. Erik Per Sullivan, like Miles, provokes an inner confusion. I thought it was extremely effective because the whole movie is Miles's own, what's going on around him. Finally, John Spredakos is perfect as a threatening Otis, a man who does not like the world for showing up. Instead of giving this film, future viewers should approach the open mind.
