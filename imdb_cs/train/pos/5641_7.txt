Yes, the plot is predictable; yes, there are several holes of holes; yes, it has good television; and yes, Britney Spears "wrote" a book with obvious publicity. <br /> <br /> But forget about it all ... this movie is fun. <br /> <br /> School fun after school Special but funny Virginia Madsen as a mother does a great job ... so good to start watching her movies. Reminded me of Diane Lane for all good reasons. The rest of the cast also does a great job. If I were the agent's departure, I would definitely mislead these young actors. Production values ​​are above standard TV standards and music was really great ... better than a few big budget movies I saw it. <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for German noir, this movie is not for you. If you want a safe, fun and underestimated movie, it's good. It's one that you could show your 10-year-old daughter, but enjoy it yourself.
