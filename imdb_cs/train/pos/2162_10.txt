I was so surprised to see the movie so underestimated ... I understand why some of you do not like this movie. Its pace is slow, characteristic of Japanese films. However, if you're in a movie like me, it's not a problem at all. <br /> <br /> I have to say it's the best comedy I've ever seen. "Are we Dance?" is often considered to be the masterpiece of Japanese comedies. It's very different from Hollywood, like Austin Powers or Scary Movies, in which the gag is guaranteed in a few minutes. Rather it's a light heart, a movie that feels good. <br /> <br /> I love the movie because I feel "real". The drawing is straightforward but attractive. I was so pleased to see that Sugiyama (the main role) found the meaning of life in dance. Before I was watching the film, I was a little suppressed because of the hard school work. I felt lost. This film, however, was thinking about the bright side of life. I believed I was in the same Sugiyama ship; if he finds himself in his hobby, why could not he? It reminded me of "exploring my own future" and discovering happiness in my everyday life. It is important to realize that actors are not professional dancers. While some of you can find dance scenes that are not as perfect as you expected, I kind of like it because it seems to me that the characters are really "alive", learning how to dance as the film continues. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is encouraging and hearty. As a comedy she does her work perfectly. He certainly deserves ten stars. And yes Aoki is funny :-D
