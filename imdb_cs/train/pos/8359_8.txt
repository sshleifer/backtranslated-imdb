Bertrand Blier is a really horrible French film, and in the seventies he could always shock the public. He made his favorite duo (Depardieu and Dewaere) and the usual dose of sex (Miou-Miou plays a typical role, at least in the 1970s he knew that ten years later he would be the best French actress). The first "Les Valseuses" is also one of the first roadmovies, while the viewer is just taking on some paths of two small criminals. Those who are happy with family life or simply do not know the movie would be quite shocking, but this film is more than just allowing you to think about all the usual things in life (working for a car, being limited at work etc .). It's a kind of critic of the hypocrisy society we live in. Great work and it just makes you want two things: Dewaere died too young because he was a topactor and, of course, Depardieu, he would rather stay on French movies, proving that no one can beat him. Timeless classic and 20 years later will somehow shock ...
