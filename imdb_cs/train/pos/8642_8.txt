Surprisingly effective thriller this. <br /> <br /> David Duchovny and Michelle 'Ensign Ro' Forbes are a successful, professional couple, writer, photographer. Forbes is desperately moved to California, and Mulder agrees on this route, assuming he visits historic sites of known serial murders. His idea: he writes the words, she takes photos, with the ultimate result of the best-selling conference ladder book that sets them for a lifetime. To help finance a trip, they decided to share and promote the car. Their luck would see Brad Pitt ad and shortly after killing his owner, he and his girlfriend, Juliette Lewis, meet a writer and start their running trek. It's inevitable that's bad. <br /> <br /> Pitt is as cool as the really cool inspiration of Early Grayce and is able to back up Lewis playing her common white waste baskets which seems to be his default setting. The Spirituals and Forbes also make a convincing double act, and when the events of the spiral are out of control, you as a spectator are soaked in your situation and feel the tension rising. Intelligent, ominous and beautifully shot, this deserves recognition for the current state. Top film.
