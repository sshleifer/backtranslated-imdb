Before Cujo Lucky was the devilish dog. In 1978, Halloween introduced "Devil Dog, The Hound of Hell" in the evening. Family story about getting a new puppy (from a farmer who is just around the place where fruit and vegetables are sold) because their dog Skipper was killed. Everybody loves a new dog, but there's something weird about it. <br /> <br /> It's not long until my father disappears from Mike Barry's father (Richard Crenna, the first blood). His wife Betty (Yvette Mimieux, where are the boys, Jackson County Jail, Snowbeast), his children Charlie and Bonnie (Ike Eisenman, Witch Mountain and Fantastic Vourage and Kim Richards, Witch Mountain, Nanny and Professor, Hello Larry, Tuff-Turf) also changed. Does a dog have anything to do with it? He is determined to find out and do all he needs to save his family. This movie is great because Ike and Kim have a darker side of themselves than what we've seen on mountain witch movies. It's one of the 70 movie horror films that were really scary for a movie horror movie. The music was terrifying and even the end I will not tell you. "This movie also stars Ken Kercheval (Cliff Barnes of Dallas) and R.G. Armstrong (who could not stay away from diabolical films remember" Race with the Devil "?) <br /> <br /> It's worth watching.
