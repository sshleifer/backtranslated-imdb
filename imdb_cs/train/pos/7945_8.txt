I'm a fan of animal films. If you can take a conspiracy and give animals the main actors, you will usually win me. Homeward Bound did just that. They took a conspiracy that was as old as time and brought it new. It was a complete success. It's a very archetypal movie. You have obi-wan groups (shadow) that are wise and logical, have a nice but impulsive and unwavering chance, and a coming princess who thinks she should be pampered and praised. These three personalities are very well reflected. I also like how Chance and Sassy made such dynamic characters and they did not change it. Most people say it can not be good because it's too much a kid's movie. But what they forget is that it is a children's film, and it still does not shrink from the acoustic film. It's a good movie that you can watch while you're bored and just want to watch the movie. It's a Disney movie without cartoons, an air filter with a better plot. No doubt I would advise you to look at her.
