I did not read Nabokov and did not know anything about chess, I could only see "Luzhin's defense" as a movie. <br /> <br /> It works really well as one of my favorite "sports romance" genres. Chesss are coming alive as a heavy competition much more than in, say, "Searching Bobby Fischer," when they show how hard the hard work can be a game that requires thought, preparation, endurance and planning. I especially liked special effects on the board because alternative games are expected. Despite the feminist director Maureen Gorris ("Antonia"), Emily Watson with her big blue eyes gradually strengthens through her transformational relationship with John Turturro's relatively one note of absent-minded intense chess genius. Settings in Italy and Hungary are beautiful. <br /> <br /> (originally written 5/27/2001)
