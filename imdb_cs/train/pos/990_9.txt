I really enjoyed this movie. Of course, the idea is largely out there ... a federal government that tries to ensure that the tracking device is implanted into the jaw of a small thief to disappoint a more dangerous thief / computer hacker. But Alvin Sanders, the man who volunteered to implant equipment with the federalists, is a very nice person, and it seems like it's a bit of fun when he gets a bit of a head on it. Alvin even proves to be much more than a good but passive or one-dimensional nature when it shows that it is not as easy to manipulate as it may seem. Definitely worth watching.
