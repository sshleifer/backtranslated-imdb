I found this film, which was exciting from the very beginning - like Spielberg's movie - and found that the plot was interesting when I tried to find out what the situation was. <br /> <br /> start - before opening credits - the action starts and brings immediate tension with it. The two main characters are very sympathetic. (I'm having trouble with one of the Baldwin because of Alec's out-of-school politics, but William was not too bad in this movie.) There were a few very unexpected interventions that contributed to the entertainment. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there were many places where an unpleasant high tone appeared in the soundtrack - something like 19kHz. I suspect the microphone picked up the video monitors on the TV.
