Watching the Rhine is one of the best propaganda films that were made during the Second World War. Paul Lukas deserved the Oscar. Bette Davis is brilliantly shining as a great actress and beauty. I would recommend this film to those interested in this time and, of course, wonderful films late, great, Mrs. Bette Davis.
