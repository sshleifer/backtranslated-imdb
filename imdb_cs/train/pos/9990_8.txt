I've seen the movie recently and I really enjoyed it. I was surprised and wept. This movie is in the same genre as "Away from Her" - or even "The Bucket List", but it handles the whole theme of aging with incredible authenticity. It is really hard to have the main character as unfit as Hagar. The director has a masterful job with this challenge. Hagar is hard to understand. Her world has hard edges and is not a warm woman at all. <br /> <br /> The first scene comes without compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is taken to her nursing home by her son and daughter. It calculates on the way and grows up. Its edges are really hard. She is wrong. She is disgusted and selfish. It's a stone. She did not like her - not a little. <br /> <br /> We get a preview throughout the movie. We find out why she does not like petunia, why she prefers one son to another, how her losses have made her figure ... I started to see the angel ... and I started to love her. I loved it very much when she spilled her secret to the boys in the hut. Ellen Burnstyn, you are a great actor. Glory. Glory. Glory. What a scene! <br /> <br /> It's not a "feel good" movie, but it's definitely a movie that gives the viewer empathy. I understand more clearly that the hard edges in human life are there for protection, they are there for some reason ... <br /> <br /> Hagar is not my mother - she is not my mother, law or neighbor ... but its parts are present in many women (and men) in my life. These parts make me somewhat more meaningful when I watch the Stone Angel.
