Thelma Ritter stole the picture. I just watched her again. I could not help myself feeling emotional in the last scene. Oskar did not get it. That's why you should not be too swirling in the Oscars. Richard Widmark never played a better role and was a perfect cast as a 3-D, faulty person. Jean Peters was great as a strong, heavy girl in her best role at all. And Richard Kiley had to be very good; why would I hate him otherwise? Yes, it was a tough handover of patriotism; but without it you do not have the power of a movie. Watch their faces! The top three stars did not really need many scripts. I would like to see them doing this without dialogue. If you've ever seen Raya Milland and Rita Gam in "The Thief," maybe you know what I mean. When I was a child in 1956 on my first trip to NYC, I made my bronze uncle, who led us to the feet of South Street, looking for number 66. I knew Hollywood could not be trusted. But I found the river. I'm doing so much story because I hate it when I know what happens before I see it myself. If you've seen it, there's no need for clarification. Perhaps someone who reads these comments did not see Pickup On South Street. You will like it; just go looking for 66 South Street in New York.
