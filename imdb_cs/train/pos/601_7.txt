I was surprised that this film was won by the audience. I saw it late at night on TV and fell into place - actually, I think it was in 1989 when it first appeared. Still, I remember well, with a nice twist or two, and an interesting atmosphere on the windmill farm. Michael Pollard looks furious because of his role, which largely sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career, and everyone else plays it straight. I certainly recommend this as a lease, although some of the themes that seemed a bit nervous in 1989 may seem twisted, which is a shame, because the current "sharpness" is often used only as a necessary marketing tool, as if summoned to he noticed it.
