One of the greatest hits of 1926, Brown of Harvard is an exciting comedy / drama featuring the regatta and football scenes that gave William Haines the role he needed to become the main star. Haines is patented all the way: a dirty intelligent player who has nothing serious until all of them are rejected, and he becomes man / hero and wins the girl. No one worked like Haines. An amazing comic actor (Little Annie Rooney with Mary Pickford, Show People with Marion Davies), Haines could move from comedy to tragedy with facial expression. It's all the joy in this movie, like Tellin to Marines (with Lon Chaney) and West Point (with Joan Crawford), where he repeats the formula. Mary Brian is good as a girl, Jack Pickford is very good as a sick roommate, Ralph Bushman is a rival. Edward Connelly, Mary Alden, David Torrence, Guinn Williams and Grady Sutton. This film is marked now due to his homoerotic relationship between Haines and Pickford, and for John Wayne's film debut as a Yale footballer (but I have never seen him). Haines was the box star who started with this picture in 1932. It's a shame that he was largely forgotten and that most of his films seem to be lost. He was one of the most attractive and talented actors of his time.
