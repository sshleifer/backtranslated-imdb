I've seen hundreds of silent movies. Some will always be classics (for example, Nosferatu, Metropolis, The General and Wings) but among them is my favorite movie (it may not be the best - but favorite, yes). In fact, when I looked at IMDb, I noticed that I immediately laughed because the movie was so crazy and cute and well made. Marion Davies was able to prove she was really talented and was not William Randolph Hearst's mistress. The story includes Hick of Georgia coming to Hollywood with every expectation of being an instant star! Her experiences and interesting acting stories of the stars of this time make him a real experience for film enthusiasts and the need to see!
