Haunting is a movie that boasts a really scary house, good effects of work and sound creation, cast that seems to believe that everything around is real and that house. There are scenes that bounce you, and the ominous aspects of what happened in Hill House in the past, I was interested. There are really spooky moments in the movie, and I enjoyed the ghosts in cans, curtains, and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave him the right atmosphere, and the sound design had pop-up voices around him. What I wish to happen is something a bit more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating that he faces and I think he has not given up too much. Poltergeist scared me foolishly when I saw it many years ago, and it still stands. Haunting would use several scenes of pure terror. The end was a bit anticlimactic for me. Overall, I enjoyed it. The game is good and the moments that make you jump. I just wish I was more scared.
