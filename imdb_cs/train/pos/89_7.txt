To be honest, I had no idea what this movie was about when I started it. So I watch movies whenever possible. No prejudices. I thought it would be a movie about storms in the woods or something. I was wrong, a little. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I know the feeling of being sucked into something dangerous, where you feel powerless, but doing things you do not want to do. Another user commented on how this movie was stupid and unlikely, but I begged. These things have happened. I'm sorry, but not everyone lives in the world of dreams where nothing can happen and crazy situations are "unlikely". It's really sorry, but the reality of the world is that it happened. The filmmakers, as well as actors, have been wondering how things can go wrong and how people can make a really bad decision. Sometimes things turn out to be good, sometimes they turn wrong, and that's life. I highly recommend this movie.
