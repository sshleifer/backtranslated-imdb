I have long enjoyed the serial of the law and the order of the criminal intent. Kathryn Erbe, Det. Alexandra Eames, the detective is rather tough and seems a bit bitter in the Criminal Intent Series. Check out her other side in this movie. This film shows the gorgeous soft side of this talented actress, and if you're a fan of a crime plan, this movie is fun in her acting and you get pretty darn good yarn from family troubles in the south. I did not like Albert Finneys' role in this film because he did such a convincing act of an older Southern man who is hardheaded, intolerant, and does not accept change. It reminds me of so many people of my youth, and the portrait is divine, but in this film it's probably going to be hard to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Katryn Erbe is very fond of this movie and why I recommend it as 10 stars for fans of criminal intent, law and order.
