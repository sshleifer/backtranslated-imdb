Gandhi My father is a well filmed movie. It portrays the life of Gandhiji's eldest son, Harilal. His character, differences with his father, love for his family, the desire to stand alone, his failure, his ego. Akshaye Khanna fully justifies the role of Harilal. Not just him, they all played well in the roles they played. Darshan Jariwala is the best Gandhiji on the screen I've ever seen. But I'm going to cut three points, because there were a few shortcomings. At first, the film was fifteen and twenty minutes longer than he had. Secondly, the film needed further research on Harilal's character. Somewhere the character looked incomplete. Also his relationship with his brothers was not shown. There was no mention of any other Gandhiji child in the whole movie. I believe a character like Harilal should have at least some differences with his brothers, taking into account the egoistic nature of Harilal. Anyway, despite some shortcomings, I liked the film.
