I read Nancy Drew as a preteen and gathered the books as an adult. I loved the effect used at the end (and a bit in the beginning) of the film, where the book drawings were transformed into scenes from the film. It was a neat way to show the connection between the situations in the movie and the books. For example, scenes with an Oriental antique dealer resembled many scenarios I remember from books. I thought Ned was completely occupied, and Emma Roberts was the beautiful interpretation of Nancy Drew in the 21st century. (Just like the picture of Betty Crocker, she keeps her time!)
