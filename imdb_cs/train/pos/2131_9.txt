It's a movie that improves every time I see it. There are so many different performances in this. William Tracey, like Pepi, is a pleasure that brings sharp comic reliefs. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only "villian" in the film and his oil spells are well used here. Frank Morgan is gorgeous as the owner of the home shop, Mr. Matuschek, and his well-known way is well-used here. I enjoyed the performance of Felix Bressart, like Pirovitch. Very confident in all aspects of his role. The two outings are equally successful, with Margaret Sullivan, who does an excellent job of showing a slightly desperate, neurotic, yet charming and attractive woman. <br /> <This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart. The film is introduced from his perspective, as he turns around. Mr. Stewart is more than the task of wearing a movie with amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions. Just follow Stewart when he is released from work due to misunderstanding. He is able to show shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that will cause such traumatic events to be so perfect. In my opinion, James Stewart is undoubtedly the greatest film actor in the history of the media. There is no one else who has ever been captured on a film that can fully tell what the audience feels. At the time he made the film, he still had most of his career ahead of him, yet he was the master of his craft. It's one of Jimmy Stewat's best movies, and one of the sweetest and most enjoyable romantic comedies you can find. I highly recommend this movie, especially for those who appreciate Stewart's work.
