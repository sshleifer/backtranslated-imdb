I saw the movie twice a week, both at the Orpington Cinema in Kent, UK. The place was packed both times and people had to be averted. Since the beginning of the movie when Henry Winkler was injured on a football field, the whole audience was upset with laughter, laughing, which lasted until the credits. For those who love the American match, this movie must be, but be prepared to see Henry Winkler as you have never seen before. See also a well-known actor whose famous fight is the head - but! <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to watch this movie and it's family comedy fun at its best!
