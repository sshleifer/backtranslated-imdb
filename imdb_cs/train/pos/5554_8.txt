This entertainingly cheap "tragedy" copy of the exceptionally beautiful and well-equipped brunette hottie of the highest Karin Mani as Billie Clark, the best martial arts warrior and a woman devastating crew that opens a gigantic ten gallon drum of wild chopsocks who are on a variety of countless sages, hatred , drug dealers and gang members have met after some nice, low-life criminals attacked their beloved parents. The stunningly sensual Miss Mani sinks her teeth into her fearsome, thick, stomping, tough pussy section with a winning bustle, defeating dwarfs with infectious joy, and capturing her smoking hot spot in some absolutely free but highly acclaimed naked scenes. Unfortunately, Mani has extremely irritating chewing on marbles, a rough and gruff voice that is a total murder in my ears (my favorite moment when it comes to Mani's dubious delivery of her dialogue) occurs when she tries to "Do not try the girls in the park, that's not nice! "The only subsequent film role of Karina was in" Avenging Angel, "in which she does a really charming full-length nude scene, but has no lines.) The film is the only most sensationally dirty sequence to appear when Mani is briefly imprisoned for contempt of allegations and will show his substantial essentials in a group prison jail. Of course, Mani's lascivious lesbian cellular friend is trying to seduce her just to prevent her unwanted progress being rejected with a heavy blow! Leszha, of course, forgives Mani and becomes her best friend while behind the grid. Since Edward Viktor was in a harsh rough hand that was so harsh, Edward Viktor's head, funky rockin scores, terribly frightened, playing gaming (if they are deceptive), a constantly fast move, many pull -the-stops exciting fighting scenes, and Howard Anderson III is a frantic photo, this extremely enjoyable doly'd'd'dirty abuse whill is essential for hardcore fans to blithely a low-grade low-budget grindhouse cinema junk.
