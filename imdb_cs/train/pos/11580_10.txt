As another reviewer, Hannah War is an excellent film about an outstanding person, Hanna "Anniko" Senesh, who becomes Jewish Joan Of Arc. Unfortunately, I deviate from the view that I do not think Miss Detmers as a leader is too beautiful to be a fighter for resistance. In fact, my performance is not maintained by her beauty, but it is even sharper in the horror of sadistic brutality as the resistance she faces. Maruschka's Detmer's performance is courageous, dizzying, heartfelt, or understood, and utterly believable. In other words for me "In the Zone." of the initial credits. If you would like to learn about someone else's misery for something they believe and be entertaining, try Hanna's war with Maruska Detmers. My hat is also switched off by Ellen Burstyn as Hanna's mother known and famous actress who would try to go with the movie. This is a team effort of perhaps two actresses, but not of the Eve situation.
