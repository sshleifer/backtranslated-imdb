As a boy who saw all the years, I can say that JG is always surprised by me. I mean, when you saw him moving over the years from laughter to paranoia, and after every little gesture of his awareness of being a gangster, he thought, OK, he's a good actor and he can get into gangster skin. But when I saw him open his eyes and try his life, I think I almost felt the pain he "did" that we were convinced he was going through. I had the impression that I immediately considered Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more. But today they are either old or dead (Brando), and it's okay to make fewer movies and their performances are "lighter" than before. I can not wait to see Gandolfini in other films, where he gives a completely different role. Can I recommend some of his older movies to give unforgettable performance?
