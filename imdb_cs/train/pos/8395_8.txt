*** SPOILER *** *** *** Spoil This is undoubtedly the best film Rainer Werner Fassbinder, who ever made, and even with an amazing scenario of the film is enhanced by excellent performances by Hanna Schygulla. The film begins with Maria (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitschem), just married when the bombs continue to fall, and Hermann comes to the waning days of the war and now Maria and her mother and sister must scramble to survive. Maria decides to get a job as a dancer / prostitute in a club that cares about American GI, and she meets a black soldier in the army named Bill (Greg Eagles) and they begin to see each other constantly. Marie hears her husband, Hermann, died in the war, so he is very worried with Bill. One day, when he and Bil met intimately, they saw Hermann at the door. He did not die, and when he entered the room, there was a seizure, and Maria broke the bottle over Bill's head and died. Hermann has blame, and he has been sentenced to jail for a long time, so Maria tells him he will succeed and pull him out. The war ended and Germany must rebuild and one day the train Maria meets Karl Oswald (Ivan awful), which is a successful businessman in the textile and uses her charm to get a job. Maria is committed to doing well and climbing the company rankings and becoming a Charles Mistress. He tells him he will never marry him, but he's in love with him. Hermann goes out of prison, but goes to Canada to try to get everything Maria has done since he was blocked. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> One day he dies Karl and Maria leave everything in his will and Maria buy their own house. Then Hermann finally returns home to his wife, and they are both ready to start being married, even though they have been married for some time. But Maria leaves the gas on the stove and the house explodes with both of them still in it. <br /> <br /> In this movie there are so many interesting things that its one of those movies that can be studied and talked in great lengths. Just like in all Fassbinder films, the use of color is a very interesting way. As the film begins, the tones are brown and gray, representing the war torn Germany, but as Maria starts to be successful, it changes into a bright rich colors such as red and white. The restoration of Germany with all the sounds of the building is used only as a background and the film remains focused on the use of Mary. Fassbinder wanted the rebuilding sounds to remind us of what was happening in Germany at the time. Hanna Schygulla has never been better and her performance is the key to the success of this film. With a smaller actress, it would be just another interesting film, but Schygulla is so strong that her performance raises this film to an elite status. Schygulla shows that Maria is very determined and smart, but at the same time uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants. He is not embarrassed or guilty, and Fassbinder wanted to show Mary as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive. Schygulla has not been nominated for the Oscar, but she has done a great performance that will endure the time test. Fassbinder himself appears in the film as a businessman and his mother Lilo Pempeit plays Frau Ehmke. I have heard many things about the end of the movie and it is related to whether Maria intentionally left the gas. Later in the bathroom it runs over the wrist and seems to be sad. That's just speculation, and if you think I'm wrong, send me an e-mail. I think she was too excited that Hermann was at home and left her by accident (Remember that she dressed her clothes for no reason?). Then, when her will feels at that moment, she finds that Hermann and Karl have become friendly without her knowledge, and I think she felt that everything she did was nothing. This is the reason for the bathroom. So when the house explodes by accident. But I think the reason why Fassbinder has such an end is to show that everyone who sells his soul has no livelihood. Fassbinder was fascinated by the survivors, but he was also incredibly passionate. In his view, Maria can not have both options. Fascinating film.
