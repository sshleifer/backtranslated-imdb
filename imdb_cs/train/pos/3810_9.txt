this is my first IMDb review, I really did not want to write one, but because there are only 2 for this great movie right now, I feel compelled to add my perspective ... and no, I'm not associated with movie makers in any way (yeah yeah , how often are you here before ;-)) FYI I'm in my late 20s <br /> <br /> First of all I have to admit that I really like animated movies because what you see is limited only by imagination creators and were very imaginative. Not so much about the story, but about achieving a very unique and fresh visual style. The characters look good, but far from real and work well for the movie, after all, it's a fairy-tale world. But the background and the world in general are full of amazing visuals that my jaw dropped several times when I watched it. A blue, rabbit-like mini-dragon steal parade and has easy some of the funniest moments of the movie, he's already an instant classic, much like Scrat since the Ice Age. The story is not very surprising (a lot of antihrdin must go out and kill the biggest dragon as you can imagine) but who cares if the movie looks and sounds good ?-) 1 thing I must point out, the film is not suitable for very young children, because it has some darker scenes in it and perhaps terrifying for children up to 6-8 I would say that there are very few scenes but worth mentioning imo. Anyway, I looked great at it, and I could not wait to get into high definition shops to look at it again and again just for the sake of total beauty. <br /> <br /> 8.5
