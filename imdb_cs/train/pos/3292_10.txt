Paperhouse is the most moving and tangible movie I've ever seen. I often think of a "horror film", it is a serious mistake. Some journo once called "The Nightmare of a Thinking Man on Elm Street," and while I accept the logic of my conclusion, I can not help, but I think it is a badly deserved and misleading mark. Those who can only see the horror are really missing and only serve to prove that they do not really think at all. <br /> <br /> In fact, just trying to classify this wonderful work is probably a bad idea. Simply, Paperhouse is perfect in every amazing detail and always has a special place in your heart. Once someone wiser than I said, "the film will hit you at a totally emotional level," which may somehow explain why my notes are so tirelessly shaking. To be honest, I can not apologize, so if you feel my words are too bright for your taste, you will stop reading because there is more to it. It's so rare to find a movie that has his heart's pain and childhood grief and a struggle to overcome terrible feelings of isolation and loneliness that can overcome us in this delicate time in our lives. It is still unusual to find child actors who can really play their roles with sensitivity and intelligence that are essential for everything to work. In Charlotte Burke and Elliott Spiers we have inspired a piece of casting, and the continued influence of Paperhouse owes its ability to portray melancholy and childhood theft (often overlooked) in a fluid and persuasive way. <br /> <br /> And yet it seemed that both these great young stars slid into grasping studios and somehow vanished. Add to it all the incredibly gifted director (Bernard Rose), the imaginative cinema and the most beautiful and popular soundtrack you've ever heard, and you begin to count on why I have such affection and addiction to this movie that can not express words. <br /> <br />
