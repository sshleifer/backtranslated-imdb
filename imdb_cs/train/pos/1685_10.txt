He first saw this film in 1990 and died in his laugh. It became a favorite cult with my circle of friends, and we would quote it on a drop of a hat ("I'm going home in the bag!"). Needless to say, humor is still there, 15 years later. It has become a tradition at Halloween time to expose many of my new friends to this movie (a good thing you can still buy from Ebay!) I've found that Halloween candy tastes much better when your tongue is firmly in the face. this film provides all-pathos, tension, unrequited love, nobility and the list goes on. Royal Dano offers an incredibly amazing performance like the Old Man Wrenchmuller. I remember seeing him in Doctor Lao's Seven Faces as a bad guy who had a bad ending. Here really feel the old man right from the start. <br /> <br /> If you're not careful, you'll miss some humor in this movie. In many ways, the creators are out of the way with unnecessary remarks, small fine costumes in other science fiction films, and even the scene torn from Wile E. Coyot's site! a lot of thought processes that try to analyze the film, people - it's a fun ride without the need to pamper and should not be insulting to someone (well, maybe stupid people, but they will not know that they are ridicule ...). <br /> <br /> -If you apologize, I'll get the bar "Zag-nut" .... -Ramsay "RC" Cowlishaw, karaoke DJ / fun
