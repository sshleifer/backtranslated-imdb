IF THE FRIEND KILLS, in my opinion, is very irritating and a kind of heartbreaking drama about the consequences of anorexia or bulimia. Whenever Lexi (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton) jumped out, I wanted to vomit. It's hard to explain why. If you ask me, you should work more about things. But I really enjoyed seeing how they did things together, just as parents had lectured. Before I pack it, I'd like to say, "If you ask me when the LIBRARY KILLS will actually show you how anoretical or bulimic influence can be on the human body." Finally, I recommend this movie to anyone who did not see it. You are in tears and cool, so next time on the TV, kick with a friend and watch him.
