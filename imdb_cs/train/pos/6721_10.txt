If it was possible to distill the heart and soul of this sport - not a clean lifestyle - surfing in perfect form, this document did. This document shows that life is not just about waves, but rather about people, pioneers, and modern vanguards that push the envelope of a big wave further than it ever was. <br /> <br /> Stacy Peralta - a virtual legend from my early skateboarding days like SoCal teen - has edited a number of amazing songs and interviews into her essence and created what is not just a documentary but a masterpiece of this genre. When his heart and soul are in the subject - and it is obvious that he is here - his gene is full of pure vision that does not interest, waterproof or sentiment his subject. He respected surfers and surfing / beach lifestyle, but he does not even radiate it. This sport is also a harsh reality. <br /> <br /> There is so much to say about this document, Surfers, Early History of Sports and Wild Surfers to Profiles. Greg Noll, the first personality of the great waves that probably promoted this sport; Jeff Carter, an amazing guy who has been practically alone for 15 years on extremely dangerous Maverick's large surfing in northern California; and the main piece of documentary film Laird Hamliton, today's messenger of great surfing waves. <br /> <br /> These boys have a huge heart and warmth - and a few girls who appear on the camera - and a deep and strong love for surfing and the ocean that goes by every word. I found a story about how Hamilton's adopted father met him, and how Hamilton, as a small four-year-old or five-year-old boy, actually made him his father particularly delightful (and once again stripped of raw sentiment). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
