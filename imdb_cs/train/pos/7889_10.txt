Freddy's Dead Last Nightmare's Film Is Just As Exciting And Disturbing As Any Other Nightmare On Elm Street Yes Yes Comes With Comic Essence About Any Other Movies But How Can Someone Tell You That You Will not Find Freddy Krueger Spooky If You Meet with this man in his dreams, we will not find him even more scary with the comical essence of him, because his comedy shows that he does not care about killing you, that he thinks it extraordinary fun, and Freddy also plays comedy with them, which is in his own way very worrying, using his comic ways I think he makes horror films Nightmare on street streets today, writers are very clever to make Krueger comic and frightening as against Jason Vorhees who does not say anything and does not have such confidence, to really scare his victims. This movie is about as good as Freddy's joke, and I would recommend it to everyone with humor and the way "Do not fall asleep!"
