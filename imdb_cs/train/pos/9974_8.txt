Sure it was a remake of the 70th film, but it had the tension and action of the current movie, say Breakdown. He runs desperately to be with his hospitalized wife, police are the least worried. Walks were very good, part with him <br /> <br /> focused on the stop was well done, the end of the movie was a great cliffhanger. Is it better than Bullitt, a boring movie with what, a sleighing muscle car that was filmed badly? The Vig's character knew what he had to do to escape Johnny's law, a few films had effects - night vision, CB radio - well, I forgot the name of the movie, the boy has 76'Caddy upped, the toy with the guy he upset. The end is great, you can not tell if you suspect suicide or not, very good - to-make-it-or-not.
