As a huge fan of the original I prevented this film as an epidemic when bad reviews began to appear eight years ago, but I just watched this movie and found it to be a really pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> Well, if you're looking for a protectorate from the original original, you're very disappointed, but if you're looking for something totally different, a bit nervous and political, then it's the movie for you. <br /> <br /> Gregory is now thirty-four and works as a teacher in his old complex school where his colleague haunts him and has sexual dreams about one of his students. When a student insists on meeting Gregory, there are a number of bad events that involve torture, breakage and entry, and all sorts of unexpected twists and turns that left me feeling excited and moving. If you are looking for something original, then I highly recommend this movie. I just wish that more people got to it when it was released and they saw it for what it really is.
