Brown from Harvard is a tough film that should be overtaken. We expect much more from our films, so helping to remember that the audience in the 1920s was a bit innocent. William Haines is charming as a dishonest, who has to come to pain and humiliation to find success and even glory. All the relationships in the movie feel very compressed, except for the homoerotic relationship between Billy and Jack Pickford. The film has everything, romance, tears, love, death, and even sports ... It's a great education as society changed in the 20th century.
