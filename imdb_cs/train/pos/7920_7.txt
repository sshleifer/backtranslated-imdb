Full Moon High (1981) 3 of 5 Dir: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Roz Kelly <br /> <br /> Tony (Arkin) is your average average high school student. Prepare for a great game to return home, trouble with your girlfriend and growing hair in unknown places - you know the usual. But hair in strange places gets a little out of control when a trip to Transylvania with his father (YES! McMahon) leaves with a crude case of furball. Now he is condemned to go to the world forever young as a werewolf, how will Adam have any girls? "All Month High" is not often spoken, but it's a stupid and fun horror spoof. Larry Cohen (Q The Winged Serpent, The Stuff) contains as many gags as he can come as a writer / director. Arkin (H20: Halloween, 20 years later) shows nice timing in the lead role. If you become a fan of spoofs such as 'Aircraft' and 'Student Bodies', I think you will be having fun with this sweet fest.
