I'll start by making my first encounter with prince music. It was at the bar, on my 39th birthday and the girl was dancing naked, as if she was playing on the "loudspeakers" on "1999". I asked people who the singer is? I was told he was the Prince. It was so good that it scattered me from the beautiful dancer upstairs. Later, I began to hear other Prince songs and really "kicked" them. When the Purple Rain came out, I knew very little about this Minnesotan. The film blew me away. Immediately I became a fan of Princess No. 1 generation "War Child". Later I discovered that one of my cousins ​​was his secretary, and she got me and my nephew to V.I.P. Prince concert where we sat next to mother ... how great it is! When I return to this topic, I agree with Siskel and Ebert, who called the Purple Rain an instant classic. I've seen it more than 17 times, and I absolutely love it. I thought Prince's acting was all right, Apollonia fought a little, but everything in acting was all right. John Gielgud was not available to play "The Kid," so the prince took over the role. The film is visually stunning, brilliantly tempo (never getting slow) and greatly directed. I know it among the best movie musicals of all time. The last time I watched it was after a seven-year break and to this day. I'm so proud of colleagues from Minnesota Prince Rogers Nelson, and I'd like to personally tell him. During the aforementioned concert, he went straight in front of me and said, "Hi," my nephew, but not me. He talked to his mother. I was a bit crushed but still with me.
