this film just shows you do not need big explosions, millions of dollars of computer graphics, or highly paid actors and actresses to make a good movie. All you need is a great story line and plot. which the master of all Japanese films, Akira Kurosawa, brilliantly pulls out. I recommend this film to everyone who loves epic work. and for those who have Kurosawas before working. 10/10
