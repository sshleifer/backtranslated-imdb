The night listener kept my attention when Robin Williams shone like a New York radio host, who is fascinated by his friendship with a very sick 14-year-old boy (Rory Culkin). Williams never saw the boy personally not only by phoning. However, Williams's former boyfriend (a nice job from Bobby Cannavale) raises doubts about the boy, prompting Williams to arrange a meeting with him personally. What follows has a lasting impact on William, a way he does not expect. I'll leave it to it. Toni Collette also stars. I liked the movie when Toni Collette gave a memorable picture of Culkin's adoptive mother. Sandra Oh also played as Williams's friend. The night listener is inspired by current events and has a total, almost spooky silence. Sometimes it's predictable, not thanks to some reviews I've read before I saw the movie and just for logic, but I just liked it. I love Williams in such roles, more than his comedic characters, so it was another bonus for me. Recommended. 8/10
