With a relatively small $ 60 million animation budget, people at Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have done incredible work. They have brought together the most up-to-date digital animation, the perfectly vocal talents of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) that create a very entertaining, family-friendly film with a strong message of cooperation, friendship and care for your roommate. And how sometimes it takes so many creatures for a herd to happen. Watching this movie I received a strong political report on how to share with people who share your space for all the world's leaders! David Newman - another member of the Newman family of Hollywood composers - provides an excellent score that is not distracting but serves to move the action along and sometimes is a positive tope tapping. <br /> <br /> The overall appearance of the movie is incredible; heavily colored, strangely believable fantasyland of snow, geysers, mud, rocks and ice. The characters were also beautifully believable with Rayman Manfred's facial expressions, which is a special treatment. The whole sequence with DoDos leaves no doubt about where the term "Dumb like DoDo is coming." This is a good family movie that keeps things that could alarm or scare the kids were pretty clean - but real, however. a great movie that you can see in the theater and buy at home.
