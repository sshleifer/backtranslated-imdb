I searched some of the old VHS tapes I got and I hit the John Denver and The Muppets Christmas TV shows together. It brought me to my computer and looked at him to find out if I could find the DVD version of this show to buy. I was disappointed not to find her on DVD yet. The show was broadcast in 1979 and was a nice show. I have a record and a CD, but I'd like to buy a DVD version of this show. The tape is old and the image quality is pretty good, but fading, the sound is not as good as the CD. There are also several other tracks on the CD. As a fan of John Denver and Muppets, the DVD of this show would really be a good seller. If you do not have a CD, it's a wonderful collection of Chritmas songs from this show. The album is also good if you find it and you still have a record player.
