Hidden Frontier is a fan show in the Star Trek world. The story takes place after Voyager returned from the Delta quadrant. It has some characters from the official Star Trek performances, but most of them are an original show. The show takes place on the star base of Deep Space 12 and several spacecraft, giving it an opportunity not to have official shows. Characters have the opportunity to climb in the hierarchy, which features in shows with only one ship do not. The show has a good computer animation of spacecraft, but the acting takes place in front of the green screen and the green glow around the actors. Not all actors are just as good, but most are all right. Episodes are characteristic and the characters evolve in many episodes. This is a bit more like Babylon 5 than in most of the official Star Trek performances. Hidden Frontier takes the taboo that even the official series has shrunk. Overall, I enjoyed watching.
