I watch this movie after watching the Practical Magic and the older movie was far better. I liked how light, makeup and costumes changed as Gillian had changed in the story. Jimmy Stewart's handling for me has not done much for me, but I suppose they've managed to highlight Gillian's reserve. I was also struck by Nicky and Gillian's manners - it was as if the director wanted to appear effeminate and Gillian appeared male. The gestures Nicky does when he shows Redlich, his forces have particularly hit me. I never thought of warlocks as women, so it was an interesting way to contrast these characters.
