Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey are a sequel to the great adventure between Bill and Ted. Their fake path follower almost immediately after the first film and doing the same good work if it is no better to entertain the viewer. The plot is an evil person from the future trying to kill Bill and Ted uses bad robots that look exactly like Bill and Ted. As robots kill Bill and Ted, they have to compete with a grumpy jerk (death) and return their lives to normal. The film's play is top-notch and even thought it's a bit weird at times, especially Bill and Ted's interview, it's a great movie. Happy rockers certainly made another great movie. They chose it the next time they come to the market!
