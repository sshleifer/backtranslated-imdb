Surprisingly good movie! He has a lot of good jokes. The only negative thing is that some scenes go to extremes to show how stupid the two main characters are. We got it, stupid blondes, go on! <br /> <br /> The conspiracy barely avoids saying it is "rotten". And boobies are always a plus of the movie for some strange reason that they did not play too much with the card, even if the line of plot is to portray two black hair that behaves like the evil contradiction of both of our two blondes. <br /> <br /> So in all, a good movie to watch. I almost gave her 8/10, but do not be crazy.
