Debut? Wow - Cross-Eyed is one of the most enjoyable indie films I've ever watched last year, so it's hard to believe that Cross Eyed is the writer's debut film. I mean - I signed up for IMDb to find other movies of this writer ... because Cross Eyed has this unique signature - you want to see what this writer can still say. Nowadays, its rare to see a film that is well written, well-controlled, well-groomed and well-acted. For me - Cross Eyed encapsulates what film production should do - combine the best of all film elements to create a smart, artistic and playful story. Please, please.
