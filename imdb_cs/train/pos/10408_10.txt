I first saw this movie when I was a little boy and fell in love with him at one time. The sets are breathtaking, and some scripture is damn right cheerful: "You sons of thousands of fleas". It's always shown on TV late at night or really early in the morning I woke up at about 3:00 in the morning and it just started. Television companies need to give a little more respect and put it on Sunday at the main time so that everyone can get the opportunity to look at this great job. <br /> <br />
