One of Roger Corman's b-and c-class cult classic classics was Ramones (originally designed for a cheaper trick), Rock N 'Roll High School. It's just a simple, technically dated story (but it would serve extra doses of nostalgia for humor because it was such things that Napoleon Dynamite was funny - see Eaglebauer's van) about teenagers who love rock n 'roll. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> amoral deviants and promises, Rock N 'Roll-free Zone. In fact, he plans to break Rock N 'Roll for all students, regardless of whether he / she is at school, and works with most adults who could successfully do this. Riff Randell (PJ Soles) can help. Ramones fanatik, has written several songs (including Rock N 'Roll High School) that she wants to give Ramones and when she tries to do that, Miss Togar is refused to do everything in her power, check out Ramones in the city . It culminates in a final rebellion among obsolete adults and adolescents (ultimately, which somewhat resembles Over the Edge). After years of punk, when the fame of garage rockers, Ramones (and others) marks another shift in musical evolution, it was great to see a movie that celebrated all the fun and so witty, exaggerated. <br /> <br /> It's mostly a mild comedy, but great comedy, although you're in the mood for something you enjoy. With Jerry Zucker and Joe Dante (Gremlins fame) who are involved in some directors, you can get an idea of ​​how humor you have been behind (not to mention Dicka Miller, even if only for a few minutes in the final of the film). The story had to be later inspired (and subsequently updated) by comedy in the mid-1990s, Detroit Rock City, which changed some minor change in the old glam rocker, Kizz. <br /> <br /> I recommend the transfer of Corey Feldman, Rock N 'Roll High School Forever, which was released almost ten years later. The original is still the best.
