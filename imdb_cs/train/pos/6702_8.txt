Although there are no new episodes, and it is rare. I loved the spell of Sabrina and the teenage witch. I've never seen the last episodes, but I want to know what happened to Miles or Josh? And why do aunt get out of the show for good? I'm sure the end has become perfect. But there are a lot of unanswered questions. And I want to see the last episode of S.T.T.W! Because I heard she would decide between Erin and Harvey on a wedding day! I really hope he chooses Harvey! And I can say that Nate Richart is HOTT !! Pity it's too old for me. Melissa Joan Hart has her own sense of cuteness she adds to the show, but there are a lot of little "silly" things like the way the famous bands come out of nowhere and play songs and listen to listening. stupid. In addition, the cat starts to be really poor as the show continues, the jokes start stupid, and the things that audience-controlled "audience" laughs at, I think it's so lame. Do not get me wrong, in some places it was funny, but I think the show just lost her "magic" to talk, because the show continued. I'm kudos to all the cast, though he tried, though Soleil Moon Frye girl did not like it, and she was a terrible actress. I wonder what Melissa or any of the actors is doing now for this thing when the concert is over.
