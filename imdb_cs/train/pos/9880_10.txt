This movie was made in 1943 when I think Judy was on top of her (looks wise). In my previous film For me and My Gal often they say he looks exhausted. Well in this movie it looks perfect. She is beautiful and shows she has a taste for comedy. I think this movie is cheerful, especially at the beginning when trying to hold an audition with John Thornway. One of the funniest scenes is, in my opinion, Judy's Lady Macbeth's rendition and when John is looking for her at the party to give her a lollipop (Lol). One criticism I have is that there is a hole in the conspiracy when John and Lily fall in love. I think one minute when she scorns her, and others are dating, then they meet next time and they are in love. Another point I did not like was Tuesday night. If I were Lily, I'd be furious with John, but it's not ... it just makes no sense. But overall I would have to give this movie 10 because it's just great and almost perfect.
