The things that come are rarity, a film about ideas. Many films represent a vision of the future, but few attempts to show us how this future has happened. The first part of the movie, when the war is coming to Everytown, is short but powerful. (Ironically, filmmakers in their release year laughed at reports that they were attacking enemy planes in England - the calming was at their height, Wells forecast was confirmed too soon.) The assembly of the endless war that follows a par with the model of work is most effective. Explanatory names strongly resemble German Expressionist Graphic Design. The artistic director was great William Cameron Menzies and his pieces of remnants Everytown are among his best works. Margaretta Scott is very seductive as the Chief of Staff. Everytown of the 21st century is equally stunning. Efficacy in the 21 st century story is not convincing - it was perhaps an unsuccessful attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of this time with barbarism in 1970. Unfortunately, the model work representing angry mobs rushed through raised pavements is ridiculously bad and could be much better, even 30s technology. This is particularly noisy, because the scenes of giant aircraft are very convincing. This is redeemed by Raymond Massey's magnificent speech, which closes the film - seldom being the ideal of scientific progress. Massey's last question is now more important than ever, in an age of heavily limited space flight. The scene was backed by the stirring music of Sir Arthur Bliss, whose surname I proudly shared. Unfortunately, the VHS versions of this movie are terrible and have serious technical problems. Most versions have edited a rather interesting set of futuristic workers and machines that have taken us from 1970 to 2038. I hope there is a good DVD of the whole movie.
