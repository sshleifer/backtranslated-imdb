In the last few weeks, Laurence Olivier was very entertained and I was thrilled to discover this jewel. I always felt great when I came across a movie where I do not have to have a finger on the remote control if the nudity appears in his ugly head. The divorce of Lady X is enchanting until the last scene and it has to be a real pleasure for the audience in 1938. I just wish people today to accept and love real humor instead of the terrifying call that people today call funny. The divorce of Lady X is well worth it.
