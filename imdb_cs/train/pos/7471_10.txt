Despite the excellent Vanilla Sky trailers, I expected the movie to be disappointed because I heard it was not getting great reviews. However, I left the cinema in amazement, as good Vanilla Sky is. <br /> <br /> There was no bad acting throughout the movie, every character is credible. Romantic moments between Cruise's character, David Aames and Cruz's character, Sophia are tearfully realistic and intimate (probably because they were early real-life lives). <br /> <br /> The story of Vanilla Sky interchanges you in the last third of the movie and there is very little chance that you will end it. However, the ends are tied to the end, giving you a strange mix of feelings consisting of sadness, shock and empathy for David Aames. The film is intellectual and you have to pay attention all over. It's not that hard, because it's likely you'll be totally attracted to the movie and you will not have eyes on the screen for one second. I usually leave the cinema and forget everything around the movie, I'm just watching. But Vanilla Sky is still in my mind after watching. I recommend it to anyone who wants to change from simple shallow films.
