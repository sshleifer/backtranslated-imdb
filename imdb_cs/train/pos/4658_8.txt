Talk about the dream cast - just two of the most amazing actors ever to appear - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in "Hot Millions," a funny, unusual comedy also played by Karl Malden, Robert Morley and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is a former challenger who has received the tale of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes up his position in Malden, with the intention of committing an embezzlement. It's not a smooth cruise; he attracted the attention of his competitor in Newhart's society, and his neighbor Maggie Smith (who knows him at his place of residence under a different name) becomes his secretary for a short time. She can not keep her job and she's seen across the movie in various jobs-and it all ended with being released. When Newhart does it, Ustinov brings his curtain flat to cover, but they will soon decide they are for themselves. Of course he does not know that Ustinov is a cheater. It's such a good movie - you can not help but love Ustin and Smith and be fascinated by Ustin's machinations, his genius and ways to get out of trouble. But there is the end of the end that will show you who really has the brain. Do not miss this movie, which is in London in the 1960s. It is worthwhile if she only heard Maggie Smith kneel: "I was released."
