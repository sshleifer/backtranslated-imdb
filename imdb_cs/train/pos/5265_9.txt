I remember watching this for the first time when I was 9 years old. I wanted to be one of the "barbarian brothers". This movie is still great. One of the original aspects was that combat scenes where they are very short. It means that "barbarian brothers" where they are so good that enemies have quickly ended up there! In addition, you have a chase, a cage, a dragon and even a bar battle! <br /> <br /> Yes, acting is bad, that's why it's not ten, and the story line got a lot of criticism. I think it's completely original. Not in many movies in his genre they have the same original stories or colorful dialogues. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie.
