I've already seen Zu: Warriors of the Magic Mountain. In this movie, the meeting takes place in the mountains of China, the Zu legend looks like another dimension! Thank you for using Tsui Hark for CGI effects. He is able to portray his imagination of the mountains floating above the clouds, the land where the creatures fly freely, and the forces that move from sharp crusaders, split swords and ultra cold moons. many characters in this, the focus is mainly on King Sky and Enigma. Romance is here, although the film looks much darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on the screen makes this film a great attention. At the beginning, I like how it looks like Countess (from Zu Warriors) and plays Enigma well when dealing with the past life. By the way, did I mention that Cecilina is very eye-catching? In fact, Zu Warriors had more comedic elements and his special effects were limited due to his time in 1983. Tsui Hark will convert it to a whole new level and set a new standard in the cinema.
