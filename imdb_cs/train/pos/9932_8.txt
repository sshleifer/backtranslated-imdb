If you go into this movie expecting something that is not, you will be disappointed as with any movie. This film contains what Hemmingway described as a "glacier effect". On the surface is simply a cache of random film clips that smashed the film together. If it was written in the book, it would be a short story, because the action in the movie is very fast, and if you do not really try to capture it, argumentation for a plot (along with some fine foreboding) can go very well. Definitely a movie that you will have to see twice to fully realize. Experimental cinematography hardly describes this film. The production of cameras and post production contributes to the overall taste of the film, which is quite artistic at some points and, in other cases, open interpretation (something that seems late in American films). Although in some parts it may be somewhat angry, scary, and too heavy for some audiences, the movie never becomes completely unrealistic. The only aspect of a movie that I would write as "needs improvement" is the choice of a soundtrack. No movie is good at all without a soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is quite appropriate, the opening is a bit too long, and other rap songs in the movie could actually be replaced with something more appropriate (heavy, eccentric rock or psychedelic electronics would make this film a real way). Flooding the image and dynamic ... color palettes adds another "artistic" aspect to it, combined with the events that take place throughout the movie, it's not a movie that you may miss and still understand. However, it also makes a much more desirable movie to watch, and not one who is quickly bored. 8.5 / 10
