*** SPOILERS *** Also in real life and in movies is a well-known story that happens to many young men who are in their hands placed in a war zone with a gun or a rifle. The case of the young and innocent who never maintained or used the gun, Jimmy Davis, Franchot Tone, has repeatedly echoed thousands of times over the centuries when men like Jimmy Davis are forced to accept weapons for their country. > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jimmy, who first wanted to cross the US Army but was encouraged to stay in the mouth with his good friend Fred P. Willis, Spencer Tracy, France. With Jimmy's machine, which was fastened to the German machine gun's nest, he managed to disqualify him from a commission that selected about half a dozen German soldiers from the safety of the nearby church tower. When Jimmy shot the last surviving German, who raised his hands in surrender, that the artillery shell hit the tower that had seriously injured him. Recovery from his wound at an army hospital with Jimmy fell in love with the American Army volunteer sister Rose Duffy, Gladys George. Rose was really in love with Jimmy's good friend, happy to go happy with Fred, despite his unpleasant irritation to her. It is when Fred was lost in the West Front fight that Rose, thinking he was killed, fell in love and later married Jimmy. When Fred unexpectedly appeared in a French city where Jimmy, now fully recovered from his wounds, found himself in things that were very sticky to him, and with Rose, who had already accepted Jimmy's marriage proposal with him! <br /> <br /> With World War I and Jimmy marry, Rose left Fred, who is still in love with him, a bitter and indignant young man. It was almost a coincidence that Fred hit Jimmy in the streets of New York City and discovered for his shock and surprise that he had completely changed from the quiet and non-violent person he knew before he was sent to a war on the European Western Front. Easy and confident and the ability to shoot a gun, Jimmy has become a top gangster in the New York underworld! And not only because Fred later found out that his wife, Rose, had no idea what Jimmy really was involved in, and Jimmy told her that she was working as a legal and harmless policyholder. Jimmy's life of crime came when Rose learned of her secret life, drove him to the police to prevent him from performing a massacre like a "massacre" with his gang members dressed as cops, his rivals mafia. At the trial, Jimmy came to his senses, admitting that his guilt is willing to face the music and return to life after his three-year sentence. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ALERT *** Hearing of other convicts that Rose and his best friend Fred had a matter behind his back, Jimmy broke out of prison and ended up as a refugee by law. It's at Fred's Circus, where he works as a hawk as well as crazy that Jimmy saw that Rose, like Fred, was true that he, like in his process, had a sudden change of heart. But the thought of returning to jail, at least another decade to add to his sentence, was too great for Jimmy. It was at that time that Jimmy decided to end everything by leaving the police, who subsequently traced him to do his job, that he had no heart for him!
