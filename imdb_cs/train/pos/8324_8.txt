This is a romantic comedy, where Albert Einstein, greatly played by Walter Matthau, and his comrades play a match with his niece (Meg Ryan) and talented car mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interplay between these major tasks is complemented by the amazing support of casting famous actors. This movie is cute and fun ... "good feeling"! Nice recommendation.
