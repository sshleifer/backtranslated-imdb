It helps immensely if one is acquainted with the culture and the time period in which this film takes place. First of all, these ladies are NOT geisha, they are oirans (prostitutes) in the Yoshiwara type "green houses" around 1860, give or take. This should help to clarify some details that can be confusing unconscious. The film deals with the issue of loyalty, love, and perhaps the most important way for people to deal with a disability, whether it is their own, or with others in their immediate surroundings. This together with incredible photos and surprisingly beautiful music make a beautiful ride. Just connect, pause your infidelity and enter their world. You will not be disappointed.
