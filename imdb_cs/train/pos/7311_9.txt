Halloween is a movie, I have to get out and watch every time it's that day of the year. I even watch it sometimes when it's not leave !!! This movie is so great. Jay Lee Curtis is an actress I can never stop loving. This movie could be old, but the story line always gets me there, and the acting was absolutely fantastic !!! Although I have not seen a remake, I feel it was completely useless. I think Rob Zombie Never make such a classic. But what kills me is knowing there are some people who saw a remake without hearing the original. I become furious, I just think about it !!!!!! was great, and in history it will always be remembered as a classic.
