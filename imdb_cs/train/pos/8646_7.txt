In 1990, Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis made television too young to die, where they played almost the same type of work they did in California. I have no doubt that it was what led to their casting on this great screen. California finds aspirational writer David Duchovny and his girlfriend, art photographer Michelle Forbes in relation to Spiritual obsession with writing a book and getting into the minds and souls of serial killers. In fact, he's scheduled for the most common odyssey, wants to go to the skin and visit the sites of several well-known serial killers. But he and Forbes are just broken. Fate intervenes more than funds with the advent of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, a few strange Southern types who have agreed to split the cost of gas to this country trip. It turned out that Pitt is a serial killer himself, and he decides to do a little research himself, immersing himself in the mind of someone who is fascinated by amorality. California is not the kind of movie I usually go, but in fact the acting ability and the charisma of Brad Pitt do so to a large extent. Pitt is the definition of walking of the inbred Gothic refugee from Deliverance. But better than she is Juliette Lewis, who again plays these low types of self-confidence that seem to be doing well. Look at her scene with Forbes when she's doing her hair and Lewis describes her sad and poor life. Lewis 'dialogue and Forbes' reactions should be reflected in acting classes across the country. For those who like their biting movements, they do not come better than California.
