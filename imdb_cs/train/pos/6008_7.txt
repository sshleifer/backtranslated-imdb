When I first saw the film at the beginning of the 1970s, I was amazed in this film. Visually, it was stunning, and the events at universities in Europe and the US combined with what Antonioni had been trying to visually think of in the last 15 minutes of the film: launch into your mind "tyrant" races and big business interests. Repeated blowing of a beautiful house in the middle of the desert, the leading female figure who enjoys the natural flow of cold water, paint the plane in psychedelic patterns (even what British Airways did a few years ago) are some of the paintings that have been copied for decades advertising staff all over the world. Even Pink Floyd raised his fan after the movie was released. <br /> <br /> You see this movie 30 years later and start wondering why the same movie lost its appeal. Today, films have a lot of substance against filing - facts, documentation, subtle performances and excellent scenarios. Antonioni seems obsolete; wrong genius. Even looking at Antonioni's "Blow Up" now gives you a similar feeling of being a passport. <br /> <br /> "Zabriski Point" must be judged for what it was when he was released. It was a great movie if you saw it on Panavision's wide screen, unlike stunning TV screens. Visual and Phonetic (Mick Jagger, Kieth Richards, Pink Floyd, et al.) Attract the film. The leading couple were not big actors, but they were cute and natural. One of them (Mark Frechette) died in a US prison and spread the reality of the non-conforming values ​​he personified in the film. Today Antonioni looks like a "sync." But watch carefully and appreciate the muted sounds of regular actors - Rod Taylor, G.D. Spradling, ladies by the pool, police at the air belt. Real sounds are in contrast to nonconformists. Antonioni was relevant thirty years ago, but his understanding of the media can not be disputed even today. He knew what he was doing.
