Hook or By Crook is an extremely innovative film from a pair of extremely clever and talented creators, Harry Dodge and Silas Howard. He tries to tell the original story in a distinctive cinematic style and is beautifully shot by Ann T. Rosetti and beautifully written - really poetic. <br /> <br /> The characters are true heroes and serve as a rare type of model / inspiration for sheds and dikes everywhere. This movie has so much energy, so terrifying passion and the sore heart of San Francisco. I can not recommend it enough! <br /> <br /> The best film of all time!
