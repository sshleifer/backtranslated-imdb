According to the director, this film was popular in Asia. It is rather difficult to take these movies seriously because most of his films are shot at a very small budget. Nearly no USD at all. It is fascinating to find out that Mats Helge will eventually finish something that can be called an action movie. Ninja Mission is - in my opinion - the best among all the movies she runs. Some special effects are pretty nice. This is not a movie "B" or "C". It's the movie "Z" - but fun and funny movie "Z"!
