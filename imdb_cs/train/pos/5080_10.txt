When ever a movie produces or directs Mel Ferrer, you can bet your life any image of it will be seen for generation after generation. Only with Claudette Colbert (Ellen R. Ewing), "The Egg & I", "47 will appear and play in the movie will be even more great classic film." In this film Ellen Ewing got married and then meets many kinds of mental problems and even Murder The mystery is very entangled and Robert Ryan (David McLean), "Battle of the Arrow," 65, comes to help Ellen and sometimes you even wonder that David is up and up. When you look at this picture, you will find out that you are starting to understand who is a real nutty person and suddenly you will begin to change your mind about how the film will end. Great acting by Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, who played a completely different role than usual on the screen. I forgot to mention that Mel Ferrer was married to Audrey Hepburn's great movie star. Great classic movie with great classic actors!
