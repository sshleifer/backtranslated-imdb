Red Rock West (1993) Nicolas Cage is involved in a deadly crime without first knowing it, and dominos leads to increasing danger, adventures and misfortunes in the wildlife abandoned by the American West of the nineties. Red Rock West is often brutal and sometimes cheerful, and Cage pulls a mix with his usual sardonic joke and caution. <br /> <br /> Is the conspiracy over the top? Yes. Is Dennis Hopper perfect as a crazy, almost grateful killer? Yes. Does Cage have an opportunity? Well, you have to look and see. It never stays, and it surprised me when I first saw it. On the second look yesterday I was surprised how well it was, how good it was, and how weird and fun it was at the same time. Director Ron Dahl (who also helped to write) is more famous for his television work, but with Rounders, and with this film he shows his slender hands with stunning drawings. It's rescued by his humor by the way and cartoons. The bar is dirty, the cops are dubious. And do not miss really inspired Dwight Yoakam as a truck driver.
