From the introductory shots of the main actor, we got an early look at how many women live in these women and the humor that comes after everything that happens everyday in everyday life. <br /> <br /> Eric Lartigau, director, watches as many European men feel they have complete control over their lives, but without the help and support of the women around them, it seems. The use of face image throughout the movie is great and its clever placement of a senior family member (mother) is in place. <br /> <br /> Although there is more than laughter in the film, it deals with lonely parents / adoption and the strength of the family in society. Really reward to look, and again one that can only produce a French seam. Meanwhile, one of the top 50 films I've seen this year and is worth rating five starts. I look forward to adding this file to the DVD collection when it's released and I strongly recommend it to all ages.
