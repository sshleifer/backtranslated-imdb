That's why I like this page! I saw this movie in the 1980s on British television. Over the years it does not matter what I wanted to know more about what happened to me as one of the most extraordinary things I've ever seen in my life. With just a few key words I remember, I traced the movie and a lot of information, including the fact that it is going to become an off-Broadway musical! Interestingly, unlike the previous commentator, I do not remember finding this movie sad or exploitative. On the contrary, the extraordinary relationship between mother and daughter is stored in the mind as a testimony of great power, honor and dignity. Surely you can think when I take into account the annoyance of their lives. Maybe it's because I live in Britain, where pale majesty has an established language in the lives of old money, where annoyance is often tolerated as proof of good husbandry; I saw this as a rare and unique representation of a giant spirit, a deep and deep humor, whose utterly fragile and finely balanced structure gave him feel and respect. Something apologized for being debated as a "cult." Over the years, when I lost my mind, the brightest, and above all others, sparkled as an excellent and excellent television experience. It was such a deeply private revelation, it seemed strange that he thought he had become so public that he was a musician in New York. But perhaps somewhere, the daughter will have such a fun experience. She's the one who will have the last laugh maybe .. (Jackie O 'made the musical in front of you)
