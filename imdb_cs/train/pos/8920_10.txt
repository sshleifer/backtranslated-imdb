I did not know Steve McQueen in 1958. I just knew I was extremely scared to see this movie. (I was destroyed by the movie "Trantula" at the age of seven ... but now I was ten). The first scene, in which Blob crawled the farmer's guard bar and drew his hand, was enough to let me leave the theater. But I stayed and suffered every attack of our monster. I felt such a horror when Steve and his girl barely got out of a medical office (bad doc) and even more when The Blob entered the cinema and ate a large audience. . . so many people in fact are oooooozzzzzzed from the front door, too huge to fit through just one. It seemed to be indestructible and unlimited growth potential, and when he imprisoned the poor Steve in the form of a dinner dinner, it seemed to be a supper. <br /> <br /> To say that Blob was cold, it will be a modern description of the day, but eventually better ice than a scary and psychically torn small child. night with my uncle Nick, I try to act bravely. He knew I was having trouble, and when I got to bed in the night, I could not just feel Blob in the room, but when I called the courage to look down on the floor, there was a red pulse, a heart like a hungry guy sitting and waiting, until I try to get up and go to the bathroom. It took months before she recovered. <br /> <br /> I have 57 years. . . I did it. <br /> <br /> Of course, Blob was not destroyed.
