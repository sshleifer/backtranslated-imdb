It is a film that is characterized by love in the age. The film consists of Keaton, who seeks love in the Stone Age, in ancient Rome and the present (1920s). In all three cases, he is the usual bumpy Buster and fights against Wallace Beery for his love. From these three time periods, I think I enjoyed the best of the Romans, even though I admit that it could also be the easiest. Actually, I liked scenes with the left, who was probably a costume boy, as well as a strange chariot race in the snow - but what I enjoyed most was seeing the amazing Keaton acrobatics. However, all three time periods were good old fun, and the film, though not the best, is an extraordinary and fun movie. Look at it!
