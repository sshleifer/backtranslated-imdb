I first saw this movie on a movie channel (HBO?). I was a fan of a public enemy, NWA and another early rap and saw CB4 in theaters. Anyway, the promotion was capturing me and I wanted to see what it was all about. Well, I knew from the bats that it would be good (WARNING!) And I'm right. The parodic songs themselves make this film to be watched over and over again (My Peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the film was great. You must love rap satire (of course NWA), certain rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube) and the humor of three NWH members. Who Can Forget the Tone Deaf scratching with your ass? It's a bad thing that this movie did not get the merits it deserved, because it was a CB4 during their release, but in my opinion it's a much better film. If you know and love the 90th gangster rap, you will be watching for a long time and laughing with this movie. If you are not, or will not like, "rap", you will enjoy jokes at the expense of this genre.
