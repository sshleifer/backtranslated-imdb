The scene where Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg get to the mall to revive Sally's smoldering spirit is a good reason to enjoy this movie, but wait! Even more! It's a cracking good touch of daily television, movie stars on the way down, (and up) and horror of love. Robert Downey Jr shows the lighter side of her genius and Cathy Moriarty is gorgeous. Dialogue is humorous and physical humor is done with perfect skill. This is a film that will appeal to those who really enjoy acting, acting and writing.
