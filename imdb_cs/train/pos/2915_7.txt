Bunny Comes Home "This male navy" deserves more credits than it gets, the clever screenplay of Borden Chase, directed by "Wild Bill" Wellman, the film has just the right feeling of wounds after the WW2 euphoria and goodwill and none of the blind terror came into play a few years later. Made in 1944, the Japanese defeated the battle scenes a bit of déjà vu, the melancholic attraction of Tom Drake for the vibrant young Jan Clayton has a solid chemistry, plays real and confirms Drake's career at the Metro. The following year, Jan opened on Broadway in Carousel. Wally Beery, a pale pale eye, always boasts Jimmy Gleason's unbeliever? his memories improve over reality and give Beers as Ulysses-as a shadow to play against. The Navy LTA (Lighter Than Air) is authentic, photographed in Tustin and Lakehurst, and the P-38 is AFB's March AFB. Lot 3 doubled for India and Bunny to U-turn? Bunny coming home ?? gives back Beery an authentic slice of her past, something she wanted to believe is true? then is the future we turn again fantastic? now on a larger scale, the newly designed LTA naval aircraft with the launch capability for the reconnaissance plane? how expensive, blissfully optimistic? Still, "Do you have to believe it, is that the way things are done?"
