The only explanation I can gather about why this film is not widespread is that it got too close to home. This movie was a really happy surprise that satire is brilliant. This film turns on the lights in the dark, which is organized by religion and large media, and the cockroaches cross. Rent a DVD and watch yourself, if you have not succeeded, this movie succeeded where many of them failed (dogma comes to mind) to try under the nose under your nose, both with humor and very clever analogies connected with background and location narration. We can not comment more deeply without revealing any significant spoilers. There are some surprises in this film, which even an experienced film fan will take.
