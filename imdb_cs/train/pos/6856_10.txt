This is a thrilling work by Brian De Palmawith an amazing performance all around! It's extremely exciting and often scary and the score is fantastic, plus all the characters were amazing. Yes, it's a lot of psycho, but it's still a brilliantly made horror / thriller, with a fantastic opening and a shocking and unpredictable final! This is undoubtedly one of the best horror / thrillers I've ever seen, and the lift scene is one of the most memorable scenes ever and Michael Caine is just amazing in this! The end is great and the hospital scene at the end is totally terrifying, and the end of the end shocked me! It never helped me, and the trace marks are absolutely great, plus Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon had fantastic chemistry together! This is an exciting masterpiece by Brian De Palma with amazing performances all around! Direction is incredible! Brian De Palma is doing incredible work here with incredible camera angles, unbelievable angles, fantastic use of colors, amazing zoom and marvelous POV shots and film keeping at a very fast pace! It's a little blood. We get bloody stings, knives, bloody fire wounds, and two bloody cut throats. The act is amazing! Michael Caine is amazing, he is amazing in the acting department, he is scary, he is very kind, he was mysterious, and he really just did a great job overall and he loved it! (Caine Rules!). Angie Dickinson gives unforgettable performance here and was quite beautiful and had a good chemistry with Caine. Nancy Allen is STANGINGLY GORGEOUS, and she's fantastic, she's extremely sympathetic as a footballer, she had a superb chemistry with Keith Gordon, and she's made a huge show! Keith Gordon is very good as a kid, he had excellent chemistry with Nancy Allen and he was very nice! Dennis Franz is a good detective. Overall, this is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made, and I say what you did right now and go for it! ***** of 5
