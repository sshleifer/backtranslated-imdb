Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have a solid hit in their television work. However, their film work was much more adorned (2008's The Job Job was fine, last year is over the universe certainly weak, for example). Still Crazy, fortunately, is a solid success. It has a great story, great performances, lots of humor, wonderful music and above all everything else, a real heart. The taste of "moments" and this movie has one of them - just when everything is going on in the shape of a pear at a festival meeting ... <br /> <br /> Very pleasant.
