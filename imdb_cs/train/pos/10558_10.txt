<br /> <br /> Charlie Kauffman has done a special marvelous metaphysical rage, but this Canadian jewel makes it cheerful. <br /> <br /> Like most of the strange movies, the plot is called less, the better, but we are directing the scene, two friends Anthony and Dave are together since childhood, they can not cope with the world, and in the end it means they no longer have to . But that's where even more problems start. I loved the film, I made myself smile at the end of the loan, and it is a rare experience with so many massive pieces of "nothing." <br /> <br /> Do not miss this. <br /> <br />
