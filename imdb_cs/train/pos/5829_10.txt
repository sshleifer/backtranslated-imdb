This is one of my two or three favorite Stooges shorts and undoubtedly the best actor Christine McIntyre with a trio. In many other shorts it is good, but here is absolutely great. Her singing is not at all funny, in fact, she is absolutely beautiful, but the plot is built in such a way that singing improves humor rather than detracts from its meaning. We hear that McIntyre sings the voice of the Voice at least three times, but never grows up, partly because we do not deny her voice and partly because she is well tolerated by Stoog's brownies. The use of the opera soprano in comedy recalls the role of Kitty Carlisle in "Night at the Marx Brothers Opera," but singing is much more a part of comedy than Opera and McIntyre (perhaps more in performances than here) exhibited her own comedy talent that Carlisle never Stuoges' crazy, McIntyre singing, and a well-built conspiracy to combine for 5 out of 5 stars.
