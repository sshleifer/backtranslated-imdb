This comic-book movie is funny, has a nice action and a great futuristic style. Writer Steven de Souza, who also wrote the Commando, gives Arnie a lot of lines to succeed: "Send me a copy" after signing the contract and punishing money with lawyers back; "What sore throat," after strangling the subzero with barbed wire; "She had to divide," as she slashed her body between her legs; And finally, when Killian encounters a billboard with his own face, Arnie concludes: "It's done now." Perhaps even a little reminds of total memory, other sci-fi movies play Schwarzenegger.
