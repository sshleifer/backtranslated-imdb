The best Treasure Island he ever did. They just make movies like this or not. No one is making such movies. More than new, this movie is fun, honest and fascinating, but moody, mysterious and deaf. This is one of my favorite pictures. The director had to have some idea of ​​what it is all about, but he certainly leaves room for your own impressions and interpretations, while leaving the little left for fantasy. Why he did not do such other movies, I have no idea. Although they remind me of some of the best noir, it's unique. But this <br /> <br /> is not lazy or simple.
