This is actually a stupid little film made of absolutely no distinctive budget that was filmed on video jitter. It takes a little time to warm up. The game is so bad that it soon gets a zen-like spell. After several scenes, you will notice the inappropriate lines or try the sound of some supplies. All characters develop a special charm, especially "Richard". Forget about Anthony Hopkins, Maidens is the guy I'd hire to play a psyche. He seems to like him very much! Mixing with scenes of mad gore collisions and zombie infestations are some truly visually effective shots of the title character, the "Midnight Skater" zooming school campus in black sweatshirts, looking the whole world as a cross between Grim Reaper and say Silver Surfer. These shots sometimes make ridiculous things about Skater that seem almost ominous. The soundtrack contains some very entertaining garage punk melodies and dirty, nasty stupidity that suits the film's mood well. Thumb, I say that.
