If you like Deep Purple, you'll enjoy this excellent movie with Stephen Rea in the lead role. The story is about the most famous rock band in the 70's, Strange Fruits, and decided to play again. Of course, there will be a lot of problems during their concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are great and the song "Flame Still Burns" is perfect. You have to look at it.
