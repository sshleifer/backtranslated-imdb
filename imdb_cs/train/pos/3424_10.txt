The information contained in this film is somewhat familiar to many who have recently paid attention to news. Walter Reed's scandals show a small part of the fact that when they return, we do not do a good job of caring for our wounded heroes. What this film further shows is a truth common to all wars. Psychological trauma suffered by soldiers in engaging in war, and the difficulties they face when returning to civilian life. They are not just changed or affected, they are other people and most do not know how to deal with it because they do not know themselves. Finally, this film shows what the army does to our young men in women when preparing for the war, and the policies and procedures that must follow in pursuing the war that leads to all the psychic trauma. We have over 3000 dead soldiers in four years of this invasion; but we have many tens of thousands of people suffering from a life-long physical and psychological trauma due to this war. No matter which side you are, you need to know the cost of war to decide if we should be in the store. This movie perfectly reflects the costs for men and women.
