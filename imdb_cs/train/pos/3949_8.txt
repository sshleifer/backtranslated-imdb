Like many people on this site, I have seen this film only once when it was first broadcast in 1971. Some scenes remain in my memory and the overall feeling of concern is how I remember being affected. I would be fascinated if it was seen again if it was ever available for home video. Possible Spoiler: I wonder if anyone else would agree that the basic settings and characters could be derived from the 1960 British film, originally called The City of the Dead, called the Horror Hotel for the US Edition? There are some similarities to the later British film The Wicker Man. <br /> <br /> One detail remains with me after years of seeing the movie. It's a small but significant moment near the beginning of the film. As I recall, the minister and his wife stopped to help some people along the road around 1870, somewhere in the west. Friendly, seemingly Ray Milland will present himself and her (daughter?), Yvette Mimieux, a beautiful young mute woman. While the preacher helps Ray Milland with the wagon, the rattlesnake is cramped and horribly twisted, without any character except Yvette Mimieux. She does not seem afraid at all, but she stares at the snake with a silent concentration until it disappears. With this strange moment, we already realize that there is something unusual about these seemingly normal people, although the potential danger to the minister and his wife remains indefinite and uncertain for a long time. One small scene stays with me alive after all these years along with many others. The film has a terrible quality that is not going to go, and no wonder people remember so vividly. Someone should do this for home video!
