Oh, noir. My favorite genre. Otto Preminger continues the film "Laura" is a film noir based in post-war New York, where corruption and violence take place uncontrollably. He plays Dana Andrews as Sergeant Mark Dixon, a detective whose brutal tactics have brought him to sinful superiors in hot water. <br /> <br /> When he accidentally kills a murder suspect, Dixon tries to blame Tommy Scale's crime boss. Dixon is approaching his goal when he joins Morgan Taylor's dead, beautiful wife. Of course, in the typical noir fashion, things go quickly down. <br /> <br /> While the movie makes nothing of an interesting camera or story wise, it has a constant tone of fear and darkness. Like most of the great noir, it's also a gorgeous, spectator's home right from the start. Still, like most of Preminger's workshops, it's not something I would watch again. Wilder's word sense, Hitchcock visual prowess, or space experiments with Welles are missing. Like Lang's later work, the "sidewalk" feels a very "clone" of what should be noir, instead of something truly artistically authentic. <br /> <br /> Thematically the film is nothing special. It's about a policeman who is slowly becoming a criminal. In one scene, Dixon explains that his father himself was a small time step, a fake movie with a notion of predestination, but this one scene is as far as Otto goes or dares to take his ideas. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera is also a disappointment. There's no intelligence in Otto's camera. No effort is made to assign the camera anything. It does not play with space or architecture or an empathic step-by-step procedure. These are only tripods with occasional mines and out. Not meaningless, though most people do not care about these things. <br /> <br /> But there is one good shot where our hero is imprisoned in a car full of gangsters (noir cage), who enters the elevator (another cage) and enters the main gangster of the lair. Like Lynch's "Blue Velvet," Otto retopologizes the film, constantly resembling "up" to hell. This works well, but the design sample does not consolidate it. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Otto seems to be content with the Hawksian form of what is noir, rather than a toy with options where noir can go. Like "Well in the City," "Scarlet Street," "Lonely," "Law of Violence," "Bomberang," and "Johnny Eager," "Where the Path Ends" He is competent and pilgrimage, but lacks a special extra magic.
