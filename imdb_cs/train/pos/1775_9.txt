I often wonder why this series has been so foolish. I thought he was great and he was very smart and written. I think in the next time it will be seen in the light it deserves, that is, if it is ever released. This is where many young and young comedians appeared and everything was bigger. Perhaps this will inform people about their value and will have to be released. Sally Phillips, Simon Pegg, Peter Serafinowicz and last but not least Julian Rhind-Tutt from the enormously successful Green Wing. Writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews are two of the best comic writers of modern age. Anyone who can produce a comedy like Father Ted can not be able to write something that would not be worth publishing. If it's ever released, I'll definitely buy it.
