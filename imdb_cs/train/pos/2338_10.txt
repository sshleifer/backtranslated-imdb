Many of these other viewers complain that the story line has already been tempered. That may be so, but adding the narrator and Dr.Suess as sceneries makes this show a necessity to watch. With adult cues throughout the series and the touch of childhood across the set, the show is both reminiscent and encouraging. The investigative part of the show is not what attracts the audience. Promised land and love lines scattered in this seeming paradise are what faithful viewers are returning more. This is a success that ABC should never leave. Bravo ABC. LOST grew up, a way to revive the main time. 9 episodes in front of the writer hit the left audience, who wanted more.
