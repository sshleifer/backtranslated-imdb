For years, we've been watching every horror film coming out of boring Hollywood protectors like Saw 2, to a terrible indie release that's totally incomprehensible ... we suffer from all the bad movies in the hope that we can find little gems like Dark Remains. <br /> <br /> We managed to capture the screening of this movie at Shriekfest 2005. The audience loved it and I believe it ended in winning the Best Film Award. <br /> <br /> While not having the budget or stellar power of studio films, it packs it up with a serious blow in a ghostly atmosphere and fear. Acting and cinematography are top-notch, but it's the direction from which this film is worth. The story and characters are evolving at the right pace to provide some fantastic horror. <br /> <br /> Edge and visual fx are also top-notch. And while many horror films can not benefit from music for their benefit, the score for "Dark Remains" only contributes to its craze. I know the film turned out to be a series of festivals, but nobody was close to me so I can not wait to hear it when it finally comes out on DVD. Trust me, even if you're in a bad state of horror movies, try to try this ... you will not regret it!
