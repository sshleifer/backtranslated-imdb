I had no place to go. I was on a flight to Vancouver. I would probably miss this film if I did not choose Air Canada. Looking at the small screen at the back of the seat, I found it charming and fascinating. I went in several places and had to move back, but I had to watch it end. Now I am looking forward to the DVD release in Europe, although I will be as attributed when I can go out, it still needs to be discovered! The photographic composition is stunning, and the film gives so many insights and "fills" the story of the photo. <br /> <br /> We recommend (if you have time for your hands).
