None of your harder stories, and that's the real strength of this movie. There are at least two relationships in which less reliable writers would add some predictable romantic tensions. Not only does it save the audience but also surprising. There are several Disney-ish moments, especially near the end, but they are manageable. Overall it is worth the rent and it was good and relaxed fun. <br /> <br /> BTW, if you have a DVD, look at the segment where the director teaches you how to make albo gobi. We followed her instructions and it was BRILLIANT! Next day we'll do it the day before we plan to eat because it's one meal that definitely improves in the refrigerator and lets cook spices!
