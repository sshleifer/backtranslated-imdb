Jake's Closet has the emotional power of Kramer vs. Kramer in combination with the imagination of the Panovsk√Ω labyrinth. Even the initial special effect apparently nodded to the labyrinth of Panov. But it's a story that's going on in modern times, not in the war sixty years ago, and it has even more resonance today. Jake's Closet is about a boy, the only child, virtually himself on a summer vacation that deals with the breakdown of his family. It's a horror movie like the other and sixth sense, a horror movie for the idea. If you're looking for a movie slasher, it will not be your cup of tea, but if you're looking for a story that's both so concerned and thrilling with a good actor, it's the movie for you. In the projections I saw, I swear there was one moment when the whole audience shouted. I highly recommend capturing this movie.
