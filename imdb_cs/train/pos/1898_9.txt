Alcoholic drummer's father Who, Keith Moon, was named Arthur. In this film, I found so many similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon. Liza Minelli, who mostly OVERACTS, did a pretty good job in this and was able to turn her face on Dudley Moore in every round. Yes, I agree, Sir John steals absolutely every scene. It was a "different" film that allowed the viewer to look into another life. We often try to capture the repetition of this film on a satellite. God rests Dudley Moore; it was such a nice movie. A lot of satire and thumbs down to the rich and snobby / rich. The close friendship between Moore and Sir John is somewhat cute.
