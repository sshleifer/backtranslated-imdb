It was a lot of things for me to look at. <br /> <br /> First I was a Shakespeare class school I did not like, much less understood by half! Shakespeare would be no more than REALLY without pouring all my concentration into almost encrypted games ... encrypted in my extremely difficult language ... and then I would not get it. <br /> <br /> <br /> Second, it took 4 hours! I never thought it might be a good thing. Well, let me tell you something. This movie was so masterful, so beautiful, I actually understood the whole language it was being performed. The script was followed by a letter in this movie, the same script that was not understandable to me in Shakespeare's class. And here I opened my mind and I understood it. I was doubtful when I watched the movie almost! But then, when it happens, Shakespeare is alive. So this version of Hamlet has shown me that Shakespeare is indeed a master who has written great stories. When I saw it on the big screen, especially in a big budget with a great movie style (with beautiful cinematography and photographs) and stunning Brannagh and casting, somehow ... I understood what was going on. What has been said. The language is amazing and passionate. It allows for more raw emotions ... when words can not describe anything, perhaps Shakespeare's words can. <br /> <br /> I still keep this day that Fist of the North Star is the biggest movie ever made. No movie offers more fun entertainment. But for a movie that is approaching a dethroning fist from this position (which Hamlet did - is coming) is really amazing ... inspirational. It was not a movie. It was an event. <br /> <br /> Even more amazing, I appreciated Shakespeare. Wow. Strong. Powerful is the word. One of the rare, really powerful movies there. <br /> <br /> This gets from the endless stars two hundred trillion stars. Yes Yes. <br /> <br /> By the way, all your children in the Shakespeare class ... forget about it. You lose your time. You have to see the games played. Only then shall they be given righteousness.
