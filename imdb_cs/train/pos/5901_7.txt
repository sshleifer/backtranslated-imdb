It's a rehash of many recent movies, but this one has fewer stars, smaller complications, and more fuzzy feelings. Abhay and Rita (played by Fardeen Khan & Esha Deol respectively) meet at a friend's wedding where their own marriage (unbeknowst to them) begins the process of arranging them. At no point are two foreigners married and sent to a wedding camp where they meet other couples who are going through similar movements like theirs. When they spend time together, secrets are revealed, hearts broken and / or edited and love flowers. If you've seen Honeymoon Private Limited and / or Salaam-e-Ishq, then you've seen this movie. The plots of the plot are the same, the whole two and a half hours of the film is not the only element of surprise. Everything is predictable. I only enjoyed it because I saw "Darling" (also playing Deol & Khan leads) and enjoyed their chemistry, so I said "why not" when my sister suggested we rent Just married. <br /> <br /> Look at this: Because Kirron Kher plays in the stars and is her usual darling. <br /> <br /> Skip it: Because you've had enough of all this unusual! <br /> <br /> C ++
