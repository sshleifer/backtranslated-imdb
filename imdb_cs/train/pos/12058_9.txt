Spectacular Horror movie that will give you the winter when you meet it. The atmosphere is very scary and stylish, the score is cool, but the best of the film is the performance. It is rare that you are afraid of the performance and the solid acting of this film plays an important role in the fear factor. The story is very interesting and gets your attention from the first minute. Although the woman in black does not have much time on the screen, she does the necessary performance to cool the audience in some great scenes. Dialogues are very descriptive and make your imagination work and that is when it becomes really scary. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, watch it at the theater, it's a whole different experience, but it's just as awesome as this movie. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Ghost films at all, and it's aimed at people who want to get scared.
