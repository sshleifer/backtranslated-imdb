Meteor sinks from the sky and wakes up the plesiosaur, who has long terrified the area around the crater lake. When a monster eats local people, he tries to find a monster killing. Recent attempts to send old movies about horror and sci-fi movies, such as Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and Alien Trespass, are a bit outrageous when you have movies like Crater Lake Monster available for screening. It's a kind of movie that spoof these films and send just this is a real deal. It's all that those movies try to be just tongue-to-face and its much more fun because of it. It's a real drive - in a movie that was unfortunate to come, just like star wars have changed the way we look at special effects. Monster, a mix of motion and life-sized head, is a charming little animal. Movie players ruin viewers with frequent monster shots and chaos. Surely it is clear that all his fake, but not movies about the suspension of unbelief? Actually, I think it's really great monsters that have it. <br /> <br /> I like this movie in a low budget drive in some way. If you want a really authentic disc in the movie monster look on. This would be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar jet monsters (Boggy Creek etc.).
