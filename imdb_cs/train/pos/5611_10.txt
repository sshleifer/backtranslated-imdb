I saw this movie at a time when I was shy with the idea of ​​moving to my apartment and starting my life myself. Maybe that's why I took it so seriously. I fully believed the psychic degradation of poor figures within Paris of eternal construction sites, dust, misery, selfishness, rudeness, anger and decay. I give Polanski the artistic award of all recognition of his direction, his acting and the inevitable script, but in the terrible final scene I fainted and had to revive him with a cognac in the theater manager's office. Luckily for me, my life on my own was not as disastrous as this one (so far), but I have always maintained great respect for the artist who can do such an illusion and so plunge into the (fake) reality he is trying to say. Simply put, the man is the brilliant genius first and merit of the human race. This film is the sum of many, many examples of great acting and great casting. Since some performances were performed in English (scenes with Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas) and others in French (with most other characters) and Polanski did his own dubbing in English and French, I cordially recommend you, if you are bilingual, to switch the sound from French to English and vice versa, during the respective scenes while watching a spectacular transmission on DVD Paramount. This film is part of Polanski's so-called "apartment house trilogy," which also includes "Reflection" and "Rosemary's Baby". Unfortunately, the "Odd" still has not achieved a decent DVD transfer in area 1. Needless to say that the three films will create a beautiful boxset.
