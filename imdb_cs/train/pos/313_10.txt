I'm a black American and I loved this solo opera. I watched it dubbed it in Spanish on telemus almost 5-7 years ago. The story was a TRUE story of a black slave who is a love affair with the white commander led to her leadership and a sincere, moody way of life. Many of us could learn a lot from XICA. She took what she had, nothing, and saw her options. Many would think that they were selling - but trying to secure her future and future children. It was such an excellent soap opera that I thought it would be released on DVD, but it was not released. This soap opera was the best fashion opera EVER. We need it to be released on DVD or re-broadcast on TV. It plays just in Aztec America, which is only available in Mexico or in the US with a cable. We need her to be released again to Telemundo.
