My father was a prisons prison (now retired) who appeared in this document and I grew up around the prison, so my views will be completely different from everyone else watching this movie. Let's say this, the filmmakers who brought us this 93-minute miracle are fantastic artists and even better people. They were so brave that A) showed and told this story, B) they got into these prisoners of mind and heart and C) it all responsibly. Responsible for his arts and especially for the prisoners and staff of the Luther Luckett Correctional Complex. They should be unqualified for this job. If you want to have 170 hours, yes HOURS, records and you can reduce them and reduce them to 93 stunning minutes, there is nothing extraordinary and have the greatest respect. I saw this film in circumstances that very, very few people saw it. I was at prison screening. I was in the same room with these men as they watched their heart pour on the screen. I saw people weeping on television and weeping in the chair in front of me and allowing me to tell you it was a very profound experience. These men, in some cases, have committed terrible crimes, but they find ways to try to redeem, even if they feel they are inexhaustible. How many of us have the courage to do this? How many people can do what they did in such a harsh environment? Seeing them react to the film was an experience I'm always grateful for, and I will never forget it. I thank the men who gave me this look into their lives, thank my father for doing everything I can, and thank Philomath Films for taking the time to pour his blood, sweat, soul and tears into this project. /> <br /> This movie will change everything you think you know about the life of the prison and the prisoners contained therein. "Oz" is not real, television is not real. "Shakespeare Behind Bars" is.
