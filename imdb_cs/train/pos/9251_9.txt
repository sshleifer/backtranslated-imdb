what can I tell ?, ms Erika Eleniak is my favorite blonde ever and as an Italian American, the number one fan of feminine beauty, I can not forget about this film. <br /> <br /> You know, Do not forget the plot or the situation or the other actors. I just remember that I have a beautiful Erica dead and that she looks better than ever in this movie, I really do not care if it was a bad movie or a good movie, I only care about the nice moments when I was only a Brooklyn teenager I'm thinking about the beauty of Erika. <br /> <br /> Well, just to conclude if you're a fan of Eric Eleniak's beauty like me, surely this movie is for you.
