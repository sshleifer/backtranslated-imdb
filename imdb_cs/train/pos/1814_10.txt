All dogs that go to heaven are, in my opinion, the best animated movies ever. I'm not a big fan of animated movies, but there's something about what's better than any other animated movie I've ever seen. The music is amazing, just like the performance of Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise and above all Ken Page as King Gator. "Let's Make Music Together" is perhaps one of my favorite songs from any musical movie I've seen. This is definitely necessary for people of all ages.
