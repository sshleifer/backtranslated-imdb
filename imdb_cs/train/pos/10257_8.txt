what can I say about this movie that has not been told yet? well, true, it looks very fake like some of the crying and kicking. as Charlie's gloss, though it was real I do not know. I'm sure they would beat her and kick her much harder if it were. pressed scenes and hot oil look very real. and the final needle in the eye scene is surprisingly done and is probably the only thing on a movie that sometimes shocked me.
