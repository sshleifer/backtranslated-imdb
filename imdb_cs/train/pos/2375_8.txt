I honestly think it was the best version of the world war I've ever seen. it was funny, but it was also educational I learned a lot of the movie and if I could even the movie. my favorite part was when the soldiers killed the robot and the other came after him. in the last film war in the world I think it should be the first and it would be better. but in any way I give this film 2 inches up. <br /> <br /> And if they're going to make another movie, I'll definitely watch it. <br /> <br /> Thank you
