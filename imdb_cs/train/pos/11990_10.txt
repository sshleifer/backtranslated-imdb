In 1990, the world of Disney TV cartoon was certainly in place. It turned out that as Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers, DuckTales and Gummi Bears were already popular, and now Disney has created another great cartoon, and this cartoon has brought about the birth of Disney in the afternoon. The cartoon is called TaleSpin. It's about the old figure of Jungle Book Baloo the Bear when he gets a job at an airline. In the series, he meets Kit Cloudkicker, a former aviation pirate and good misty surfer, business mistress Rebecca Cunningham and her hyperactive daughter, Molly. This series is very entertaining and has lots of great plays that you do not have to understand as a child, but you will understand later in life. This is a smartly written series and it's great to add to the DVD collection. Parents, buy it for your kids and let them watch all the terrible cartoons Nickelodeon. If you liked TaleSpin, look for "Darkwing Duck" and "Goof Troop". Spread it!
