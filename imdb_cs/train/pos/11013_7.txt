During the war years, many films have been filmed in Hollywood, designed to support our soldiers from the public. They have seen today, some can dismiss them or simply see them as propaganda - which are technical but positive, and serve to unite the nation. This movie is a fairly effective and fun example of the genre - it has a very realistic scenario and good production value. Pat O'Brien plays almost the same character he played in a number of other films (you know, the hard-spoken, hard, but "crazy guy"). Randolph Scott is as competent and entertaining as ever, and the rest of the bonuses are excellent (look at the young Robert Ryan as one of the bombs in the training). While the story recalls several other films about our pilots and crew, the film is so elaborate that it is interesting and not too far away. That maybe except the end itself - where the film is a bit over the top, but also very satisfying. The only serious negative, and that's mostly about nitpickers, is that some of the films are somewhat strikingly integrated in the film, and "nuts" like me who are both history teachers and aircraft lovers are likely to notice - everyone else probably does not notice and.
