As if most people did not have a nervous outlook in the field of dentistry, this little film will certainly cause paranoid patients to disrupt. A successful dental hygienist testifies that his wife goes to the pool (on their anniversary of all the days!) And the great time comes to a furious collapse. After shooting the attacking dog's head, he goes to work and ends his marital aggression on the patients while planning what to do with his "bitch" wife. There are plenty of up-close shots of mouth-jabbing, cutting the tongue, and queen of beauty cuddling, as well as the terribly deranged performance of Corbin Bernsen. The scene in which he binds and marries his wife before it ruthlessly pulls his teeth is hard to watch. The dentist is an absolutely bad type of person who comes out of the deep end and certainly explains this film in detail. The "dentist" is sometimes incredibly entertaining, quick and cheerful. Look at it!
