This film uses fantastic cinematography, the depth of the camera captures every character. Denzel Washington and Kevin Kline embarked on amazing performances, though Washington's accent dies in certain scenes. How is this movie forgotten? unable to rent or hire recently threatens to lose forever. a disturbing idea.

Although criticized for biased nature, the film is a faithful book by Donald Woods and a faithful message to express the world. that and peace
