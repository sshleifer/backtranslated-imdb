One of my favorite performances in the 1980s. After the first season, he started to go down when he decided to add Jean Bruce Scott to the cast. Deborah Pratt was amazing and it was fun to watch her and the figure of Ernest Borgnin to make with him. The last episode that appeared was one of my favorites in the second season. Unfortunately, these days blacks did not last long in television shows. Some of the episodes in the second season where it is ok but in the third season it was more about human practices than Airwolf and it has not been shown until almost at the end of the show. When it came to the US, it was disgusting !!!
