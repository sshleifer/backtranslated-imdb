Opening credits: great. Music: just for this movie. Cinematography: dirty to great effect. <br /> <br /> The terrible excitement in the train-wreck is a bit. That's how out of control can be some lives. "Wonderland" depicts drug-induced wildlife (and its consequences) not as aberrations, but shows how it really happens in our society. It's better than showing another wild group - Manson - because all the movies, books, and so on, Manson are more focused on Manson's mad mind than the overall picture of cheap glory and randomness that is so ubiquitous today. <br /> <br /> To see some of the best "Method-acting" movies, check out the Kilmer movie. It shows how the "Method" can be bored in the right role. The filmmakers are here to succeed in increasing "out-of-control" at the level of artistic form, not only because it gives us cheap excitement.
