ERROL FLYNN had one of his most popular roles as a rough braggart from a fighting Irish family who became the world champion at the time when John L. Sullivan (WARD BOND) said he "can defeat every man alive." Both Flynn and Ward Bond give what is probably among the best performances ever played on the screen. Raoul Walsh directed a colorful story in a robust style, capturing family life as well as scenes, hearts and good humor. All of Warner's players are a gentle performer - including always reliable ALAN HALE as Flynn's inexperienced father, proud of his son's fighting skills, and ALEXIS SMITH, who most closely resembles the role of a girl-like society that loves dealing with his fervent ways. <br /> <br /> All the atmospheres of the eighties are captured in beautiful black and white art, even though it is bad. Warners did not have faith in Flynn to make the movie color. At that time he entered the stone phase of his cinematographic career and dealt with a widely-propagated rape test, which had all busy busy places. Battle scenes are among the best ever choreographies on the screen, with Flynn apparently in subtle form and very little use of doubles for most of the action. And the scene on which Bond converts his poster award to Flynn at a social gathering is one of Ward's most beautiful moments in his long career as a character actor. <br /> <br /> Summary: Keeps your interest all the way, you are a sports fan or not.
