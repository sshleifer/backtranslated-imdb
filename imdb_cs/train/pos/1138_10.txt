When I was a child aged 8, I always watched films and television I did not have, and it was one of them. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorite movies all the time, and it must be the funniest movie I've ever seen in my life, acting is excellent, they do it nowadays no comedies (movies that are really funny and they make you laugh without resorting to excretions or some type of fluid-induced vomiting like in those slowed Judd Apatow films played by unsuccessful non-actors like Seth Rogen, barf). <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic with actors who can really act and deserve all the awards.
