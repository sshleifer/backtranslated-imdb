Late Dudley Moore had the most famous role of his too short career in 1981 ARTHUR, a frantic funny and alternating touching story that creates warm smiles, a big belly of laughter and occasional tears if you're in the right mood. Moore earned Oscar nomination for best actor for his performance as Arthur Bach, a drunk playboy who "races cars, plays tennis, loves women but has weekends and is his own boss." Arthur is determined to inherit $ 750 million when he takes a girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry), who is spoiled by the secret gangster's daughter. When Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli), a black queen actress who steals his father's birthday ties. Moore lights the screen in one of the funniest performances of the last 50 years. Late Sir John Gielgud won Best Actress Oscar for a flawless turn as Arthur's boyfriend and best friend, Hobson, whose show for Arthur's behavior relates to fatherly feelings. There are other funny contributions by Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's demented grandmother. The film was focused on comic life by Steve Gordon, director of the first film, who sadly died the following year. A few years later it was also a forgotten sequel, but the current classic can not be missed.
