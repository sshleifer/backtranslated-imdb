Director Raoul Walsh was like Michael's Bay from the 40's and years before. And I think it's positive because I'm certainly not an enemy interest. His films are just great entertainment, just like the films Raoul Walsh were in his days. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" is quality entertainment. In addition to the first-class director, he is also occupied with first-class cast, with chief executive Raoul Walsh in the main section of Errol Flynn. What surprised me how well the boxing matches were transferred to the screen. They made a very dynamic job with the camera, which also made boxing matches uplifting and exciting, with the final championship fight against John L. Sullivan as the pinnacle. The biopies of the 1960s and 1940s, of course, still differed from the biographies that are being done today. Modern biographies often celebrate their main subject and show their lives from birth to death and all, mostly emotional, aspects between them. The "old" biopsy was just the same as films that were not based on actual real life, which also means that movie makers often use a number of creative freedom with personality and personality events that occurred in his / her life. This film is not just a biography of boxing legend, it also creates a nice picture from the time when the illegal bare joints of fighting entered the modern era of boxing. Errol Flynn is doing a great job showing real-life boxer James J. Corbett aka Gentleman Jim. Not too many people know it, but Flynn has done really good actor work in the 1940s, of which this film is one. Physically it also looks in the upper form. It also looks completely different, without its trademark little mustache in this movie. The film also includes some subtle supporting actors and some fine acting throughout. <br /> <br /> A great and fun movie that still really keeps really good. <br /> <br /> 8/10
