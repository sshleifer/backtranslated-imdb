Bad scenario, bad direction, top performance, redesigned dialogue. What could you ask for? For the smile it's just not better than this. Zadora is overexcited in combination with the cliche scripts, which finds itself in the story of the merry parody of the "Hollywood" machine. Almost as funny as the "Spinal Tap," though it was clearly not intended as such. Do not miss Ray Liotty's debut film line "It looks like a penis."
