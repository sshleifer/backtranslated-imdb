this is the visual adaptation of the manga with very little conversation. what dialogue exists in verbal balloons like in manga. the conspiracy of this fact exists, but only ambiguously. there is a manga problem, which is based in English in a collection of explosive books, "comics underground japan", and has a real subtitled dialogue that explains the plot a little more than here. I recommend that you check the volume if you like it because it explains some "plot" of the movie, which is otherwise inexplicable. wise animation is quite decent, good non-intrusive use of computers, and images are largely implemented well. jumps into and out of episodes like characters, a cat and his brain-dead older sister cat wanders in and out of a series of strange pictures: a ship, a circus, a desert. only half an hour go through a series of semi-finished and set-ups, which leads me to the fact that the director picked a number of long manga questions to adapt randomly but was primarily selected visually. Knowing what's going on can increase somewhat appreciation. it reminds me mostly of the things that played on the mtv show, the cartoon of sushi, especially the short one, which contains a cat that is chasing after a man is chasing after a broken face. only in this case the cats recall the hello kitty more and their adventures are expanding to include death and reincarnation and a number of other topics [though not so easy to tell what is going on]. The DVD of this has director's comments and "making" features, but I cant comment on those because I get around them. I put it in 8/10, here's not a lot to compare it in the anime, and I hope it resembles it.
