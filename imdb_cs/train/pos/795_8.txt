It is a shame that a few notes before me do not know the facts of this case. It is based on real events, the big cases of disappearance and murder that take place in Wilmington, PA / Philadelphia from 1996 to 2000. I must admit that I am very skeptical about how Hollywood would dramatize real history and events was really amazed at how close he stayed to what was constantly reported on the local news and Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper coverage throughout the season. Of course, I immediately pointed out that the actress (who really loved me in the cold case) who played Fahey did not look the same as she (Anne Marie was really nicer). I have to admit, however, that Mark Harmon actually infected the type of personality that was revealed as Capano and the behavior Capano exhibited during this period. Case details were directly on ... no deviations from the dramatic effect ... even on the rug, the gun, the furniture and the cooler. In conclusion, I also wanted to add that I have met Thomas Carper many times in various positions (a good man though he was a politician) and I am so glad to have pulled the strings in the federal sphere needed to resolve this sinister crime. Guys like Capano are real and it was great to see him finally standing behind the bars.
