At a time when Hollywood is making money by showing our weakness, despair, crime, drugs and war, this film comes to remind us of the concept of "Incomprehensible Spirit." If you feel beaten, this movie will free your mind and lead you to climb. We all know how hard life can be, sometimes we have to remind ourselves that our endurance and courage will get us. That's what this movie did for me and I hope it will be for you.
