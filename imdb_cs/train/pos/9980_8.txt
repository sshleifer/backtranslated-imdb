Every film that shows that the federal PIG (People in Government) are the crazy threats that are in real life is a great recommendation to me. <br /> <br /> Alas, checking and editing scripts and even, sometimes, overhead is wrong, so there will be people who will disparage the whole movie and ignore good times. <br /> <br /> I saw the original way back when he was new and hated it, despising it. I thought it was a terrible and irrational piece of junk mail. But now I do not know why. I believe these two should not be compared or even interconnected. <br /> <br /> Consider them as two different movies. <br /> <br /> Rate it in two different movies. <br /> <br /> This "Vanishing Point" provides a place for gathering, a banner for people who want to support individualism who believe in human rights who recognize the threat of freedom, government can be and is, and especially the federal government . "The Voice" wears a cap that carries a state motto from New Hampshire: "Live Free or Die." Suddenly it would be the motto of most Americans. In spite of its obvious shortcomings, "Vanishing Point" is the movie to be fancied.
