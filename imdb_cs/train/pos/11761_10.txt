Kurt Russell is in his best job as a man living in the past of glory, Reno Hightower. Robin Williams is his polar counterpart in a rare low key performance such as Jack Dundee. Big Pass missed more than one. You will see some of the most sensitive scenes that have ever been shot in one movie, such as Jack Rat Cabinets, Reno Presents, and Caribbean Calling Off. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this classic that is not afraid to show soccer in the mud as it should play (note the NFL).
