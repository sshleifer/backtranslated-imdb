Do not connect to this curly crazy criticism, that's gem! Young wealthy Joan and her brother find themselves without money after their father dies - and now he has to work for a living! She, of course, will become a reporter and, of course, also a driver for the crowd! Because of the wildly common occurrence, their career is mainly met by gangster Clark Gablem. Meanwhile, there is a chance that the underwear for moonlight will swim for a lot of nice young things and Joan to make a couple of risky dance numbers (with all the mercy of the steam bucket). <br /> <br /> But none of this should be taken seriously - it's all good fun from those wonderful days when Hollywood was really naughty. Joan looks great and displays a big part of the emotional range that would give her a career so long (thank God she stopped dancing!). Gable is remarkable as a slimy gangster - he was not yet a star, so he did not have to be a hero. Great to see that he is playing something else. And William Bakewell is excellent as a poor confused brother. And there are some great montage and watching shots with the kind permission of director Harry Beaumont, who moves the piece with the bursting pace - and occasionally wink at the audience! Great fun!
