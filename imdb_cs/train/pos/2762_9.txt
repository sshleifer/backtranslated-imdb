This movie is close to my favorite celluloid piece. In fact, it's not much I want or wanted to say here. With the exception of "See this movie," and "Enjoy the great work of Daniel and Pascal," which will guide you through this neat, fun and heartbreaking story about "spending the eighth day" - your own day! <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie, I was seriously thinking about spending the eighth day = my life! It seems that some of us are losing precious time by doing the things we think we have to do. Whether it's a delightful career or just eating television shows and balls. What we tend to miss is the satisfaction of being something for another person - to change. About how time and space becomes spontaneous and you live - NOW! (eighth day) ... At least that's what I got since the "Eighth Day".
