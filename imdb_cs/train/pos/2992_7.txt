It seems that the director does not like this movie, but I think he's a bit cruel for him. <br /> <br /> Sure, it is not perfect, but there are some atmospheric shots and the story is good enough to be of interest to you all. <br /> <br /> It's shot in a pretty nice village that adds the atmosphere as well. <br /> <br /> If you like horror movies shot in England, it's gone. <br /> <br /> I just saw a trailer for this director, the last movie 'The Devil's Chair', which looks pretty amazing. <br /> <br /> There is not enough English horror movies for me, so everyone who comes together deserves our attention and this is not as bad as you think
