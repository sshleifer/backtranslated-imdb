I like this movie a lot. I rented that I was expecting something that was not so bad to spend the evening. It turned out to be a particularly satisfying experience. Some of the scenes were funny and they managed to be in a movie that is not just a stupid, scary comedy but with some sense and moral values. It manages on both computers. Leaders are all good, but especially the stars who also wrote and produced the film. I have never seen any of these actors before, but they were sympathetic and they made me care about what happens to them at the end who says a lot. The script is smart and engaging and has a refreshing feeling. I guess you will not be disappointed if you follow it.
