This film was directed by Victor Nunez, who also wrote a script (Ulee's Gold). Nice and simple writing that was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award and looked at Ruby's everyday life. What we see is a cut in the life of the young Ruby woman. Ashley Judd (Sisters) was awarded Independent Spirit Best Female Lead for this role. Ruby begins to live alone and establishes her own identity. Exploring jobs, friendships, friends, sex, typical young adult search. The film won the Grand Jury Award at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film enthusiast, I chose a movie about Sundance. I appreciate this type of film because it carries Hollywood baggage. Though the stories are completely different, it reminded me of Nobody's fool and looked at Paul Newman. The later film is part of everyday life of a common man. I like it. The story is very nice, and all we had to do was sit back and enjoy the story. The only thing I'm not sure of is the name. I'm sure there are not so many mistakes, and it's flying in paradise like in Florida. Because I'm allergic to mosquitoes, Florida is no paradise for me. I had a full red lime. I recommend this movie! Favorite scenes: Ruby and her girlfriend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean on Panama City Beach in Florida. The sand is really white. I was there. Favorite quotations: "Necessity has always been a good excuse." "The whole upset over finding a person now does not differ, who will be and when and why." <br /> <br />
