Good working time with the Quiroz brothers and the whole cast in this project as "Guy on the Bench". I was amazed how well they were able to capture all the identifiable features of the real horror movie "B". I hope that in the future we will have the opportunity to work with the Pumpkin Patch Pictures team. I moved to Detroit shortly after finishing and since then has been publicly acknowledged several times. One day he was in a video rental shop, and the girl lost her idea damn damn. It was quite funny and it was my first real autograph when I signed it. One day I asked the girls in Blockbuster if the film is often leased and confirmed by looking at it on the computer. At that time, it leased more than Ring2, which was also a new release at the time ... The title really captures the immediate interest in urban markets. She also noticed that the movie was not returned by the customer, which led me to believe that the movie is so good that people do not want to return ... Watch ZoMbIeS when they get in the hood, you!
