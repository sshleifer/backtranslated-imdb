Dental small pot, whose 65-minute length does not seem to be too short, My name is Julia Ross, who returns to the English tradition that things are not as it seems - Hitchcock's Lady Vanishes is one example. Unemployed Julia Ross (Nina Foch) finds a seminal job at a new employment agency in London, whose ominous representative seems very willing to find out whether she lives with relatives or a friend. After reporting for service, she woke up (as if she were being drugged) in a huge heap of similarity to Manderley on the Cornwall Coast, allegedly the wife of George Macred. His disgusting, capable mum is irresistible to Dame May Whitty (this time a disruptive efficacy model on the other side of Good Against Evil before occupying The Lady Vanishes). The night view of this story unfolds claustrophobic; we know what's going on, but it's helpless to say poor Julia. This film, curiously, is regularly regarded as an honor as one of the first (and very few British) film noirs. I think it is a closer Gothic tradition of an old dark house than an American one from wet paving stones and urban corruption; however, modern, psychoanalytic casting of the mind appears. Whatever you say, it will remain a shrewly satisfying thriller.
