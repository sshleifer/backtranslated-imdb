This movie is amazing. It was always there. I think it's really better than falling in love with the house. Walt really did it himself. And music! Dream is the wish your heart is beautiful! What else can you do besides incredible? I can not wait to get a special release, it will be so great! I can not wait to hear all the deleted songs! This movie is so beautiful and smart! It is beautiful. And what cute mice! I know I say the same thing over and over and over again, but hey, that's a great movie! Woods was amazing in this beautiful beautiful BEAUTIFUL movie
