Another great foreign film that plays deeply with an endless Hollywood breed! This is a story about life and life. No, certainly not the perfect little life so often portrayed in Hollywood's entirely artificial films, but rather real life supplemented by real characters, each with strengths and weaknesses as well as real people in our lives and ourselves. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of all these lives, interwoven inside the walls of this spa and especially its aging owner, is magnificent, the heart touches and highly thought provocative. Sit down, relax and put into a simple and beautiful life. There is a real wisdom you can learn in this movie if you only open it. <br /> <br /> You will not be disappointed.
