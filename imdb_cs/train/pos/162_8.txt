For movies without budget, this thing is rock. I do not know if America will like it, but we laughed all the way. Some Funny Funny Things. Really non-Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Actors and music nodded. Cars and gags, and even less in our face, we shattered. Whooo Whooo! Some of the actors I've seen before, but never in one or two of them I thought I saw in commercials or something else. Basically it's agile! Luckily, I saw a copy from a friend of one of the actors.
