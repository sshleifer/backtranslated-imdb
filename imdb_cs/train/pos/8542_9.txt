_Waterdance_ explores a wide range of aspects of the life of artificially wounded artists. Small experience of malignant fluorescence lights blinking overhead for sexuality, masculinity, and depression is developing a disability experience. The variety of central characters themselves underlines the complexity of the material under study - Joel, writer Raymond, a black man with a dark past, and Bloss, a racist biker. At first, these men are associated only with the nature of their injuries, but they maintain their competitive spirit. Over time, shared experience, both good and bad, brings them as friends to support each other. The most obvious is the transformation experienced by Joel, who initially gives up his sunglasses, earphones and curtains to his colleagues. If he accepts the changes that have caused his disability, Joel discards these props and begins to engage in the fighting of the men with whom the department shares. The dance given in the title is a reference to this daily struggle to keep the head above the water; giving up dance is to reject life. _Waterdance_ is a moving and powerful movie on many levels and do not hesitate to recommend it.
