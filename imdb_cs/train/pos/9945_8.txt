Oh, okay! It's not an action movie, even though it's a lot of action! I think you can compare it with American sports movies! Where a team of very bad players manage to solve unthinkable, win the game or tournament over expectations! In this case it is not football or baseball, but Taekwondo! In the beginning, it seems that these street robbers are nothing good! But soon we find out that they do not want to be fools and really achieve something in life! It's nice to see fighting and training! I was surprised how fun this movie was! From the beginning to the end you will laugh your pants off! Young Korean actors are very convincing! Go look at this wonderful good movie!
