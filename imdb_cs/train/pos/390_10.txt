The first thing I realized when I saw these movies was: It's not really a movie, at least it's not what we imagine spontaneously when we hear the word "film." it is completely symbolic, everything in it has a pictorial meaning. So if you are not used to expressing a thing in a symbolic way, you will find it strange if you are not familiar with philosophy, religion, spiritual life, you will think it's just a fairy tale ... and even weird, chaotic. For me, the "Legend of the Zion" is perfectly transparent. And I like it. The screen tells us the story of a struggle between light and darkness, a struggle that is as old as humanity, and anyone who seeks meaning in this life is confronted with it. The film is probably created by a Buddhist. I'm not a Buddhist. My religion and the visions of the world and man are different. But if we are all human and have the same human nature, we must have common experience and understand each other. It's a really beautiful movie! And I, in which we had more films like these - movies that make sense. There are too many empty stories that are good just to make time pass.
