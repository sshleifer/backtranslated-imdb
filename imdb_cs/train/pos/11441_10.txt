As a person who was looking for existence as a "professional" income person supported by BS in chemistry and MS in business management, my common sense has always been spasmodically maintained in external indulgences in matters of more artistic. My postgraduate courses have always been emotionally and spiritually supported by interest in photography, stained glass, ceramics, metal fitting / welding and artistic drawing, which also included silk scanning. <br /> <br /> I am also healthy with jogging, walking and recently walking to distant destinations in California and nearby states such as Utah, Arizona and Nevada. Jogging, walking and hiking are approaching the ground with time to stop and watch and listen and also take pictures or record sounds. Against this background, I was obsessed with the river and Tides. I was equally impressed by the documentary content of Andy Goldsworthy, as well as the skills and fluency of the director / cameraman Thomas Riedelsheimer. Actually, I could not separate the art of Goldsworth from the Riedelsheimer. <br /> <br /> Amazing. Great. Great.
