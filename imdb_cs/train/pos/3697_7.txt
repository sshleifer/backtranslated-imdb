I recorded a Sundance Channel movie on a cable late in the afternoon. Maybe you say, "Who loves the sun" is the perfect entertainment fun story, why not at all. You get a trio: Lukas Haas is Will, Molly Parker is Maggie, and Adam Scott is Daniel (a friend or enemy or fiance) Lake Falcon, Manitoba in Canada, captured in graphic compositions, which lie alongside the vivid summer colors against the sun and shadows. And the trio's support is another two family members in the mix revealing: Wendy Crewson's mom Mary Bloom and R. Thomson's daddy Arthur Bloom. Writer-director Matt Bissonnette delivered the sophisticated story development and his various tentacles - do not worry, Haas can have a "painless" face, but humor comes when Parker and Scott enter a circle of friends, breaks and cognition of pleasure. Dialogues may be positive or even zero, yet we would like to taste what is cooked, stunned, or thoughtful. Yes, "Who loves the sun" can be very well categorized as a sleeping jewel. Chemistry between all five principles ensures that gels and "flue gases" provide a powerful set. After all, it's all in the family and the movie certainly does not take too seriously. <br /> <br /> It looks like the official site is still available on the 'wholovesthesun.com' site and there's information on Mac MacCaughan's soundtrack (Portastatic with guitar melodies and strings) where scenario excerpts are played, and backstage production notes, interview with writer and director Bissonnette on how the film and the concept appeared, casting and more. Always appreciated Molly Parker from her free but appealing performance in 1996 by Lynne Stopkewich's "Kissed," and she married Bissonnette, who "wrote Maggie's part for Molly."
