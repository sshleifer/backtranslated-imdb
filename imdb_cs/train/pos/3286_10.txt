Simply put, this movie is scary. It starts with it simply, it looks like a study of a rebellious young girl and it always becomes a beautifully created horror film. <br /> <br /> Do not expect gore or zombies. That's psychological and, just like he would have done in Candyman, Bernard Rose can surrender the horror that is not believed. Every time you look at this movie, you will find out more about what's going on and how the two worlds interact in this movie. Drawings have never been more frightening.
