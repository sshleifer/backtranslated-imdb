I've seen this movie literally more than 100 times ... it's absolutely a jam full of fun !!! Powers Boothe gives stellar performance. As a fan of actors such as William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981), I never thought an actor could capture "intensity" like Shatner and Liebmann in these roles until I saw Boothea Jim Jones! As for me, Powers Boothe is Jim Jones ... this film captures his best performance !!!
