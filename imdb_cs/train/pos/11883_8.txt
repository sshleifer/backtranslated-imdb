I saw this movie about a week ago and I still think about it. I was very fond of this film. I found those characters very believable and sympathetic with almost error. Just as in real life, though some people disappointed, as in the case of Leo, who, although I liked his character, could not be more disappointed when he was willing to have unprotected sex even though he was fully aware of his HIV status. I was also disappointed that Leo had refused the remedy he had at his disposal and, in a terrible way, dealing with Marc when he decided to return him home on the train. I think this film has shown a very realistic way of identifying HIV numbers among young gay men. This is by no means intended to overwhelm homosexuals (I am gay) and could very well record a film about a young, straightforward person who makes a bad decision and does not seem to have consequences for himself or for others. The only part of the film I did not understand was why the family (homosexual) was not willing to include Marcel in Leo's disease so he would not let him go to the funeral. the biggest news from this movie is that if she is gay or straight I DO NOT SEX SEX!
