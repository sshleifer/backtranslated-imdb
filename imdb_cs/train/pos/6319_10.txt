With the opportunity to watch some shooting in a Slavonic village on Broadway, I could not wait to see that it was a final copy. The film at the Cleveland premiere last Friday did not mean loud to the comedy for a long time! It's great ghosts. Russian brothers did a great job. The entire cast performs his best comedy acting ... No slow or dry segments ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and is great as a crippled security pirate in this movie. I was the most addicted to William Macy as a cheater of "Riley" and Michael Jeter as "This" who held you in a "stitch". I believe they have the most entertaining roles in this year's film.
