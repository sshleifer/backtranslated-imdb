Document without losing words ... at all ... <br /> <br /> Suppose the narrative is more than a spoof, we assume it is a comment about Japanese society. And because this movie is as fast as an absurd documentary, a constant word game comes as fast as it may be and as badly translated as it is - in its current version of the screener festival, as seen today in Copenhagen Cinematek - It's Still quite pleasant. <br /> <br /> But for the patient and only really patient and open, I talk to you fans Jim Jarmusch with ADD relapses, I believe it's a movie for you. It's an intelligent movie if you let it win you. Pretty pretty and quite kitsch and pretty Japanese subculture. And quite experimental. Static 2D in the 3D world. All in all, fun for those who want to see a Japanese film that spoils the Japanese food culture. Push up if you're in the mood for something completely different.
