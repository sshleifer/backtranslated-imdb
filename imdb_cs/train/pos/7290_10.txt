After some extremely good reviews at SUPERB, I was very satisfied with the film. The film was dark, moving, anger, pain, guilt, and a very, extremely persuasive demon. Originally, I expected to see lots of special effects, and as a mistress, caressing me blew me away with gentleness and accuracy. Brian, I kicked back with your art again by telling the story and the care of special effects. You'll get a long way, buddy. I will definitely be the president of your fan club. Eric Etebari, Best Actress, was the number one choice. You have earned Jr Lopez as a child compared to Kasadya. :) <br /> <br /> Overall, the actress, story line, high quality filming and amazing effects, it was fantastic. I just wish it was longer. I look forward to The Dreamless with extremely high expectations.
