It's a great movie, I just played. It was a strange zing ... on it. I loved Vanessa Williams as Rose and Jason Alexander had a good voice. It was great. The setting was also very good. Besides being 2 hours and 50 minutes, it is quite long. Overall, I give 8.5 stars. They also added several parts, but it was still cool.
