I agree with another user and I must say that this is one of the best Kung Fu films ever! I watched it as a child and absolutely loved it! The scaffolding scenes are great and you can really empathize with this guy because it is considered to be excluded. Nice humor and fantastic kung fu this movie! If you like Kung Fu, you'd love it!
