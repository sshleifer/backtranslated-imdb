There are very few movies that are as fun as this movie. I was lucky to have watched this film in a "reserved" movie for movie lovers like me, so it was not so embarrassing to sit there when I laughed while my jaw was totally painful and shirt sleeves were all wet before dry the eyes ... </ p> <p> <br /> Sometimes the story was a little 'slow', but that's probably the best - a little rest between the streets between the streets (I almost got out of the seat ...) was very welcome.
