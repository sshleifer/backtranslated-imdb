Indian summer! It was very nostalgic for me. I found it funny, hearty and absolutely loved it! Anyone who went to camp as a child and wishes to return to "good Ole Days" for a short period of time, really needs to see this! It begins 20 years later, a group of old campsites return to a "meeting". I will not comment on the plot because you have to see it for yourself. The actors were great and feature star cast. They all played a great role in it. Actually, you felt like you were watching the movie. Alan Arkin was especially good at acting as Uncle Lou. He plays such a man everyone wants in his life. This is also a good family film for the most part. I would suggest it to everyone in my heart! Highly recommended!
