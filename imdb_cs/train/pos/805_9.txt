The "Return of the Jedi" is often remembered for what happened badly rather than for what it did right, and that's a shame because the last chronological installment of the Star Wars saga is a glowing example of epic narration. He manages to wrap all the stories from the previous films into one big final and make it very convincing. Yes, there are Ewokes - cute and plush bears that probably served to widen the demographic star wars - and in the middle the film tends to slow a bit. But the last hour is probably the best part of the whole saga where Luke finally meets face to face with Darth Vader, the best-known villain in the movie. <br /> <br /> The Return of the Jedi has made so many things right that people tend to overlook: he introduced the unbelievable conclusion of Darth Vader's story (he was very persuaded by the impetuous "Empire Strikes Back"), an exciting opening in the Jabby Palace, a masterful performance Iana McDiarmida as Emperor, Luke finally arrives at his own, distinctive Solo and Leia romance and extremely strong end moments on the Endor moon. Yes, there are some inconveniences. But it is the disorder of the generation of film audiences who had time to devise each scene. It is still a magical and moving cinematographic film that also serves as a great closing chapter. It's not a good movie - it's fantastic!
