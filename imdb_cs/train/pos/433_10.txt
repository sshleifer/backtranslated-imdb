It's one of those rare movies, it's beautiful and convincing, dignified and strange, a real gift. I think it's a prerequisite for any trip to Italy, or a holiday at all, because it reminds you to open up to a wider experience (yeah, find a spell). Especially I loved Josie Lawrence, like Lottie Wilkins, but every acting and acting is impeccable in this movie. Furthermore, costumes, if you are attracted to fashion and costumes, are extremely well done. I just wish they went to DVD because I was playing on my tape! <br /> <br /> Absolutely well worth it, just make sure you sit down to look at it without interruption.
