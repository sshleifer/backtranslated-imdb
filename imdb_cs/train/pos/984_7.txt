One night I went over the Bait cable as soon as it started, and thought, "Eh, why not?" I'm glad I gave him a chance. <br /> <br /> "It's not perfect." It suffers in an unnecessarily dazzling direction and occasional stupidity. Overall, however, this movie worked. All the elements were right and they removed what might otherwise be a pretty nasty movie. <br /> <br /> Most of this, I think, is due to Jamie Foxx. I do not know who identified Foxx as a conductor, but whoever was this film was a great favor. It seems that Foxx slides through the film and is incredibly glad to be smooth as butter and more fun than hell. You can say he's working on instinct and the instinct will not disappoint him. The conspiracy, though insignificant, actually merges quite well and there is even the character of the arc through which Foxx's character grows as a person. Again, they could do without any of this, but it is much better. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised by the low rating. Maybe I just caught this step in the right night or vice versa, but I would give him 7/10. Bravo, Msr. Foxx.
