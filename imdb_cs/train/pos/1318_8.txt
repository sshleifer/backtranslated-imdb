I felt compelled to write a review for Space Cobra because it had a good score of 7.3 stars but only a few reviews at the time I wrote it was especially positive. A special situation and I hope my positive reviews will show people on this old and mostly forgotten movie Anime. Space Cobra is a funny story of a smuggler and a cheater who joins three nurses of old and dead planets and evil forces who want to use the power of planets. This is an old film and animation shows, but what he lacks in modern sophistication, forms with a lot of spell. The Cobra universe is very focused on the western audience and is very easy to watch. There is little if any references to specific Japanese cultures and great for anime novices to watch and enjoy. The universe of Cobra is funny and sympathetic. I can not say how much of it is due to the English oak or the designer's intention, but it's one of the few Japanese comic characters I find really fun. The style is a 60s Barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack from Yello. The style is colorful and imaginative and there is a constant move to move the story. The strangest aspect of this film is how it begins as a comedy and ends with a very dramatic remark. I can not think of another anime or a general movie that did it without difficulty and convincing. You barely realize it's happening, but it's so delicate and looks absolutely natural. You also really think the characters have gone on their way and life has been changed by this experience. See if you can.
