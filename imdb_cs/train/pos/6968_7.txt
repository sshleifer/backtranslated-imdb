Just as the new BSG was not what the fans of the original series expected, Caprica may not deliver what the fans of the new BSG (for the most part) expected. It's a very interesting, if not somewhat sexy show, or at least a pilot. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for great CGI excitement from the (new) BSG, you will be very disappointed. If you like drama, you'll probably find something you like and you might even like. Give a look at how the Cylons were developed, why Adam hates them and the origin of the monotheistic society. Writers can also deal with people who play God (a) and create or re-create a "human" life. It will be interesting to see how he plays it. <br /> <br /> I found it was born in some parts and preached in others, but it was promising. A small part of me wished (or hoped) that there might be some minor inclusion of BSG out there (except the back story I mentioned), but that would probably convolutive action too much. Like BSG, I'll have to wait and see if Caprica appears to me, but it's too soon to say so. It would be really easy to dismiss it as a failure if you compare it to the previous series, but I am willing to give a chance. Overall, I thought it was so interesting to see how the real series was before "tossing (a proverbial towel)".
