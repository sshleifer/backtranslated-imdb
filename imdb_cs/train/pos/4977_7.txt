So many educational films are nothing more than I mean an exhausting thug, rescued only by mocking them "MST3K" ("Why study industrial arts?"). "Hemo the Magnificent" is actually quite well done. It's all about blood, heart and circulatory system. I admit that I do not remember everything from him but he does a good job that explains everything, it's serious but fun. I think you can always count on June Foray (Rocky's squirrel's great voice, here playing deer). Because "Hemo Magnificent" can be hard to find, probably the best place to see is in "Gremlins": the class looks at it while creating a gourmet.
