I was in the movie too, but I do not know if they actually put this scene on. On our way back from the school trip (in 2005), we stopped at the petrol station at the same time as the movies, and we were (all of us) asked to slip and scream Go! Freebird! We were all around 10 years old, someone who saw the movie could tell me if this part is actually in the movie, it would be great to know! I remember thinking that the movie never worked out because it was two and a half years before she was released. All your comments seem good, so I think it was a pretty successful movie, I could buy it, but first I'd like to know if I'm in it! : D Thank you
