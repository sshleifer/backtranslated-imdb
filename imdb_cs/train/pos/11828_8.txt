"Dick Tracy" is one of our favorite families - the actors are great - artistic trends are exceptional - the music is magical. It's not "Kill Mockingbird" - it's a fun experience. <br /> <br /> Stephen Sondhem's tracks are stellar: "Back in Business" is energetic, "Sooner or Later" is right, "What You Can Lose" is scary - even melodies like "Live and Like" <br /> <br /> I must love the passionate supernatural performances of Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Charlie Korsmo, Mandy Patinkin, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, who support villains ... The list is too long. And yes - even Madonna and Warren Beatty are amazing. He wrote with a smile a minute (how many times we looked at each other and said, "Wait a minute - I think he's gone!").) However, one of the most famous things in this film is that all participants they have a good time - and that contributes to entertainment for the spectator. So, if you have not done it yet, leave "Dick Tracy" a chance - accept it for what it is - Sunday's comic book brought to life - and a wonderful way!
