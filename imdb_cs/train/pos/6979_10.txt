This is a real character and story-driven drama on a level that matches most of what we see on TV on the mo. <br /> <br /> I was amazed right from the start. Do not be put off if it's not science fiction (like me ...) It can be done on Earth, the fact that in another galaxy it makes the show more interesting. there are no spacecraft or laser weapons (no one exists yet) I have seen up to s01 e04 and I'm gripped and wondering what's going on since there are so many options. <br /> <br /> The cast game is born passion. Eric stoltz is especially strong. <br /> <br /> This show really stands by itself, it does not matter whether you watched BSG or not, in fact they are completely different. I've read some negative reviews from scientists who expected less drama and more aliens and rays, but I think I ignore them. This is a really positive start to the show. Make sure they do not do it after 1 or 2 seasons, as it is today with good shows.
