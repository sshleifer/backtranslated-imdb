Do not make a mistake, Maureen O'Sullivan is perhaps the most beautiful Jane ever and never be gorgeous. It is visually stunning. It is better than a beautiful woman to make a good movie. It's a great movie. Not only does he have the classic araz of Tarzan, but also the feeling of a continuing saga. We engaged two white hunters looking for an ivory, one of them in love with Jane, the other is a stupid catalyst whose character may be one of the best-defined and best-researched in the history of the film. And this characterization is by the great action moves as a classic. There is an inconvenient racism that is displayed. Africans are plotted as individuals, and eventually the two become more heroic than white hunters and act as such. In fact, the one who is not nominated is likely to give more sympathy to the audience than other characters. The final is also one of the reasons why you enjoy this movie. The big lion attack has never been duplicated, and horror is well indicated by nature reactions more than the modern gore film should do with the graphic display. If I left something, it's because I do not want to leave a picture for those who did not see it. But it's all you could want in the movie.
