In all the comments that praised Dalton's performances or I hurt him, I thought he was excellent. He does not play Rochester as a spoiled pretty boy, but as a strong man. This version I liked, though the shot of the video aspect was sometimes disturbing and the scenes with Jane and St. John never completely gelled. I give it 8.
