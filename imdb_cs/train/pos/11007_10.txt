The characterization of Jeremy Northam's stuttering, gentle manners of Morgan Sullivan's book, and observation left him free pieces of his true identity under the influence of the only malt stains and Lucy Lia's spell was greatly created and joyful. His cigarette offering at the bar is an old habit, made without thinking or even asking and losing in his face, neck and lips. Regardless of brainwashing, love is a way of endurance. Love can also not be "brainwashed" with one of his two fake women. In stages, he begins to watch his glasses, walk and speak differently, and even his face looks different as the film progresses. Music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy, and appropriate riding occasionally. Extensive use of black and white and gray tones makes this almost science fiction movie noir in the tradition of many classic thrillers. I would love to see more vulnerability in portraying Lucy Lia whenever he sees him in his ragged states, a man he loves, and for whom he performs a mission based on blind faith, any exhausted vulnerabilities and glimpses of true sympathy, and worry would make him less dimensional performance. There is no connection at all for Northam's talents, but overall I enjoyed this film and I'm excited to know about other scenarios written by the same author.
