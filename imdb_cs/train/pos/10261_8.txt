First of all, it was not a brilliant and thought-provoking film, as if many other reviewers seemed to think it. the first review says something similar to someone who likes to know nothing about a horror movie, apparently in the opposite direction. If someone had to go back to the movie, it was not supposed to be convincing, it was a low ipecac budget. But it really was all about it, it was supposed to drive the audience away with total shock value (and all the errors that its visuals were much less apparent in the original VHS versions). <br /> <br /> I give this high score because it has reached its goal and although it was not really horrible (in a senseless sense), it made me a little sick and thoroughly paranoid / pessimistic (I did not do that, not trusting anyone for about a week, because I did not want to wake up and tortured)
