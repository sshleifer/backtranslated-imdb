I've never heard of this movie until I've logged on IMDB. I saw that there were many terrible reviews that contained very varied excuses about how much that had happened. Of course it meant I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised because Whipped is actually a good movie. I watched it with a group of friends and we laughed more than we had with many recently acclaimed Hollywood gloomy comedies. It is an independent film and as such it shows its subject (sex and dating) without the usual Hollywood fake. I clearly doubt that people's views on this film will greatly depend on their life experiences. If you have never been too involved or not, you will not have this movie because you will not meet people like these characters. If you do, you will know many of the situations that come out comically here. The end was also good because he did not portray women as unreal, helpless, virginal romance, unlike many Hollywood movies.
