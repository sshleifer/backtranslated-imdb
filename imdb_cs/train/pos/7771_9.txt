The absolute sum of the work of this hilarious Dan Douglas Sirk (born Detlef Sierck), written on the wind, attracts our prudent attention in every cheerful frame. From the fairly glorious initial sequence, with the leaves blowing into the baronic foyer of Texas Castle and the wind that moistens the pages of the calendar into memories, the film compresses in its 99 minutes all the family intrigues that were to be fired as late as Dallas, Dynasty and Falcon Crest, throughout their long runs. The combination of wealth and dysfunction is the Americas topic in our society based on the dollar, which is irresistible. Brother and sister Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are spoiled, troubled by the heirs of the County of Hadley; baby boy Rock Hudson and new bride Lauren Bacall are normal outsiders who try to keep the lid on the roller boiler. (It is said that the story was based on Libby Holman's marriage to Reynolds' tobacco money.) As always, disordered to get all scenery chew - and the best lines to spit out (Malone, in her Oscar-nabbing performance as a guy nymphomaniac with jones for Hudson, gets detonated all the fireworks). Hudson, though well, can not compete with all these enthusiastic emotions; Bacall starts strong, but grows recessive, with just comfort. It does not matter; with a number of clippings shot in extravagant shades, Sirk gives the subject a lesson to prove to be the predominant melodrama in the lush consumer paradise of the late fifties of America. Nobody did it better.
