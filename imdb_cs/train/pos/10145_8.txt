This is really an old fashion charming movie. The location is great and the situation is one of those old Preston films. Fi you want to watch a movie that does not require anything other than to sit back and relax, then that's it. Acting is good, and I really liked Michael Rispoli. He was also in Rounders. And while you were asleep. The rest of the cast is fun. It's exactly what happens when the two people who get married meet the one who really loves the weekend that they plan their own weddings. I know ... It sounds like a tie ... but it is. And that's what's fun to watch. It will be your girlfriend either to hug you or leave you, but at least you will know.
