North Africa in the 1930s. A beautiful Arab woman on the outskirts of the Sahara comes from a beautiful woman looking for a sense of her life and a handsome Trappist monk who escapes the crisis of faith. They will meet and passions will be disturbed, but even the divine spectator does not know if they will find happiness or sadness, here in the ALLAH GARDEN. The story is pure hokum, but the movie is still great fun and beautiful looks. Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer are an excellent pair of screens. She is, simply, gorgeous, and Boyer gives the most effective, fanciful performances and leaves his sensitive face a lot of being acting for him. <br /> <br /> Support for the cast is excellent: Basil Rathbone, in the affectionate role of the Earl who loves the desert; Joseph Schildkraut as a friendly guide (all "Arabic" he and others are talking about in the movie is purely crazy); Lucile Watson as a fine mother introduced; Alan Marshal as an honorable young French officer; Tilly Losch as a dangerous dancer; Henry Brandon as a comic; John Carradine as the mysterious song Diviner; and the magnificent Sir C. Aubrey Smith as a wise old priest. <br /> <br /> The movie recognizes Helen Jerome Eddy as a nun; Marcia Mae Jones and Bonita Granville (looking at the shoulders of the nun) as monastic girls; native Nigel De Brulier as a monastery lecturer; and Ferdinand Gottschalk as a hotel clerk, all unbelievers. <br /> <br /> Colorful films of the thirties are rare and beautiful to look at, and this film is no exception - cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself. ALLAH GARDEN was the first Technicolor film to be shot on the spot. Yuma, Arizona gave filmmakers all the sand dunes they could wish, but contaminated drinking water and 135 degrees of heat soon had the company in rebellion. When the daily exhaustion showed Boyer's face burned bright tomato red, producer David O. Selznick finally set out. The rest of the film was shot on the Hollywood sound scene.
