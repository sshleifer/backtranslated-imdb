I did not expect a strong movie experience "Girlfight". It's indie; low budget, no actors with a big name, director for newcomers. I hear it's good, but not so good. Built in modern, ethnic, working class Brooklyn, Karyn Kusama has done extraordinary work to capture the daily struggles of Latinos. Protagonist Diana is angry and angry at her college, has problems with her school and her friends. She is brought up by her father, who seems to love both her and her brother, but she applies a strict, sex-based double standard to her children. The Otter Double Standard is documented by the fact that Tiny, Brother, takes the boxing hours at the local gym, but Diana is denied similar persecution. On the way to the gym to meet Tiny, Diana is taken with a box. Tiny does not like boxing, so he and Diana trade; he gets the money from dad then he gives Diana to get lessons in his place. This is actually a good movie, as Diana grows and learns about boxing, meets a guy, and solves some very serious problems. There is no laughter, "everything that can go right, goes right" and la "Bend Like Like Beckham". Reality and accompanying personal problems are too big to decide, but in my opinion "Girlfight" is a better and satisfying film for them.
