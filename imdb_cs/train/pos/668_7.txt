I just watched "Last wave" in my school's art library. It's interesting, just like all the things Mr. Peter Weir does, but it's not always as attentive as I'd like. I have found that I am fascinated by the idea that throws me (because the film director Weir is very well), but at the same time it was not enough stimulated. AKA I was a bit bored in the places. The plot surrounds Aussie's lawyer, who becomes obsessed with certain dreams he has that associate him with the Aborigone group he advocates. <br /> <br /> It starts with intense weather and has very amazing mood effects all over (the most notably bizarre, "belching" sound design) and the strong direction; but I just did not like the later films of Weir. Maybe I would have to watch it again. <br /> <br /> A good movie about obsession and secrets. Because ultimately, the mystery that exists between the white and the native has very serious consequences. God bless Peter Weir. For him, this film is worth watching ... a very organic director. As the Aussie answer Malick! I would give him seven because he has a lot of great ideas to overcome boring moments.
