no, it's not supposed to be a high budget, but it's brilliant. you have to look at what it is, a small budget masterpiece that includes a zombie rapist who controls a 12 inch love rod that keeps you calm. those who have come to see this movie have a low review are probably looking for another classic or hidden "gem" as they say, and they simply did not get there. I love everyone pointing to obvious observations like "baby 5 cents attached to the fish pole" hahaha, yes, yes. I do not think a movie with such a budget could afford "good" actors or effects, so they worked with what they had. entrails and guts were truly convincing. the movie was a bit torn from sequence to sequence, but overall it's one of the better movies I've seen recently that does not follow any trend or predictability. very good for laughter.
