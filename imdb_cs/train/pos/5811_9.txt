Only 9/10 from me would be the perfect tent if the film was rather conspicuous, yet Moonwalker still remains an entertaining festival of music, dance and entertainment. He begins with mounting videos of Jackson's long career, reminding the viewer why he is often considered to be the "king of pop". From his hit "I Want You Back" to "We Are a World", which has won many awards for a charity record in favor of Africa. After this short film, though in an unsettled Oscars scenario, it provides the audience with a fantastic and fun drama. Ending with the Perfect (Sexy!) Come Together. Some family members can watch and enjoy themselves.
