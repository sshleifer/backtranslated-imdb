This is the last Dutch film that Paul Verhoeven shot before making traditional Hollywood films "Basic Instinct", "Robocop" and "Total Recall". Sets the podium by opening this story with a black widow spider who caught the prey on his site before meeting Gerard Reve, an annoying self-centered writer with a morbid imagination. Gerard was invited to become a guest speaker at a literary club meeting in the sea town about an hour or an hour from Amsterdam. Verhoeven allows us to inspect Gerard's imagination as a reality. I asked if the writers are a bit close to madness when they admit when they read the newspaper "and says" boom. "I read" doom "when he says" flood "I read" blood "when he says" dead. "" When he tells the story enough time, he begins to believe it; "I'm right." He accepts an offer to be a nightclub guest overnight, a beautiful owner of a rich salon. Once he knows her and finds out that her husband has died, she begins to imagine she is a "black widow". Is it his more of his reality twist or is it murderous? This is a psychological drama, and when I recognize which of these old films has stuck to me, I realize it's my favorite sex. If we look at his work, he seems to be Paul Verhoeven, and he is the master who challenges us to understand reality. It's a nice change from the usual Hollywood fare. I saw it in 1983 and it's a movie that "stuck".
