Yes, I did that when I sat here with a red face, and I remembered feeling almost guilty when I watched it for a couple of weeks back while my wife decided to watch something as unimportant (compared) as "Mommie the most expensive ". <br /> <br /> As you explain the appeal of "Batman and Robin" - I think the only ones that really count Adam West and Burt Ward. It was a terrible show, with terrible screams and terrible gambling - and, yes, it was terribly funny! And the same goes for this movie "Reunion" and "Flashback". Adam and Burt are invited to an auction where the old Batmobile will be sold for charity. But it's stolen, and our buddies (like them) jump into the characters of their old characters (if not their costumes) and walk away to find out what's happened. On the way, they recall the series and see how it all happened in retrospectives when Jack Brewer and Jason Marsden played young Adam and Burt from the show. It was really interesting for some behind the scenes to look at the old series, and Adam and Burt just entered the character perfectly (although they were not really characteristic - you should watch to see what I mean.) It was also great to see Julie Newmar and Frank Gorshin. <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of the old series, you will hate it. If - forbid heaven - you think Michael Keaton and George Clooney are acceptable "batman", then you hate it even more. But if you've grown up with Adam and Burt and you're still willing to admit you've never missed an episode-well, that's for you. Yes, it's true - 9/10
