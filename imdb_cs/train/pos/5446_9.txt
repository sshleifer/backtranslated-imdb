National Lampoon's Class Reunion is a classic comedy film from the early 1980s that combines unique characters, lots of laughter and great music from Chuck Berry. When Walter Bailor is absolutely humiliated by his classmates at high school graduation, he uses the opportunity to avenge his class meeting. One by one they track their classmates, including an innocent blind girl, a horny fat boy, the beauty of a college, the king of all prejudices, and even an ugly old lunch that served all high school children. This movie has some creepy element and has several short scenes of sexuality, so I would not recommend it to little kids, but it's a great movie for teens. If you are looking for a movie with a beautiful score, complicated characters, or murderous special effects, you may not love class meetings. If you want to sit after 90 minutes and have some great laughter and a lot of fun (and who does not), then this movie should be on your movies to see the list. ++
