In addition to "Star Wars" and "The Wizard of Oz," it remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. It's a real shame that it's not as well known as ex-movies (maybe because it's based on a story based on legends rather than on contemporary or sci-fi environments and that it is the British, which means a smaller film market) you know it deserves a reputation. Like all big family movies, a child, adult or even teenager can enjoy this movie (I am currently 18), but one has to appreciate classic movies first. I absolutely admire this movie. He has an extraordinary musical score of Miklós Rózsa (perhaps my favorite classic movie scene) that rivals any John Wilsam "Star Wars" score, with fast but uninteresting pace, beautiful sets, dialogue and color use (both sets and cinematography won the Oscars); state-of-the-art special effects that have won the Oscar (in time and some are still stunning). And of course, June Duprez's sensual look looks like a princess competing with Catherine Zeta-Jones (even looks like Jones too!). In conclusion, it's one of my all- ("Robin Hood Adventures") and really deserves more attention. It's a real adventure of enchantment around the world, and together with "Robin Hood" it's my film desert island that I could watch over and over again without upsetting me. <br /> <br /> Stars: **** (outstanding)
