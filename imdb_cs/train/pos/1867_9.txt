it is a film about life, triumph over the inconvenience and miracles of the human spirit. It does not matter that no one jumps to the end of the movie. It's more than just a tear market, its impressive, thought-provoking drama with excellent performances from all cast, but especially Luke and Denzel Washington. After 7 years, I'm amazed that Luke is still virtually unknown and Washington just directed one more movie. However, in addition to the slow boom, the story of these childhood trials and tribulations, and how he keeps touching him in adulthood, is the type of movie that stays with you long after you've seen it. Like many fox luminaries, it was more sleeping and did not get the massive critical appreciation they deserve. The scene where Antwone finally meets his mother summed up the film behind me, there were so many ways to do it and it could be all schmaltzes, or it could have been unrealistic, but Washington hit exactly the right tone, his mother never she did not say a word, and could only tear a tear, while Antowne simply asked why. Her stunning guilt prevented her from saying anything she could say to defend herself? One of the most exciting movie scenes I've ever seen.
