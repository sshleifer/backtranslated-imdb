I know you have already entered the film festivals (or at least I think you have it, I can do it only), but I think it should have the "best animated short film" in each. Bravo. I can not wait for the whole movie. I realize that you may not hear it often because of the bizarre nature of your animations, but now you hear it and accept it as the truth. Kudos, my friend. Okay, now I'm trying to get ten lines of text ... Even though I still think so. And there comes another - SHOE! - and I can not stop yet. This is extremely unpleasant and I have nothing better. Actually, I'm probably going to watch all my movies in another spasmodic Jason Steele Marathon. I've got a lot. <br /> <br />
