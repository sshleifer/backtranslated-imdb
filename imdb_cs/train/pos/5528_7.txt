This is a very beautiful and almost meditative film - there is no dialogue at all in this conversation, except debates; and scenery and music make each other more complicated. First of all, I did not run the red hair of girls and foxes until a girlfriend (who also has red hair!) Is almost an old-fashioned type of children's films and says kids prefer animations like Shrek or Toy Story, etc. - but I think young people should be more familiar with the beauty and the miracle of nature, which certainly makes this film. Perhaps this is not the best film of its kind, but certainly a great and relaxing look for all ages - not just kids.
