For 50 years, this musical comedy fantasy may look like her age, but she worn it dignified. This movie is still very entertaining. Crosby has never been a really romantic lead material but delivers material with the slightly humorous edge he needs. Bendix plays wide and is a huge entertainment in the part that calls his strength. Hardwicke - as cheerful as the knight of the realm - right - to cast himself into such chaps with such abandonment. And Rhonda Fleming enjoys the slightest imagination of the main roles. Only Murvyn Vye disappointed as an unconvincing Merlin. <br /> <br /> Though not a musician, the songs are very good and the "dance" routine accompanying Busy Doing Nothing is perfect - funny, appropriate, skillful, without being demanding, and doing the virtue of Crosby's musical movement, fair, was inherently fun because it was never his greatest strength. <br /> <br /> The color is fine, the sound is a little muddy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And the story - with the original it needs some freedom, but I suspect that Mr. Clemens would be happy with the result.
