I love this movie. My friend Marcus and I went through the local Hastings because we had the urge to rent something we had never seen before, and they came across this beautiful movie. We did not know what it was, but it turned out to be magnificent. 2 inches up. I liked how the film was filmed and the actors were very entertaining. If you are looking for a fun movie that also thinks you, I highly recommend that you quickly get to your local store and find this movie. I would tell you some of my favorite parts, but it could destroy the movie for you, so do not. This movie is definitely on my top 10 films. Do you really think nothing is bouncing?
