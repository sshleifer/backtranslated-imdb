Was anyone able to buy this movie? My uncle "Hutch" was a real (not a reel) pilot who saw him throw his wings in the air and then caught them with his fist when his pilot wings were awarded him. <br /> <br /> It's just a few seconds on the screen, but my family would love to have a movie. He was killed in a battle against Italy, at that time he was only 24 years old. We know the movie studio that did it? Or did anyone see it at a video rental company like Blockbuster? I wish all the catalogs of these old films were available, because it's so cheap that they are doing DVDs today. <br /> <br /> Please email me at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where I can buy a copy. Thank you.
