Lubitsch is the last production, but not his least interesting film. Some of them were mostly ignored by critics because he could not finish it and the film was not signed by Preminger who made most of the productions ... A very strange mixture of the musical (the memory of the Merry Widow?) And classic Lubitsch touches sentimentalism (an impossible love story like Cluny Brown) , but very clever and intelligent, yet not to be understood as the nostalgia of a lost world, but rather the proof of eternal feelings prevailing over the stupidity of mankind, and especially of men, in times of war with the "moral" lesson, which is still true today 1948. Billy is wild as a response to Preminger, who was saddened at Lubitsch's funeral about losing a great man, he said we still have his movies, and that sums up everything about the lady at Ermine ...
