We think people have stopped working originally, as it is time for the original Battlestar series to be a masterpiece, even with all the stars, story lines and art. Lorne Greene was great because Adam and Richard Hatch were perfect because Apollo and Dirk Benedict were funny like Starbuck, but I dared say, not as nice as Katee as Starbuck. <br /> <br /> I loved an episode with Pegasus and Greetings from Earth was good John Calicos was great like Baltar, the War of the Gods, the best was Experiment in Terra, I thought it was a tribute to how Heaven can wait, then you had Battlestar women, you should not compare them, say Tricia, which is exceptionally beautiful as number six, but beauty of Jane Seymour was not compared. We do not want Loerrta Spang like Cassiopea to be fantastic. She had the beauty that the rainbow was embarrassed. I loved the original as well as the new one. Can you imagine John Calicos number six? :) <br /> <br /> Thank you for listening.
