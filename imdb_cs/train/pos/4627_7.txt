If you're going to be inside the castle, why should not you go to the top dramatist William Shakespeare? And if you choose your cast from many criminals who will serve long sentences for the worst crimes, you can be sure they will have enough time to try. In Kentucky Correctional Prison, this courageous project has been done with amazing results. This film shows how everything was done, casting, tests, sets and costumes and the final presentation of Shakespeare's "The Tempest". It was not for me before, but there is an analogy between game setting and corrective jail. In the game, destroyed ship features are limited to an island without contact with the outside world. The prison life is similar. Thanks to the simple painted stern of the surrounding seaside, characters in the most agreeable assortment of costumes that are in the ranks for the authoring audience, Shakespeare's intention may not be so completely but with a certain heart and genuine sincerity. <br /> <br /> More interesting than the game itself was a small camera of every person behind his character. One of the prisoners saw the game as a lesson in forgiving the other as the redemption of their sins. It was pretty pretty when they saw the men wipe tears when they talked about murder, shooting and strangulation. One felt that everyone would like to return hours and re-evaluate their brutal deeds. However (as some have said) past history and presence was the beginning of a new future. At least the game gave temporary relief to the depressive ideas of past events. Prison authorities should be pleased to allow the game to take place. Such an event would put Kentucky on the map and hope the other prisons could follow their good example. It seems to me that everyone benefits not only from prison in Kentucky but also prisoners themselves who need to find new confidence and self-esteem and be ready for the day they go out.
