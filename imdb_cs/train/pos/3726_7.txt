I did not expect to have the highest qualification of the film and Joel Schumacher would drive it, so I was surprised that TIGERLAND was not a complete waste of time. In technique, it's often a derivative of SAVINGO PRIVATE RYAN with an unsettled camera, grainy shots, and the film runs occasionally as if jumping the gear - all the techniques Speilberg used to make his film look more realistic, but eventually more disturbing than anything else. <br /> <br /> But unlike SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the emotional component was not as weak as the characters in this movie looked more like real people and the story less fanciful not packed in the American flag (Speilberg gets 'F' in In addition to the first part of KUBRIK'S MY METAL JACKET, this is the most realistic portrait of the boot camp I've seen in the movie, and I think it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> It's not a great movie, it's not a bad movie.
