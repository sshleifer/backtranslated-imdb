William Powell is a murdering doctor and ex-wife in "The Ex-Mrs. Bradford," starring Jean Arthur, Eric Blore and James Gleason. Powell seems to have chemistry with a woman he was connected to. Although he and Myrna Loy were the perfect pair on the screen, the actor made several other "Thin Man" films, one with Ginger Rogers and one with Arthur, both for a very good effect. <br /> <br /> No one is tired of seeing Powell as a humorous, merciful professional and "Ex-Mrs. Bradford" is no exception. Former lady. B has Mr. B with a call to nourish his back and then goes back to help him solve the mystery that dragged him. And that's not the first time she did it! It almost sounds like it was in front of this movie "Bradford" or that it should be the first of a series of films - Mr. B complains that his secretary-writer ex constantly brings him to the cases. This time the jockey, who rides on a favorite horse in his back, mysteriously falls from his horse and dies just before the finish line. Case resolution is a little unusual, but it's next. The main reason is the bat between the wife and the intervention of the former lady. B. Jean Arthur is quite impressive in his role and very entertaining. However, with an actress who emerges as wise as Arthur, humor seems to be deliberate rather than featherbrained. I suspect that the writer is thinking of something else - say, the insane party of Carole Lombard. When Arthur hears that the police have come, he says, "Oh, probably my grooming, I was waiting for the police to take her hand," it's more of a rival to Powell than a serious statement. It still works well and shows how a good actress can be part of her own. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth watching as William Powell and Jean Arthur have always been.
