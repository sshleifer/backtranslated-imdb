This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen - everything has - really touches the script, the fine actors that make the finesse of the beautiful art to look, really elegant romance (it's a shame that the novel just does not seem to have there are beautiful songs and lyrics (especially the final song), artistic scores and costumes and kits that make you live in them. The end was just disappointing that I expected the great movie to have a brilliant end - but it was even more beautiful than the overwhelming majority of the movies there. Make sure you check this movie - over and over again. There are many details you miss the first time that deserves a second look.
