I thought the River of Souls was a very good film, Babylon 5, with exceptional performances by Martin Sheen, Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If it was an episode of the series (no humor), it would probably be one of my favorite stalls about the series. <br /> <br /> Personally, I have always preferred Scoggin before a Christian, JMS also wrote it for most of the series and she has to deal with the Byron / Telepath plot. If you take a sad humor of a brothel and "poorer" actors in these scenarios, then this film is solid. Probably my third favorite of four films, but by no means bad.
