This terrifying and somewhat horrifying adaptation of the great Stephen King's novel features an excellent central performance by Dale Midkiff, Fred Gwynne (who died a few years ago) and Denise Crosby and some really terrible effects gore.Director Mary Lambert has a wonderful sense of visual style and can create one from the few versions of the Royal Work, which is worth not only seeing, but really disturbing. Also remarkable is the image of the Gage zombie child (Miko Hughes - later in the "New Nightmare"). the ridiculous figure makes it terrifying and scary. As for people who think this is not scary - watch it alone in the dark (or with your conspirator friend) and I guarantee that "Pet Sematary" will sneak up on you. Some horror films such as this or "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" should not be watched in a group. Recommended for horror fans!
