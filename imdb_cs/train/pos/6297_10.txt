My friends and I have just been discussing how we are frustrated about how movies and romantic comedies are doing. We feel offended that Hollywood is serving these days because they behave like everyone else. But it's all wrong ... except for a few bright spots like this movie. It does not have a big acting name, a big budget, I do not think it's a big release (I was renting out of the Hollywood video), but it really did not have anything that would have the biggest budget of a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> But that was what most of them are missing. Among love, "Parker" (Jonathan Schaech) and "Sam" (Alison Eastwood) had a great hema. Their love story was not forced to us like so many people. The director took the time to really get to know these characters. Their story reminded me of one of my favorite "Tootsie". Support for the cast has added not only fun comic moments but also the depth of the story. The James LeGros person was absolutely invaluable. Sam's gay friend was hysterical. Parker's interaction with colleagues in the psychic hotline was very fun. I laughed, I cried, I remembered how great she felt to love.
