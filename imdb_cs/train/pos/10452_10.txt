I want CÃ©line and Jessie to continue in their relationship, I wanted to tell them that they were created for themselves that we want a lot of time in the movie to die each other. Their story is what we have ever wanted and probably most of us have never reached. It's love, but not stupid things, such as a "inconspicuous hill" or such kind of movie. This is life and I believed them, I believed they were falling ... It was so smart and touching. I just finished it to see her a minute ago and still there ... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was now a misanthrope and I felt as though love was just a fake concept, but thanks to this movie I realized that maybe somewhere, somehow and sometimes when something really happens . I'm French and I did not know Julia Delpa well despite Kieslowski's "Three Colors: White" ... Now I have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and has perfect acting. I saw "before the sunset" (continued in Paris) a few days before I saw "before sunrise" and theirs did not matter. Both are masterpieces. proof that you do not need to impress your eyes with technology to get pure feelings. I apologize for my English, which I try best. Franck in France
