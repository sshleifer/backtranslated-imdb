Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) are best friends since then, and after graduation they decide to go to Thailand. Because of the incident, they meet a young attractive mysterious stranger who invites them to go with him on a Hong Kong weekend. But at the airport, Alice and Darlene are wrong with a heroine of drug smuggling and are sent to jail. Now is the time for ultimate survival and true friendship. It was a pretty good movie, I've seen it a couple of times and after a while you notice there are a few holes in the plot, but the movie still enjoys you. Claire Danes did a great job as usual, she's a great actress. I would give Brokedown Palace 8/10
