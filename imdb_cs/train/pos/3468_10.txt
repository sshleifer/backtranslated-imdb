I absolutely loved this movie! I was hesitant when I thought it would be too painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. However, tracking "Two of Us" took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and opportunity. I think the writer did a terrific job that shows what "could be". Aidan Quinn was adorable as Paul and met his head. I was overwhelmed by my accent and manners. Jared Harris is also very talented and was quite believable as John. My favorite works were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene that was so terrifying. The film left me with both sadness and contentment, both of which I think fit because of the circumstances.
