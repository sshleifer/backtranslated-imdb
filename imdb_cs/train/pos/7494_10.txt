Mysterious murders in a European village look like the result of the VAMPIRE BAT horde, which is worried by a terrifying community. This surprisingly effective little thriller was created by Majestic Pictures, one of Poverty Row's Hollywood studies. Engraved production values ​​and harsh adjustments actually contribute to its mysterious atmosphere and give it almost expressionistic quality. Overall, it leaves the viewer with a feeling of being caught in a bad dream that suits the thriller of this kind. Although the ultimate explanation for sinister crimes is quite ridiculous, and with respect to the correct development of the plot, the film boasts a good cast. Grave Lionel Atwill gives another of his typically gentle performances, this time as a doctor conducting scientific research in the old castle. Beautiful Fay Wray plays her assistant in a role that requires him to do more than look beautiful and frightened. Dour Melvyn Douglas appears as a confused police inspector who is also comfortably a friend of Miss Wray. Maude Eburne, who could be extremely entertaining due to the right situation, steals most of her scenes as Miss Wray Hypochondriak Aunt. The elderly people of Lionel Belmore play the village burgermeister. And little Dwight Frye, who will always be remembered for his strange roles in FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula, is the most effective as a crazy fool.
