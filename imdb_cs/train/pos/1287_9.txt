"Let's Bowl" started on Twin City's local television. She arrived late at night, something that would come across a channel when surfing your 7th Hamm bottle. Even the commercials were produced locally, he was Wally outside of Grumpy's bar, he held the microphone, and nervously coughed - "Oh ... to you, Steve Sedahl." I'm not sure why, but he always laughed at me. There was a bowling match featured on the pretext of settling a dispute between two bowlers, but the game was secondary to commentaries and clips. Sedahl played it straight, balanced by the bizarre and cheerful Wally Hotvedt by Rich Kronfeld. The most important points included segments such as "How to Dispose the Old Bowling Ball Properly" and "Dating Tips", where the duo "dates" a couple of counterparts and Wally ends with a bitter complaint: "I could have done it myself!" <br /> < > Another segment - what the duo did in his spare time - was Steve in a beer that could sit in a blind alley and climb out of the refrigerator while Wally tried to climb the cliffs at Taylor Falls, a light blue jacket, and over-sized headphones. Hilarious! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> <br /> <br /> <strong> and he had some good times, but the network never knew what to do, running in the main time and highlighting a bowling "competition" that has never been the subject of the show. Continuous ads broke the flow and side characters (Ernie, Pig, Butch, etc.) They were more scattered than anything else. The whole thing looked grim and forced. Even Jon Stewart disappointed Let's Bowl on a daily show - (lack of lame, snide jokes?) - ignorant treatment for a show that deserves much better. How often does "Let's Bowl" come to the world of modern television, a locally flavored mixture of comedic genius and bustle? The nets have "bullshit" down in the cold, but it's sad to see how they kill such a dark, weird, fun little jewel like Let's Bowl. <br /> <br /> Here I hope it comes out on DVD.
