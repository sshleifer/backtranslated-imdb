"Purple Color" is really amazing. There is no such thing, and I do not think it will ever be. It's the roller coster of emotion and the pain the spectator has taken. The actors are impeccable and the direction is excellent. I totally loved it. The film has never been so happy to me. It's beautiful, that's the best way to explain it.
