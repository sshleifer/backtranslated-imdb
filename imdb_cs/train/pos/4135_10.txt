It's a totally charming movie, one of my favorite romantic comedies. It's incredibly humorous and the cast is wonderful. Although Laurence Olivier is mostly associated with his Shakespearean work, he shows in this film that he is by no means restricted to playing classical theater. It manages the transition from a cynical legal divorce that tries to avoid women and their treacherous ways, puppies that Lady X plays Merle Oberon effortlessly. The dialogue is a wonderfully humorous and refreshing and charming atmosphere. Ralph Richardson was also delighted to watch. I highly recommend.
