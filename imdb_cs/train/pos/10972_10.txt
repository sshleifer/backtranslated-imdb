I have only seen it recently, but I have seen him for several years and have always been interested in his name. Now it belongs to me as one of my very popular films. It's hard to describe the incredible object that Maysles has discovered, but everything works fine in it. It has so many memorable pictures and moments when you feel that you are interfering with a very private world. I fell in love with this film and its characters. It's as if the filmmakers have cast the charm of the listeners and dragged us into a strange world of eccentric Beales, a true aristocratic family. It has a tangible atmosphere and I find that I wish I could have been away from it all, cooking my corn on the shelf at the bedside table. There is air of sorrow that penetrates all over. Fall of grandeur for this ever-respected family. The money vanished, but their air and grace remained as well as their beauty. It stuck to me from the first picture, and long after the movie I was interested in their fate. I wonder if I was walking through East Hampton Beach, I could hear old Edie's voice at night and see Little Edie's silhouette dancing in the window behind a thick hanging plunger. Unforgettable.
