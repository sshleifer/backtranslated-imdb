Although I bought the DVD at the first exit and watched it several times, I never described a review. I loved it when I first saw it and I still love it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that he never scared enough money to motivate someone to follow. I have to assume that QT still controls the rights, but after Kill Bill, if I make a movie that is equally true of comics and books like My Name is Skimness, with another hard female lead, someone, let-down. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Donnell wrote his stories to focus more on psychic tension than on action thrillers. The attractiveness of the play between Modesta and Miklos is very true to the source material and is tense, exciting and fascinating for anyone who does not have gore and explosions. Alexandra did a great job playing as O'Donnell's character took control of this situation. They will find it above the curve that followed the unnecessary restart of Batman and James Bond. After two quiet earlier efforts, though not so well-known to the public, it's really a reboot of a modest character and it's really sad that probably no more movies will be made of it.
