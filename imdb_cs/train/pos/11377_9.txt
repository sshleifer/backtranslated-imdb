Citizen X tells the story of Andrei Chikatil, Rostovsky Ripa, who killed 52 people in the past 8 years, especially women and children. It shows how the Soviet bureaucracy has blocked investigations, how difficult it was to investigate crimes. It does the work in such a brilliant way that nobody leaves it untouched. At the beginning it may be a bit slow, but it will really catch you as the story unfolds. I can only say that besides "The Silence of the Lambs" it is by far the best film about the serial killer I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's very hard to say which performance actor excels over others in this movie. Stephen Rea is really great as an inexperienced forensic expert who is in charge of investigating. The performance of Donald Sutherland as his cynical superior and the only person in the Russian government willing to help him is as excellent as Rea. And what about Jeffrey DuMann, playing a serial killer? DuMann famously created a character that inspired empathy rather than hatred. Yes, he is a monster, but he is also a sad figure, oppressed and mocked by his wife, his boss, his coworkers ... He is tortured, ashamed, and also extremely cruel. /> I can recommend this movie to anyone interested in a well-prepared documentary drama where actors are increasingly important than special effects. It deserves at least 9/10, maybe even more when you ask me.
