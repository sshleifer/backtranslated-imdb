I saw this movie with my friends, and although only two of us left the cinema when they thought how cool it was, the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was. Well, that was because it was not meant to be taken seriously, basically it's a movie that laughs at horror movements and does a goddamn good job. It looks like another movie is coming out, um ... Scary Movie ??? Well this is Aussie and original !!! Jessica Napier makes a surprise performance, and Sarah Kants has a bright future in acting! I hope to see more of them. Molly Ringwald was a good move, and Kylie was a better step. The unreal princess was the queen of the screen! I recommend seeing this movie because you will be guided to the end of the connection with Raffa, Hilary and a movie that never ended 20 years ago.
