I think it was a lot of courage for her. It's unfortunate that when a celebrity suffers, that's what helps people the most. But in her case it was remarkable. I have been in the mental health field for five years, and I think it's great that the mental illness is no longer a terrible word and I believe it helped her. I always thought she was great and would always be. I'm glad she wrote this book and that the movie was made. She is a remarkable lady, and I hope he continues to act. She was a lot and faced. I would really like to see her work more with children, especially children's actors. Her suffering should not be done and I think she would be wonderful as a young mentor. The film made me feel very touched. TBI's suffering, which brought about the onset of my disorder and PTSD, is good to know that someone has the courage to show her life just like her. I believe it helped this people and people in general realize that there are others like them and that there is help. Thank you, Mrs. Duke or Anne, you've always preferred.
