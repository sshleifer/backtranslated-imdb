I have never seen Barbara Steele's film, which I did not like, and I was always crazy about a good story of a haunted house (especially for such beautiful photos as "The Legend of Hell House" and the original versions "The Haunting" and "House on Haunted Hill" ), so I felt that the "blood of the blood" would be right on my aisle. And boy, it was always! This French-Italian co-production, though not a classic, that Steele's first horror film "Black Sunday" remains today, is an extremely atmospheric, cold entry into the spook genre. Filtered in black and white, it can deliver a truly spooky miasm. The film concerns a journalist who bets a lord Blackwood and an author named Edgar Allen Poe that he can spend the night in All Saints at Blackwood Castle when the spirits of those who were killed in the castle are once again living their destiny. The viewer notices these deaths and is to a great extent terrible. The movie actually sends the audience shiver to the back, and on the vague DVD that I just watched - thanks to the great people at Synapse - it even presents a surprising topless scene and some slight lesbianism! And Barbara is great in this movie; her second worldly beauty is beneficial and she plays a sympathetic specter. Its mere presence transforms the haunted story of the spirit into something truly unforgettable. She did not even call her "The Queen of Horror".
