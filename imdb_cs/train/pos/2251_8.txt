It seems to me that Alan Jacobs is evaluating the film very accurately, but I had the chance to rent a DVD from a blockbuster with a commentary from the curator, the BYU film archive James D'Acor. At that time prof. Heber J. Grant approved a film that understands deviations from historical content for dramatic expression and telescoping events. For example, the film showed Joseph Smith in court. although Brigham Young is a great orator in the defense of Joseph Smith was equally convicted. Then Joseph was killed. Historically, Joseph Smith has never been condemned for anything. Brigham Young was in Boston when Joseph Smith was arrested for this particular trial. Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum, where both were killed in court.
