Henry Fonda captures greatly what we have long believed to be Abraham Lincoln. It's upset. Through the performance of the Funds, we are led to the belief that Abraham Lincoln was a bumpkin landscape. But because of your confrontation with the lynched crowd, and especially during court proceedings, you can see that under the posture is a great person who knows how well it works around him and how to influence people around him. <br /> <br /> In this film, Henry Fonda shows he has a very good idea of ​​how to present humor. It's his aspect that has been lost over the years. When she tells stories and jokes, she has the perfect time. There is a sequence in the test, in which I laughed quite a bit. He shows this gift again at The Lady Eve in 1940. The end of John Ford is absolutely great with Henry Fonda going to the top of the hill and in the distance a huge storm of symbolic civil war. It returns to history. The film is a fiction, but the view of Lincoln is huge. It is definitely worth seeing again.
