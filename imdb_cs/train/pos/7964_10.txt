I am surprised at how much I love this movie, despite the fact that I do not like dogs. Fox, Field and Ameche are doing a wonderful job with the votes of Chance, Sassy and Shadow, and animal acting is simply amazing. I've seen this movie 72 times (I know it sounds creepy, but it's true!) And every time I end up ending the scene. I highly recommend it to people of all ages and especially to animal lovers. It's really my favorite movie!
