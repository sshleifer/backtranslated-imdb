"Tintin and I" first thought of me as a masterpiece. Photography and editing are really eager (almost anti-dogma). We are following the life of Tintin socket Hergé through an open interview from 1971. The Tintin series was drawn against the backdrop of the great ideological struggles of the twentieth century. In the midst of these herghes, he has his own demons he is struggling with, and much of his drawing seems to be an attempt to spoil them and escape into a world of perfection. Although there is a magnificent photographic panorama of the Tintin albums, as well as some reconstructions and reading passages from the album, the story of Hergé is narrated exclusively through interviews and archive materials and never through reconstructions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Herges lived a real, suffering artist. But the fantastic world that came from his fantasy will continue to amaze readers over and over again.
