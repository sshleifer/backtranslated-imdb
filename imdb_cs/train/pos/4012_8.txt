After some trouble, Johnny Yuma arrives at the ranch of his uncle to take over the day-to-day operation just to find out that the old man was murdered by his beautiful wife and feminine evil brother. /> Good production values, a pleasant performance by Mark Damona and a smooth action pack make up for it to be a fun, if not extraordinarily deep, over-normal addition to the western spaghetti genre. <br /> <br /> Co-star Rosalba Neri is one of the hottest European bucks ever to love the screen. Here he is perfectly perfect as a cold man (and abusive) weak men. <br /> <br /> Damon and Neri appeared together in at least one other film, The Devil's Wedding Night, a pretty good horror film that's a special interest for those of you who want to see what's under Rosalb's dress .
