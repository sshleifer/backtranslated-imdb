I just recently watched on the Sundance channel. The idea of ​​the film was to bring many filmmakers famous in their own country to produce short films, eleven of them, all in one film that focuses on just one topic: September 11th. I could tell this movie why these filmmakers were great in their country because it had all the elements of a great movie. The film begins with a film in Iran where the teacher is fighting to teach students what happened on September 11, which they do not realize until later on. The second film from France includes deaf women who write the letter with their lover angry without realizing what is going on as a TV game. <br /> <br /> Another Egyptian film includes a director who talks to a dead soldier about recent events not just about September 11 terrorists but about bombing in other places. <br /> <br /> Another comes from Bolivia, where the girl learns about the September 11 events and believes she has to march for them. <br /> <br /> Another from a country in Africa, where a group of boys follow a guy they think is Bin Laden. Another comes from Mexico, where nothing is displayed, but the sounds of that day. <br /> <br /> Another of Israel, including a reporter on a bomb spot trying to get a message, but is often informed about the attack. <br /> <br /> There are other movies you remember at that moment, but they are all powerful. It will bring you your emotions from that day. <br /> <br />
