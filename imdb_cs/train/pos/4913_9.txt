The title somewhat exceeds the content of this film, which may lead to some unrealized expectations. Frankly, there is very little "panic in the streets". In fact, very few people actually find out in the movie that a freelancer is a killer who can spread the plague to everyone and anyone he encounters. After what we have here, this is a very well-done story with a level of tension that begins to be reasonably high (because unlike the people in the streets, the audience knows what's going on) and that director Elia Kazan is building very deliberately. Because the wanted killer is infected, one of the most interesting side panels I've found is the development of relationships between Dr. Reed (Richard Widmark) and Police Captain Warren (Paul Douglas). At first, they both do not like each other, even though they have to work together. Finally, they created a true bond of mutual respect. Kazan did a good job with that. <br /> <br /> Quite a lot of performances here were great. Widmark and Douglas were great and I was quite impressed with the very early look at Jack Palance, who would become his typical "heavy" role. I found very little to criticize here. Maybe Barbara Bel Geddes hit a little flat like Reed's wife Nancy, but her role was not really important to the story. Overall, it's a great job. 9/10
