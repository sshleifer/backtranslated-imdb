I thought the kids in the show did a very good job. Especially I enjoyed the idea of ​​Emmy. Great! Stunts were pretty good for a low budget show. I was able to watch the movie and enjoy it without having to look at my watch every 5 minutes. I used scenes with a tooth fairy and burning. The positive revelation of the children's souls who were released was also good. Another good point of the film is that it is still moving. There were not many slow scenes. Adult leaders were also credible, and therefore helped keep fun. Everything is a nice night watching movies.
