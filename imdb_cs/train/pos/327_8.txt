I read one note that marked this film as "waste" and "waste of time". I think that person has gotten his political boots too little. <br /> <br /> I just rented new DVD Criteria both yellow and blue. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm expecting some real porn (there is no.) There is a frontal nudity (including even the verboten frontal male nudity (automated <br /> <br /> NC-17 - Orwellian-X) in But I did not expect the movies <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> </ span> <br /> <br /> The first such scene is very realistic, the leading couple is clumsy, awkward, fun and cute in their first dome scene. <br /> <br /> The second - most of them are weeping Wear - is false <br /> <br /> Cunnilingus and Fellatio. And the last is the end of an angry struggle that is credible. <br /> <br /> Extras include an informative introduction to the movie, an interview with the original American distributor and his lawyer, excerpts from the US testimony and diary comments on some scenes. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that did not leave "blue noses" alone and led to the key "prurient interest without social redemption" standard, fortunately it stands. <br /> <br /> Those who are interested in stories will find this.
