When I was little, my parents got this movie so I can watch. I really liked it and I watched it again and again. Even when I was in 3rd grade, I still looked from time to time. I recently watched it again, just for nostalgia, and although the show was not focused on my age group (I was in late teens), I still considered it fun and educational. This show teaches good lessons about imagination and is good with others. Some parts I found quite fun. Also, this show has no bad content, so you can leave the kids with this show and you do not have to worry about choosing a bad language or something else. I would recommend it.
