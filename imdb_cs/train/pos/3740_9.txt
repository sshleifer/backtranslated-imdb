While it was filmed on the site of Florida National Guard, "Tigerland" totally resembled Fort Polk, LA, fire ranges, maneuvering areas, deep water, and everything. The film was quite authentic and characters similar to those on my AIT in 1974. The difference between Tigerland, 1971 and 1974 is that all the sergeants and instructors knew not to return to Vietnam as it was all over, so the training was very relaxed - not a challenge at all. It was the ancestor of all our troubles in the 1970s and 1980s that I knew because I stayed in 2004. I never heard of anyone mentioning "Tigerland", but the army had real Vietnamese training villages in different bases after the entire US Vietnamese veterinarians told me that until 1972, Basic & AIT could be quite harsh and harsh because the trainers were there and were entrusted with the training of men bound in Vietnam to carry those skills, even though that was not the case. Both the Sergeant in Polka and later one of my vets from Vietnam when we became instructors of the Fort Bliss basic training brigade told me that nothing they could do to prepare someone and simply had to find out and build for themselves. This movie is high.
