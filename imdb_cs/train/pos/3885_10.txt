I was first introduced to "Eddie" friends from "Over-Pond" who know I like smart humor. I prefer comics that can be thought provocative in fun as George Carlin and Dennis Miller. In "The Dress to Kill", Eddie provides the same type of social humorous observation that stimulates your thoughts on the subject, while causing your party to divide at the same time. In this stand-up there is a wide range of themes and they are just hysterical. A little bit of how to decide on Englebert's scene name will leave you in stitches! Thanks to Andrew and Catherine! ... and "Do you have a flag?"
