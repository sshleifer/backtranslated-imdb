The picture bride portrays a realistic and moving portrait of what must have been like the Japanese men brought to Hawaii at the turn of the 19th century to work on sugar cane fields. Most lost a return to their homeland, but few people managed it. Likewise, the fate of Japanese women, some youngsters like fifteen or sixteen, who were sent as promised brides to men who knew only pictures that were often out of age ten or fifteen, or were from some other younger man. They also worked long heavy hours in the fields as they fought home and maintained their dignity. Director Hatta portrays the courage of bride and perseverance who have tried to survive in a foreign country and a foreign society under great physical pressure is ultimately inspirational and uplifting - the story of moral and cultural survival. There is the grandeur and grandeur of sweeping the character and landscape in the Picture Bride that captures the welcoming beauty as well as the violent roughness of the colonial Hawaii. It is a film that is emotionally, intellectually and artistically rewarding.
