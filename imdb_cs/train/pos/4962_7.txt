"The Brak Show" is good. Probably not at the same level as "Aqua Teen Hunger" or "Space Ghost Coast to Coast", but it certainly has many brilliant moments. He basically watches the life of Zorak and Brak, who have a normal life and go to school, to live in a 50 'sitcom style neighborhood. The humor and animation of this show is very similar to "Aqua Teen Hunger" (and in one episode you could see Meatwad) with bizarre situations and strange characters. But that's good, they have funny parts. Some songs are great, others are not much, but I like this show. The most entertaining figure is Father Brak. (that's a man, no one knows why)
