Story and Music (George Gershwin!) They are wonderful as well as Levant, Guinet, Foch and of course Kelly. One thing is missing and the thing is a good front lady. I'm sorry, Leslie Caron is worrying me. Anyway, despite that, the conspiracy moves well with the famous (and deservedly) Ballet. Colors, dazzling red, blue, green and yellow. Can not forget beigas too. ; ) I just appreciate the contrast between the Beaux Arts Ball (completely black and white costumes) and the ever-brilliant ballet. I suppose what I am trying to say is this: in any case, to see and enjoy it, because although it is not the best, it is MARVELOUS. But do not forget another Gene Kelly musical with a 20-year-old girl who was starved afterwards.
