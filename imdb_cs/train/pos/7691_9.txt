This show was the landmark of the American comedy, as it was the first sitcom to play all the African-American cast. Unfortunately, it has never been extended to British television. <br /> <br /> The Evans family is a poor African-American family living in a tower block. Dad is called James, trying to run the house, but his Florida woman always likes it. Three children are JJ artistic, moody Thelma and young intellectual Michael. I always go to Florida's overflowing girlfriend Willon. I was looking at the two episodes of this show on youtube (Black Jesus and Sex and Evans Family - the only two on the site). Maybe you wonder why the English spectator was looking at a series that he never showed in his country or what he heard. The answer is as follows. In 1976, Britains first published all black sitcoms called The Fosters. Only two sets were made and now they seem to be forgotten. But I watched one episode and was really impressed. Then I learned that the scripts are the same as "Good Times". They were exactly the same characters, but with different names - Sam Foster was dad, his wife was Pearl Foster, and the three children were Sonny (Lenny Henry), Shirley and Benjamin. Pearl's drunk friend was Vilma. (To read about The Fosters, I wrote about the review). While watching "good times," two things upset me. The first one was the opening melody (horrible) and second was the laughter of the audience. I like the laughter of the audience, but somebody says a funny line and the audience is going crazy and they start to clap. Besides, it was a very entertaining show. Let's hope you get more episodes on YouTube and hoping someone released "The Fosters" on DVD in England. <br /> <br /> Best Episode: Sex and the Evans Family - Episode 1 of the 6th series. The Foster episode was called Sex in the Black Community. Another episode I saw, Black Jesus was the title of one episode "The Fosters"
