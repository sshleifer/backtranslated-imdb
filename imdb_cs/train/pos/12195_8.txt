Any movie in the early days of Orson Welles is triumph until the third man with Joseph Cotton. He is also amazing in Touch of Evil. Take a look at them all! He tends to get pompous and self-serving in movies as F is for Fake, a really silly film waste. Do not waste time watching it. it is really unconscious. Orson Welles is a film icon, and anyone studying the film should see everything he shot. All his front ladies are huge, but in the end Welles became a drunk drunk, like his character in Touch of Evil! For some reason, Orson Welles had a way with women, I see how he could be considered attractive in his youth, not like Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton or Cary Grant, John Wayne, I could go on, but I turn ... and because I woman, I see attraction to him. He (Orson Welles) is one of the last true filmmakers and if you do not count today's creators: Tarantino, Scorses, Spike Lee, most filmmakers just do not measure filmmakers of the 1940s! I know there are a lot more great filmmakers today, but in such a short time I can not name them all. No attack on one of the best filmmakers of this millennium! August 21, 2006. Please remind me of some contemporary filmmakers, I do not want to be in the past! I love some of the movies, but seldom there is some that I would give the "100 best" list. "Hustle and Flow" was great, so it was "Fargo" and "Oh brother, where are you," from the line in Sullivan roads; another fine film from the 1940s! Can anyone give me the best list for the 90th and up to 2006? I want to know who to watch! Thank you! Also props on this site! Where else can you join a movie or you can! I love wounding and courage from regular people like me who can say what I want, and I promise they will not spoil any movie for someone who has not seen!
