Before I look at this movie, I see a lot of comments, each of which has a great view of the film good or bad ... What I really want to emphasize is Woody Harrelson acting as it may not be in many parts of the movie but when it appears or even the introduction , I was amazed by the "message" of Willy Smith and Woody Harrelson, who were trying to create and maybe slip the whole plot up to the end to really understand what was going on. <br /> <br /> I'm not a very sentimental person, I think a good deed should not be a curiosity or regret. But the law to show redemption is not a lot of films that, in my opinion, could show. This is one of them that can. <br /> <br /> I agree with one person who commented on this movie that suicide acts are a fall but I do not believe it is a "message" that the movie is trying to send but "sacrifice". A little to the extreme, but that's a message in your opinion. The film has the potential. Every penny is worth playing, the script is incredible. from a person who really does not like to watch dramatic movies ... if you like drama, it has to be a watch.
