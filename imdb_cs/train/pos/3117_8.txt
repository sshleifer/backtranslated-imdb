I start by saying that I am very pleased with this highlight of the Bourne trilogy. Please, oh, please, do not ruin it by doing a flight or predecessor. Just leave it alone. He just ... was thinking. He is talented and versatile like Matt Damon ... it seems as if Jason Bourne was just to play. If you are a fan of the first two Bourne films, you will not be disappointed with third installments. It sticks to what works and adds a little more. It was a great pleasure to see how well all the information we gain in "Identity" and "Superiority" is finally drawn in the "Ultimatum" window of a complete picture of Jason Bourne's past history. The action sequences are fast and keep you on the edge of the seat. Fighting between Bourne and the assassins is always fun to watch. I've always been a fan of CIA filmmakers, and as CIA collects his Intel and this movie is right on the street, it's even more exciting for me. If you choose to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without watching the previous two installments .. you will still be enjoying the movie carefully, but I would recommend you to watch them first. This would allow you to fully understand the character of Jason Bourney and become attached and part of his world. This will allow you to appreciate even more and enjoy the movie. I'm not sure what's better than the first 2, but personally I think 'Ultimatum' could, just MIGHT, have a boundary in comparing the trilogy.
