Greetings again from the darkness. What a relief ... a thriller that is really exciting! The new girl, Rachel McAdams ("Wedding Crashers" and "The Notebook"), dominates the screening of this fine little classic thriller from Wes Craven's famous movie "Scream" and "Nightmare on Elm Street." Craven even has a dude as one of the passengers on the plane. What this is doing, it's realism for the first 15-20 minutes, as we can see that McAdams works with 4 or 5 people either in or on the phone. It's natural. When he meets Cillian Murphy (a "Batman Begins" scarecrow) in what seems to happen, the film really is flying. Watching two types of yuppie-flirting, while the audience knows there is something evil, is a charming filmmaking! Aircraft tracking is fascinating and 30 extra minutes aboard is exclusively claustrophobic. Craven lets us guess about the involvement of others, and if anyone comes to him. <br /> <br /> As with many thrillers, a single trigger occurs during the climax when the lamb becomes superhero. Interesting fence equipment leads us to the fact that little Rachel has the trouble to see it, but we can not help, but we kind of get a little crazy about it. The most exaggerated scenes include broken hotel guests, annoying airline passengers, Cillian's injury and FX at the hotel. The power of the film is in the development of characters and psychological games among the leaders. Unfortunately, veteran Brian Cox with a low screen is inadequately used, but overall it's an above-average suspense thriller that's worth seeing for everyone except the finals.
