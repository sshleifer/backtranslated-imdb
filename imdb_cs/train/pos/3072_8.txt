Panic is the sneaky little jewel of the film - you think you chose it in the first half of an hour to be delighted to realize that Henry Bromell is a much better writer / director. The film moves slowly, with one quietly destructive scene behind the other, all perfectly done by William Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter and the most prominent child actor, and I have long seen David Dorfman as Macy's son delivering his line, as if thoughts were created in his mind completely unnoticed. Rich and rewarding, this movie will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.
