It is a relatively slow film that slowly creates the story of a former stripper who begins a new family life with a complete stranger. The viewer slowly feels that there is something wrong ... <br /> <br /> I really loved the film even though at the end it left a slightly bitter taste at the end. It's smart, well-functioning and very good acting. Both Philippe Toretton and Emmannuelle Seigner are deeply attitudes. <br /> <br /> The little son "pierrot" is also very moving. Thriller that does not look like one. A very unconventional film, a very specific atmosphere throughout the movie, even if you can feel uncomfortable several times with several scenes. <br /> <br /> I'll give it 8/10 !!
