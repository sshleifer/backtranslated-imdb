Idiot scammers, babe, safe, plan and baby. Add them all and get the best comedy you've never heard of. <br /> <br /> Even with some stellar performance (at least minus ... okay, b-plus?) this movie has received little publicity. do not limit his genius. <br /> <br /> Great writing, solid delivery and a credible group of characters. Some really classic lines and a fun twist at the end. <br /> <br /> It's not a broken comedy "Nutty Professor". They are bad people with a low life. They speak a bad tongue with a low life and do bad things with a low life. But they do it for your entertainment and fun and they do it well. One of the best comedies I've ever seen.
