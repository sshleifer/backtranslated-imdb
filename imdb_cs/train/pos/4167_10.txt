The Devil Dog: The Hound of Hell is a really good movie. He has good acting, including Richard Crenny and R.G. Armstrong. Music is scary and it gives the devilish chill! I liked the effects on the dog and I think the creature itself looked really cool with its horns, it was bent as a part of the neck and it was really viscous! have not seen The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell and are already able to find and buy this precious film, then they will do it because it's a good movie and I do not think you will be disappointed!
