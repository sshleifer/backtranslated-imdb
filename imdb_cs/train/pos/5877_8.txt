Okay, this movie is okay, as I said, but it certainly has to watch how it's worth watching. These are two Mac and Sam boys who are great friends and work as fashion photographers, and the time of laughter begins when Mac (Akshay Kumar) starts dating three hostesses while leaving his wife suspect. Sam gets lucky and almost forsakes his friend, but not completely. But Mac thinks yes, so he's going to go with Letouchky. there is a garam masala at every step of the movie, rock tracks, but somethings are missing. Comedy is not a brand name and deserves a prize. It's nice, but not so great. Some people laughed until their stomaches hurt, but it did not deserve to laugh much. But of course, every opinion is different. So if you want to watch a movie, you can do it.
