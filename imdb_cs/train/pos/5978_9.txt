It's a true movie of the '80s: At that time, they produced about 100 times more films than they did today, and that makes them a lot of interesting ... It was a cultural phenomenon that no longer exists. Nowadays, maybe the same kind of people who would make cheap movies "directly on the video" in the eighties make cheap pornography. Porn seems to be selling. Anyway, it's above the media: It has a good and fascinating story and I think it's pretty good. In one scene, you can even see how the microphone moves to the top of the frame. Of course there are also small windows from Ozzy and Gene Simmons, but they do not help much to the movie "success", though they are good in their small roles. Monster, the heavy singer "Sammi Curr" looks really horrible, especially when singing. One of the most awesome monsters I've seen in horror movements. Maybe I have nightmares on him the next night. Not recommended for fans of intellectual films.
