I would say that this film provides an insight into the trauma that a young mind can face when the family is divided by divorce or other disaster. I highly recommend this movie, especially for parents or individuals who want to have a family. <br /> <br /> I found characters that are attractive and very sympathetic from many dimensions. <br /> <br /> A spooky monster, though probably not scary for most adults, has a very real hint of what could cause the child's excessive imagination faced with unknown horrors. I thought the movie was wonderful!
