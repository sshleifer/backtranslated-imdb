Let's start with the theme song sung by Christopher Cross. The song is "If you're caught between Moon and New York City." It's a great theme and song even after all these years, it never bothers you. It's a great song about New York. Anyway, the great Dudley Moore CBE stars as a spoiled drunk millionaire who deals with the character of Jill Eikenberry in the movie. Jill later played LA Law. Anyway, it is given by the great British maid Sir John Gielgud OM, who won the Oscar for his performance in the film as Best Actor. Arthur falls in love with the character of Liza Minnelli, who is perfect in this film, in addition to her appearance as an Oscar in a cabaret. No, Liza sings. He plays a service station. Anyway, I like Geraldine Fitzgerald as Bach's family matriarch who decides about family wealth. Anyway she is wonderful and she should be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress Actress. Barney Martin best known as Jerry's dad at Seinfeld plays Lizin's Dad. It's also great. The film was well written, acted and delivered to the viewer who wanted it more.
