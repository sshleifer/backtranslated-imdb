Although the effects are really scary, I think that some of them may have gone into the well several times too many times. The end seemed hurried to conceal what could have been more favorable moments. The viewer can solve a lot of things for himself, not as a challenge by the creators, but because they simply missed it. Yet it's a good little Indian horror film that's just a few steps above the average. It is well worth the rent.
