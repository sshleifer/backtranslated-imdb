The dentist was made at a time when almost every profession had a psycho. We had dirty police officers, rescuers, secrets, and that was just the beginning. The dentist arrived surprisingly late because going to the dentist is usually the nightmare of every person. <br /> <br /> The plot is twisted. Super Clean Dentist Doctor Feinstone has a perfect life in his great "white house", has a beautiful blonde and a great place to work as a dentist. Dark clouds come to his horizons as the enemy of the IRS (Terminator's Earl Boen), the dirty pool cleaner "cleanses" his wife and suddenly it seems that all the teeth have gone through the dark filter. He goes nuts and begins to take care of the teeth of people on an ugly path. And you do not want to go his way. <br /> <br /> The crew was professional. Producer / director Brian Yuzna produced stylish horror films such as Re-Animator and From Beyond. He drove the sequel to Re-Animator and his first film Society was a pretty spinoff by John Carpenter that lived. Film producer Pierre David is known from films such as scanners. The game was great. Corbin Bernsen really surprised me. I knew him from LA Law and Major League, but I could explain him as a dental psychologist. He was really great in his role and he was a little sad man. Linda Hoffman was beautiful and silly as a female Feinstones. Micahel Stadvec did not have much, but when I saw him with the ladies around, I knew my future profession. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead, From Beyond) was a nice look as a police officer on a case. Virginya Keehne was an innocent teenager who is going to be another client of Feinstone. <br /> <br /> Concluding remark: If you are like me and you have a dentist problem, you might want to omit it. But if you want to try than you should prepare with dark humor and lots of nasty boreholes.
