This is a shooting (4 hours) of the remake of the story of Ridge Haggard with the usual added woman and an external subplot with Russian soldiers searching for the "Stone of Power" buried together with the treasure of King Solomon. It is very well shot, it makes sense for the wide open area of ​​Africa and is very good at acting. Patrick Swayze is an excellent Alan Quatermain and Allison Doody is attractive as Elizabeth Maitland, who hires Quatermain to help save her father. Sidede Onyulo as Umbopa, Gavin Hood as McNabb and the leader of Russian soldiers (who are not listed in IMDb) are also unforgettable. Because all that Hollywood can not leave a good story by itself, when it adapts it, this is well said and besides being too long, I enjoyed it. 6/10.
