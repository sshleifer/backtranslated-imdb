I saw this movie at the University Film Festival in the 1970s - I expected FOREVER that this movie came out on the video (it's finally out there). It was made in Brazil, so I assumed it was the reason she had not done it yet. I've been checking video stores over the past 15 years waiting for this great movie to come out! It's one of my favorite times - but be warned, it's weird, like Werner Herzog weird - his curiosity results from his super realism. The film is based on a real incident back several hundred years ago, in the pre-colonial era, when Europeans first met Amazon tribes. The white man is the wrong tribe of cannibals as his enemy and intends to kill him. But before they sent him, they became part of their tribe (their habits). The entire movie is like watching a National Geographic document when it becomes an accepted member of their tribe. And it is done. Cosmic plotline? No. An intense insight into the diversity of human life? Certainly. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah ... be warned ... this film has some nudity - this is not a hollywood folding film about noble savages ... this movie says it as it was above: National Geographic, superrealism) <br /> <br />
