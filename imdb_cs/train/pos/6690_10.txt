Mystery Men is one of those films that are becoming funny over time. The characters are naive innocence and "pretty". It has become part of our "culture" of the family, and we often bring characters. It's my favorite movie for the past two years. My children are 13 and 11, and we all love this movie. Great actress and comedy. We love Galaxy Quest and Monty Python. Well, here we are not talking about the intellectual, just about the family!
