A thrilling thriller that resembles Deliverance as a scenery and setting. There are also some highly innovative scenes and good music, although the vileness and sometimes seemingly careless attitude of one of the characters is an inappropriate situation, although it is not the mayor's problem. It also presents interesting questions about the righteousness of revenge and the boundaries of friendship. <br /> <br />
