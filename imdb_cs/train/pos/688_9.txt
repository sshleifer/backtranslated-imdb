I was delighted to see this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was very impressed. Tess Nanavati is clearly a great screenwriter and I would like to see more of her films. If she could do what she did with the budget of this movie, I'm very nervous when I see what she can do with the main picture. Kudos to cast for their amazing performance (the girl was golden), and for everyone who composed music. The deformed "Order of your ship" has fired me away. A very creative movie all around ... I really hope it will look like a video or a DVD because I bought it for a second. If you have a chance, you should definitely see this movie.
