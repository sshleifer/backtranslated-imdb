Michael Kallio gives a strong and convincing performance like Eric Seaver, a rogue young man who was terribly ill-rescued as a little boy by his monstrous, abusive alcoholic stepfather, Barry (the really terrifying image of Gunnar Hansen). Eric has a compassionate fiancee (sweetly played by beautiful Tracee Newberry), and the job transcribes the autopsy reports at the local morgue. Horrified by his bleak past, lifted by baldness and concealed by Jack the Demon (really scary by Michael Robert Brandon) and sent over the edge of his mother's recent death, Eric emerges from a deep end and goes to brutal killing spree. Director Kallio (who also wrote an anxious, austere screenplay) with evenly gentle sound without a cast (Jeff Steiger is particularly good as Eric's willing angel Michael), rather harsh but generally polished cinematography by George Lieber, faithful true characters, horrible explosions of raw , a shocking and fearless fierce violence, a moody, scary score from Dan Kolton, an endless ending, eccentric Detroit, Michigan sites, a terrible serious tone and a tense, catchy story that stays on a steady track all over the world, this extremely powerful and horrifying psychological horror thriller is often absorbing and disturbing viewing. True sleep.
