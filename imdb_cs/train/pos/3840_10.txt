Jerome Crabbe plays a major role in this film. I've seen this movie 6 times and I'm still not tired. This film is in some ways similar to Flesh + Blood. Gerald Soetman is a great writer. He wrote all the Dutch films of Paul Verhoeven. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. I've seen all of his movies except showgirls. My mother does not like him very much, but I do not agree. I think all of his movies are a ride that can watch especially Total Recall and Basic Instinct. Jerry Goldsmith made some of his films, including Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Hollow Man. I ask Jerry Goldsmith never to die. Dutch films are different but still enjoyable.
