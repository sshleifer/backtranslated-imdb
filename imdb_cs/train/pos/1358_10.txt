Season after season the players or characters in this show seem to be people you would love to love. Is this show manipulated so or was she chosen the same? Each episode abuses a single individual person and eventually kills. You are looking forward to seeing how they get stuck, even if they are bad and bad. You're happy to see them hacked, screwed, dirty, get back, escape, and finally kick out Trump. The amount of tears also increases in the season. Rewards that seek to offset the past of humiliation and suffering are also greatly reduced. In later times, it's like, "You'll meet xyx, who will teach you about uvw." Like who does the phrasing take care of? The characters are so hateful, collectively and individually, that you are surprised to be paid actors? The only rational person gains. <br /> <br /> Watch carefully and keep your conscience. These are your close people on fire.
