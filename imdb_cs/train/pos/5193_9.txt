Fighting the sword was out of this world, fighting for spectacular scenes without flying on wire techniques (to the end), which are too common today. The scene with Chan and prayer was probably the pinnacle of the movie. The characters in the attack on the manor with the bad guys were clich√©s, but the film is comfortable with him. Injection of humor from Woo. Complete twists and turns were unpredictable and exciting, and you could not tell who is good or bad or on which side people. <br /> <br /> Good feeling of tension and well-timed surprises. The depth of the story is quite intense for this genre's short film and will reach you as most kung-fu flicks do not.
