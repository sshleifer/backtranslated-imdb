She had never heard of Men on the Moon until he saw him on the HDTV channel last night. Look, my taste is like any other, eclectic. My favorite runs from Blue Velvet to Dr. Strangelove to the Spirit and Mrs. Muiro through the Sorcerer of Oz and Beloved, Eraserhead, Repo Man and The Spy Within. The Man on the Moon is a beautifully shot, gentle heart, joyous and tragic film, beautifully shot, in which actors actually live in a moment rather than act. This sweet story will soon be in our private library. This beautiful story of life in a much more subdued time in rural Louisiana will literally bring you to your pastoral environment. <br /> <br /> It's hard to stay stoic during the last moments of the movie, especially when the young girl's range of her older sister's heart is afraid of private pain and forgives everyone. Rather than blush the joy or bore you sobs with my boring prose, it will end up with this suggestion now from the one who likes movies that speak from heart to ours. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to buy another movie, buy the Men on the Moon. This moving story is the one you will love again and again. It's a joy and gem, a movie that's too little in this world of heart-curing. <br /> <br /> The simple virtues radiated by the Men on the Moon are joyful. > Paul Vincent Zecchino <br /> <br /> Manasota Key, Florida <br /> <br /> April 05, 2009
