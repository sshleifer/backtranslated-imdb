This is a great show! I had a history teacher at a secondary school that resembled. In history there are many "facts" that are not entirely true, and Mr. Wuhl is very good showing, which is unforgettable. Mr. Wuhl teaches a class of film students, but history students and the general public will appreciate funny ways to uncover some of the most famous deceptive events in the history of the world, and try to impress them on the brains of their students. The use of live actors performing "skits" is also very fun. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in the history they learned when the baby turned upside down.
