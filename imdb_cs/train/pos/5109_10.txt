I grew up in Houston and it was nine when this movie came out. As a result, I can not remember anything about the movie. But I remember the feeling that caused Gilley and the mechanical bull on Johnny Lee's hit song "Lookin for Love," which still brings memories of childhood whenever I hear it. A few years ago I first saw this movie as an adult and all I can say was that I was thrown out. Several films hit me. This movie is as brutal and real as you can get. From the ranch house of Uncle Boby, from a chemical plant in Texas, from a dance hall of Gilley and Buda and Sissy. And perhaps for this reason it does not have a wider appeal. But no matter how you feel in rural music (I can not stand it for myself despite my roots in Houston) Urban Cowboy is a unique slice of American cake. That's why I like it!
