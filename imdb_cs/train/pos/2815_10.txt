I can not believe my eyes when you read a lot of other comments and reviews. It's like the average movie of the old guys. <br /> <br /> The film is great, fun, crazy, supernatural violent, even with a minimal gore and all the way to the core. He loved every piece of his. I can not remember something crazy like this one that was done for laughter and martial arts. And now it's the most important thing (at least for me): computer effects are free. When I look at some Hollywood actors who appear on the screen in a modern, high resolution and damn high-budget action "fuflo" (Russian word meaning "bek * beep *"), I understand that it can be a beep * - You can set the wires on the body, add some cute PC effects and put them in the action movie. Here is something else. I do not think there will be a dozen physically mature action stars around the world who can repeat the battle that takes place at the end of the movie or the game of "Chinese Football". And it's just a little Hong Kong cinema made for fun, not to pretend to be "star wars." <br /> <br /> They have a DVD with English soundtrack a problem with this movie. It's not losing the atmosphere to me. I can not help mentioning a very neat theater play. Some of you, assuming, will not like it. As for me - it's amazing. Look at a friend of Dragon who boldly talks with criminals and suddenly gets his fist on the left side of his head. His expression of face turns into something moody and comes to Dragon with a child's expression. And look at the menacing size of his mouth - it's almost from one ear to another long when he makes grimaces. This film deserves higher ratings and a thousand comments from people around the world. Very grateful to our Russian industry for the release of classic Jackie Chan movies. Its modern are much weaker in my humble opinion and do not deserve too much humor. A total of 10 of the 10 legendary film in their genre. Thanks for your attention.
