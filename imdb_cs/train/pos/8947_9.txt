Kim Novak is a witch hunt for a deadly mistress and James Stewart is her choice. Scintillating comedy behavior, from the Broadway scene; fired James Wong Howe in Witch Color and played sterling cast. Ernie Kovacs is amazing as the constantly disheveled writer Redlitch. I love this movie, even though it seems to be a little. Kim alone is the winner in my book. Ha! My film No. 5 of 1958.
