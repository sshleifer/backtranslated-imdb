If you like romantic comedies, then you'll find this story of two biennial 30-year-old singles who have fallen in love with the American League fans. On the other hand, if you hang around waiting for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2, then you should probably stay away. The task is to make a compulsory boy meet with girl friends, a girl meets with friends, and the guy meets girls' parenting scenes. There is even a guy who meets a girl's dog scene. That's all that's happening in a movie like this one. However, what I liked was that the conspiracy came into the decision making process of people when they began to realize that their romantic interest was not perfect and actually a bit weird. The plot focuses on answering questions; how much is the wail too much, and how much love does it take for these remorse to be thwarted? It's interesting to see that the characters are working because deep (if we admit it) we all have moods. Barrymore is doing a very good job in his role, and Fallon sorta surprised me - he's also good. I rate 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy. Add one point if you are a baseball fan or romantically involved in one. Add another point if you are a Red Sox fan and subtract two points if you are a Yankees fan.
