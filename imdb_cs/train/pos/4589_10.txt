Well, I think the Police Story is one of Jackie Chan's best movies. The story, combat scenes and stunts are excellent. In this film, Jackie himself served as a policeman, Chan Ka Kui (Kevin Chan in some versions), who successfully arrested criminals. After the criminal had been released due to lack of evidence, Chan had murdered a policeman. Because of this, he became a police officer. Later, Salina (Brigitte Lin), who was the criminal's secretary, went to the mall and began stealing the evidence of the crimes of crime from her computer, and was about to hand over to Chan. The murderer, however, knew Salina withdrew its incriminating data and hired her followers to capture her. Later, Chan appeared on the scene and began fighting with all the followers and defeated them one by one. On the last scene, Chan saw the crime. And finally, this is the best action and comedy movie. Everyone should look at it. Highly recommended.
