A masterpiece of comedy, a masterpiece of horror, a masterpiece of romance, if there is anything negative about the Chinese spirit story, it might be that the special effects look like modern technology. The film has a simple premise: a poor collector of debt must remain in a remote area while trying to gather debt. Of course, it's also scary. What I did not expect for the first time when I saw this movie is that it's one of the most loving stories I've ever seen; it is without losing any slapstick comedy that will have you in the stitch. Unlike some Asian cinema films, the Chinese story about the spirit is not hard to swallow for those who are not proficient in Chinese culture. In fact, he plays on timeless, helpless topics paranormal and romance. Think of Evil Dead 2 if they brought a wonderful love story to the mix. This movie is real, even though many people overlook it. It's absolutely one of the best I've ever seen. It's the ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres and to cross cultural boundaries to enjoy people everywhere, nothing is fantastic. We highly recommend 10/10.
