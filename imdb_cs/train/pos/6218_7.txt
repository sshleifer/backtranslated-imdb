79/100. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have never done anything but great movies. Although it is not one of their best, it is an excellent musical instrument. There are some excellent musical numbers, good support from Randolph Scott. Two remarkable performances, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, make an unforgettable premiere on screen. The ball is especially good and a blonde. "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of the best musical duo numbers. Harriet Hilliard, better known as Harriet Nelson from "Ozzie and Harriet" plays Ginger Roger's sister. The basic plot is quite well known, but with exceptional occupancy it works. Outstanding artistic direction and score.
