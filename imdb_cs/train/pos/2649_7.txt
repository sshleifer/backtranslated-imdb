Walking with the cave guests guest Alec Baldwin is a look at all the hominids (that's us!) The species of the last 5 million years: who they were, how they looked and how they lost. Along with a very interesting scientific insight into the information we have about these species, we also go with cave people to explore what makes us human. I waited a few weeks to look at it, and I was not disappointed.
