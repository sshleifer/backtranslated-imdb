Without Kirsten Miller, this project may not be completed. However, with respect to the beauty and talent that Miss Miller is, I would definitely recommend her. It seemed as if the other actors played only for her strong performance. Wagner's unfortunate attempt to honor this film was a bit of disappointment, but his few scenes did not get away from having fun. Mostly I have criticism in the field of writing and rendering, a set of talents have done a heroic job of rescuing what was to be a disaster. Miller's charismatic deliveries and timing were impeccable and credible. He plays the fine line between the assertive and the boss, but never insulting that he is in fact the designer he claims to be. I wish I could see it on the big screen, but unfortunately I was lucky to have rented it before it was lost.
