Previously, the bad "Slaughterhouse Five" was the best. But this adaptation of the "Mother of the Night" screen is very true to the book and preserves the intention of comedy, mystery, and tragedy. Fortunately, it was not Hollywood or idiot, and the movie "Breakfast Master". Another good thing about this movie is that you do not have to be acquainted with the book that would follow her (as I think you are doing for Slaughterhouse Five). Probably this is true of Breakfast of Champions, but they did the wrong job that you were better off when you just read a book and did not see the movie! Nick Nolte has done a great job in this film.
