As a child, I loved computer animation, although it was extremely limited, and the tools almost did not exist. This film, when I was amazed and watched amazing pictures and almost hypnotic music, created in me the desire to create moving things in the computer. It's a full-trade deal, between music and video, which really packs one or two punches. If you know a child who wants to engage in computer animation, it MUST be. <br /> <br /> Still, almost 20 years later, I'm watching this movie as one of my top 3 favorites. I think the originality is still insurmountable by the majority of today's McMovies that Hollywood spits out. At the moment I want to see if I can do it again. if imitation is the most real form of flattery, then this film deserves TON imitation =)
