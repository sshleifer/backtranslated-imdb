I find it a deeply funny dark comedy. Brosnan is a genius; as someone seduces it, must not be in the role of bonds. Kinnear was as charismatic and entertaining as anybody could be in the role. I do not know if I laughed so hard with every movie! What unexpected pleasure! My favorite line would be "I feel like a bangkok prostitute on Sunday after the navy arrived in the city." Brosnan added this very unstoppable line of such unexpected comedic finesse. I was also very impressed with the performance of Hope Davis. Everyone in this movie seems to have split up from their previous work to such an extent that it has really improved comedy. If you like the dark and jolly 'The Weather Man', you'll want to. <br /> <br /> I voted 10.
