A cheerful, inspiring, confusing, brilliant film. It reminds me Bunuel's L'Age D'Or or Jodorow Svat√° Hora - lots of strange characters who are moving and looking ... what is it? I laughed almost all the way, watching attentively the confused and sometimes horrified reactions of the spectators who surrounded me in the theater. Fun and walks from the beginning to the guts and poisoned guts to the end if it was over. I'd just like to remember every detail. Sometimes he pursues me. <br /> <br /> Honestly, but I have only the most remarkable memories of this movie. Since it does not seem possible to take home and watch, I assume I will have to wait a few more years until Crispin Glover comes back with his Big Slide Show (and the screening "What's That?") ... I made this film in Atlanta almost immediately after I got involved in a somewhat devastating car accident, so I was slightly dazed at that time, which was perhaps a very good state of mind when I watched prophetic talking arthropods and retarders superhero costumes and divine Glover in his in a suitable environment where small girls protruding from the floor like the wonderful damp dream of DADAist. Is this a statement about life, how do we know it? Of course, everyone EXPECT that it is. Rather, I think the truth is more apparent in absence and in negative space. What you do not tell us is what we have to conclude, but it is much more valid than the lies that other people give us daily. Rather one "What is it?" than 5000 films such as "Titanic" or "Sleepless in Seattle" (shock, gag, groan). <br /> <br /> Thank you, Mr. Glover (in addition to the fun - smart, fun, unpredictable and terribly hot). Create more movies, write more books, keep the nightmare alive.
