I was lucky to see Zero Day last night. It's an amazing movie. This is very worrying. <br /> <br /> In a sense, Zero Day is very similar to "The Blair Witch Project". It's a complete shot with pocket camcorders. They are about 2 children. Just your average children. Andre and Calvin. They are starting a campaign against this college called "Army 2". The whole story is narrated in the Video Diary from two children. It shows relationships with parents, among other people who show that they are normal children, as well as people we know about or who have come to the market. We found that the Second Army's Second Army would be eligible for Zero Day. They plan to shoot there college. You see how they get to the gun, how they plan, everything. They emphasize that the media has not affected them at all, and there is no reason to do so. As I said, it's all said in the Video Diary format and then puts the tapes into a safe box that can be seen after Day Zero. Current photography is displayed through Survillence Cameras throughout the school. Cooling really. The film is very cold. Some of the things that say how they plan, you should just see for yourself. One quote that I remember is the only time Calvin is alone. He says that "Andre thinks he leaves a car escape and does it in many schools across the country. I do not know what he means, but the only way I got out of school is in a black plastic bag" <br /> <br /> I'm probably not even giving you guys the right idea of ​​this movie. You really need to see them yourself. Today it's happening around the festivals. <br /> <br /> A +.
