Hrm - I think the line came from old movie posters. This is a stupid film that seems to be translated from a language that was completely unknown to the translator. Here's a tip: Any movie that starts with a black screen and the text "In the future ..." will be fun. That means the assumption is so unlikely that it has to explain to you. In this case, "In the future ..." means that instead of fighting wars, the nations boys climb to huge robots, and they know that it's never horribly clear, but it's probably something really important. There are good guys (obviously capitalists, ie "We") and bad guys (Commies!) And there are great stopping robots. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the budget for the effects was quite slim, not to see a lot of big robots. There are lots of inexpensive interior scenes, and then a large combat space near the end. The cosmic struggle is particularly nice because it serves an insignificant purpose other than a blow to the rest of an effective budget. <br /> <br /> With the money you spend now, the climate fight degenerates into (and I will not do this) two boys who beat each other with the sticks. I can always laugh at the bar by re-starting the final scene, complete with the last line to ensure that no audience will scratch the heads. <br /> <br /> As I said-it's stupid. That's why I bought a cassette.
