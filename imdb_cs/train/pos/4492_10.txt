but I would like to say that I disagree more with Moir. <br /> <br /> What a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> I thought about it this morning, I would like to advise some drugs who have lost money on their debit card by scam and wanted to say "keep money in my pocket" and I realized I was talking like James Mason. I tho he did not say these words, I still think it will be! I never forgot, "Do you?" in his reconciliation with his son, Hywel Bennet: "You always have money in your pocket!" Good advice. <br /> <br /> Insufficient children have fathers with such unwavering but well-meaning attitudes. Or father. <br /> <br /> It would be good if we renewed 'you', 'you' and 'your' in our language to show us that it matters to us. It is the same as "tutoyer" in French or "du" in German. <br /> <br /> Appendix: I just realized that many of my notes were about James Mason at The Family Way! <br /> <br /> I think that's because I mixed Susan George with Hayley Mills. Well, an easy mistake. I stand for comments. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>
