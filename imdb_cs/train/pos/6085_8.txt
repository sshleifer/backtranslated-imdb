Critics are stupid. This movie is fun and smart. I loved this film a lot. Why everyone hates this movie so much. I wish people loved this movie more than they did not. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are real comics and do a lot of work to make this movie. I do not see people doing movies like them. So people should just watch and not comment. I like this movie. It's all right. Some components were when it was stupid, but at least they did. Jerry Stiller would love it because this film has acting as well as King of Queens show. But it's better than this. I can not believe it was so low.
