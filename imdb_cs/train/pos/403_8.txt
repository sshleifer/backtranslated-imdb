I remember the trailer Legend of Zu was quite impressive and it was a fan of Hero Hero (my favorite time), Storm Riders I decided I had to watch this. I know there's a way of shouting at Ekin Cheng's acting ability everywhere, but he's my favorite Hong Kong moviestar so far (no better than Nicolas Tse anyway), and it's one of the factors I liked. Undoubtedly, this film is an artwork from beginning to end. I even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was created by the computer until the end of the movie. He has a lot to do, and he deserves a good credit. The story of the film was a fairy tale between good and evil, in which a love story emerged (I think Ekin Cheng makes girls easy). The story is not too intellectual and deep, but that's not what you expect when watching an action movie. I wanted to fight martial arts with fists and fists instead of fighting magic skills, but that's life and it's never the way you want. And why did they sound like supersonic aircraft in battle in the sky? That's too fun. The legend of Zu can not be called a hero in my eyes, but it's like a video game, and that's not a bad thing at all. If the company decides to publish games on this movie, I will not be surprised to see it as it carries all the elements of the video game. Good work. Please do more fantastic movies like this one
