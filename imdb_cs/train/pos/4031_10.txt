I have been a Hindu film fan since 4 years, but I have never watched such a moving and intrusive film, especially as a Hindu film, in my life. In recent years, I have stopped watching the current Hindi films and have returned to watching classics (Teesri Kasam, Mere Huzoor, Madhumati, Mother India, Sholay, etc.). But this movie changed everything. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I found out that she was not only moving but also considered highly educated for someone who was the first generation of an Indian woman growing up in America. It helped me understand my own family history, which was always very abstract for me. But to "see" it, to feel it and to understand that it helped me to sympathize with generations ahead of me and the struggle that Indian people endured. The film has helped me to bring many aspects, especially with regard to current world events. I never thought the movie could change as I meant it before ... it was. The plot is fantastic, playing great and the direction is flawless. Two inches up!
