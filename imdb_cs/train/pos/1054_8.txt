If you want soulless action, hot chicks and postapocalyptic outlook on Seattle, then it's a show for you! The Dark Angel concept is nothing new (in fact, there is a controversy about whether James Cameron stole this idea from a book), but I spend the whole hour watching her every Tuesday from start to finish. Jessica Alba smokes and Max's friends (the original Cindy, Kendra) are just a shot. <br /> <br /> Battle scenes are accelerating, but the dialogues between Original Cindy and Max have to be a bit better (slang sounds forced and sounds like someone living in the suburbs, he wrote it). /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Dark Angel is a big guilty pleasure filled with anything an action fan might ask, but if you're looking for a hard hit, award-winning drama, check out the "The West Wing" or something.
