I own this film and for several years I watched him for several years after his release. Prince does not threaten us with his phenomenal acting style or anything else, he is a musician and I feel that this is what he showed here is just the best story of the story. Most of this film is straightforward and adolescent, but it's the fault of directors / writers, it's still a great movie with even better music. The principles and moral convictions of Purple Rain are quite strong, and if more films were based on the basics we taught as young children, we should have a better environment because we see that art reflects a life that reflects art.
