He insisted that the inspirational spirit of Martin Luther King is based not only in American civil liberties, but within the hearts and minds of people everywhere, Danish leader Niels Arden Oplev transforms this belief into a Danish high school in 1969. More specifically, he goes to the crusade of a young boy called Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) against his oppressing and brutally abusive director Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Adapted to the real story, performances are performed with a certain aplomb, and a refreshing command over its various characters keeps it. The battle of ideologies between a 13-year-old and a demented disciplinarian gives way to inherent humor, but clumsy shifts in mood depression, even though it is cleverly cynical in the same spirit as "the Society of Dead Poets" more than "Matilda." He's going through a well-known journey, but continued and accurate service to a young protagonist, including a personal subplot that portrays Frity as a young boy who becomes a young man, can lift the film into an exciting family-friendly film with his nose right on the money.
