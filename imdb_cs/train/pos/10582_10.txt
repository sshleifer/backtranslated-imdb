She has singing. My drama. She has a comedy. He has a story. It's one of the biggest movies ... If you can not enjoy this movie, you have to be either sleeping or some sort of mental disorder. In "Yankee Doodle Dandy" James Cagney sings and dances his way to the Oscar; but in this movie it's better! This is James Cagney at his bizarre BEST! It's fast with one-shot lines! He's fast with his feet! It's a 24-hour event. Songs and dancing are classics, especially "Shanghai Lil". And the supporting cast is great; and the whole movie is optimistic, moves quickly and radiates confidence. Even though this film was shot more than 70 years ago, it is still observable today. And of course, this movie features Miss Ruby Keeler (who was married to Al Jolson). He's a perfect partner for James Cagney ... and Dick Powell too! If you like optimistic, fast movies, with a lot of singing and dancing, this movie is being watched.
