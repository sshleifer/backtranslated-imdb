I read an article about Dan Jansen's Olympic and personal journey before I saw this movie. I am always interested in the story of hope and overcoming life-changing events, and that was no exception. The background of the characters that are provided gives you the feeling that the family is close and how they are positively influenced by the lives of others. I can not talk about the precision of particular details in this movie, it's usual that you get a creative license when organizing the script. However, the spirit of Dan and his family is important here. His valuable film about the story that should be solved. I felt the empathetic character of the character, and at the end I was excited.
