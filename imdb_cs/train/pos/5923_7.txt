The Cat-Hating Woman (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved to a small town and have to deal with an average teacher (Glenn Shadix), their incestuous relationships, a beautiful girl (MÃ¤dchen Amick) and a hell of a big secret. Well, so technically it's a "bad movie". But who cares? It's so fun! <br /> <br /> Impossible things (including corn) are happening, people are scared of cats, they are bad unicorns, too many cheeses! You will enjoy it. Many. It will not move you, touch you, scare you, or excite you, but you will have fun and laugh!
