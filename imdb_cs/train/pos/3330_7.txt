In this film I was not just extra, I had to see him in Boston on a sold-out cinema. More than a thousand Boston Red Sox / Farrelly fans buried in the cinema near Boston Common to watch the comedy ... about them ... Red Sox fanatics! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon star is this cute comedy about love and lust. Love is between two young lovers. The demand for the Red Sox is to win the World Series. Although Fallon is not a great actor, he is the best actor for the role. He's pretty fun and laughs most. Barrymore, on the other hand, is the same old Barrymore. Sometimes I felt that supporting actress Ione Skye would be a better actor for this role. Overall, all fans of Boston Red Sox will love this movie. For the rest of the world, it's just a fun movie.
