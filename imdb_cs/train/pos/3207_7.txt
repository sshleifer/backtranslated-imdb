Of course, according to any normal standard of film criticism, Soldier is really a very poor film. Kurt Russell is a futuristic super soldier who was born since birth to kill, but then became obsolete after being upgraded by a bunch of really super soldiers on the dangle hoop ruck, which looks a bit like a Gladiators competition without a parachute. <br /> <br /> Abandoned on an unsolicited planet, the hippies community teaches him about gardening, family life, and breasts. Kurt is not talking much. Ultimately, the super soldiers are lifting and killing the hippies by shooting them behind their backs as they run. Kurt is angry and kills everyone. The planet is all. End. <br /> <br /> If the Academy does not launch a new "Best Blast" category, Soldier will not win any prizes. However, just as absurd, it remains a pleasant experience. Military hardware is the youngest of foreigners (APC in particular), and after 90 minutes it is not welcome. Please note that the tag below is only a guide.
