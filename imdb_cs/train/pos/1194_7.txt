The film focuses mainly on bullying Robert Taylor as a ruthless buffalo hunter and the people who have to deal with him. Set in the middle of a hunt for a falling number of buffaloes, it marks the end of a tragic era of meaningless defeat and is full of drama and remorse for buffalo and native Americans. Taylor is blinded by his hatred of Indians and his naivety that the buffalo herds will never disappear. In one scene, he shoots the beast for the animal, while in another he kills the Indians, and then he eats the food they cook for their fire. Below this ruthless exterior lies an uncertain man who is forced to ask his friends (Stewart Granger, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn) not to leave him. It's not the most enjoyable movies and it's considered the drama it creates, which leads to a deep and very appropriate conclusion in the blizzard.
