An excellent story about youth, leaders, football "stars" in high school. How far will you protect your friends? Lie, will I kill? How much can you lose when you study an innocent girl? Can I love to beat my chances? Can you defeat narrow-minded people from small towns? When your friend scores and "looses", do you do everything in your power to pay for it or do you respect that and respect her right to choose? Will you rape her and show her as her victory over the "troubled" girl? Can you stay with who is just sin, have your own opinion, be able to decide for yourself, choose for yourself? I've been thinking twice that I've decided who's right and who's wrong, but sure - a very worrying film and the topic in general. Thumbs up!
