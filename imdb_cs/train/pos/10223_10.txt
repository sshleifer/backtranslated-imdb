* some spoilers * <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised to find that harsh criticism (acting, dated dialogue, unclear story) is unjustified. Belafonte is great as a Brando, threatening, stern ghost who has to earn his wings, but he is really poorly equipped in his past life. They learn too late how empty, material life was without love. Mostel is also great as an anxious man with his dying wife Fanny. Despite his prayers for the miracle, his bitterness prevents him from accepting (or believing) one. The two social worlds they represent alternate and complement the other. The result is a sad and sad sadness. The sad end is actually quite compatible with the rest of the film. Looking at everywhere at Belafonte, Mostel looks up to see the falling pen, and he furiously comes to him as if he is finally willing to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte could not complete his miracle (either to restore the health of Fanny or Mostel's faith), so he never had wings. Pen is flying from Mostel's grasp, a metaphor for both men: it's late and you have no second chance. Like "It's a wonderful life," this movie is magical, amazing, fun, but terribly tragic.
