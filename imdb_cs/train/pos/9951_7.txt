If you've ever wondered why they're doing porn, watch Dream Quest. On the one hand, you must obey Armstrong for making the effort to use this idea and using such a strong adult occupation to gain some power. On the other hand, it also quickly becomes clear why most portions never have more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialogue that connects sexual scenes together. These people simply can not act (and the story is, unfortunately, lame to ridiculous). Still, I gave him 7 because it was a nice test and it did not seem like a lot of effort to lower the corners. I'd also like to see other attempts like this one. Maybe someday I'll see the perfect combination of porn and plot.
