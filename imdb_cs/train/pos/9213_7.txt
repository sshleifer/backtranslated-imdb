Gomez Pereira is responsible for some of the most used comedies of the latest Spanish cinema (just look at his biography), so I did not expect so many "Cosas Que Hacen ..." ... In fact, I do not know why he decided to follow the world. Anyway, I did ... And what a surprise. It looks like Gomez Pereira eventually arrived and now he is able to make a good movie. It's the last job that deals with the middle age crisis, disappointing and searching for the second chance after you've destroyed everything. The last half-hour movie (the more dramatic) is the best part, and it's just worth watching the movie. We also have the lead role of Eduard Fernandes and I still think he is the best actor of his generation (by far). <br /> <br /> * My Rank: 7/10
