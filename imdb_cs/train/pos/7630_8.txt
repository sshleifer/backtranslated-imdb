Kurt Russell, whose career began when he kicked REAL Elvis in It Happened at the World Trade Fair, will probably never overcome his performance as King in this biopic helmed slash and shock by Meister Carpenter. Sometimes you have the feeling that you are watching Elvis until something comes back to reality ... perhaps the memories of the unfortunate Don Johnson in Elvis and the Queen of Beauty? All the performances are excellent: Hubley Season as Priscilla, Pat Hingle as Colonel, even Shelley Winters brings the right level of nerves and hystory to her rendering Momma Presley. <br /> <br /> Kurt's Dad Bing plays Elvis's father, Vernon, and there's a pretty understated performance from Robert Gray as Elvis's friend and bodyguard Red West. <br /> <br /> They have to see rock n roll fans.
