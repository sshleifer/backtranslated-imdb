Although some may call it the "Paradiso Cuban Cinema," the film is closer to How Green Was My Valley, a memorial film sad for lost innocence. The film cleverly avoids getting into the political trap of the party (pro-Castro? Anti-Castro, focusing instead on the human fragility of the character and the importance of the family.) A very good acting act, especially from the Mexican actress Diana Bracho, who plays Keite's wife, a masterpiece full of classic films, from CASABLANCA to Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS, Gael Garcia Bernal plays a small role that is critical to the dramatic payout of the story. to play (remember OAKs?), plays a homeless who acts great like a Greek chorus. It is a pity that this film, originally called DREAMING OF JULIA, was released in THINKfilm states with the terrible name CUBAN BLOOD, which has nothing to do with the movie.
