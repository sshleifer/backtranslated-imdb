After watching Arthur on TV, I laughed so many times that Dudley Moore's role as Arthur, a lucky bowed drunk millionaire, was hysterical, but John Gielgud as his servant / father figure Hobson was just as charming. I bought the DVD a few weeks ago and watched it, despite the pasta for almost 27 years, is still as enjoyable as anytime Liz Minnelli's role, since interest in love fascinated chemistry between the two. /> Arthur Bach, (Moore) is a spoiled drunk millionaire who has a bank account that reads as a national debt that has no desire to grow up and loves to behave like a child. His activity is controlled by his English-speaking buttress Hobson (Gielgud), and Arthur seems to like him, except that Arthur's father (Barbour) offers an ultimatum if he can not get married to a terrible blonde Susan Johnson (Eikenberry) in four weekly cut off her son's inheritance for $ 750 million. Arthur, however, meets Linda Marolla's love (Minnelli) with a young waitress and murderous thief, now facing a difficult decision to marry for love or money. When Hobson dies, Arthur finally grows up and breaks up with Susan before the wedding and lets him keep both his money and his true love. Arthur is a really charming romantic comedy for everyone
