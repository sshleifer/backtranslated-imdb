when I saw the ads for this I was thinking "No what NICK has to do on NITE!" because it dealt with the "fresh prince". Well, I still love a fresh prince. but George Lopez is a surprisingly good show. I love how stereotypical Benny is not. Carmen is a pretty good figure, it's really funny to see how silly and oversold can ever be. I feel bad for the one who plays the max, looks much younger than he is! but max is a funny figure and it worked well. and yeah, angie is a bit stereotypical, but she has her funny moments. ha ha george has a big head! but it can also be really good. fun show! there should definitely be more home improvement.
