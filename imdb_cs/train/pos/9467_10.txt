I was attracted to DAN IN REAL LIFE from excellent reviews and dramatic thirst that was well written - thank you Peter Hedges - and because when Steve Carell plays in the movie, you know the audience will find it as in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, a performance that is very fun and rewarding. DAN IN REAL LIFE delivered this promise. The film is so real with many families all over the world who have lost a member and yet have gone out with their lives by seeking something that gives them magic back before their loss. With Steve Carell and the brilliant Juliette Binoche, their relationship was so beautifully executed and written that their scenes were so real to their characters and their ways. Cast, assemblies and stories from DAN IN REAL LIFE we remember when we go on holiday.
