Pet Semmen (1989) 9/10 The Creed family has just moved to the town of Ludlow. The family consists of father, Louis, mother, Rachel, brother Gage and daughter Ellen. Jud Crandall is grateful to her. Jud is 89 and can basically tell you about Ludlow's entire history. Behind the new house of Creed's House is the road leading to the domestic cemetery (written by pet sematary). When Ellen wants to go upstairs to see her, Jud certainly took his family for a trip. This is the beginning of hell for the Creed family. <br /> <br /> When Rachel and the kids are gone, Ellen's cat dies. Jud thinks that Ellen is not ready for the death of her cat, and suggests that Louis follow him along the road, around the pet cemetery. Jud tells Louis about this burial site, the Micmac Indians. Louis buries the church without Judah's help. A few days later the church returns alive, but from hell. This movie was one of two horror films that could scare me except "The Exorcist." The greatest performance would ever be Zelda, Rachel's spinal meningitis nurse or Victor Pascow, a ghost who is trying to help believe I make a mistake to return things from the dead. the film plays an extravagant part. It's both sad and mysterious. It's a great movie. <br /> <br /> 9/10
