I have a six month old baby at home and in the long run she is struggling to sleep really badly. One morning it was particularly difficult to fall asleep when a dark song of the noodles bop appeared in the TV. She stopped crying almost instantly and was satisfied for the rest of her performance. I sat in her bouncing seat and watched her legs kick her, swinging her arms and actually laughing at this show. She kept having fun and happy all the time. I also got a video from them, so at the time of my little jammer, I have something to calm down. I admit late in the night when she wakes up with a bunch to make the doodle bops unleashed, it's not her cup of tea, but it will be useful if I need a little time for homework, etc. The biggest surprise about the pacifier bop is that my baby she does not even watch TV She preferred to play in the floor with a toy or a little toy poodle before watching the TV, but the noodles bops took full notice of her. I do not know if they will still like it, but it is still connected.
