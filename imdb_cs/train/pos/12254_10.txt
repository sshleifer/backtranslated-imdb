I saw this movie after watching Paltrow's version. I found out that one is very good and I thought it would not be so good ... but I was wrong: the British version was much better and fun! I found Jeremy Northam more "enjoyable" than Mark Strong, but I can say that Strong catches much better Knightley Austena. Anyway, both versions are good, but anyone who loved Austen's books should watch this movie. I agree with the challenge *: Andrew Davies has changed a few things but still remains true to the original. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 <br /> <br /> My 2 cents!
