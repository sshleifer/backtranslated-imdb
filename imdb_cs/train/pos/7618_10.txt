Hi: <br /> <br /> I heard about the loss from a coworker who had obvious differences in the view of the fun, he loved it. Well I've been watching the episode or 2 in the early seasons and it was boring, so I tuned it up. After a few years I came across the lost; bored with contemporary science fiction fares. Wow I'm surprised. You can say gravity well, I swell damn in. The pace and scripting are very good, some of the flashes forward / backward are so with laser figures, but above all good ones. Among the popular characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond and Jack's father. Jack and Michael are definitely immature, very corrupt and immature. Kate 1 step above them, Julie was much smarter than Kate. Mr. Eko was underestimated and Charlie's level, if not more, so badly that both of them died. A man dressed in black talk with Jacob (back) is a real curiosity. Overall, great, very layered series: looking for more. <br /> <br />
