"Masks" is a moving film that works on many levels. The simplest is the horrible story of a street artist who joins a small child and tries to pass on his creative art (masks) to a new generation. Though sometimes the story makes the old man work, it is so well-created (written, understood, controlled, wonderful production values), it is easy to move in its difficult situation. And if you hang with it, the film is ultimately very sweet and uplifting. Kudos all around. It's a great movie for both kids and adults. The trick is how to get Americans who may not like foreign language movies to see them!
