This movie is fantastic. Finally, well-written characters that you can love for all your good and evil. Pierce Brosnan is hysterical in this self-fulfilling role. I think it's the best he ever did. He had other roles that showed hues that they were capable of doing such full-fledged work, but this role eventually gave him room to go with it. I almost died when he walked through the hotel lobby in his underwear and boots. And Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis are both trying to strive as well as actors to strive. Kinnear is so ominous that his turn at the end is really delightful. You give good actors a good job with which you play and give us something more.
