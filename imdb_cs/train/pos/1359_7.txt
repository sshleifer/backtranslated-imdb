I work in the library and I expect this movie to be enjoyed when it was released 5 years ago. I like a lot of Parker Posey (she's a beautiful actress), and Omar Townsend was really cute as her friend (he could not act, but if you look like him who cares), but the movie was bad. It was not funny, cute or too much. Posey kept the film above the water with her energy. But she learned the Dewey Decimal System OVERNIGHT and then the book tones of the books into the rhythm of the music ?? !!!! ??? Come on! I also had a problem with what she looked like when she finally became a full-fledged librarian at the end - hair in a glass, glasses, no sense of humor - can we leave this stereotype to go? It's worth seeing for Posey and Townsend, but that's all about it. The TV series was much better.
