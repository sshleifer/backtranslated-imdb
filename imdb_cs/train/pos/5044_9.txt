Bill Paxton plays and controls this very original film. When I first watched how cool I was. The views I heard were all right. As a result, I expected the average thriller to a maximum. However, due to Paxtons's superior direction and playing film it is well worth watching, especially if you are horror movie fanatic.The film is also helped plot conspiracies that continue coming to the final credits. The film's strongest point is a story that I have to say is very original and it's like I've ever seen. Well done also by two young leaders who perfectly communicate emotions if they are confused by the boys. I'm giving this movie 9/10 and I strongly recommend that everyone capture it.
