Kafka's thriller of theft and paranoia. Extremely well executed and Polanskij plays as well as a dissatisfied introvert who is struggling to adapt to his cheap accommodation in Paris and his classmates. It is horrible soon because of the seemingly malicious and self-absorbing colleagues of tenants and later terrifying when it develops its defense, which will eventually be its detriment. Personally, I could do it without cross-dressing, but I agree with nodding to Psycho and the fact that it has some logic in terms of storyline. Still, it could work without removing a slightly theatrical element, but perhaps it was intended because the courtyard certainly looks like it looks out for the theater at the end. I can not help to feel that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings that he is not a "real" Frenchman and the Jewish boot. Yet there is plenty of pleasure, including a great performance from the beautiful face of Isabelle Adjani and the old old Shelly Winters as reliable as ever.
