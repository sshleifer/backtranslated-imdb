Of the three remakes of this plot, I like everything, I have all three on the VHS, plus a copy of this DVD on DVD. In scripts, there are just enough variations to make the three fun and re-traceable. In addition, does she have another movie three times performed with all those star casts in each? Of course, the main stars in this are great, but supporting actors are excellent. I really like William Tracy like Pepi. It was such a script I was looking for to find other movies in which it is. He appeared in many, but most of them are not available. Like other notes, I also say - buy this.
