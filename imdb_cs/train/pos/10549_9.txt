I just saw it at the Toronto Film Festival and I hope it gets into a wide selection because I want to see it again! It's the character of the movie, and Andrew and David are more than just a task. Any discussion of the conspiracy could be considered spoilers, so I'm just saying that the plot is smart, the acting is excellent and the effects are amazing. Well filmed and well-walked. One of the best movies I've ever seen, and this summer's very refreshing movies. All the time the audience laughed. Find out if you can. (Especially I liked the scene "Candy bar! Candy bar!").
