Bugs Bunny's great cartoon from previous years has Bugs as an artist in a window at a local department store. After doing it in a day, the manager comes to let him know that he will soon transfer. The Bugs are glad to realize that the new job is in taxidermia ... and that taxidermy has to do with the stuffing of animals. Animals like they say, a certain rabbit. This causes a struggle with the rationality between the rascally rabbit and his former employer. I found it short, beautiful and definitely one of the better ones in the early 1940s. He still remains as funny almost 60 years later. This animated short movie can be seen on Looney Tunes Golden Collection 2. <br /> <br /> My rating: A-
