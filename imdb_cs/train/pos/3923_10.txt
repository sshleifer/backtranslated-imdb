It's an amazing film, both for the incredible energy caused by flamenco's frenetic dances and for the unique way in which filmmakers blend the story of scenic production with the lives of the characters preparing for it. Spellbinding is the only word I can use to describe the experience. This is not "Bizet's Carmen" according to any usual standard. This is not a standard standard film. Every gentle look, every stomp of the leg, every piece of music is interwoven so charming that you can not take your eyes off the screen. You do not need to love opera or flamenco (I do not) to be captured, enchanted, enchanted by this film. Fine and straight; loud and calm; One of the best films, if not the best, is that it is so small.
