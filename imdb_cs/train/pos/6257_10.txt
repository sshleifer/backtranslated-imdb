This documentary by Marian Cooper is absolutely amazing. I saw it on the Turner Classic Movie today. I think I'll see if I order a copy on DVD. The film footage does not look blurry and disturbed as you might imagine from the silent 1925 B & W film. In 1925, the nomadic tribes in the documentary film leave their desert home and go through raging rivers, men, women, children, animals. Then go upstairs and all the Barefoot pass through the snowy breeze. It's diving or swimming and climbing or dying. In search of grass for your animals. They have cows, goats, dogs, horses, mules. In one scene, a man carries a mullet that is too sick to climb up a mountain. The children in the documentary film look happy and healthy. They had such a difficult life. I wonder if the nomadic tribes of Iran still live like this. We appreciate the modern life in the USA.
