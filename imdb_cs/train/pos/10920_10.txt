I remember seeing this movie as a child. I do not remember where I saw it. I had to be about 14 years old. I thought the movie was incredible and wished to see it again. Kung Fu came once, but I missed it. I was really bummed. It's the best movie with the special effects I've seen up to this day! I strongly recommend, and now that I find out where to get it, I can use it again and again. I also have to look at the film "Return from Venus," some of which have been so highly spoken.
