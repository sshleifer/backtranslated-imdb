Anyone who thinks is an anime is nothing but sex, and violence will be silenced forever after watching this movie. This is a great movie that tells Tetsura's attempt to avenge his mother's death but also grows in this process. Train travel most often represents Tetsurova's journey from childhood to manhood. The music and visual styles of the movie are a bit dated (you can say it's the 70th movie) and the animation is just a little better than your average "Star Blazers" episode. But the story and the characters are so strong that it does not matter. You have to look at animation fans!
