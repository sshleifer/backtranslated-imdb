I started watching The Apprentice about 4 years ago (maybe 5) and I really really enjoyed it. The first thing that appeals to you is a refreshing format that resembles a lot of other reality shows in its core, it's still very funny. Donald Trump is great as a guest and show champion as well. There is also a casting takeover with intelligent people who have a good look and are selected as contestants. But the best part of the show is New York. Mark Burnett may have done a lot of bullshit at his time, but his handling of cinematography is excellent because he makes NYC look like a figure herself. Jazz melodies along with some great camera make New York look spectacular. The disciple will make it easier to do my best 3 reality shows of all time (Amazing Race is however number 1). But as well as an amazing race, this show is always best watched with reassurance. If you look at it for a while, the original of the show is quickly worn (in the same case as in the TAR case). The Star World television station in this country has taken part in the show. The first three seasons showed up in a row, then two years later, two more seasons emerged, keeping the concept fresh. <br /> <br /> Finally, you will love this show, especially in the first two seasons. However, if you watch the show continuously, then its spell will wear out and fast.
