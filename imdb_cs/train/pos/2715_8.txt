Q.E.D. was a brilliant TV series and really was one of the few worthwhile plans! I suspect that at this time, TIVO and recording devices will be much better than it was in 1982. I'm impatiently waiting for its availability on DVD! <br /> <br /> While it is true that it has some in common with other TV shows such as Wild, Wild West, Bearcats and Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., of which I was a huge fan of QED for a lot more intellectual quality . But it did not suffice - the dialogue was funny and the action was high. The show appeared in the UK as a Mastermind and had a feel of the BBC, but with better production value than the BBC had at that time. <br /> <br /> I was a nineteen-year-old boy when this series was counted initially and she had too much time in my life to make time on television. I remember my dear mother, but he tells me he reminds me that Q.E.D. was on, and we would sit on the phone and look together. Wonderful memories. <br /> <br /> Really, Q.E.D. is a sad loss, and if it could be done with the same quality and value today, I would like to see it coming back.
