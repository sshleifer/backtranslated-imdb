It is absolutely useless to rate this movie. As if you have condemned (or praised) the newly born for your future life. Instead, look at it as a strong meditation on what could have been and what has been in the past 100 years. Eight and eight years of cinematography: what happened to the babe? I would like to think about what would (creative) happen if Europe were not interrupted twice by the great wars of XX. Century. In her ruins a false neon castle of a non-performing and reactionary circus called Hollywood. Before 1914, the French, Italian and Scandinavian cinemas had a journey both financially and creatively. In particular, the French film had some original and creative ways that could have (if not interrupted) some unpredictable change in media history. One wonders what the history of the film would look like today if it were not dimmed and touched by the business and cheap political agenda of Hollywood for 80 years or more, what could Chekhov define as nasty greed and fornication ... Whatever it may be like, at least realize that La Sortie is the key (or at least one of them) to the "kingdom". Place of birth: Cinema: Lumiere Brothers Factory, Lyon, France Date: March 19, 1895 (also a replica reel in the summer of 1895, so if you notice Summer Light and Lighter Worker Clothes: Louis Lumiere: Creative thoughts, cinematography, the direction that it's Louis's own domain because Auguste took care of the rest (money) * The first film reels were fifty seconds long: le cinematograph and cameramen (le cinematographer) have only a tiny fifty seconds to make it happen! * It seems that Le Institute Lumiere managed to preserve some 1,500 of these first films executed mostly by the Loumiere employee brigade traveling with cameras criss-crossing all over the world. *** So all stars in starry sky and a minute of silence for perhaps the most beautiful invention in the history of mankind (still).
