A very brutal crime drama by director Pou-Soi Cheang, director of Home Sweet Home. This reminded me of Billy Tang's "Run and Kill," though it's not so polished. However, it is an intriguing, bad problem of chaos about the Cambodian soldier, Pang (Edison Chen), who comes to Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. While leaving the scene, killing Sam Waiho's police partner, who adds insult to injuries, is in the middle of dealing with his dying father, so Sam is starting a mad, obsessive quest for Pang, which results in nearly ten dead bodies and relentless violence. There has to be something in the air recently, because I have never seen so many people who would have pulsated, as I have recently thought. It's terrible, ugly things, which is why I'm so partial, and applauding its gloomy atmosphere. It is visually arrested and the sound design is very unique. Dramatically everything moves downward until each character is in a world of glooming pain. A sub-plot involving Pang's attachment to a sexually abusive girl adds depth to the story and multiplies the surprising fourth act that boasts a gentle act of grotesque surgery.
