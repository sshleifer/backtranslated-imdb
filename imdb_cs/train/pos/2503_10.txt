I'm extremely picky about the movies I see. I heard about Moon the Child by accident. I've been a fan of L'Arc En Ciel for a while, and Gackt and Mizer just recently. Finally, I found that the movie was re-released and lifted it without a second thought. Being just as critical as a movie, I admit that action scenarios can sometimes be hokey ... but they think they are too, as another user has suggested, it's quintessential calm before the storm, quoting Gary Oldman of Leon ... without got into the spoilers, the movie hit me extremely hard because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are unlimited and how often they say, true friendship is loyalty and as a marriage, it's until you're dead. Hyde and Gackt present performances that demonstrate why they can make the depths of their songs, their passion for music is on the big screen, and in the process they create an exemplary film that gets into the soul of man and generates emotions. <br /> <br /> After seeing the movie for the first time, I realized she was probably going to be in a heavy rotation as far as my collection was concerned. I would like to encourage anyone reading this post to pick up a movie if you want to get away from the current Hollywood trend in the movie ... it has a whole new direction using the classic Yakuza movie elements and how you can go wrong with the Ryo Ishibashi portrait from Takashi Miike's "Audition" and "Suicide Club" fame? Man .. I just can not say enough about this movie, but I'll stop here. <br /> <br />
