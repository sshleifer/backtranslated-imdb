It was great fun! I have never read the Chester-Gould comics, but there is no need to know them. Maybe there were some inner jokes I did not find, but what the eye does not see that the heart can not sad. It's so ironic, color film and the actors are all well. The setting is similar to that of "Batman," but not as dark and gray. Okay, the story is not so original, but there is a conspiracy (which is not obvious) and a more or less surprising ending. Thanks to this movie you can play an interesting game if you follow it with your friends. Do not look at credits at the beginning and then see who is the fastest to find out who are the famous actors under their makeup!
