This movie is just too fun, completely non-PC gangster romp. If Mel Brooks took a picture of Mob in the 1930s, it would probably look like this. Too many great disposable inserts you remember, and while it's not for everyone, anyone who laughs all the time does not have a pulse. So, put it and LAUGH you Iceholes !!!
