"Mother" is an extraordinary filmmaking - it thinks you, makes no punches - and finally lets you think. Very open in terms of lead fate. Anne Reid (I just briefly knew about her performances in some projects led by Victoria Wood and thought it was a great comedy) is really great. Not a stereotypical widowed housewife who was perfect in marriage and maternity at all. And not everything that is initially carefree and adventurous. He plays his character only with the right remark that the truth will ring (well, she did). Powerful cast. Great script. The Renaissance of European Cinematography;
