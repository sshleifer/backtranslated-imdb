I like all versions of this story, but this is my favorite time. George C.Scott gives the depth of Scrooge character, which others do not give. The film shows more about why it gets worse. Changes in Scrooge are gradually appearing when they encounter the various ghosts and incidents that show him. <br /> <br /> This movie has the best Tiny Tim yet. It's the right age rather than playing someone who's almost a teenager, like in other movies. Anthony Walters still has all or most of the tooth. <br /> <br /> David Warner is great as Bob Cratchit. He is such a versatile actor. He displays a man who obviously loves his family. He plays a role with dignity or a horrible man who feels under Scrooges'thumb, but as a person who kindly gives him a job because he has a family. Susannah York and other actors do a great job that brings these characters to life. Edward Woodward is the best Spirit of the Christmas gift I've ever seen. It is most often played as the merry character of Santa. This shows anger at Scrooges attitudes and really makes Scrooge rethink. <br /> <br /> Costumes and sets really bring life to Dickens in London. Great movie.
