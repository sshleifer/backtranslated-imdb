Tell me what you want about schmaltz. One beauty of this film is that it is not pro-American. It is a morality when some Americans are called to a high purpose and how they have come to this occasion. It's inspiring because they are people of noble purpose. For me, the most interesting part of the education film is Fanny and David Farrelly (mother and brother Bette Davis). As Fanny says, "We were shaken by magnolia." In today's political climate, where the president, who lied to us and used the 9/11 to direct the absolutely worst characteristics of human beings, we sank to the level of the murderers of September 11 to seek vengeance in the blood. He can not blame Bush - after all, we let him lead us in this direction and even choose him again after his lies have been exposed. Now, with full justification, we Americans are offended all over the world. Today we are watching this film with a new awareness: that the rise in Nazi power in Germany was not caused by a defect in German nature but by a defect in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that justifies our committing immoral and abominable acts. I do not use George Bush with Adolf Hitler. But I point out how a leader can lead us to madness of terror, hatred and hyper-nationalism to make contempt. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a riot who does everything that needs to be his own agrarian, no matter how immoral he is, is most like the leaders of our country, those who support them, and those who have so deeply mastered their heads in the sand that they can not even bother voting. The film as a patrol on the Rhine reminds us of what we once wanted to be - a force for the improvement of humanity - and that we should once again strive for the noble targets in us. <br /> <br /> Geoff
