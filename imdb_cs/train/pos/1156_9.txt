Years ago I watched the soap on TV. So I was curious about this movie and I was so rewarded for finding it. It's a terrible miserable soap, jealousy, actor's insecurity, and all sorts of beautiful excesses. But more than anything else - an amazing cast and an incredible script. How did you get all the top actors to play in such a silly movie? And how did this little film get writers to write perfect lines? I have never heard of anyone talking about this movie, or even admitting it is heard, but it is amazing and I highly recommend seeing it. Sometimes I'll throw it away when I'm cleaning the house, and finally I'm sitting on the couch, watching, laughing and enjoying all the amazing things. Many congratulations to all who did it.
