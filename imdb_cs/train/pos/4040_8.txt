Innovative, exciting, claustrophobic exercise. A Japanese thriller that deserves hard work by being completely set up in two rooms. Not quite successful, but tense, surprising and well acting. One could find a movie somewhat reminiscent of SAW? two men trapped in peace and pitting against each other? but unlike this film, he dares to stay with the premise and keep the hero locked in his entirety throughout the movie. It's like watching a lab experiment. Some might find endeavor that is unusual, but this reviewer found it fascinating. The sound and images of the film are tremendously well done. This is certainly a good movie that is used to showcase a good home video system. It is true when someone in a paranoid mood is preparing for a late night film festival. I was sure she was watching me that night.
