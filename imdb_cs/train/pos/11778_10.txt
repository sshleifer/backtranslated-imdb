This series brings new information and background to the book and includes personal performances by the author and archaeologists and other anthropologists. It brings the book to life and gives even greater sense to the subsequent opus of the author, * Collapse *. The diamond itself acts as a personal and caring, not just an impartial or disconnected academic. This series clearly shows that his book was not only a response to the need to "publish or perish", as it says about the academy, but on the deeply considered answer to the question from someone he respects: "Why did you white people get so much load and we have little? "Because he respected the intelligence of the questionnaire and its community, Diamant was looking for a response that did not harm this intelligence or community. I like to think of his answer in a very simple way, in the same spirit as "South Park's" "Blame Canada": "Blame Wheat!"
