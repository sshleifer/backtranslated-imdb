"Madam of Shanghai" is well known as one of Hollywood's most troublesome productions. The original Welles section was taken by the producers and cut into ribbons. This made it even more difficult to observe the already confused mysterious story. They post dubbed a good deal of his dialogue due to the Irish accent density, and the dubbing is too obvious and badly done. The most disastrous of all, Welles and his on-screen and real life lead lady Rita Hayworth have disintegrated in their relationship and their crazy chemistry comes on screen. Fortunately, it all overcomes the fantastic direction of Orson Welles. The film makes it incredibly slim and atmospheric - every scene seems to be breathing back from the screen. Also, characters and scenes are so bizarre that they border on a dream and unreal. This sense of strangeness highlights the scenes that are often found in these films, such as the courtroom sequence in the middle. I usually find dramas in the courtroom, but Welles' direction and special expressions make them as fascinating as anything else. The end of the carnival almost reminds David Lynch. <br /> <br /> Acting is also very good. In spite of their failure, Welles and Hayworth give good performance - but their interactions are a bit short. Everybody else is beautiful and beautiful, but especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. The "Lady of Shanghai", of course, has problems, but it's worth watching just to see one of the film masters at his best. (8/10)
