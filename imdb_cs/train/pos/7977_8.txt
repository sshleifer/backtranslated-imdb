In fact, the film could be one of the most enchanting titles of one of two Scott (Ridley and Tony). Do it straight, the movie deserves your humor as one of the most stylish action / thriller ever. As for dissatisfied tragic heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts really make the ideal duo. Both movies and Deja Vu are better thrillers you can expect. Washington really felt very well in blurred cameras and in all the scenes in the movie. One could easily be associated with the emotions of his character, so they enjoyed all the murders on the road. It's a success that they created the super-dark city of Mexico with lots of shit happening. One would be easily convinced of the extent of corruption outlined in Man On Fire. I do not know what the Mexicans would think when they watch this ...... <br /> <br /> Well, let's go again. It's one of the best genres of Death Wish, but it also suffered from a lot of violence. It's a little uncomfortable to justify the vigilante action by making the film very realistic and letting Denzel Washington play the tragic hero of the "missing sheep." Finally, they even let the hijacker shoot in his own pool as a document. I was exploring IMDb if the film was based on real events for it ... So it is for your attention if you also find that the movie theme is a little fake. <br /> <br /> In the end, I hope the movie will not be real. <br /> <br /> 8/10 for artistic direction / editing / cinematographic / Denzel Washington.
