The riveting drama written by William Mastrosimone, based on his stage play, in which Farrah Fawcett plays Marjorie, attacked in his car on the rapist Joe (James Russo). She can get away, but police tell her she can not do anything. But he realizes that Joe has got his wallet and knows where he lives. When her mother Pat (Alfre Woodard) and Terry (Diana Scarwid) are at work, Joe visits her to finish what he has started. After Joe degrades and decomposes her in a variety of ways, she gets a chance to strike and imprison him. She knew she was in a different situation of her "word against yours" and that no rape had been made technically, she did not intend to tolerate until Pat and Terry had admitted what his intentions were. <br /> <br /> The film eventually represents a conflict between two opponents. In addition, Marjorie shows such ruthlessness that one must be interested in not becoming as fearless as her nemesis. Fawcett does a lot of good work while Russo is really great as a spoiled creep who does everything to handle the situation. With just two characters on the screen for most of the time, the film has an intimate nature, which suggests it will work even better on stage. Director Robert M. Young must not avoid the worst and exploiting elements of the situation; the movie becomes annoying watching occasionally. And at a time when Marjorie has the upper hand, things are changing so much that it is no longer so easy to encourage her to go to blood, and hopes that Pat will see her. "Extremity," I felt, was a pretty good film that at least kept interest and quite high intensity. Woodard and Scarwid are both in support (Scarwid has a great time when Terry reveals himself as a victim of rape) and the pace is consistent. The dialog is not always very sharp, but the material is convincing at every step. <br /> <br /> 8/10
