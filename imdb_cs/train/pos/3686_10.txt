Diane and I have seen this fantastic film today in Fremantle, and we both agreed that it was head and shoulders over the others from pastic movies. I say this because we were amazed by the short five to ten minute segments of the film and the fact that this film had a theme around which each piece was composed and of course the subject is love in many forms. > <br /> It seems that the film was playing in different Paris districts, giving each segment a special flavor. When I was several times in Paris, I was not sufficiently informed to know places, but I'm sure Europeans and especially French people can easily recognize cities. In any case, the viewer is instantly drawn into each story because of their production perfection, so these cities are lost to the consequences. The movie moves quickly and the viewer stays absorbed by one scenario while the new one is on the screen. The stories themselves are not graphic like hollywood nonsense, they are subtle and thoughtful and gentle like most of their lives, without the media that destroys so much vivid beauty under the nearest shabby hall, it only sells, sells. sell ... <br /> <br /> Go with someone you care about and let this magical little movie bath as a spa treatment and when you leave my estimate you will feel restored.
