It seemed that at the beginning only another introverted French film appeared to me, offering me more than just frantic sentiments, and in the second look, really, indeed, quite a satisfying presentation. <br /> <br /> <br /> he probably did not know what hit him. Bad audience; we were initially caught in what looked like a truly beautiful and romantic story just to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch. These two guys just did not belong together since the first ambiguous meeting. Just as Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other, the absence of deeper emotional attachment made it impossible for Mathieu, the intellectual being, to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensitivity was more attuned to carnival festivities and romps to the beach. <br /> <br /> On a purely technical note, I loved the camera action in this movie. The titles were totally useless, though my French is "friendly." I could track it again without annoying translation in English and enjoy it even more. It was a polished, very professionally filmed movie. Although many scenes seem unnecessary, I measure nine out of ten.
