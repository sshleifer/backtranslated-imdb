If you have trouble stopping your mistrust, then it is not for you. Consider: a woman in the late middle age will find a newborn baby in cabbage and pick it up as her own. Think about it; she does not try to find a mother who might be a confused teenager who needs medical care, and no one in the Italian equivalent of social services seems to make any effort to give the child "care" (no social services - you know it's fantasy) . Before you know it, young This is about ten, and his adoptive mother dies and leaves him to an orphanage from which the HAPPY man appears who loves everyone. He did not just give his suitcase to a man who stole him from him, but he organized local homeless people into the bona fide Shantytown people, for example, led them in the struggle against capitalism in the form of a merchant who bought the land on which Shantytown stands when it was discovered there Petroleum. It wants some swallowing without the subsequent "miracles" beginning with this dead mother (the old lady who lifted him rather than her biological) who appeared to him and handed him a dove that doubles like a magic wand and allows him to give modest Wishes and a finale in which hobos cast in a better place probably somewhere over the rainbow. On the other hand, the film is here with Charm and it's easy to surrender. To balance a small masterpiece.
