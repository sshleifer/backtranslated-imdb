"Against all flags" is every bit of a classic swashbuckler. She has all the elements a fan of adventure can hope for, and even more so, a girl in need is, well, she is not safe. As Spitfire Stevens, Maureen O'Hara is in her best athletic race, which inflicts on her enemies in violation of the social norms of that period. Anthony Quinn captures the first three acting actors as ruthless captain Roc Brasiliano and proves he is a smart and capable anger for Brian Hawke (Flynn). For classic adventure fans, "Anti Flags" is needed. While it may not be in quite the same league as some of Errol Flynn's earlier works (Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk, for example), it's still a very fun story.
