Whatever you do in your life, you must never forget that you have roots. It's a story of true facts that have been created into a beautiful and moving movie! I really like to say that this film is underestimated. This shows the reality of life ... the more the evil surrounds you, the better you become. Increase your instincts and realize that the ideal of life is to live happily ... without hatred without living "under the rock". The film concept is much more interesting ... it combines storytelling with events in real life ... keeps us aware of everything from facts to emotions! Bless these people and all the happy ones! You see, I recommend it to all the young people. It's not about racism, it's about how to live your life!
