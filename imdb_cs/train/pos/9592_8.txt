This movie came out 12 years ago and was even revealing to people who knew something from the New York scene. In the textbooks, nothing is said about these voguechov√© houses. Anthony Slide's "big fake" does not say anything. Julian Fleisher "Drag Queens of New York: illustrated guides" with his evolutionary diagram of influence that pulls Julian Eltinge, Minette, Warhol Queen and 90's club scene - and postdates the film - ignores the houses completely. Even Laurence Senelick's "The Changing Room" - the closest thing we have to the definitive book on the move, is quickly passing around the movie and does not provide background information that would expect it. <br /> <br /> From the film itself, I understand the various articles I've found on the web that this house system has been going on for decades. The main film performance of a member of the house before 1990 appears to be Chrystal La Beija in "The Queen", 1968. The historical context is the largest missing part of "Paris is burning". The movie is valuable because it focuses on the scene otherwise ignored. It is a valuable film of life in 1989. The unfortunate fact that Venus Xtravaganza was murdered during filming provides a very dramatic end, but it is not the only film about transsexuals that would involve murder in real life. As we already know, Dorian Corey had a mummified corpse in a literal cabinet, but it did not appear until three years later. Historical importance, but we still need someone to create a book or documentary that provides more context.
