An excellent cute film with Peter Falk and Paul Reiser combines forces like father and father. My father appears in the evening and claims that after more than 40 years of marriage, Mom has left her (Olympia Dukakis). /> <br /> The rest of the movie shows father and son for a day trip to get ideas on what happened. With them, daughters can play detectives. The story shows the adventures of father and son in their discussion of life, what was supposed to be, why my mom complained to my father when he talked about his philosophy of life. <br /> <br /> We see an unexpected fishing trip and play a pool, which leads to almost battle. It seems that both men are getting away from their everyday life. The end is declining when we learn why the mother has suddenly left. It becomes a story of courage and a human spirit in the face of an adversary. It's never too late to change.
