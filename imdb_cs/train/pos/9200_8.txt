I have read countless posts about this game that resembles Max Payne when I played for the first time when I thought it was a bit of a strange arcade game with the desire to make the Max Payne style (not just bullet-time). So when I played it for a few hours, I realized how fun it was! and how it differs from "Max Payne", yeah, the ball time is a bit similar, but I think it's different from the game style. This game is a non-stop action - mix between shoot'em up and fight'em up, as much fun as a big fan of Max Payne I have to say that DTR Story is not close to Max Payne's size, the graphics are a bit average and some levels look the same , but if you want a bit more "bullet-time", you should definitely own this game.
