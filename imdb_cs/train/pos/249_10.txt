I've seen the trailer for this movie several times, and I have to say that Ned Kelly looks like a wonderful movie. When I saw a trailer for the first time, I could not get rid of his eyes (he warned me). Heath Ledger sticks to what he knows and what he works for, a period. Not to mention Orlando Bloom, which is seen for a fraction of a second, looks fantastic. I think this movie will be a hit, and many people will see me again and again.
