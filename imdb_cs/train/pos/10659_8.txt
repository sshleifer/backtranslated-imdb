"I like cheaper perfumes, it does not last so long ..." - Ralph Meeker's convicted figure (Lawson) tells Helena Charles Barbara Stanwyck after getting the perfume perfume she chose with her husband in Tijuana ...! This line crackled me, and it also seemed like a metaphor for this movie - cheap are better than expensive because a cheap man loving perfume that has a trip with 2 x 4 is a better person! I agree with some other comments about Helen's attraction to Lawson. Although her story tells her that she wants Lawson to be deferred, it seemed to be attracted by its fiery nature, and the passion she had created in her would probably not be rid of her tide!
