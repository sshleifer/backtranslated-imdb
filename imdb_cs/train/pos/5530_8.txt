It must be seen for anyone who loves photography. stunning and breathtaking, leaving you in red. she saw it twice in the cinema and now on DVD. it kept well on DVD, but it was something else on the big screen. <br /> <br /> I took my two daughters to see it and they loved it, my oldest called at the end.but she was the one who wanted to see it again tonight when she saw it at the videopůjčovna. his simple narrative about the child's love for nature and especially the fox is well-known. in some respects, the bear reminds me of his narrative story, which is not a documentary format. which works very well for children. why it is not preached, it is very important, you make your own opinion. <br /> <br /> But the star of this movie is cameramen how they did what they did. amazing amazing.
