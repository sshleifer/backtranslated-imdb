Rich alcoholist Robert Stack falls in love with Secretary Lauren Bacall. He married her and is so happy to stop drinking. However, Bacall is secretly loved by Best Friend Stokes, Rock Hudson. And sister nymphomaniac sister, Dorothy Malone, desires for Rock. Playing in a few complications and filming is out of control (in a good sense). Very glossy film in beautiful Technicolor with jaw-droping fashion and equipment (check out Bacall Hotel Room at the Beginning). Everyone looks perfect and dresses in beautiful, shaped outfits. Basically, it is a soap opera with Class A production values. The story itself is a lot of fun and some dialogs at the beginning are cheerfully over the top. Playing Hudson, Stack and Bacall is not so good, but seeing them so young and charming is great ... especially Stack ... when he smiled, his knees were lost! Dorothy Malone, on the contrary, is fantastic - she earned her best acting actress for her role. She is sexy, violent, cruel and sympathetic ... convincing. <br /> <br /> Fun, shiny baskets. Do not miss!
