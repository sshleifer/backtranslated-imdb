Along with the South Pacific Ocean, boys and dolls for adults are seductive, sexy, and full of men who are interconnected with men and women. <br /> <br /> There is energy and drive to stand out of the pack - the power of Jean Simmond's performances and the young Brande's magic, and the master Sinatra already contribute to the overall feel and appearance of the work. Boys and Dolls win as it is carefree what it is: the MGM musical. <br /> <br /> You are still looking and listening to great melodies and dance figures - it will remain one of the classics of cinema in the 20th century and will be watched the pleasure for the coming years. <br /> <br /> Warm recommendation.
