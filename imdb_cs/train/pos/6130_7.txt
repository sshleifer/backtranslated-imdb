Surprisingly good. It was fun, the screenplay was fun, the music was fun, the plot was extremely fun. It was a fun movie that could watch you and give your brain some rest. I found lots of conspiracy and quotes to be very creative. 7 out of 10. Actually, for what it was, it would have deserved 10 out of 10. You should not compare it to an artistic film or a movie of bloody slasher.
