"I just wanted to see you laugh at the Purple Rain." That's a great movie. It was to be re-evaluated on PG-13. But still, Prince's first and greatest film. Subsequent suction. But I have not seen years, so here's what I remember. Kid must juggle with victory over the love of her life, Apollonia (herself), keep her band together (Revolution like them) and tension in her family. But his rival band (Time Like They) is destroying their lives. Just like Morris (himself) is trying to steal Apollonia from Kid. Like Saturday Night Fever, Flashdance and 8 Mile. Really good. Rent it, laugh and cry, and buy it if you want to buy it.
