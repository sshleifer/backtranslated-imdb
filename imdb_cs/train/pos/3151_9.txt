I saw this show about 3-4 years ago. It was fun Funny! When I first saw her playing ETV (Estonian Television), I started to like it. It's a shame that this is a bad time for me. Hyde is like a cool guy who likes to sing Frank Sinatra! And he comes to the stupid thoughts. He got those glasses that were brown. I like this . And there's FeZ. The Pervert Group. We all know what he does when he's alone ... he wants to get wrong. He even had it with his boss in one episode. And there's Michael, the stupidest guy in the whole group, probably the most stupid in town and his cop! It's so silly that I recall the following: Hyde says: Did you do the police? - No Michael will come and say. Does anyone know how to turn off the siren? It's urban playboy. Then comes Jackie, a former girlfriend of Michael, and then her girlfriend. Then Eric is Who is the son of the unfortunate war veteran and the son of Kitty's domestic wife. His one big pussy. But she loves Donna, her girlfriend, with what she plans to be married. Donna is one hot girl. Hmm, what have I forgot? ah Hyde lives in the basement.
