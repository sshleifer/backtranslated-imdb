Sandler is amazing again ... I've become a fan of Sandler. This film is the saddest story of Sandler. His expression is fantastic. I screamed more click tracking, but there are some similar points. Think about the value of the family before you lose it, and to say "I love you", these are some of the most impressive truths in life ... It's hard, it's real ... and in fact there is a real owner of this success, Binder . I do not think that another director could give these emotions in such a way. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Burrows are also amazing ... Cheadle is one of my favorites from Crash. Do not expect to laugh or have a positive atmosphere ... If you are ready to face the reality of life, do not miss this movie.
