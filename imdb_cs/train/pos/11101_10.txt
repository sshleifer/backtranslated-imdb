The soprano was probably the last adventure show in the 1990s. it's sad that it's the best, it was the best show on HBO, if not on TV, not everything that was portrayed for you had to think it was great. cast was excellent. Tony (James Gandolphini) is a great actor and he played his character as well as others. Each character had mistakes, making it so real and enabling viewers to join them, and that's why it took so long. The last episode was good, I'm not sure how to take on a lot of different things that can be interpreted by the end id, as if he thought Tony was not dead, but a meadow came in and sat down with them and that the outages were just for tension . Tony will have to go to court and deal with hoping he's not dead, that's how I feel ... Long live Soprano and Tony Soprano .......
