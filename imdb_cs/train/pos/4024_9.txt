I was very fond of this movie. It took me to guess until just before the end of what will happen. One of the better movies about the department I've seen. Urmila Matondkar is also wonderful. This is one of the most personal films and films on earth I've seen in the department. It's a little less mainstream than Gadar, and it's really an emotional roller coaster, where you start with one opinion of what's going on and one side comes out. This is not typical bolid goods, but rather a film of artistic type. The best part of this movie is that there is no dehumanization of one side of the partition conflict when we focus on another story. He does not win or win, but rather allows you to draw your own conclusions about things.
