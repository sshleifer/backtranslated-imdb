Many reviews and comments I've read about this movie say it's a rather outdated movie and Clary Bow's performance. Though the story was rather typical of Clara's later silent sounds, it still seemed a bit of a heart-stirring and incredibly entertaining. Clara plays a happy Hawaiian girl who does not stop in any way to get the man she loves ... she does not mind the man being married! Clara's lack of modesty has been shocking today, but I believe it will go into the sweetness and general entertainment of the film. Though it's definitely not a brilliant story-line (quite typical, in fact), this movie is a nice show of Clara's ability to laugh the audience.
