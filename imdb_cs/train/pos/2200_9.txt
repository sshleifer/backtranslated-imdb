The 100 black-and-white half-hour episodes of the early sit-comedy "Mr. Peepers" were originally broadcast on NBC in 1952-55. Like many child booms, this and "Ding Dong School" are my earliest memories of television. Because they both later appeared in syndication, it is difficult to say how many of these memories are actually associated with the original broadcast. "Mr. Peepers" is worth deciding for more than nostalgic value. It features a very different style of sitcom than "The Honeymooners" and "I Love Lucy". The genre could have gone through two different directions these days, and eventually ended in the loud abrasive way of these two performances; which is probably why they still look modern. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers," which has been differentiated by its intelligent limiting tone, can be quite slow and boring. But it's more like adapting to a different style. Once you get into the character, it wins over most intelligent viewers. Credit should be given to the producer of the show, Fred Coem, a key figure in early television, whose dramaturgical anthologies are also going to check ("Philco Television Playhouse", "Lights Out", "Playhouse 90", "Producers Showcase", "Playwrights 56" , "Fireside Theater", etc.) On the kinescope "Mr. Peepers" offered a much finer style with Wally Cox (to be the voice of "Underdog" a few years later) in the title role, Robinson Peepers, a secondary school teacher with moderate ability. His glasses were his trademark and symbolic link to his name and the role of a passive observer. <br /> <br /> The series gave Cox excellent support. Tony Randall played his best friend, history teacher Harvey Weskit. Jack Warden played Frank Whip, a vocal gymnast teacher whose mild bullying gave the show most of the conflict elements. <br /> <br /> There is a competition for interest in love, which includes school sister Nancy Remington (Patricia Benoit) and viewers quickly cope with Mr. Peepers, who seems to be a much better match for fine Nancy. Their on-screen marriage near the late 1953-54 season attracted national attention, the early version of "Who Shot J.R.?" madness. <br /> <br /> And then again what do I know? I'm just a kid.
