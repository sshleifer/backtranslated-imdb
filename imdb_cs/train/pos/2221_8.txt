One night I found it on the Bravo satellite station. Originally from curiosity, I decided to watch it. To be totally honest, I was not disappointed. The main character is beautiful and her body has shown itself well. Do you think her talents would be useless as a kata, but apparently it was not after watching the whole movie! The only real sin is acting acting acting, especially the actor who plays Melnik. Christ is wrong! The prison guard Hank is also terrible. he drank and made mistaken attempts to move on to his Wanda guard, though fortunately for us the viewer and for Hank gets down and dirty with Wanda near the end. The music used is tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for execution. This movie is well watched for the beautiful, gifted and very sexy Jennifer Thomas
