it's a very nice movie and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. but there are 2 minus points: - Story level has a large spectrum. some of the scenes are very large and some are just boring. - a lot of stories are not separate (compare to coffee and cigarettes where every story has a point, message, punch or anyway you want to call it) but well, most stories are really good, some are great and overall it's one of the best movies this year for sure! <br /> <br /> Unpleasant that I have to fill at least 10 lines, I have nothing to say and I do not want to start analyzing the individual sequences ... well, I think it is so!
