10 TOTAL or LESS was made in two weeks on the budget of the Sheriff by writer / director Brad Silberling, just a small film shot in Carson, CA, which seems like an improvised whole story ... in the best sense. Silberling was lucky to link veteran actor Morgan Freeman to his big projects with Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different things who can improve the life of another. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays himself-but it's part of a comedy that he's portrayed as an actor who has been out of work for four years, looking for a place for a small film filter to get back into the flow of things. His role is to be a market manager and is released on a permanent market in Carson, where he meets, among other things, one Scarlet, a girl on argumentation 10 items or less. Not only is Scarlet tired of her static work, she has also embezzled her crazy husband (Bobby Cannavale), who is currently sleeping with Scarlet's lazy coworker (Anne Dudek) and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere. Two couples after several shared problems and beyond they go on a "road trip", which has the effect that each of the characters comes from the presence and life story of the other. This is a simple story, in simple terms, but because of the continuity between Freeman and Paz it works very well. This is one of those little films about human relationships where the message is threatened by change and exchange. It is a lot worth seeing, and it is a DVD that has featurettes that are touching, informative and comic - enjoyment from view. Grady Harp
