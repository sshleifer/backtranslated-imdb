Excellent cast, please more! <br /> <br /> If you can capture something else written by Plater (or play with these gorgeous actors). For anyone who does not know Plater has a real feel for jazz, I recommend that you see the Beiderbecke trilogy at any time. <br /> <br /> "There are three kinds of jazz - Hot, Cool and 'What time does a melody start?'
