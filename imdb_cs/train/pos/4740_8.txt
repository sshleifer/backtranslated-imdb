OK, it's not a perfect movie, but I do not agree with the overall IMDb view that it's really really bad. In the nineties, I watched a lot of Hong Kong flix and loved a nice time. At that time I never saw a "black mask" and for the first time I saw her for the first time. In addition to the bitterly bad copying that my DVDs did not give up on, the film contains the raw energy and bravado that had penetrated Hong Kong during that time. I still hold my guns in the fact that these guys, regardless of their budget, add a magic element to the screen, not Bourne Supremacy, Casino Royale, or Mission Impossible movies - I just think they lack the spontaneity of this and feel too regulated). What is it? It is a feeling that movie makers have been experimenting while shooting and editing, not afraid to leave some stains to learn later. For me, watching movies makes it fun and dangerous.
