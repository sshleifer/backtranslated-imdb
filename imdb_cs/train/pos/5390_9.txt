Life Begins is a wonderful pre-code movie that plays some of the best games. It is located in the maternity ward of a hospital, especially in a room for women who are in trouble. This is an older woman, a heavy unmarried mother (Glenda Farrell), a fragile young woman, an Italian woman and a main character (Loretta Young), who spent 20 years in prison for murder. Her husband (Eric Linden) is in the hospital in every other pain to know that everything will be all right. Aline MacMahone plays a sister who is great in her work. <br /> <br /> This movie is very interesting and fun. It's not even shocking, but it's interesting to see such a neglected object on the silver screen. Performs brilliantly all around. Loretta Young is beautiful here. Eric Linden comes out of nowhere and is sincere how it can be. His innocence reminds Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell is great, as always, a lot of precursors and for good reason.
