MacArthur is a great movie with a great story about a great man, General Douglas MacArthur. This, of course, is the story of one of the great American military figures and characters I have known since the first moments of my memory. Although there is a problem of continuity (there may be others), such as MacArthur's film appearance that appeared in 1962 that the US Military Academy accepted the Thayer Prize, it did not contain the phrase that "the old soldiers will never die, they simply disappear." (This was in his speech to Congress after his dismissal by President Truman) in 1951 for his alleged distrust (these two did not see his eyes!) Gregory Peck is an im-Peck-capable as a general who promised to return the Philippines in the Second World War . The film moves quickly and easily with the general, his family and his staff from the beginning of the Second World War to the end of his career. This film would be much more important to a man familiar with both WWII and the Korean War. However, Peck's portrayal of this great man who fought against the twin evil of fascism and communism and who hated war as the only soldier is truly memorable. "There is no substitute for victory in the war."
