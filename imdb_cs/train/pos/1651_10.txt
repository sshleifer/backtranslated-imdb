I watched it on PBS in the US when it was originally broadcast in 1988 (?). Assuming the miniseries were available on DVD, I bought the first edition of all three books last year. Since then, I've been looking for serials on the movie websites. Today I found this web page. I'll leave it. <br /> <br /> I would like to buy this complete - 26 episodes - miniseries. After buying the DVD I read every book and then watched the episodes of this book. That's what I did with the trilogy of John LeCarre Karel and the trilogy of Larry McMurty's Texas Ranger. Does anyone have any suggestions for great books or a series of books that have become very good TV miniseries - or movie series - that are now available on DVD?
