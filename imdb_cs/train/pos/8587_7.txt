My Take: It uses its famous plot with subtle performances and a few real moments of excitement. <br /> <br /> This land is well known. An innocent man is framed for plotting to assassinate the United States president, the first traitor in the United States secret service. As his colleague of secret services seeks, he tries to prove his innocence. Of course we know his innocent and real culprit is just around the corner but I still enjoyed SENTINEL. At this time, when thrillers are limited to being too absurd and too abusive in action sequences, SENTINEL is a good lick-back for all those good old-fashioned political crime thrillers. The familiar plot is raised by narrow exciting sequences and amazing performances. Michael Douglas, the perfect person for work, is longtime secret service agent Pete Garrison, who is framed as a part of the plot to assassinate the president. Former secret service colleagues (Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) are following Harrison and trying to find out who is behind a possible murder and a traitor in a secret service. This leads to lots of scene scenes that are surprisingly (and fortunately) never incredible. The script also features a subplot with Garrison, which has a relationship with the first lady (played by Kim Basinger). Fortunately, it was not unnecessary, as most subplots belong to these films. The director of the film is Clark Johnson (S.W.A.T.), who can make the film look good. Although many criticized it as "it should be a television movie", I have to disagree. I agree that this is not a perfect movie, and much of it is inspired by other action thrillers and political intrigue such as LINE OF FIRE or an episode of TV series 24 (which is very similar to the style and star Sutherland), but even so, this film gets into serious heights and will not leave even less details. The performances are amazing (with top rankings, bindings, even with a letter by numbers. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give it a *** 1/2, not perfect, but not far from it. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 of 5.
