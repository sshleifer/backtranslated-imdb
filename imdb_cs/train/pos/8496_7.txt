Wow, it's been years since I last saw this movie. Watching this in 2008 is definitely different than watching it in 1986. At first I thought I would make it through the movie. Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so uncomfortable, arrogant and disrespectful that I could hardly follow him. He embodied every negative stereotype of Americans. If it was not bad enough, when it turned out that the small workers of the small American city got it, it got worse. On the contrary, the Japanese were presented as helpless robotic workaholics. The movie was not so funny, I just hung there for nostalgic value. And I'm glad I continued my watch. Just like the box, the judges are influenced by how you've finished the round. This movie went about three to seven, which I rated for the end. The end was excellent. You always want a harmonious end, and that's what it is. It was great that the city should keep working there and keep the factory, but what was particularly strange was the marriage between Japanese customs and values ​​and American customs and values. It was an average film that ended with a high note.
