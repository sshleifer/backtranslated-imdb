The film begins very slowly, with lifestyle Wallace Napalm, serving at the photo service station. His wife was confined to her home with ankle bruising as a result of a punishment for arson. Wallace is a member of the fire department of volunteers and take the fireworks seriously. Watching Wallace's rather boring life continuation suddenly comes up with something new and steep: a carnival arrives in the city. One of his stars is Wilder Napalm, Wallace's brother. It's a clown, but it has a special talent. Also, Wallace. Both are pyrokinetic or "pyrotechnic", people capable of triggering fires with mental energy. Wallace maintains his secret powers; Wilder allows his friends to know what he can do. Spoiler: Some of their differences are returning to a childhood incident when they have inadvertently caused the death of laughter. Wallace gets rid of his powers; Wilder wants to become a public on national television. Wilder wants a difficult affair and wants Wallace's wife both of them years ago. She becomes the bone of conflict and becomes one of the reasons why brothers eventually achieve a literal firefighting intervention. The film is fun but not funny - loud funny. I think I have enough copies in my library. It's a good movie.
