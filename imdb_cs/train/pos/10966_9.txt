Gray Garden is the world for you. Edith and Little Edie live in almost total isolation, eating ice cream and liver paste in improvised kitchen in their (seemingly) shared bedroom. Cat licks, while Mother Edith offends her daughter pronouncing. This is a game of Tennessee Williams that comes alive and should inspire screenwriters and dramatists because the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100% realistic. The situation in the house reminds me exactly how my grandmother and her 50 - their daughter lived for decades (except that they were poor and clean). They will whip all day long, her grandmother talks about her perfectly beautiful past, while her daughter has constantly blamed a neglected opportunity with men, work and self-sacrifice. This film is a must for anyone who writes the relationship of mother and daughter of this kind. It's sad and voyeuristic, but the creators have done a terrific job of getting Edies so comfortable to so recklessly revealed. Rare life is rarely seen in this way, and especially in the context of the remnants of a strong family that has fallen into nothingness in the cave of its own estate.
