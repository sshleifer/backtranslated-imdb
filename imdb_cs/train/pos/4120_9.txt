<br /> <br /> In 1970, after five years of absence, Kurosawa did what his first film would be in color. Dodend 'Ka-Den is a movie that focuses around many entangled stories that continue in the small Tokyo slume. The title comes from the sound a mentally retarded boy does when he thinks he is running a train. We slowly become acquainted with other people in a small community, two drunks who trade with wives because they are not happy with the ones they have. An old man who is the center of a city helping a thief who is trying to rob him. A very poor father and son who can never afford a house, so they are one of them. By the end of the movie all stories are full of rings, some are happy, others are sad. Because it was Kurosawa's first color film, you see that he uses it to his advantage and shows. Maybe too. This movie goes in many different directions and is hard to settle and get into it. But do not do me wrong, Dodes' Ka-Den does not have to be Kurosawa the best, but comes from the greatest director of all time, it's much better than 99% of today's films.
