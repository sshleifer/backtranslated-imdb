Harvey Keital is the best performance of a new century. Very nice photo, beautiful shot in front of Castro Cuba. The story revolves around a nephew of a local minor crime boss who develops friendship with the American Hollywood companion. It is really a moment when the boy wakes up to the fact that a small circle of people he knows actually lives in a much larger, much more complex world that he still does not understand. The script is strong and full of humor, the direction is sharp. Overall, this is a truly professional work that fits well with the Latin American cinema tradition. The only weakness is the decision to shoot in sync-sound English rather than Spanish - likely to improve sales in the US. Unfortunately, it just makes the film a bit less convincing. But if you can see this path, you will find a hearty trip to another world. Recommended.
