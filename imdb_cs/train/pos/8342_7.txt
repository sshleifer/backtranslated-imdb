A fairly good romantic comedy, in which I do not think I've ever seen Meg looking at some fun. All the players did a good job of keeping a living story. Of course, in the real world no genius mathematician would have seen a fatty monkey, but that's why I love romantic comedies ... one can totally forget about reality and have a good time. Nice movie. Shit, Meg is a kid, huh?
