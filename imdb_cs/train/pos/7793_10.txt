My brother brought this movie home from rental and I remember that I expect it to be so boring. I think the title was particularly disapproved of me. I never remember that I started a movie with such low expectations and was so completely won. I was watching the film twice before I let my brother back to the store. It's very unusual that the film talks to me like this. I was totally caught up in Ruby's situation as she tried to get through her life. The bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so fast. I could watch for several hours. Another drawback is that I am dissatisfied with what Ashley Judd has done since then. She's so perfect in this movie. This movie is easily in my top ten most popular from all over the world.
