I was absolutely impressed by "Shelley Adrienne" Waitress (2007). This film only confirms what was clear from this film. Adrienne was a great gifted writer-director, an original and unique artist. He managed to show the suffering of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanist tendency. Ally Sheedy steals this movie with amazing performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge. Male Director Reg Rodgers, looking like Judd Nelson, is fine. There is also a great friend Ben Vereen. The song at the end of "The Bastard Song," written by Adrienne, can be her optimistic eulogy: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
