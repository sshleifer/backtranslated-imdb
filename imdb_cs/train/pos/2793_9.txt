It's such a shame that thanks to this title, this film avoids people who hate football. Bend It Like Beckham is much more than just a bored sports movie. The story line is touchy and intelligent without being shy, jokes are laughing loudly and the characters are well-behaved. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are brilliant as teenagers Jess and Jules who will show off well on the pitch as well as outside. Anupam Kher is amazing as Jess's old father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so wonderful in "Ride with the Devil", is just as good as a nice kid and he takes full advantage of his wonderful Irish accent! Even if you do not like football, check out this movie. If you feel anything, you smile.
