I do not know why some boys from the US, Georgia or even from Bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about something they do not even understand. For those who did not record this movie - watch it. Do not expect too much, or do not give any frames just because it's Kosturica. Watch the film without prejudice, try to understand the whole humor inside - people from Serbia really got married while Bil Clinton bombs their villages, Gypsies all over the Balkans are always trying to get you anyway, LOVE is always unexpected, clean and colorful and the Balkans are extremely creative. For those who claim to be a bad movie, I only see that American Sh * t (like Meet Dave, Get Smart, etc.) is much worse than a pure and honest Balkan humorous love story like a Promise. The comment should be useful and secondly should be a personal view of the writer. I think the movie is great and people are looking to have to respect the director and the story inside. It's simple but true. It is brutal but gentle and makes you laugh.
