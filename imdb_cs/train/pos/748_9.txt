This is 2009 and in this way the underestimated jewel loses nothing of the power it had 31 years ago. It combines a fairly wide range of different characters and stories without seemingly overcrowded. <br /> <br /> Clothes and music can change over time, but ultimately it's a story that never loses its ascension -dateability. And above all, this film does a pretty good job. Of course it is sometimes lean, but also very touching. The performance of Jodie Foster is striking and shows that she is really a naturally born actress who has shown her real potential, especially in her earlier films. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this.
