Love is overwhelming ... It's all manifestations ... It is beautiful, absolutely beautiful ... Tudor Chirila, Maria Popistasu and Ioana Barbu, one really dramatic story of love in all shapes, a story about undefined ways of young hearts, about life and the lost innocence, driven by the handsome eye of Tudor Giurgiu. With the spectacular soundtrack of Faultline & Chris Martin and Vama Veche, he is surprised to leave behind a sour taste of misunderstanding love ... Really remarkable ... Is it me or is Romanian cinema slow but surely progressing and gaining respect? It's a great movie ... Two inches up to everyone involved.
