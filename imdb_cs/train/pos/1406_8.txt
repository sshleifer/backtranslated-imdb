You remember H.G. Wellse "The Invisible Man"? So here's another movie, like that, just the most extreme. "Hollow Man" is like no story about invisibility as a weapon of choice. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientific genius who goes into the world of invisibility and makes it useful for military purposes. Initially, serum was an easy part, so no one returned. Most of the first attempts ended unstable. Up to one night, when he perfected the formula. And who else, but Caine will be a lab rat. The gorilla was the first and almost died, so when it came, it was tight. So when Caine decided to use it for fun. Then, when he was tired of not seeing, the team tried to bring him back to the world of the body. However, the visibility pattern does not work the way it should, and Caine would fall into madness. So he'll end up like a crazy invisible killer. It would be best if you got out of town instead of taking the lives of people close to you. I would not care about those you did wrong. Great movie, lots of fun. 3 of 5 Stars!
