Due to the time release, the story that revealed Panic in the Streets in 1950 was not a surprise. The corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and left like no one until next examination by a public health inspector who claims that the corpse carries the drum of the Bubble Plague. Still, with today's current drama in the world, this strangely helps this film to become credible for today's viewers. Cast and crew are flawless. Richard Widmark in his first role after his breakthrough performance in Night and Town, Jack Palance in his debated film about chill, also starring Paul Douglas and young (and rather cute) Barbara Bel Geddes. The rest of the slots fill a number of unusual, unprofessional actors (typical of director Kazan). Elia Kazan directs Joe MacDonald's films (he will later work with Richard Widmark again in 1953 with a much better "Pickup on South Street") and great Alfred Newman to score. Almost everyone involved here did a better job, but "Panic in the Streets" is quite a rewarding watch. Especially for film-noir enthusiasts.
