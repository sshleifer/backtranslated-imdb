Of course it will be the average fan of the Battle Star Gallactica "Sci-Fi". It makes me happy. I do not like the cheese sci-fi shows, especially the Battle of Gallactica, so I like this show. The creators of the show got a lot of heat for what happened (unconventional sci-fi way) and it was worth it. I read on the Wiki that they want to appeal to all, including women, and not just science fiction. This is probably the most promising show from Lost. It has the most exciting, clever, deepest scenario of a show in a while, and it's really unique. <br /> <br /> What I love most about the show is that she plays like a great Anime! From young teens running around firearms to an extremely balanced and complex scenario, robots remind us of something that came from Japan, except a bit better (most Anime is too confusing).
