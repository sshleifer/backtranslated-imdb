Right now I watch this movie for the second time (on TV) and I fell down for the second time when it was running for an hour (I think I've seen it for another 2 minutes this time) This film is really impressive as Goldsworthy looks at nature, turns nature so that you would never realize it is really amazing. This whole movie gives you a pleasant feeling and sees him with such a love to play with the world around him. Or just see his hands, covered with dirt and broken nails, will only touch you.
