Russell, my friend, is wonderful in this movie. But more, the film covers a huge amount of human passion and sadness. Everything from marriage to homosexuality is solved and respected. The film realizes the viewer that the tolerance of other people provides a way to save mankind. A wonderful love story between Lachlin and Lil. I repeat my scenes again and again. Anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people. All the characters are greatly busy and rendered.
