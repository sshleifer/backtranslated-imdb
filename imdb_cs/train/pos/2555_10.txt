The movie was not so great. The book is better. But the movie was not that bad either. It was very interesting. This conspiracy had enough tension to watch me, even if I did not say I was actually interested in the film itself. Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato Jr are both wonderful to watch you :) She has some cute scenes that should be romantic. Overall, I would make a 7 or 8 movie. It was not bad, just a little missing a plot.
