Big bad swimming has a low budget, it feels indie. So many times I started to watch independent films that had really good reviews just to find that they are demanding cruel for whom people who are so blinded by the idea of ​​the film and their potential to be provocative forget that film is the most important form of entertainment. I do not know if Big Bad Swimming has any message or higher meaning or metaphor, if it does, I miss it. <br /> <br /> It was easy, warm and humane, as the BBS felt right, there were no big dramas or meaningful insights, but I just joined the characters directly. And when, like any good movie, it came to an end, I felt sorry for the loss of this connection. If you are looking for something big, or quick or inexpensive to look elsewhere, look for a movie that tries to deliver more than it can. BBS brings a full, enjoyable and real experience and I felt rewarded and satisfied when I watched him.
