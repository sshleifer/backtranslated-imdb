I recorded this film at the IFC and I liked it, though I had the feeling that the editing work was a little rough, though it might have been deliberate. I had some time to find out what was going on initially because they seemed to be preparing for a little presentation of a Pulp Fiction-style non-linear drawing. It seemed a little forced. I certainly think the movie is worth watching, but I think it could be a little bit clear. Some scenes just do not make sense to others. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that the rating here is as low as it is. It's not perfect, but it does not have serious problems. I gave her 7/10. The film showed at least that Laurence Fishburne could act when he wanted to. They just had to tell him not to be in Matrix movies.
