I just finished listening to the director's commentary on this film and I think one big thing I got from what I agree with is that this movie, like Mann's The Insider, is totally subjective. It's from Howard's POV. So any review or attempt to think about the set of comments, as Ebert did, is really about Nolte's character. If you feel like he did the movie "does not work" then you say, I think Howard does not work. And to be honest, you may be right. Howard's thinking and personality really should not stand in professional psychological treatment and analysis. But, hey, that's the nature of people. <br /> <br /> Andrew.
