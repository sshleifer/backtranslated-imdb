Sudden influences were, in my opinion, overall better than Enforcer. He's building a great movie, but then I saw the villain and he was disappointed. Sudden Impact differed from previous repayments. The conspiracy has gone in another direction because Dirty Harry does not use so much police this time. We also do not see the villains until later, which means less time on the screen, which is all better for us. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood again steals the show as Dirty Harry,. Pat Hingle was pleasant as Chief of Jannings, Harry's newly assigned boss. It seemed that Bradford Dillman changed his name to Captain Briggs, and it was either different. Michael Currie is decent as Lieutenant Donnelly, Harry's unpleasant superior. I personally liked Kevyn Major Howard as Hawkins, a young punk who has a vendetta against Harry. Albert Popwell was as good as Horace, Harry's friend. Audrey J. Neenan was as good as Ray Parkins, a famous lesbian around the city. Jack Thibeau was well occupied as a Kruger, pervert. Now for a really bad part. Sandra Locke, Eastwood's longtime mistress, was horribly embarrassed like Jennifer Spencer, Harry's love interest. And Paul Drake was just as bad as Mick. The film would be much better if not for better writing and playing in some parts. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
