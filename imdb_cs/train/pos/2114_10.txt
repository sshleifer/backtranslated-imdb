Two warriors in the leather goods trade show up as secret lovers as they respond under the pseudonym. Within this simple idea and everyday environment, Lubitsch produces a rich tapestry of joke, drama, mourning and irony that will never leave. Stewart and Sullavan are perfect as the average couple with real emotions and tension, and other well-developed characters have their own subtle shots and jokes. Though badly overshadowed in the big films in Stewart's 39/40 (Destry, Philadelphia Story, p. Smith), it is simply parallel, and in other films we enjoy a whole range of actor's subtleties.
