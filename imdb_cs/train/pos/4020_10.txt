Pinjar from Mr. Dwivedi is an amazing film. It is definitely the worst and best of 2003. This is a very good performance. Dwivedi knows what he can get from MAST Urmila. she's like they've never seen. one really great performance. along with her is the fine actor Manoj Bajpai who showed Bollywood what Bhiku Mhatrem is. The film is about a girl (Urmila) living in Pre-partition of Pakistan. she is from a family in punjabi living in a small town. she was kidnapped by a Muslim guy as part of an indignation with the Panjab family. and then followed by a series of twists and turns, as after a few days the marriage had to be matched. this movie is really a very good movie. give it a solid with an amazing script. all performances such as lillete dubey, isha koppikar (at wont believ but can act as well as jus dancin on Khallas), kulbhushan kharbanda and many others. these files with pre-partition Pakistan, costumes, cinema, sound, background scores add to the positive points. from start to finish u is stuck on the u'r seat with the question of what will happen next? this film is not one that's worth watching, but it deserves to be part of your movie collection. the final scene is the end of the movie. I would suggest to all the people of No-Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhi-and-No-Dil-To-Pagal-Hai to watch this amazing film. My Rating: 10/10.
