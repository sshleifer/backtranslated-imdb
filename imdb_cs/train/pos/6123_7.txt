Before I comment on this movie, you should realize that when I saw this movie, I expected typical bullshit, horror, B-movie and I just wanted to have fun. Jack Frost is the one who not only adds but is actually one of the best I've ever seen. Scott McDonald is great as Jack Frost, in fact, I think he has a future in being a psychopath in a movie of great times if he gets a chance. McDonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman through some stupid random mix of ridiculous elements. Once the snowman starts to move and kills people, it is difficult not to interfere. The Greeks that are said are completely delayed, but really funny. The fact that the rest of the cast goes beyond just contributes to the stupidity of the film, but it's stupid, it's genius. The scene where the snowman is with a teenage girl is really classic in B-horror, a horror movie. I really hope it's a sequel, and I'll be there right now to look at it on any cable channel. Of course, it's just fun to watch for the first time and it's not really good working with film technology, but I'd love to see a snowman kill people. I gave her 7 out of 10, it's a great movie for dates and couples in the late hours.
