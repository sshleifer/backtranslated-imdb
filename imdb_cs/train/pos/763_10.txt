This movie has changed me all ... I've heard about breakdancing and hiphop, but I've never seen it professionally (hey, I was 11-year Dutch Dutch!) When I saw this movie everything changed. I actively engage in hiphop-movement in our city, I started breakdancing and writing lyrics. <br /> <br /> To this day, I still consider this film to be a personal favorite. Certainly, filming and "cinematographic" meanings may not be so significant. But who cares if a wide shot is badly shot, or if you see someone hanging over a microphone? That's what makes what counts for you ...
