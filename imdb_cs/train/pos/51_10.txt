Busy is so amazing! I just loved every word she'd ever done - monsters and barks, Dawson's brook, white cubs, smokers. when I first saw my home, I went and got it the other day. I am a great fan and has many fans in Israel. if anyone has not seen it, it's a great movie than you do not have more time and you will see it now. I recommend everyone to see all of her movies. I saw busy in a late night show with Conan and she was so beautiful and cute I loved her! anyone who saw the movie - looks so scary in the house, but in real life it's so beautiful! you have to see all her half naked pictures for magazine stuff (maxima) looks so good! ~ DANIELLE ~
