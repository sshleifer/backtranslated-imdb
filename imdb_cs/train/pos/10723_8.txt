I have read some of the other user comments and I have decided that even one of them. Some users are stuck in a "realistic" type of mentality. This movie was supposed to be "fantasy" ... and "what if" a fun movie. It was never meant to be "real" or serious. It was really nice for everyone I knew when it came out - even if it was the tragedy of the Challenger explosion ... At that time I was 30 and I was looking forward to it - my young son loved it too! Later, I shared it with my daughter and she loved her too. SpaceCamp is a fun family movie that you should enjoy just because - fun. All "realists" in the world should get rid of or keep track of documentaries or documentaries and avoid any other type of film. I apologize for the young people who first looked at this film and then they could go to the real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one in Vandenberg AFB, California) - they had to wait to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then he felt "letdown" ... I think their parents did not explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Oh, okay. If you like fantasy-fun movies and you did not see it, I highly recommend! Enjoy!
