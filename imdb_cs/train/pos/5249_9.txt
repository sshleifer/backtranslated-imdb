The choice to make this SNL into the movie was much better imagined than the others. The humor contained in the character is not a humorous humor and the attitude is so shot that it can be extended for an hour or two. <br /> <br /> The peculiar sexual content seemed to be avoidable, but it may have been taught me to avoid waiting due to the limitations of live television. I think I was thinking that "Leisure Suit Larry" is risky than the producers ... <br /> <br /> There is certainly no PG-13 movie that would probably hurt him if he had reached the height of his more successful predecessors, but still better assumptions and writing than his harsher. <br /> <br /> I liked it but I doubt it will be a smash hit ... (which is sad because Tim Meadows does not tend to make characters that poison me with quite often the frequency of others SNL alumni tend to)
