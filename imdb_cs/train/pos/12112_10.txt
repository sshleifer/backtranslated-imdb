The premise of this series of anime is about bread, about all things to set up a plot! I really laughed. The main character has a special flavor with which he was born and goes to the baking of bread. I wish it was available on DVD, and it does not matter whether it's subtitled or nicknamed - it's so good. Even the song itself is fun. At one point, the theme song is an afro-Japanese man with an African horse, with a French baguette as if it were a samurai sword. These pictures will not make sense if you do not see the anime. You will laugh until your pain hurts. It's definitely the most unique anime I've ever seen.
