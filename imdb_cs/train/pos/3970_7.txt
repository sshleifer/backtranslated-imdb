This is a film that seems to be on the surface, about J. Edgar Hoover, who on his back went on fighting for the Klansmen, going after Indian murders, hunting the famous gangsters of the 1930s, battling the Nazis in the US, and South America during the Second World War 2 and Commies in New York during the early 1950s. Of course, in 1959, we did not know of Mr Hoover's obsession with keeping secret records of honest Americans, preparing people like Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr, but the worst of all, his secret love affair with his deputy director Clyde Tolson. you want to know more about this topic, I recommend seeing the film Citizen Cohn). Hoover aside, this story about life in the FBI, as Jimmy Stewart said, is for a decent but dated film. VÄ›ra Miles as his devoted wife is also good. But Jimmy is a movie. Just as Hoover drove production and always made sure the FBI was seen without fault, Jimmy Stewart gave the film a human side, quite a success considering Hoover was always looking over his shoulder. The final score is also nice. I've read recent online articles that suggest it's a forgotten movie. Jimmy Stewart was one of the greatest movie stars of all time, and none of his films should be forgotten. TCM has been the last network to show her long ago, and I hope it will show up again.
