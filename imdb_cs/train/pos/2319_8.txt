<br /> <br /> This is a generic story of the coming ages - think of a "wedding member", "summer of 42", "summer quarters", even "little women" - and there are times when Mulligan could omit Soups music, did not use slow motion, or played a golden-lighted beauty setting. Otherwise, it is done with a rare emotional perfect tone. Nothing is forced, every line has a feeling and movement is right. Even casting under List A helps: Larger movie stars with more recognizable personalities could overcome the material. In particular, Witherspoon is excellent: reading her parts is fresh and original, and her body language is suited to the horrific 14-year-old woman on the eve of femininity. Waterston is also very well, even though he has to spend most of the film climbing in family and off-road. One sense that the filmmakers were aware of their unwavering business prospects - no big stars, no big car accident, no special effects - and consciously decided to make the best film, the box is damn. He is intimate and honest and sticks to the rib. If you find yourself at the end, you do not have to feel that you have been cheated.
