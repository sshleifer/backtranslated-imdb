That's a good movie. Some fun to watch money can be caused by a high degree, especially from a child's point of view. Take it for what it is, a fun little movie about the dream of a child and what the child can do with $ 1 million dollars. Do not like it, do not look. They do movies for observers, not people who have nothing better to do, then complain about their lives.
