This movie captured my heart from the very beginning when he heard Quincy Jones' first notes or saw the beautiful purple color of the flowers in the meadows. It's really a movie to cry and die for ...! All the cast gives the best performance in the movie I've seen in years, and Spielberg really overcame himself! Whippi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey (oh lord!), Danny Glover and others give us everything that's best and you can feel it - touch it almost! Goldberg IS Celie, she gives her the insecurity and the feeling of inferiority that is needed for the character, we grow up with her, we grow with it throughout the movie and we swirl with it. Margaret Avery is fabulous like Shug Avery, although she is the most attractive and shows us that "sinners" really "have souls as well." Always nice, glamorous Danny Glover does a great job when people hate him and wonderful music (I would say, sir) Quincy Jones adds even more beauty to this wonderful movie! Photography, music, director and music make this beautiful, soulful film into life. You do not want to miss it! "Sista" ... remember my name ... "
