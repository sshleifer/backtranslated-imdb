He loved it! What you love? - you have your suburbs, you have your zombies, you have your family problems, you have your social dilemmas, you have one fine Retro-1950-style meat eating under the class held in the bay by Whether it's the next meal of the Upper Crust. You can not ask for more. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. Carrie Ann Moss is absolute perfection as a debutant climbing housewife. He is both poor and criminally conspiratorial. Every man's dream. K'sun is really great because the son only tried to be as likely as possible in this nightmare, and somehow we succeeded. It's a real presence on the screen. Very photogenic and natural. Without the appointment all the rest of the cast is amazing. Henry Czerny plays a suspicious policeman with a frightened instinct and a little scout as if it were his everyday person. Billy Connolly is as beautiful as Fido. Good actor: I wish he played the lead role in "Braveheart", with director director Gibson. My point is that his William Wallace would be closer to the real character. His Fido is contained but accessible. Nice touch. In short, great and amazing satirical poke on morals, values, social pinnings, feelings, growth, compensation in uncertain times, and compensation adjustments to impossible conditions. Real reality show.
