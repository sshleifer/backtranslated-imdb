Some of the posters have not changed much since it's not Mark Twain or Rodgers and Hart, but it does not even pretend. You'll be looking for a bigger fan of Rodgers and Hart than I did, but Burke and Van Heusen were not exactly cracked liver, besides they knew Der Bingle inside and adjusted some great songs - But Beautiful, Moonlight Becomes You, It's always you, day after day, etc . In order to fit into his very personal style and here they come with another gentle - and unfairly neglected - ballad, once and always, plus a couple of optimistic philosophies - You sting the tip on the moon and doing nothing. A fragile plot is not meant to be taken seriously - why another makes Merlin hard when in most, if not all, of the other versions is more a friend / instructor of Arthur - so when you start thinking aloud why Sir Lancelot who was sold to historians as an embodiment of chivalry and the transformation of honesty into the nursery bully, that you will not have much fun with what is basically a fun movie. In balance, doing what to do, have fun, so good luck.
