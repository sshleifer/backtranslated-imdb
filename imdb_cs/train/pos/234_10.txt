I have always known that Anne DeSalvo is a great acting actor, and now I know she is also a great writer / director. I was a fan because I first saw her in "Perfect", "My Favorite Year", "DC Cab" and "Stardust Memories". in anything. She missed the screen for too long. It's also amazing to see Cloris Leachman in something other than sit-com. It's her best work since "last performance". If you've grown up in an Italian American family, you'll love this movie. I did not expect much when I started watching this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised to fall in love with this movie. If you have a chance, be careful.
