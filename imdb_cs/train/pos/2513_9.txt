Beautifully done. Lots of anxieties. A friendship does not have to endure all, but in the end it's all important, or a group of friends will learn. I've been watching it again and again. Music is also amazing. When Kei loses a friend he gives up when he meets Shoem, an orphaned boy who is not repelled by his true nature. On the wrong streets of Mallepa they fight for their place among the melting crucible of the Asian races and learn that sometimes they are at the top, it can cost you more than you are willing to pay. A surprising end, which is treated just like the whole movie. I could not do enough. Gackt and Hyde do a great job of acting, which proves they are rather pretty boys singing.
