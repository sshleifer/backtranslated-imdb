**** Excellent <br /> <br /> *** Good <br /> <br /> ** Satisfactory <br /> <br /> * Bad <br /> <br /> 'Go forward, do your day! "<br /> <br /> The fourth film in the series is directed by Eastwood himself (who is said to be driving most of the Magnum Force), and he brings the violent company out of the first two films, but the film still lacks impact and credibility. released at the beginning of the 1980s, at the time of Regan and the young Republicans, the premise of a raped woman who avenged her rapist does not relate to this timeframe, which would be better for Enforcer, which would really make him a good movie. he needed a conspiracy like Wall Street, but Dirty Harry in the middle. <br /> <br /> EVALUATION: 3 stars
