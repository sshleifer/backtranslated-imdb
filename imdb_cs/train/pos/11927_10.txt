I have to say, even though the Angels in Outfield were a pretty good movie. I like how they teach children to always have faith and never give up because they can be miracles. Unlike other baseball movies, this particular film emerged due to the hits of amazing special effects and the well-orchestrated soundtrack, which was very interesting. Although I liked this movie, he had some mistakes, such as some irrelevant (ie, Ending when Ray Mitchell hits the homer that he does not go to the plate, and that's why it would not be a score, but that's just nitpicking.) I have to say that I was really impressed by the presence of this film and moral: Just have faith, do not give up.
