After reading the original game, I thought it would be much more difficult to customize the screen before it turned out to be. Donal McCann once gave a great performance as Public Gar, a suppressed antagonist who is openly displaying on the screen with his extrovert (but invisible others) - private Gar. Eamonn Kelly also plays excellent "screws", whose inability to communicate with his feelings corresponds only to Gar. <br /> <br /> It is worthwhile to rent if you find it. (Probably not available outside Ireland and the UK)
