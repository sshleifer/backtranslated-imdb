This film is about unlikely friendship between a businessman and a man with Down syndrome. The character's evolution in this movie is excellent. We believe that Harry is a businessman who neglects his family, and Georges is an innocent man who longs for love and care from "normal" society. The actor's performances are excellent and the best actor in Cannes deserves. The fantasy scenes in the film highlight the fact that Georges' sufferings to his leaving his family and his desire to be treated as a normal person. The song that is played repeatedly will also reinforce this message. The film shows that people with mental disabilities are good. We have been harassing them with discrimination and neglect, a fact highlighted by the scene where Georges gives a waitress in the kitchen). If they can understand and share the world of these people, we and the mentally disabled can be very happy. <br /> <br /> I was so filmed and emotional. It's a moving film for good souls.
