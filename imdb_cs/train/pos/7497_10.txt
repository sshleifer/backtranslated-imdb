I will never forget when I saw this title in the video store back. I've always been a big fan of Weird Al and when I saw this video, I borrowed and watched it. I was too young to realize Alia's subtle humor and satire at the time, but I remember much later when I was old enough to understand what I was watching. If you are a fan of "Al", especially his earlier work, you will enjoy this film thoroughly. This is in the style of the MTV-esque "Rockumentary" and tells a real (but sometimes overstated) story about how Al got to where he was in 1985. You will love him if you like his brand of humor and more importantly , his music.
