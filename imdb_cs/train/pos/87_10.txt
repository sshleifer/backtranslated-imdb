This short Oscar-winning film may be one of the greatest genres. Fully speaking without dialogue is the visual treatment of a young boy who buys a goldfish, puts him in a bowl with love, then goes to school, leaves the goldfish unprotected, and the window opens unobtrusively. After some time the adjacent orange fly around, coming through the window and slowly leading to the bowl. Fish seem to know something is happening and is very excited. When the cat approaches the bowl, a fish pops up. The cat catches the fish, throws it into a bowl, and walks through the window he came in, just like a boy who did not know what happened, he will come back. It was amazingly shot by real animals; how Cousteau got these animals to behave in this way is remarkable. I just wish this movie was now available to the people who see them; I only saw it once, in 1959 when it was originally released, but it was unforgettable.
