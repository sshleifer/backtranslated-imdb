If you like Cleese and all the British "python" humor times, then this little jewel is totally cheerful. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe is a real treat! <br /> <br /> I saw it with my friends on TV when it first appeared, and its classic quotations have been part of our jokes for 30 years and will do forever! I have it on tape and it is constantly appreciated. Maybe some reviewers take it too seriously. I can not believe it is now only available in the US (NTSC course) and not in the UK, where it should be an essential part of British humor history!
