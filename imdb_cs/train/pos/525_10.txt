After World War II, Powell & Pressburger was asked to come up with something to try to heal the contradiction between the United Kingdom and the United States. At that time, there were lots of "Overcrowded, Over Sex and Here" reminders. Somehow it came with this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie ALL time. She has everything. Romance, poetry, emotions, religion, drama and very strange. I can not explain exactly why, but it hit all the right buttons and although I've seen it a hundred times (yes, really) I'm still guaranteed to have tears in many places. <br /> <br /> Was it wonderful acting, wonderful sets, inspired script? Who knows. But * DO * watch it and see what I mean.
