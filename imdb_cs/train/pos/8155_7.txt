I'm too old to know exactly what is the difference between rap and hip hop. And being Canadian, it's likely I've never actually seen MTV, but I'm not sure. But I thought this movie was very funny when I saw it, a bright little satire. Hip-hop culture is so ubiquitous today that it's hard to constantly hear about it over and over again. (If we could say the same about bagpipe music.) I have most jokes (at least I think I did). Sure, it's derived from Spinal Tap, but there are plenty of goals that could withstand Tape treatment. Only Carpenters are not sacred.
