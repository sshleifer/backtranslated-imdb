This series was just like what they expected from Mr.Spielberg. It's really one of those creepy, fun, childish performances that you will not forget. Just like Outer Limits (another great show), this small series does what's not. It was great and it deserved to run longer. It was a great show that even children could watch, although some performances were a bit frightening when they wanted to be, but they all had at the end morality (like the Twilight Zone) that made you realize what you did not want to end up or what you were they did. I remember watching some of these science films when I was 10 years old, and even now I like seeing it when possible. Really fun, imaginative show. I loved it and I still do it.
