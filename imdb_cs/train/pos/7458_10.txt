This game is a bomb and this is a 007 game and it should be on the biggest hits. When I got the agent under the fire, I thought it was a good game, but then Nightfire appeared and it was better, but now it's a new type of James Bond game. This time he is a third person shooter and there are more than 12 missions, the graphics of the game are outside this house. She even has all the great actors and actresses in this game, like Pierce Bronsan, like James Bond, William Dafoe as a villain, Nikolai Diavolo and Judi Dench as M (forgive me if I wrote it wrong). This game would be one of James Bond's greatest games. <br /> <br /> I give it 10/10
