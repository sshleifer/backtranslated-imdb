The Rookie let me smile from start to finish. Dennis Quaid played the role of perfection. The little boy playing his son was fantastic. This was the father-son movie he remembered. The news is good. Watch your dreams. Failure in persecution is fine if you try. Excitement is tangible. I believe this movie will be classic.
