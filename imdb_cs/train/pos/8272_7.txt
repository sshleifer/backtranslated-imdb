Family (mother Patricia Clarkson, father Jake Weber, son-Erik Per Sullivan) is leaving for a family in a remote house in the middle of winter. They accidentally hit the deer while driving there. This disturbs some of the local people - especially Otis (John Speredakos), and things are slow (very slowly) to go wrong. I expected the worst when I started watching it. The bulk of reviews on this site is extremely negative. Well ... I do not agree. First it is not a horror movie. Horror does not even start until the end of 30 minutes. It's more like a family drama with horror elements that fall in. At this level, it's pretty good. <br /> <br /> First, bad things: The tempo is too slow; Jake Weber is a terrible actor; Too many false dreams of dreams; Wendigo barely turns into a movie, and a clear look at wendigo at the end is ridiculous. Good Thing: Pretty good drama scenario; Clarkson is excellent as a mother; some great direction with amazing sound effects that are a bit frightening; very clear sexual sequence between Clarkson and Webmer (which is actually necessary for the integrity of the plot!); very good actress at Sullivan (only 10 at that time!) and Speredakos and a completely unexpected tragic ending. I think that with this movie, many people are angry because they are pushed as a horror movie - which is not. So, if you can ignore it, I think you might like it. I give it 7.
