Nina Foch insists that "My Name Is Julia Ross" in this movie night of 1945 also stars Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's short and because it is, the movie suffers. It may well have been fifteen minutes and half an hour longer. When I grew up, Foch was on TV, he played a nervous woman, a wife with a cheating husband, a nerve wreck. She has become one of the best actor in Los Angeles. Here is a beautiful young girl who plays the lead role. Julia responds to an ad for a secretary and hires her immediately by Mrs. Hughes and her son, Ralph. He knows little - although we are learning immediately - that the employment agent is a queue that is set to get the right woman for that job, a woman without a family and without a friend. It's alive - in a situation; once Julia gets into the house, it's a drug, and when she wakes up, she says she's Mrs. Hughes and they do not have to leave. The game is very good. Low budgets, yet fun - some things, especially at the end, happen too fast, so I said the movie is too short. However, I recommend this.
