HOLLOW MAN is one of the best horror films of the past decade. The sub-company is the original and the main fence is even better. The special effects are great and perhaps the best I've ever seen in horror film. Kevin Bacon again proves that he can handle any role that will help him. Claude Rains shocked the world with an invisible person in 1933, but now Kevin Bacon shocked us with HOLLOW. One of the most exciting horror movies ever. The action is intense and the chills are true. You can really find yourself jumping if you observe it in the dark for a stormy night. Supported casts include Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Joey Slotnick, Greg Grunberg and Mary Randle. Everyone has an extraordinary job. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team discovered the secret that someone does not see. After testing on animals, they switch to human testing. But someone must be the subject. Volenteering, Caine is invisible. But when his team is unable to return to sight, Caine is driven by his state when he seeks his vengeance ... * End spoilers * The film has created memorable shock sequences and is meant to become a classic hill for the next century. Being the basis for a spoof joke in SCARY MOVIE 2, this movie catches you by the neck and never lets go. The first 45 minutes are slow, developing characters and showing their experiments. The other half is exciting and appealing to most fans of action and horror. Think of DEEP BLUE SEA. Then change sharks to a crazy invisible man. And then change the water to fire and explosions. Rehashing the Shark Shark Movie. Interesting ... HOLLOW MAN gets 5/5.
