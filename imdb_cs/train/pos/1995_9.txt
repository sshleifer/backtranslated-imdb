I've just seen it recently, for almost forty years. It keeps well, especially the excellent compositions by Lionel Barta. ("Who will buy" with its magical counterpoint, just one of many standouts.) I disagree with the second contribution that made the G rating. The rating system, which was completely new at that time, never intended G (general ) rating meant "totally without conflict". Characterizing him as unsuitable for children reminds me of the description I once saw The Wizard of Oz: A girl comes to a strange land and kills the first person she meets. Then he sets out on a road trip with three male companions and kills again.
