The performances in this movie were fantastic. The dialogue was great. Jason Patric added fantastic performance as "Kid" Collins in this amazing adaptation of Jim Thompson's novel. Far better than the movie "The Grifters," which was a good movie, this film really remained true to the authors of the pulp / film noir of the roots that came from the story. I recommend this movie to all fans of film noir.
