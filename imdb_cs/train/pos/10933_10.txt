Be careful with this. Once you get your gloves, it will change the way you look at kung-fu flicks. You will long for the conspiracy of all kung fu films, you will want the depth and character development, you will have the desire for secrecy and unpredictability, you will require dynamic camera work and unbelievable backdrops. Unfortunately, you will not find all these aspects together in one kung fu movie, except for five deadly poisons! <br /> <br /> Simply the best kung fu movie of all time, Venoms mixes a rich plot of land, full of twists and turns, with colorful (and developed) characters along with some of the best camera work that came out of the 1970s. The success of someone who likes the film depends on the ability of the spectator to decrypt which character is who and who specializes in what poison. One is a centipede, two are a snake, three are Scorpions, four are a lizard, and five are a toad. Each character has different qualities, features, strengths and weaknesses. There is a hook in it, we learn along with the student character and we find out who these different men are going to be. We are in his shoes (so to speak), and we must choose whom we believe and who we do not, just like him. We learn with him. <br /> <br /> Not only is the plot, the characters and the camera great, it's also fun to watch, which is more valuable in my book than almost any other film of its kind. It's worth a lot of watches to choose everything that's going on. Venoms is a lesson about what kung-fu really can do ... just do not expect many other kung-fu movies to live in.
