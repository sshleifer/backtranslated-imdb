For the first time I remember seeing it in the 1970s when it was seen on television at night. Damn it scared me. But then I was a teenager back in those days, not like a fool about movies like I am now. CRAZY CASTLE (aka: DANSE MACABRE) is a great example of the Italian horror genre of the 1960s, along with Mario Bavou BLACK SUNDAY (1960), CURSE OF LIFE (1966) and THE NICE CASTLE Mario CAIANA (1965). If you want a scary atmosphere along with great writing, check them out too. I also rate them with those early Poe films that Roger Corman recognized during the same period. I have seen the new DVD Synapse, which has been taken over from the French press, and it is a great improvement over the old pelvis - and the print scanning that has been doing on TV bikes over the years. It adds a few minutes of dialogue (in French), which in fact does not include the movie as a whole, but it's nice to see it complete, without cuts. Unfortunately, DVD does not really offer any bonuses for the movie from the movie. One flub I noticed was in the opening scene and saw that the smokehouse next to the camera was reflected in the cupboard of the front door. I think the editors did not catch up at that time or did not care, but it's something I did not notice for the first time. These are the miracles of the DVD. You see all errors, errors and details that did not appear for the first time. But it does not matter. <br /> <br /> But it does not matter that he still gets 7 on the imdb meter <br /> <br />
