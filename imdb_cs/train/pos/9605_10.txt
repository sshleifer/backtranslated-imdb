but I was not sure what the movie would be, just like I saw a little clip but I thought it would be good and that I was right that I saw it twice the day I got it and it's good my favorite movie . I think Alison Lohan played part of the beth really well that she is such a grilled actress and the writer had to go into great research to find out what bulimia is, though it ends when beth's in the hospital has 2 observations Horus after eating because I said, that the house is okay and also that the hospitals do not help bulimics as I was told, which is probably why I am still home and my sister and mum to be hospitalized because I have bulimia but it is a grid film I recommend to anyone with or without eating disorder or for people who know someone with food intake disorders because they can allow bulimia's lives person and see the world as they do it a bit over the grate of the film and I recommend it to any and every type of person
