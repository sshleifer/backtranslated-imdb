I do not think I could enjoy it any more, although some things were disturbing. I do not want to say what if you did not see it ... you have to find out yourself. Anyway, which movie can miss the eyes of Robert Downey's puppy-dog? Overall, the plot was well developed. Nothing seemed too nasty, because movies like that were. The characters were as capable and there were lots of fun scenes. The idea is that the story is very well connected, although some aspects may be unsatisfactory ... in a substantive view. But as I said before, it's hard to love any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
