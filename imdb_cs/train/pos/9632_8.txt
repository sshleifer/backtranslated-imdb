The concept of Laurel & Hardy working in the role of chimneys this time is surprisingly merry. He guarantees certain funny situations and stupid disgust, especially from Stan Laurel, of course, as usual. The film also has a subplot with a nut professor who works on rejuvenation recipe. It really does not sound like a logical mixture of stories and discontinuities, but both plot lines are perfectly suited to an unforgettable ending. It's still a little weird, but it's funny, so it works for the movie. Film support is surprisingly good. Sam Adams is a great stereotype valet, and Lucien Littlefield goes over his head like a nut professor. The film is filled with some excellent timed and cheerful built sequences that are quite predictable, but become funny to watch how they are all executed. It all helps to make "Dirty Work" one of the better shorts of Laurel & Hardy. <br /> <br /> 8/10
