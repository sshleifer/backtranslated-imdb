I have to apologize because I thought the first 75-80% of this movie was cheerful. It's mainly because of the idea of ​​Brad Pitt. Spot on. <br /> <br /> The meeting was fairly good, but Brad stole the movie. The atmosphere was perfect in all respects. I'm not a giant Pitt fan, but this has to be one of his best roles. <br /> <br /> Brutal, honest, harsh. All good words to describe this movie. I read the previous review and the person said that the argument behind Early Violence is not explained. This is explained, but fortunately, they do not have to go into the graphic details to get their opinion. <br /> <br /> Overall, I gave it 9 because each scenario 1 or 2 was effective. I think humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie. Underestimated.
