Together with "King of the Rocket Men" it was repeated on BBC TV in the early to mid-eighties. If I loaded a time capsule of this period, both of these series will definitely go inside. Someone who watches for the first time will think it's stupid, but it's one of the best examples of "Serials". Don Del Oro will laugh at you (when I was my little nickname for him was Mr. Dustbin's head) and it was funny when he was shot that he says, "Your bullets do not hurt me," then he sinks back, seemingly less than happy. I also like how the first episode tells Sebastian. I've been looking at it again because I've recollected it for years, there are some good pieces and good music (including Ralph Faulkner), the sword was not as good as I remembered it, and yes, it's an inevitable episode " flashback "! Gets 8 out of 10 because they still suffer from slow pace, cushioning and other tricks. If you are interested in these series, I recommend William Witney's book "Door, Doom, Door, to Persecution," though it's a small item.
