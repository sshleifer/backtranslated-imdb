One of the more appealing aspects of Asian cinematography (or even most of what is happening behind those most famous than the United States) are the permutations that are occurring. In the post-World War two Japanese manga (comics), for example, there are really infinite numbers of objects, many of them worked in a unique imaginative way. The same thing happens in genre film; though, again, I mean films made outside U. $. (where we are too "sophisticated" in our anxieties to appreciate anything that is not, or in the US). Would not the American company, for example, be a retrospective of films with a camouflaged professional wrestler (El Santo) or a werewolf (Paul Naschy) or a living fighter (Bruce Lee) ...? As for television: forget about it. While I still love the KUNG FU series that played lately with David Carradine, I always felt that the Americanized version of Asian martial arts was - as she kindly did - a little missing. Until today, an Asian martial artist who plays Asian martial artists was not introduced in Asia. (There is a lot of soft-core porn camouflage as entertainment programs, but the so-called Action Channel may not even have to import or produce puppets for true martial arts.) Before Cadfile was investigating BBC murders, there was at least one Kung Fu movie , representing a group of martial artists, more or less involved in the murderous mystery: 5 THREATED WINGS. As fascinating as any other genre whodunit (western, police show, etc.), this masterpiece of martial arts excels as a truly superb work. Now it's available from Dragon Dynasty, and the print is beautiful, and Bey Logan's DVD commentary is exactly the intelligent, thoughtful analysis these gems really deserve. If you are a martial arts fan, enjoy one of the greatest film genres of all time (specifically martial arts movies from the 1970s and 1980s) gaining a long, late second life (and greatly appreciating a second look) on DVD.
