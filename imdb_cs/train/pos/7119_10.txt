My father, Dr. Gordon Warner, was in Guadalcanal, he lost his Japanese leg and also accepted the Naval Cross. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that my father was a technical adviser to this film and I hope he has an effect on the film so it reminds me how it really was when I read in various commentaries written by viewers that this movie looked like real life. My father is a fanatic of facts and personalities and always wanted things to be as if they were, so I would like to believe he has something to do with it. Currently she lives in Okinawa, Japan (ironically, she is Japanese), and several years ago she was awarded one of the highest awards from the Emperor of Japan for his contribution and the activities of bringing Kendo and Iaido to Japan since McArthur was forbidden to WWII. <br /> <br /> My father was once navy, but I know that once you are navy, you are always nautical. And that's exactly what he is, and I love him very much and respect him. <br /> <br /> I would like to watch this movie if someone has a copy. And I would like to give it to my father for his 94th birthday this year!
