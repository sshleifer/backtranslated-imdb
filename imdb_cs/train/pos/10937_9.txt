For all the harassment, respect, and recognition that this film has received from Kung Fu historians, it is still lacking in several critical areas: action and combat scenes. But I have to say that the plot is probably the best and most original thing I've ever seen in a martial arts movie. Five Deadly Venoms must undoubtedly be seen, not just that, a movie that you can watch over and over again; but I also have to say that after watching it you feel like it could be even better. It somehow leaves you something, you want something more. Producer Chang Cheh sets the story beautifully for a potential master but does not respect us by giving us more of the action we want. Fighting styles in the movie really capture the viewer (centipede, snake, scorpion, lizard, toad) and are depicted, but the battles are noticeably short. Styles and snakes are especially interesting and should be shown much, much more, in fact the toad is killed in the middle of the film. Interestingly, with this movie, the absence of a constant action or fight leads to the development of a great plot, it's one of the few kung fu movies, where you really care about the story and care for the outcome. This film has a dark and sinister tone and you've pulled into the atmosphere. Criminal weapons and tactics of torture are used throughout the movie and increase the feel of the film. To run a movie and introduce a producer of the pagan clan, Chang Cheh takes us into a dirty prison. Ultimate fighting scenes are definitely good, but they seem to be subdued and somehow you expected more. Although this movie is one of the best Shaw brothers and is quite nice. My overall impression of the movie would be as follows: Styles used by fighters are just shown to us and are not shown in detail, the sad thing is that the director had something extraordinary to the right at his fingertips and did not expand on it. I do not understand what could be with this movie still one of the best. 8 out of 10 on the scale.
