This is one of the best 80s movies in the MY collection that I think all the time. <br /> <br /> The running man is one of Arnold's best and most diverse films, and when I first saw The Running Man, I was so excited to see such a movie. I just adore all the games and it's really a special movie. It is also Jesse Ventura, legendary professor Toru Tanaka, Sven-Ole Thorsen, beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso, Yaphet Kotto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson and Thomas Rosales Jr. they have been killed in such films as Universal Solder, The Lost World, Robo Cop 2, Predator 2 and among others. All fans of Arnold should love this movie from start to finish because its action is full, the star full and one of Arnold's best yet!
