Star Wars: Episode 4. <br /> <br /> Best Star Wars ever. his first movie, which I've ever won Sean, was the bad guy and his very good ending. it really had to wait for another star wars, because that's how things in this movie appear that you've learned more in the last. With many movies I always feel it can be a bed of bed, but do not whine this. and I will never forget that it was crazy Luke's player that he is his father. also love Bob feat the character and makes it a back ground player. if you've never seen a star wars movie, you're doing the best. <br /> <br /> thanks to Lucas
