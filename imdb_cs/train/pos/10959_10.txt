All I can say is that if you do not love Big and Little Edie after watching this movie, you are not human! Even after watching for the first time, I was closed. It is a charming experience that is difficult to describe, as certainly other fans assure. After what you've looked at, you'll cry when you think these two beautiful ladies are no longer with us. At least we have to remember Gray Gardens! I think we all wanted to have the rigid independence with which these two ladies were decorated. Although I always admired Jackie Onassis Kennedy, it does not stay in your heart like Big and Little Edie. What rare treatment these people know; I just wish I had it!
