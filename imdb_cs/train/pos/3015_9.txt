Why can not this compact, entertaining secret be filmed in the new century? It keeps the viewer thinking and guessing the whole way. Cast is a great set. William Powell shows real star quality. Who knows - maybe he tried his future like Nick Charles. It's a pleasure to watch. One can also see why Eugene Pallette produced more than 200 films. He is a great acting actor and his great chemistry with Powell is fun. Mary Astor has an over-average job in a big role. All other hands are on the chip to make it a nice way to spend 73 minutes. I suspect Michael Curtiz is driving his ball. Bravo!
