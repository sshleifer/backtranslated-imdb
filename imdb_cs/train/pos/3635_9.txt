this great Disney flick.it is the story of an aging baseball coach in high school (Dennis Quaid), who once went on a big league as a pitcher, but suffered a career that ended in a wound, but a series of events, Jimmy Morris (Quaid) a league team and even makes a roster. This is a great family film. It's inspirational, but it pours it on too thick. It's fun and fun. Adult enjoying this movie as well as kids.it is based on a true story, though I'm sure , that the creators did some freedom in telling the story.Quaid is sensational as the title character, very convincing. if you are looking for a movie of the entire family you can look forward to not look for another.9 / 10
