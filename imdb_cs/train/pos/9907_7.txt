"Slaughter High" is perhaps the most underestimated movie slash of the 1980s. This is one of the few films in a genre that is fascinating around the world. It is also said that it also relies on the standard slasher formula: a group of young men and women kills one after another horribly until the final showdown. The reason why "Slaughter High" stands above most of the films in his genre is that he's going over the top. Marty, a murderer, has good reasons to stand against his ex-classmates. They stood by the electric current as he stood naked in the dressing room's gauntlet, struck his crotch with the spear, and, to put it down, manipulated the experiment with the scientific lab to make him uneasy. So, the victims in this movie are about as overwhelming as you get. When they meet again a few years later - when you meet at a high school that Marty himself realizes, you realize they did not pay too much. There are a lot of sociopaths. Why should not they wonder why they were the only ones who showed up at the meeting, which incidentally takes place in a school that has since fallen into an emergency situation. And who would think it a good idea to drink beer and alcohol in an abandoned building in a room where old cupboards - just like Marty - appear on the screen? There are many leaps of faith that an audience needs to enjoy this movie. The end has little or no meaning. And the screenwriters have a strange understanding of how the stupid day of April works: The film claims that jokes are no longer allowed after noon. The whole movie is one of the best examples of the slasher genre, despite all its flaws. It's hard to understand why she has not found a way to DVD, when there are so many other Slasher films that are developing with specialized releases.
