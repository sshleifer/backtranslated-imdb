In the 1960s I was not alive, so I can not guarantee that this film was a very accurate display of the time, but it is certainly a moving and fulfilling experience. There are some outstanding performances, most notably Josh Hamilton (with honors), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders), who plays brothers divided by the war. Bill Smitrovich, a distinguished actor who ignores many people, gives his heart full of performance as his tough father who is forced to ask questions about his own beliefs and values ​​because one of his sons makes him a proud way to Vietnam but returns empty inside, while the other is exactly the opposite. Overall, this is a powerful and hearty film that I hope everyone will get a chance to experience.
