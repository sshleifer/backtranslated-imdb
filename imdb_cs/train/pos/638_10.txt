Who might think this show is not for them, try to try. Network television has degenerated into shows that are clones of clones, or reality shows based on some unrealistic people. This show is a return to family-oriented television where emphasis is placed on learning some life lessons, on how real friends and family want, and perhaps even learning a bit about our national entertainment. Jeremy Sumpter is one of the most exciting young performers in the show business and is perfectly occupied as a young, slightly naive new batboy for the fictitious New York Empires. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms are the main cast and are exceptional. This show deserves a chance to capture and be seen. Hopefully he will hold for several years and we can watch Pete Young (Sumpter character) learn and grow.
