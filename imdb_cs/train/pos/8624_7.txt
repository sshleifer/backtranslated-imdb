What is the best way to run a movie review like Der Todesking? Let me start by saying that I just came directly from viewing this film and the images are still burned deep into my brain - and I do not think they will be moving soon. <br /> <br /> It is probably fair to say that if you are on this page, you have a good idea what kind of movie it is, even if you have not seen it. If not, let me point out that this is not a medium-budget jewel that has been lost for several years and at the "Dark", nor is it a cheap, fun B-movie. What is a low budget of art, presented in a simple but painful way. The idea is simple - seven floors revolve around and end in suicide scattered shots of decomposing corpse. Sounds simple, even boring? It is not. Words can not really describe how powerful this film is when you are halfway; it practically attracts you to whether you want to go or not. <br /> <br /> I could go into the wand here about the technical advantages and disadvantages of the direction; maybe he points out that scenes are, of course, shot on super-8 cameras and sometimes they are restless. I could emphasize that some sound effects are out of sync to compete with any Fulco movie, but at the end of the day, it seems that it all fades into insignificance. as extreme movies go, I have seen the toughest of them, yet Der Todesking has moved me in such a way that it has succeeded in a few others, although it was not particularly cruel and had very few scenes that I would consider "unreasonable." In fact, the most difficult scene I found was the last story. I will not destroy it, just to say that the emotional agony of the character practically drips out of the screen and makes you sympathize if not longing for it to end. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's not the best movie ever made and seems to be rude and perhaps amateur in many places, but despite these defects, Der Todesking is an experience I would recommend to anyone who loves the demanding cinema . If you are someone who likes comfortable viewing or "nice" movies, or just wanting rude to something brutal and unnecessary, that's not what you are looking for. <br /> <br /> Whether you enjoy it or not, it does not matter what you do not forget to hurry.
