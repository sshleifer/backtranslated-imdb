One of the last great musicals of the 1960s. I was 7 years old when I first saw this movie and since then it's always popular. Music numbers are all unforgettable. In the 1960s, people who were cast in musicals were genuinely musical talents (as opposed to the Nomination of the Academy of Contemporary Musical in the Great Midwest City). All the major roles were beautifully populated ... Ron Moody shines like Fagin, like Shani Wallis like Nancy. Oliver Reed was a terrifying Bill Sikes (who fortunately has no musical numbers, lol), and Mark Lester as Oliver and Jack Wild as Dodger were also great. Mark Lester finds himself innocent, that's what Dickens intended when he wrote a book! Then of course there are dozens of dancers playing in "consider yourself", "I would do anything", "who will buy" and "be back soon", many children! It's a great show for the whole family.
