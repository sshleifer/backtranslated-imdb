It's a really healthy American story about teenagers who are interested in launching their own rockets in the rural town of West Virginia after the launch of Sputnik in 1957. Through testing, suffering and perseverance without conviction they are finally able to achieve their goals. Jake Gyllenhaal, as leader of the group, is excellent in the lead role. As its motivating science teacher, Laura Linney is pretty good, but her south accent is over the top. There is a standout supporting performance by Chris Cooper, the top miner, who wants his son to follow in his but gradually coming to the end of the film. What makes this movie so unusual for our times is that there are no scenes that would bend on the bed and there was no wrong at all. It is the embodiment of the American story that is well done. Besides the scientific point of view, we have the father and son disagreement, football scholarships as a way to escape coal mining and the loving family spirit. <br /> <br /> Why are not the photos that are so recognized in the award times?
