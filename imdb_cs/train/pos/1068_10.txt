I think Dark Angel is great! The first season was excellent and had a good story. With Max (Jessica Albou) escaping the X-5, Manticore work, he tries to adapt to normal life but still "saves the world". And be hunted manticore throughout the season, which gives the series some other spice. The second season, however, suddenly became a little odd compared to the first. The sketch has disappeared a little, and the series has lost some of its spell, mainly because all the strange "creatures" have appeared. Do not get me wrong, the second season is good, but a little bit of "manticores". In the final episodes of season 2, however, he managed to return to a promising new plot, in which I had plenty of hope to see more. <br /> <br /> So I really like an episode. And behind James Cameron it can not be bad. So, as a conclusion, I would say it's a great series, but I still hope for the third season!
