Cosimo (Luis Guzm√°n) is in prison informed of the perfect robbery. Because he is beyond the grid and can not do it himself, he has to leave his girlfriend Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson). Four people organize crime - five boys with very little brain capacity. Brothers Anthony and Joe Russo are the directors welcomed in Collinwood (2002). It's a crime comedy, which is often very fun. You can not help, but you laugh when those guys go wrong. actors who play these characters.William H.Macy plays Riley.Isaiah Washington is Leon.Sam Rockwell's Pero.Michael Jeter is Toto.Andy Davoli's Basil.Gabrielle Union plays his love interest Michelle.Jennifer Esposito plays Pen's love interest Carmela . George Clooney (also producer) plays Jerzy, a tattoo on a wheelchair. It's a very funny movie. I certainly recommend it.
