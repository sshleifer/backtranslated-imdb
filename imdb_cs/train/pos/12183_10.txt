One reviewer notes that it does not seem to matter what Welles actually says or does that will move you. I agree. He was and remains a unique force in the movie. More than a triple threat that could act, write and manage, had a genius that was uniquely suited to the film. It can be considered whether he would be a painter at an early age. This movie certainly strengthens this impression. Musician, theatrical actor, Shakespeare's heir? hard to say, but I'm very grateful that his time cam with the movie and he caught him on the film. I like the accent. I like face, size, style, mind and games. I love all his films and I wish there were more. I like the way other actors played with it. Many of them have never been better, or at least a little bit different because they were there. Even to the end when his beauty was destroyed, perhaps from his own intent, it could not be ignored and he did every scene he was in. Rita was a beautiful blonde - Lana Turner looks similar, but maybe even more loving and even then the eye goes to Welles and one wishes another minute, another movie, another hour in her company. That's why we all wish we could get to the lost scratches that were excluded from his films because we know that we all know that his part is not worthy of our time. Watch this and be grateful for the chance.
