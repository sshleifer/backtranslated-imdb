11 Oscar nominations and zero winnings !!! So far we will not understand why - as well as the actors in the movie, it's been a bit better you did it by awarding them trivial roles, like Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - Whoopi, Oprah, Margaret Avery, Danny Glover, - they were all amazing - I'm curious that I got the scripts for the Oscars' debates that year ...... it should go into the "Shoulda-would-cana" category for judges .... <br /> <br /> It's this amazing book - but in accordance with the style of writing Alice Walker has a way she looks as if she is exaggerating her characters - so I'm so glad that the screen of adaptation has solved a few things. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was amazing - African scenes live a lot to be desired - the African section of the book should be located in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - but not no! Steven Spielberg thinks the world is so stupid that they can not think of Africa outside the Safaris - yes, there must be a free scene of Zebra and wildlife when we all know there is no West Africa ---- and why people, who speaks in Swahili --- who speaks in Swahili in West Africa? I had to get out of the way ....... But like a story - amazing, film - from this world - CLASSIC yes! <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <i> I own it and I look at it when my soul needs some rejuvenation.
