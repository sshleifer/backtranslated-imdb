I just saw the release premiere of this movie and I was pleasantly surprised. It's not often that I see all of my favorite actors in one movie at a time. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the pocket scene and it was good to see Rachael Bilson and Hayden together. I think their chemistry on the camera is a direct result of their time out of the camera. My favorite scene was by far (surprisingly) Bret Ratner's piece ... Without giving too much away, I say that she is surprised to leave you ... <br /> <br /> The old couple were really good together and really you feel like they've spent their entire lives together. <br /> <br /> The Chris Cooper and Ethan Hawke segments wrapped in the surprise of the surprises that seem realistic and similar to the experiences I had in a big apple. Throughout the movie is a great place to meet ... especially if you love the city itself. I can not wait for another in the cities of love.
