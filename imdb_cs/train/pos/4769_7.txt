I'm sure this is a show that no one is, and it does not have to think well; after all, it is almost close to Baywatch Hawaii. With the actor, the place, the style of director and his publicity? showing women walking on the beach and everything. No wonder people have a misconception and decide not to look at it. <br /> <br /> It was bad they did it. Because I decided to watch the show, there are actually more things, a real juicy story and a conflict, to prove to be really exciting to watch and to a large extent? addictive. <br /> <br /> The story of hotel officials, manager, owner and their complicated love life. Also enter an unpleasant hotel visitor and a powerful man who tries to steal the hotel. It is much more exciting than it sounds. <br /> <br /> I do not deny that acting is sucking, but it's not so bad that you look away. The story is not as consistent, but good enough. The soundtrack makes the scenes fit quite well and the action is all the time. I took a few episodes before something really happened, so be patient. Recommendation: I am really happy to watch this. Zillion Times Better Than Expected. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7.5 / 10 (Stage: B) <br /> <br /> Please rate my rating after reading, thanks.
