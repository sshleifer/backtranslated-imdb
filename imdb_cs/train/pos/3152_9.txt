This show was great and I always look forward to seeing her. All the characters were funny and amazing in a way, each episode was a constant laugh, and it was absolutely amusing and different from many other performances. Everyone was just absolutely crazy and amazingly funny that you could not love this show. There have been several episodes of deadly things, but Show Showy has always managed to create a nice atmosphere where it really was not really matter. It was one of the best performances ever to be broadcast and I watch this show whenever I can, because it never gets older, never gets rid of it and never cares.
