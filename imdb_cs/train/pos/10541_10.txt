I thought it was a great movie. The theme song is sweet! :) Anyway, the only thing that bothered me a bit was at the beginning when everything was supposed to be normal. It was very strange and unrealistic. The big cable company is above all what I'm talking about. In addition, the film was very creative. I think all the action was well done, the players played perfectly their personality personalities. Everything fits well. It's really a shame that theirs is not a soundtrack. It would be great! Since it is a Canadian film and because it's one of my favorites, I give this movie 10 out of 10!
