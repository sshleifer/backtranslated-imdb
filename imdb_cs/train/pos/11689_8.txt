Hopefully, the score has now changed due to my brilliant and amazing review that convinces you to watch the movie and create an instant chorus "8", which is the real score of this movie. <br /> <br /> mentioned before Chris Rock is the King! Before I looked at this film, I was not over it, but now I'm banging on the door of Chris Rock's website asking me to take me as my protector. This movie is really fun if you do not find this movie fun, you really need therapy and it's a humor that focuses on all areas of society, including race (predictable), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams, standing comedy. but the list goes on. <br /> <br /> But for me, it was a slight disappointment. It was that when I entered this film I did not realize that it was really a remake of "Heaven Can Wait" another quite good film made in 1971 with Warren Beatty. As such, I was quite surprised to watch this movie and suddenly the plot began to reveal it to be clearly similar to the older movie I watched on TV a few weeks ago. Despite the fact that this film is, in my opinion, a better version from two of them simply because of the different areas he covers and the fact that Chris Rock is more entertaining than Warren Beatty any second of any day of any week of any year ... you get a picture. <br /> <br /> Good for the actual plot of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not throw away the experience for yourself! Do not read the story! Just go and watch the movie because there were two IMDb reviews so far as to be crazy about going see because it is the most fun thing you would see for a long time go and see because it's a movie experience that you he will not let the mourning of advertising nausea at the price of tickets to the cinema. Go ahead because it's a good movie!
