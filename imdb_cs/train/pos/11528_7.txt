I saw Lady with red hair when she appeared, and I did not remember it as something you should have. The truth is, despite her base in the real story, her screen is stupid and incredible. The true image is occupation. The constellations of some of the best players of the 1930s and 1940s are the backdrop for a subtle, intelligent work ever underestimated by Miriam Hopkins and the spectacular, spectacular performance of Claude Rains, which is as usual the best in the picture. What actor! He has never won Oscar, but is in good company with Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps Lady with red hair contains her best work in movies. Look at it and enjoy it. <br /> <br />
