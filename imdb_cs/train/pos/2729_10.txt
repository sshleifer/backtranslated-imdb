I voted well for how well he played, not for content. After reading the book, I still chill, but then I watch the movie. Two ex-disadvantages travel to their goal to rob a family of money from a secure one of the consultants learned in jail. During the ride, the tension begins to change as the soundtrack in the movie contributes to the overall expectation. After the murders end up with their work on the farm, the next morning the family remains found by a friend of her daughter. A crunching cry, when the cut-cord phone touched the phone, it really made my blood cold and chilled me. The fact that the murderers have met their righteous fates is a little comfort for this convicted family. Robert Blake was outstanding in Perry Smith's performance. The book was also greatly written by Truman Capote.
