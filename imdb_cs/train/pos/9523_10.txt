I loved this movie! I'm a real fan of Tom Hanks and I was always amazed at my work. From his most dramatic roles, such as Cast Away, Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 and Philadelphia. To his cheerful role, such as Their Own League, Turner and Hooch, Catch Me If You Can, The Lady Killers, Big & Of course Toy Story. But in this film, Hanks is not the only great actor to turn on the screen. Tyler Hoechlin, star starred and enthusiastic, who hears big promises in Hollywood stars as the son of Hanks, and provides nothing but great performance. He is certainly someone who cares about his career, I believe he will do great things. Paul Newman, as always, delivers great performance on the screen. It's a legend indeed. We can not forget the people who did not play such a big role in the film, but they helped us. Beautiful and very talented Jennifer Jason Leigh, who will perform at Bastard Out of Carolina & Single White Woman, will never forget, bringing her grace to the screen as Hank's wife in the movie and doing great work. Liam Aiken is another treasure in the movie. He does such a great job with such a small role, and just like his roles in Lemony Snickets, and Sweet November, and I dreamed of Africa gives great performance.
