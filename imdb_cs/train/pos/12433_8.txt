This is a good film, though people who are not familiar with Modesta Blaise's comics and books can be a bit slow and lacking action. For the fan of Modesta, the film will be very pleasant, especially because it is very faithful in its presentation of "history" by Modesta Blaise. Peter O'Donnell is featured in credits as a "creative consultant," and filmmakers have really had to pay attention to him as the plot follows the details that have been made in the comic over the years (although the events have been reworked into modern days). The only thing a real fan can see as disappointing is that the story is not Willie Garvin. This lack of Willie is again just the true chronology of Modesta Blaise, because the film takes place in the early days of Modesta's career. Alexandra Staden is a very believable young Modesty, which in fact looks a lot like Modesta looks like. A welcome change from Monika Vitti's portrait to Modesta portrait.
