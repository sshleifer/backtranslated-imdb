I saw this kung fu movie when I was a kid, and I thought it was so cool! Now I'm 26 years old and my friend has it on DVD! <br /> <br /> We have a cooking case and watched this classic! Lost NONE of his original kungfu comfort! If you are a fan of kung fu / karate movies, it is necessary to see ... DVD is available. I believe this movie is also called "Choose Your Poison". <br /> <br /> Watch it soon!
