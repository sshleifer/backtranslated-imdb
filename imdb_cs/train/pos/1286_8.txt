This famous story of an older man / younger woman is surprisingly tough. Bikers, hippies, free love and bait mingle surprisingly well in this forgotten black-and-white Indian effort. Leading actress Patricia Wymer, as the headline "Candy", gives the best performance of her career (including all 3 epic units). Wymer was premature and flew in YOUNG GRADUATES (1971), but gave a more serious performance in the BABYSITTER series. Occasional violence and regular nudity are somewhat surprising, but well done by the director. Leaders Wymer and George E. Carey sell a romantic flowering / December faithfully. There is plenty of similarity between BABYSITTER and YOUNG GRADUATES to wonder if the same director has also helped the last movie. Patricia Wymer, where are you? From broadcasting from Seattle, WA, Miss Wymer appeared as a dancer on the rock and roll show MALIBU U before she made a blanket (as it appeared in the eight-page spread) August, 1968 edition of "Best for Men," tasteful adult magazine. She also appeared as a witch coven in a popular 1969 culture-and shock WITCHMAKER. BABYSITTER finally made his home video debut, as part of the eight-film BCI box set up DRIVE-IN CULT CLASSICS Vol. 3, available at Amazon.com and some retail stores such as Best Buy.
