1st observation 29. 8. 2009 - 7 of 10 (Dir-Sidney Franklin): Well said about farmers in China and their rise to the importance and struggle with what Mother Nature is throwing on them. This film is based on an award-winning novel and records a family starting with a son's marriage agreement with a slave. The film does a good job of keeping your interest despite somewhat shocking performance by Paul Muni. He is a chronicler, Wong Long (the figure of Muni), and how he works on land, buys more land, eventually becomes very rich, but then returns to the land where he originally began. The relationship between him and his wife, played by Luise Rainer, is the main theme of the story (except for the country itself) and despite obvious non-Chinese actors it does pretty well work to show the country and it's people. It is clear that MGM used its money to create a really good epic with this at a time when they could probably afford it. The grasshopper scene is doing exceptionally well and the rest of the movie really looks good, which guarantees the best cinema award this year. The definitive definition of an epic is what this story is and it is quite good.
