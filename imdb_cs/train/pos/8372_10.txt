What a masterpiece. Take the conflict of the Cold War and transfer it to the future. This film is a satire of the highest order. In my humble opinion, this is superior to Dr. Strangelove. Clever designation of two superstars like the Confederacy and the market. Disadvantages are commies and Market, West! excellent. The clever use of the Jox gene was some time ago. we really only see the dangers of genetic engineering. Robot joxs solved the problem head in 1989. The message of this film is about the komradeship of a humble man and how it can overcome the wishes of the government. These movies are screaming NOT TO SURE YOU HAVE YOU, STILL ALL ALL. <br /> <br /> EXCELENT 10/10
