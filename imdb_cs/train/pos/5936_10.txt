I just saw it .... for those who do not know what it is, I recommend downloading the whole picture and enjoying its viewing ... it's a bit of an amateur trailer featuring the same producer of the famous short Batman Dead End, but this time except the black knight is also Superman ... It would be amazing if they made the whole movie ... but I'm afraid it's almost impossible, especially just before the official Batman 5 movie. <br /> <br /> - It's no bigger crime than peace than rejection fight for it. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo 'Purifier' Pinto
