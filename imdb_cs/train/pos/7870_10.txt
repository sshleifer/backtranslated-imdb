The film is a real demonstration of how the unselfish and selfish upper society has become. He has a lot of characters and each character represents another category of people. No character is 100% good and moral in contrast to the heroes of all typical Indian movies and no character is 100% bad, but all are different. The film is a perfect blend of emotions, drama and fun. For the first time, I liked the film that caused some social questions. I would recommend everyone to see the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist who deals with these hip-shaking parties from Bollywood for the newspaper, but it is a story of how she has become a newspaper crime reporter. But that's not all, then it shows how she could not survive there, and when she helped save some innocent children, how brutally her voice was suppressed. She even shoots her out of work. Then she could not find the criminal reporter's work and must do it again. Not only her but a very large number of characters intermingle in the movie and everyone gives a different feeling when watching the movie. I would really like to congratulate the director for making such a great movie. Please do not let it miss you.
