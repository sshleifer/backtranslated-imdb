For true movies, this film is a must, because it works as a perfect little allegory for movies themselves. Jan Rukh / Boris Karloff's science has to do with capturing and showing light from cosmic phenomena. This light can hurt, or it can be used for good. On the one hand, she blinds her mother, and on the other she is used to healing blindness ("I see!" A young girl exclaims, on whose eye this light is reflected). When Rukh / Karloff is poisoned by the strange power of this light, we can see that he truly radiates a ghostly glow on his hands and his face as a badly developed negative, highlighting the fact that the person we are watching is the projection, entity seen on the film cinema when the lights are out). There is an amazing passage near the beginning, where Karloff / Rukh explains his research as an informed fact that everything that happens is captured in the light that has been sweeping through space for millions of years because the light of Andromeda was launched from this galaxy at a time, when the earth was still melted rock. <br /> <br /> There are passes in the movie when this new science is adjacent to older cultural vehicles: that writer, in the person of Beulah Bondi / Arabella Stevens; and religion, symbolized in sculpture figures at local Karloff cathedral shots with a projector / ray gun. <br /> <br /> One has to wonder if this film should look at what was happening in Germany, and especially when using the Riefenstalle film, which was used a year ago to support a regime that would certainly continue to do a lot of damage: The Triumph of Will. <br /> <br /> Luckily, Mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) will hit and reminds Jan Ruck of the first rule of science. <br /> <br /> If there are more films in the theater, you'll want to get up and shout, "I see!"
