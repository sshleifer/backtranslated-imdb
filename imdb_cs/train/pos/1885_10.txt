It has been one of my favorite films for a long time. I was recently happy to see it on DVD, which is a relief from watching old, grainy versions of VHS. I have not seen it for years and looked at it today to be amazed at how well the film stands up to the time. It's one of those rare, perfect storm comedies, where great writing (a really funny line over a really funny line) blends in a great direction and excellent performance at the same time. Dudley Moore earned an Oscar nomination for "Arthur," but he lost (though John Gielgud won the best actor). If Moor's performance in the movie "Arthur" did not win an Academy Award for Best Actor - it is proof that no comedian actor can ever win the title (another example is Gene Wilder in "Young Frankenstein"). Steve Gordon Crafting a film that beautifully preserves all the characters and a warm story. Simply, IMHO is a precious gem. It's sad that Steve Gordon died just a year after Arthur was released. <br /> <br /> As far as the DVD is available since 1/2007, it's so. Although video quality is a jump over old VHS copies, there is still no widescreen version available. The DVD has some extras that are nice but not enough. One example is the director's comment, which states how much he wished how some deleted scenes and scenes could be included (because they were hysterical) but that he had to make a difficult decision for the final adjustment. The DVD, which is the perfect format for including such material, should definitely offer it. <br /> <br /> This, the original "Arthur," is a classic comedy that is one of the books.
