Arthur is a wealthy "middle-aged kid" who drinks like a fish. Arthur does what he feels and tells what he wants. He likes to boast of his riches and knows he is a corrupt crocodile. He spends money on people he does not know and finds everything funny. Arthur has to marry a high-class girl to inherit great luck, but falls in love with poor waitress Liza Minnelli (looks really weird). This is a damn funny movie. I watched this film because the very famous Indian film "Sharabee" is based on the character of Arthur. Although "Sharabee" is certainly inspired by "Arthur," I think it's two different movies. "Arthur" is just fun. It's rarely occasionally. There are so many fantastic movies in the movie. It's not a laugh, but it has a few fantastic moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his fianc√©'s father and still talks about "love". Duddley Moore has some comedic timing. He is very good with the words and tongue of the body. I liked the scene where she speaks to a permanent member of the hotel about a "small" country and still speaks to her husband and wife in two ways. John Gielgud won Oscar for this film. I do not even know the actor. I do not think he would do a great job, but it may be if I look more at his work that I can agree in the future. The film has some flat patches but not too long. looking forward to following up.
