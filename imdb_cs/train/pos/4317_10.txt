I really liked this movie when it was released, and I'm still doing because the story gives you a sense of hope for life in general and people too ... one of the things I like about Lawrence Kasdan. In addition to the positive vibes from the film, there are other reasons, such as the Grand Canyon. One thing has an excellent cast ... Kevin Kline and Danny Glover. In my opinion, Crash, a highly acclaimed film that won Oscar for Best Picture, was very similar to this film. The difference is that the Grand Canyon leaves the feeling of positivity. Crash had the opposite effect with me; it was very dark. I'd choose Grand Canyon through Crash every day.
