Absolutely great show. The second season began when the first one ended, with great secrets. It stays in most, if not everywhere, everywhere and everywhere. The one who was thinking and thinking again. It's really amazing how the writer can come out with all the links and connect all the characters together and combine all these elements to make the lives of the characters in the show so meaningful. They never get excited and I'm looking forward to a new season. Hopefully more secrets will appear, and at the same time, more mysteries will be resolved. A good selection of cast for this show, perfectly suited by characters. I really can not wait to finally discover secrets. Hopefully, all hype will not end.
