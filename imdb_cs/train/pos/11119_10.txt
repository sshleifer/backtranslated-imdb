There are so many reasons why I evaluate sopranos so high, one of the greatest triumphs being cast and character. Each series is growing more and more. Also, each series has a number of different "small time characters" as well as the main ones. A good example of the character (which was only in three episodes) you can feel is David compulsive player that played greatly Robert Patrick. Every little detail builds a perfect TV series. The show revolves around boss Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), who is trying to balance her life as a crime father. The show is not afraid to be courageous and strong due to dialogue and ideas, and so it is so credible. While Tony is driving things with kapos Paulie (Tony Sirico) and Silvio (Steve Van Zant), his nephew Christopher (Michael imperioli) is looking for promotion. Each episode also includes another Tony family including his children and wife Carmela soprano (Edie Falco). In addition to these problems, his uncle Junior Soprano (Dominic Chianese) tries to get what he can from Tony's business, even if he is under house arrest. All actors are strong and characterized as complex, but the most prominent are: James Gandolfini, who is "Tony Soprano." Also, Michael Imperioli, who plays Christopher, represents the younger (20-30) generation in crime, and if David Chase did not create this masterpiece, modern dramas of such caliber as The Wire and Dexter did not exist. Soprano is certainly Godfather, Goodfellas and Pulp fiction TV
