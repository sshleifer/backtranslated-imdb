A talking parrot is not an incredibly imaginative idea for a new film, but Paulie turns a simple idea into a brilliant, heartbreaking movie that will delight the whole family. It can bridge the gap between sentimental waste and cruel roughness during Marie's and Paulie's separation, and all the events in the film lead to an extremely satisfying emotional conclusion. Animal training is well done - everyone will be affected when Paulie first spreads his wings and flies. Paulie is a great character and should be more successful, although this film was not the culmination of 1998, unlike Saving Private Ryan. This hour and a half will surely be pleasant and one that you will remember. Paulie's story is sad, sad, happy, and exciting - from the moment it's first seen until it's unified with its original owner, you'll love to watch and watch him learn about friendship and the cruel reality of life way. You will not miss if you have any heart or emotion. 9/10
