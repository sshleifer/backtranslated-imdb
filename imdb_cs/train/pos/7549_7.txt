A young cat tries to steal his brother's brothers from death but gets only half and then has to go adventurous to get the other half ... or maybe not. <br /> <br /> I honestly am not sure what will happen in this film, which is full of very strange, very surreal images, some of which parents may be disturbing (ie the cats that cut a part of the pig that is traveling with them and fry them like bacon, which all three eat). This is a very strange film some have likened to Hello Kitty's acid, I think it's more like Hello Kitty, as Dali does. (It is definitely even more vivid than Destino, which was directly based on his work). If you are going to have a movie that would attack you in perceiving things, then look at this movie. Just be prepared for some very strange images that will be fired into your memory forever. <br /> <br />
