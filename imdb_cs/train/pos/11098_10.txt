Brendan Filone is the absolute best figure in Soprano. he died by shooting him in the eye. It was the best and well orchestrated scene ever performed in Soprano. Brendan Filone is too good. Brendan Filone will pursue his junior uncle in his dreams until Uncle Junior can take him. Brendan Filone is the best figure. Brendan Filone was killed in Episode # 3, Denial, Wrath, Adoption. But his link will live forever. Brendan Filone is the best figure on the Soprano! Brendan Filone is the best character ever. I recommend this show to anyone who likes Drama and wants to see scenes of good death and great direction and production because it does not get better than this series. Brendan Filone is the best.
