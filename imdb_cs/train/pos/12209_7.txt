I was very impressed with this small, independently created picture. The story, about a few social exiles who meet, become friends, and they provide a supportive system that is as if they lacked children, is sometimes cheerful, sometimes sad, but always provocative. Music, mostly underground bands, has been used to great effect, as well as experimenting with camera angles, filters and slow or fast motion techniques. The show (the lead actors are writers and film directors) are some of the best I've seen in the last few years. If you ever feel the pin is forced into a round slot, I really believe you will appreciate "Hook or By Crook".
