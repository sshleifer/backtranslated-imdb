Very nice pilot. The show is better movies by Tim Burton ... Edward Sissorhands, Big Fish, Charlie and chocolate factory. Cinematography, storytelling, music, external shouting shout Tim Burton. There has to be a connection or a strong influence, I just have not studied enough to know where it is. <br /> <br /> As I saw in the forums, yes, Anna Friel plays the poor man Zooey Deschanel. Every time I see her on the screen I see Zooey. Do not get me wrong, Anna Friel does a great job. Her character is very nice and nice and you can easily join her. It's more of a distraction that I'm still thinking about, "Why did not they get Zooey Deschanel?" Lee Pace is also doing a great job. Every time I tried to remember where I knew him, I just looked at it. Wonderfalls !!! A great and short series since 2004. If you like Pushing Daisies, you have to go to Wonderfalls, which is another work by Brian Fuller hmmmm She loved seeing Swoosie Kurtz (World According to Garp) and Ellen Greene (Little Shop of Horrors) again. Two underestimated actors that they never can bring with their performances.
