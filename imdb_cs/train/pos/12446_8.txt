When he heard about Modes Blaise, but never read a novel or a comic book I liked a lot with our wife. It has brought an interesting introduction to the character and its background. Even if it has some action elements, it's much more an intimate game, greatly written. It's sad that it's also where the film's big disadvantage is revealed. The intimate game lives on the actors' abilities, and unfortunately, only half the cast. While Alexandra Staden did an excellent job as Modesta Blaise, her counterpart Nikolai Coaster-Waldau - like a villain Miklos - did not do it. Smiling his way through the conspiracy, as if it were an extensive advertisement for toothpaste, he could not create an atmosphere of anxiety that would make the film a masterpiece. The support of the cast is somehow similar, from some stereotypical gangsters and curators to decent performances by Fred Pearson as Professor Lob and Eugenie Yuan as Irina.
