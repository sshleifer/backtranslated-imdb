<br /> <br /> The introduction of Lily Mars is one of the genre films that apparently disappeared with the studio system. Okay now that you know my preoccupation, here are some reasons why I think this movie excels. <br /> <br /> 1. Although the basic story - Lily Mars (Judy Garland) - goes to New York, she becomes a star and wins the heart of her director (Van Heflin) is a fairly popular Hollywood story of this time, writers differ in the subject it's a bit more than usual. Although Lily gets her big break when the star is over, she is not successful and has to swallow her pride and return to a small role in the show. <br /> <br /> 2. Judy Garland (enough said!) <br /> <br /> 3. The cast support contains some really great performances. Spring Byington as Lily's mother is really great, just like Fay Bainter (the mother of the director - John Thornway (Van Heflin)). The standout supporting performance is yet to actress Connie Gilchrist as Frankie, the only actress to become the custodian of the theater. It's definitely a watch. One of those films that are designed to make you feel better in the world and your dreams.
