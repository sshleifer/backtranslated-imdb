Not to mention Pierce Brosnon's best performance. Of course, Greg Kinnear is always great. Really, when was it really bad? I think this movie is incredibly underestimated! The use of colors in this movie is very different in today's film world where every other movie has a blue Payback filter. I also love the way the song uses Asia. Prove that even what was once considered a bit cheesy can be really well located. <br /> <br /> When I left, I did my first job. Because my film was a hit-man movie, I had to look at something in the genre that was released. After what I saw, I'm sure it has some influence on me. It was pretty cool when my film got on IMDb that it would recommend this movie if you liked mine. As for any of the others, I have no idea, to make even more interesting coincidence. <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
