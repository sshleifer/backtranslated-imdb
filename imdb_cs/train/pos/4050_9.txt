Everyone who finds this movie boring is a hopeless skeleton that should hold films and romantic comedies. This movie is riveting and does not have a tedious moment. Why? Since it is basically included in intelligent dialogue between real people at the time of the crisis and details of their efforts to survive this crisis. Repeat - smart dialogue! This is what characterizes almost all of Rohmer's films and that is why many people do not like it. They prefer action. Okay, let them spend the rest of their lives watching action movies, while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to look for such movies. <br /> <br /> Rohmer has always been accused of being "talky". Well, that is, but for me it is a compliment, not a critique. Shakespeare was also talky. Is there a speech game than "Hamlet?" Whenever a theme or theme of an artwork consists of thoughts and conflicts of values, it is essential to discuss these ideas and values, which is basically what the film is all about. Aristocracy and noble birth vs. egalitarianism; loyalty to old friends that is submitted to the final test when that friend takes what we consider to be the wrong way; the values ​​of human life and responsibility to help save this life, even if the person who has this life is not so pretty or even contemptuous. (Who ever heard about Dostoyevsky or "crime and punishment?") That's what this movie is all about. The two leads in this movie are flawless as if they were born to play those roles. Lucy Russell, who is English and speaks French as her second language, is especially great. Make a favor and see this riveting movie. This can be the last movie on the Master screen.
