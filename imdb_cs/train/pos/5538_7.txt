The couple (Janet and Richard) are camping in the woods at a huge swamp. After camping and enjoying nature, the couple will meet what they consider to be an abandoned house. Soon a couple of expelled convicts will appear and, after a long delay of inevitable, they continue to rape Janet and block Richard into a bird cage. This LAST HOUSE on LVM-like film must be one of the most underestimated horror films ever made. He is one of the more sick and twisted early 70s. Moreover, I found that it was quite charming and beautiful in its perverse tone. I love CAGED TERROR. Music definitely helps to impress a personality as well as a lot of beauty. I found the movie that's pretty scary. <br /> <br /> Errors are mainly related to the movement of the film, which means that the film is rather slow and meandering. While I did not mind the pace of the curse and tension of the movie, I think it will be the majority of people. The effect is not good or dialogue, at least in early scenes. This movie takes a little more patience than usual and it's not for everyone. <br /> <br /> In short, it was a good movie. It's not the biggest horror movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely a lot of fun. This is not the easiest movie. It's possible to find it in the USED section of many stores if you look hard enough. It's not for everyone, but if you're a fan of trash cinema, it's definitely worth it.
