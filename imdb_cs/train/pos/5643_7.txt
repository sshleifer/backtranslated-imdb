Mary Pickford ("Born July 4" as Angela Moore) is "Little American" (French Heritage); she falls in love with Jack Holt (like Karl von Austreim) who moved to America with her German father and American mother. French-American Raymond Hatton (as Count Jules de Destin of "Fighting Destins") fell in love with Mrs. Pickford. The love triangle trio eventually ended in France, with a great war (World War I, behind the scenes) complicating their lives considerably. Very entertaining, though propagandistically flawed, film Cecil B. DeMille. The torpedoing and sinking of Pickford's ship is "Titanic". The war intrigue becomes dramatic as Pickford slowly becomes a secret spy for France, while the Germans occupy her ancestral home. Of course, the German lover Holt will come. It was hard to believe that they had long enjoyed meeting each other when they moved into rape but were dark; and earlier events believed dead with each other. The film continues in its symbolic form. Pickford was by the way Canadian - although few people could deny that he was not a "little American" for all purposes and purposes. FUN in place of "extras" who later became major stars include Wallace Beery, Colleen Moore and Ramon Novarro - especially watching Mr. Novarra, which shows "stellar" quality during one of the most memorable sequences: Pickford and the wounded soldier greet each other, when she takes her on a stretcher. Novarro even gets Mary Pickford to write a letter; of course he has a picture in the future. Also in the future is Ben Alexander, who plays the guy "Bobby"; he becomes a reliable child actor and grows to become a partner of Jack Webb on "Dragnet". <br /> <br /> ******* Small American (7/12/17) Cecil B.
