Well, it is again a movie that plays with your feelings and you are all soft as opposed to a rock movie. But I'm fun for you, so I gave him a good score ... the acting was very good and there were lots of feelings. Violence is kept to a minimum, causing change. It would be 9 if it was not for the greetings! Overall a good film with very good actors. <br /> <br />
