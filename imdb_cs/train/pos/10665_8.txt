As a rejection, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years and this week I just saw the musician. This allowed me to judge the movie without being damaged by what was or was not in the musical (but it made me nervous when I watched the music :)) I believe Michael Douglas worked quite well in this role with Kasey. I think it's one of the best parts of the movie, let me dance dancing, which is useful compared to the musical. Dancers and singing in the movie are much better than musical, just like a cast that is at least ten times bigger (easier to do in the movie, of course). Decorations, lighting, dancing and singing are much better in the movie, which can be expected and actually delivered. <br /> <br /> The songs that were in common with the musical work are better done in the movie, the new ones are quite good and the whole film just in my opinion brings more than musical, especially when compared to a musical that has few decorations. One bad point of the film is an obvious passage between actors who speak and dub the singers while singing a portion for some of the characters but their dance is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical
