1936 was the most productive year for Astaire and Rogers. Their second film for RKO that year is the third film in this collection? Mark Sandrich 'Follow the Fleet.' This time, Astaire is painfully uncomfortable as Bake Baker, a vacation sailor who just encounters a breathtaking quay on the seafront, where Sherry Martin (Rogers) fights romantic sweet nohings in each ear. Yeah, did you guess it? they are hot again. Only this time Sherry's spinster sister, Connie (Harriet Hillard) threatens all the gentle romance of the fall for Bake's robust marine companion, Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott); some way of using them and driving them out of a guy, forcing Sherry to reconsider his opinion on all seafarers in general. Irving Berlin comes with classical classic ratings, including "Let Yourself Go", "I Lay My Egg in One Basket" and "Let's Face the Music and Dance," the second is a divinely inspired sketch of suicide that turns into another instantly recognizable a deep, deeper pas deux for Fred and Ginger. <br /> <br /> The transition to 'Follow the Fleet' is weaker, the gray scale remains fairly balanced, but now it's tough looking, with no tonal variation as the previous titles. is still present as well as age-related artefacts, and once you settle into a slightly dense and sometimes finer image quality, the overall impression is more than acceptable for this year's movie, the sound is Mono but very well balanced. a trailer and a short subject, but strangely no sound commentary, considering the importance of this film in the overall canon Astaire / Rogers, it's an atypical oversight by Warner Home Video.
