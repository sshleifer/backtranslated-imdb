This movie is one highly recommended. This is the boy Stanley Yelnats (Shia LeBeouf), who was wrongly convicted of crime and sent to Green Lake's camp, a refuge for the guy. There he is forced to dig holes at a depth of 5 feet and a diameter of 5 feet. While there he meets other camp boys (Zero, Magnet, Underarm, Squid, X-Ray and ZigZag). They all dig, not "build a charactor," but find Kate Barlow's legal treasure. Throughout the movie (and books) Stanley learns more about the past, about himself and more about digging holes. I give this film 9.5 because I'm very picky when it comes to books in movies (I want the movie to watch the book exactly). But it really did work well.
