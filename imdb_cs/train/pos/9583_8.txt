I waited for a while to publish a review of this document, because when I first saw him more than 10 years ago, I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write. <br /> <br /> I found the documentary view that it was a nasty good document. She did what she was about to show me something I did not know, and kept me interested in the world she was researching. I did not know anything about Drag's world and I found out about them and the "Sphere" was great for me. These people were just so gifted about what they do and how they do it because of competition. The ravenous people, the complainants (I was even angry when someone told the judges that the coat Drag Queen was wearing was not a male coat!) Jealous, it's all like any other competition. Like any other competition. I felt it was a point. You had an older dragged queen who spoke about how the balls were "used" to compare with newer overflowing queens who changed the balls and created more categories of competitions - and even those who were watching the future of the balls will change even more when they are ready to go through the track. It was interesting to hear that some contestants live on the street two minutes before the ball, but they came to compete, it was important to them! Then sad stories appeared, stories about who is "house" and "mother of the house" brought the best and brightest in the competition. It was interesting. After 10 years, when I saw this movie, I added Madonna. I've seen some of the familiar faces of this document that ended with Madonna during my Vogue phase and rightly so. If not for these individuals, Madonna would not HAVE the "Vogue" stage, I know it now. The loan should be granted if the loan is DUE. I was wondering if anyone else in the mainstream of America would be watching this document, they learn that they are not the "main stream" they think.
