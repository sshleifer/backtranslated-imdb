Chloe is mysteriously rescued by Dr. Caselli, a corrupt doctor who is responsible for transferring patients with Belle Reve skills to Project 33.1, and a fraction of a second later comes Clark. He found that Bart Allan had returned to Smallville and met in Kent's farm. When Bart is captured by Lex during a break at LuthorCorp, Clark finds that Green Arrow also hired Bart (aka Impulse), Arthur Curry (Aquaman), and Victor Stone (Cyborg) to investigate Project 33.1. Clark accepts to join the tribe to save Barth and invites Chloe to take part in their mission. "Justice" is the best episode so far in this 6th season. In this episode, the League of Justice will begin its saga with an association of five heroes: Clark, Green Arrow, Flash ("Impulse"), Aquaman and Cyborg. Chloe's participation is spectacular and completes the organization's need for teamwork. Finally, Oliver will say goodbye to Lois, based on the importance of fighting criminals and Lex secret laboratories all over the world.
