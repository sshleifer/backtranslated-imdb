This film takes place in the 1950s. According to this, the dead (called zombies) were born to eat a livelihood. However, the company has developed a collar, which, when placed around the neck of the zombies, makes them obedient and perfect servants. Robinsons's mother, Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), Dad Bill (Dylan Baker) and Timmy's son (K'Sun Ray) hired zombies because everyone in their block already has one. Tim names Zombie Fido (Billy Connolly) and becomes friends with him. But his father hates him, and Timmy will lose control of Fide and things will go wrong. As you can see, it is - among many other things - take off on the "Lassie" series, with Fido standing for Lassie. Timmy was named for some reason! Each of Lassie's most famous episodes is rotated here. My favorite is when Timmy sends Fida away to get help before the zombies eat him! It's also the satire of Douglas Sirko's 1950 films, where everything is clear and colorful - but the dark secret divides people. The figures wear VERY Bright Dresses from the Summer of 1950 (Moss is always in the dress) - Furniture, settings and cars are all above all the 1950s in hyper-bright colors. Even if the script becomes repetitive, it always looks at it. The script is good - but there are just so many Lassie jokes you can do. The melodramatics are a little stupid, but the cast will pull it off. Everyone here is great and at the finish. Even Connolly as a nonsense zombie does a good job. Moss is the best - he plays every line at his cost - but never goes beyond. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone (of course). Satire can be lost in most people and the gore is quite tame. Gore is doing so carefree and thanks to the happy music he's playing, it's hard to take him seriously. So for some people it really works. I give it 8.
