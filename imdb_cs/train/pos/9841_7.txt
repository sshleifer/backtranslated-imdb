I love cartoons. They can show things that movies with "real" actors and sceneries can not - although computer effects are changing more and more. They can push the sabers ("The Simpsons"), "South Park", "Aladdin" or "Toy Story". There are some good examples in this "ice age", for example, when we see a herd consisting of today's extinct mammals migrating across the countryside and talking like old friends. Such scenes are a pleasure to watch because we have a sense of both familiar and strange at the same time, usually by laughing at us. While Ice Age is not as good as top animated movies of all time, it's really a fun movie. Sit down, enjoy intense anachronisms, beautiful backgrounds and belly-laughs. The story follows Manfred, an ugly mammoth, Sid, an idiot lazy, and Diego, a shaggy tiger. the human child back into his tribe - for very different reasons. Naturally, they have a lot of problems on the way. Also appears throughout Scrat, the worst rodent of history, who desperately tries to cover up the acorn for the winter: in the glaciers, on the top of the dead trees, in the ice caves. His opening scene is classic. This is a simple story with a very predictable end and environment that is just a series of fun events with some moments of character building, but some scenes such as diaper or dodos are funny, the animals are nice and look good. There is also quite a touching moment when the paintings of cave painters come to life before Manfred's eyes. <br /> <br /> It's not necessary, but it's good for a fun hour or so. <br /> <br /> <br /> 7/10
