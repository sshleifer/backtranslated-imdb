It's a wonderful movie. Nonstop patter takes several observations to fully realize. Busby Berkeley's music production will never be repeated. I think this movie will easily overcome all of its further efforts. Joan Blondell and James Cagney are incredibly together. Some of humor would almost push the boundaries of today's films. Provide a rational explanation of how they have done it aside and enjoy it for the performance that is.
