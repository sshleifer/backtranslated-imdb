This movie is so old that I never realized how young Ray Milland looks in 1936, I remember playing in the great movie "Lost Weekend". Ray plays the role of Michael Stuart, a very wealthy banker. There are three girls in this picture who are not too happy when their father and mother separate and find out that their father will marry a young blonde who is a golden treader just looking for a rich sugar father. The men who want to portray themselves as a very wealthy earl, the name is Count Ariszted (Misha Auer), who is still drunk and has no character and gives a lot of comic laughter all over the painting. Deanna Durbin (Penny Craig) surprised everyone when she was booked at a police station and told the police chief that she was an opera star, and then Penny started singing with the most amazing soprano voice I heard, the entire police department and the convicts began to applaud, which was very fun and pleasant scene from this movie. This is Deanna Durbin's first debut, which has become an immediate success at night and after leaving MGM, she has become a great movie star with Universal Studios.
