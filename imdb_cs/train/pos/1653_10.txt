I agree with everyone who says that this series was the best of the "spy" genre. My husband and I were fascinated by the fact that they were broadcasting for the first time in the US and watching each episode. I was trying to buy a series at the time (everything I filmed), but WGBH told her it was not available. I even thought I wrote to Ian Holm to see if he had a copy! Like others, I bought and read the Deighton series (partly to understand a complicated plot.) If the original version is ever available on DVD, I will be among the first in a row to copy a copy. Ian Holm's portrait of the vulnerable but brave Bernard Samson was amazing. (It's always awesome.)
