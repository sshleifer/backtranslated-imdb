Without Peter Ustin and Maggie Smith, it might be Turkey. But they are great. Ustinov is in his best position and Maggie fans are great to see her in the early days, while Ustinov adapts to every step of the way and timing. For the English at the age of fifty (and I'm in this band) it's always fun to see the flashes and hear the sounds of the Swinging Sixties, and though this movie spends a lot of office time, it has a lot of nostalgia of the 1960s, including red buses, Carnaby Street, and a delicious shot of a micro-serviced waitress that England has never seen in public places since. As I.T. engineer, I know computer hacker tricks are ridiculous, but they should not be taken seriously. Nor are the wonderful stereotypes of Italians, Frenchmen and Germans.
