I first saw this movie at the theater in France. He came and went with a small fanfare, but I liked it for the beauty of landscape photography and the fascinating experiences of the wilderness. (Although the story is pretty, it's really random. If you really thought about it, there's no way most of what happens could happen in real life.) I just saw it tonight, here in the states , on DVD. Again, I think it has a very limited layout. Blockbusters had only one copy, and I do not remember ever playing in the Cleveland arts houses. Looking at my TV, photography is not as breathtaking as it is still very beautiful. The record of wildlife is still fascinating. The story of the relationship between a ten-year-old child and a fox is even less convincing a second time when you know where it's going. Yet, as I said, the story is random. It's a beautiful movie that you can watch, and if you like footage of wildlife, you should find it fascinating.
