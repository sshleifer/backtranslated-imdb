Zodiac Killer (2005) was an interesting film by German director Ulli Lommel. He directs, produces and collaborates in this latest production. Not only can he make an interesting movie cheap. But he will achieve a new decline when Herr Lommel works in the footsteps of almost the entire film. I've seen movie clips from Boogeyman I and II, Military Birds, Wicked Nerves, Brain Waves, and Coca-Cola Cowboys (even Andy Warhol is a friend of the deepest courtesy of this film). Even though she uses a lot of old shots, she works well with them (and I can add it very creatively). The film follows a young man who copies the original Zombie Killer. also corresponds to the writer (Ulli Lommel) who originally wrote about a serial killer during the late sixties and early seventies. Writer's friend (David Hess) helps him try to find this Zodiac. Can the killer stop? Will the writer put two and two together and get some of his old glory? Is David Hess still a man? You will have to find out yourself and look at the Zodiac Killer. This movie is NOT about the original Zodiac. I also heard people laughing about the film being filmed. So what. The old school artistic style of the director underlines the fact that he is filmed on a video. My only complaint was the excessive use of stock records from previous films by Herr Lommel (but I understand why "wink" "wink.") Do not trust the hype. This is a horror movie at street level. Just as the assertion made at the beginning, this film does not even celebrate the murder. You like it. <br /> <br /> We highly recommend fans Ulli Lommel.
