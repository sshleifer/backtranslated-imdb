It should be an American movie that I would evaluate 7: we saw it before. It was an Argentine film and I was Argentinian myself, I'd like to give him 10, because it's the kind of quality I was hoping for - more than I expected -. It's great quality is amazing due to all the limitations imposed by the third world ... I can not forget the scene when you admit the power of Silverstein's fiance - you know what I mean when you saw the movie. I think that's the key moment of the movie, not surprising maybe, but original. Then the real action begins. Before watching the movie I always try to collect some of the previous information. Since I was the main, satyrical, commercial, I pressed "Play" and broke reality and logic, I would say it's best to look forward to such films. It is not possible to discuss the credibility of the whole conspiracy, yet it is somewhat believable. As for me, I could not laugh at every joke and commentary - "the sauce had" ... in the mouth of Díaz, the largest. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty tired of seeing movies "designed for" Peretti. I know he's a great actor, but sometimes I feel his roles are unfairly opposite, Luis Luque's role in this case. I do not like Argentine television, so I did not see a lot of work from Luque, but it's pretty clear he's a great artist. His physical role, his views and his content attitude in this film made me fall in love with his performance. I think his role would need some modernization just to show us how great he can be! I do not know whether Szifrón plans to continue or not. I know he does not do that if he follows the rule that "the other parts were never good", so if he does, we'll definitely see it. And I hope he will be able to give his colleagues Peretti the same chance to develop his roles in the future. Great movie, great performances and a lot of laughter!
