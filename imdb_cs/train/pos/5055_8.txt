I did not expect much to see the DVD cover for the first time. I mean, Pierce Brosnan as a gray owl? Ah ... but then the story got into motion, developed in beautifully photographed and filmed film. I was surprised and delighted by this (basically) true story. I wanted to read more about this fascinating character, which means that the director fulfilled his goal and the movie was successful!
