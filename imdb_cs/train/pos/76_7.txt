Vincent Price continued in HOUSE OF WAX (1953), a movie that has consolidated his reputation as an icon of horror, similarly revolving around bitter? even if inventive? showman. Although the remake, the first (shot in Technicolor) remains a superior effort; (except for some durable comic relief, it was obligatory to use a cheap T-shirt (another 3-D showcase) and occasional telling shortcomings (what happened to the missing bag that allegedly appeared on a police station with a cut-off head?), it offers more than Grand Guignol's great excitement and the total value of the camp (the prize was made in various dressups as inventors of illusions that claim to be the "missing" stars who used their genius) to stand on their own two legs. By the way, the participation of director Brahma here is not a mere coincidence? because the narrative contains elements from two horror titles (both played by Laird Cregar) who had previously treated, such as THE LODGER (1944) and HANGOVER SQUARE (1945). Young guided games play Mary Murphy (as Cenen ing√©nue assistant) and Patrick O'Neal (as her police detective friend - curiously enough to take the lead in a similar work, CHAMBER OF HORRORS [1966]), just in time to serve as a supplement to this). An interesting part is his acceptance of new detection techniques, fingerprints that are crucial to achieving a fall in Price (in a predictable but rather unpleasant fiery climax), although the persistent snooping of his amateur crime writer has at least a lot to do with him in the long run! Watch the star in a custom-made role, the movie has a lot of fun? especially during compact 73 minutes.
