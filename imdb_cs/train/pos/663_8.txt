I've been watching this episode more often than any other episode of TFTC, it's nice. And it's pretty scary but everything in good, crazy fun. A woman kills her other husband, but there is a problem when a fledgling maniac in a tattered Santa Claus suit decides to pay her and her little girl to visit right now. Mary Traynor, who I probably remember from SNL or some other television comedy, is a bad woman, and Larry Drake plays in crazy Santa clothes. I forgot that Santa played Drake over the years. His Santa is a tireless force and sometimes terrifying. Probably you can guess how Santa finally gets into the house. The episode is played with laughter, but it can sometimes be intense.
