Anton Newcombe makes the film and is the main theme. Watch him when he touches the song, if not the whole album quickly showed that the guy is a real talent. He thinks he is God, but he is so prolific and interesting. DW are not really interesting compared to music or otherwise. "Hey, do you have a driving license?" , Anton says to the cameraman: "Well, let this guitar walk!" Great use of archive / home video. Great to see rock documents that are still being done. A great documentary on the creative process. If you like, check out Nirvana Live! Tonight! Sold Out! on DVD. Anton's good experience is this movie. 8 out of 10
