Had this film been shot a few years later, I would have given him a lower score. However, for the year 1909, it was dandy a small film and still stands quite well today. Just do not try to compare this silent film with later silences - the industry has changed so radically that the shorts of the first decade of the 20th century are not even seen as films made in 1910 and others. <br /> <br /> This film is 11 minutes long (mostly on most films) and is a variant of Edgar Allen Poe's The CASK OF AMONTILLADO. While many are familiar with this story, they will not work any further because I do not want to destroy this movie. Just just say it's scary!
