I started riding fairly recently, and how someone who ever went should know that I fell in love with horses and their world. I rented the Spirit in whims, just trying to pack my life full of the most related horses with my horse, and I was surprised by the results. What I expected was a good Disneyesque movie with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes. <br /> <br /> What I earned was a wonderful movie full of beautiful sceneries and animations and a stunning story that has great potential for warming one's heart. <br /> <br /> <br /> The spirit is a wild mustang in the Old West, whose whole world falls apart when it finds people slowly taking over their homeland. The story develops with a wide range of characters, some people, some animals, everything is well written and most of them are nice when I look at the screen. I would recommend this film to anyone who has a good story and who has awards for history and animals. One thing I forgot to mention but I feel important is that the animals do not speak in this movie. It was a really nice holiday from the animated films Lady And The Tramp, which they all get used to today.
