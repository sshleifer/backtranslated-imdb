When I first saw this movie in the eighties of the last century, I was in my mid teen years and somewhat reluctant to see it because I considered myself an adult and old age "Sesame Street / Muppets." I honestly do not remember whether I liked it at the time or not. But somewhere in the dorm, I watched this movie again and it went wrong (and remained) in my personal collection Best Films Ever. This movie is LOADED with humor, which goes much beyond what it would expect from Muppets. I understand that Muppets always appealed to adults and children, because it is a humor focused on both generations. But come on ... Janice is accidentally heard from someone saying, "I do not want someone to give up the dress even though it's artistic" ... there is a joke from father to son that if a son in love with Kermit Frog his father does not want to hear that ... Gonzo puts the chicken with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and then says "I think we are now engaged" ... these and many other moments in the film have imposed me. Add to this very clever dialogue, very clever humor in New York / Broadway "wink wink", the usual large number of celebrity portraits and some really nice songs that do not limit the boundaries to "childhood" ... this movie is a masterpiece! I do not throw out "10" regularly ... but it deserves it. More than 20 years later, this film is completely behind, perhaps even more. Muppets have never been and never will be again, as fun and smart and just brilliant because this movie was and is. --- Q
