This is one of the best military films ever made. And it's great because it focuses on values. It's a great story about human interests that builds on commitment to honor, loyalty, love and determination. Gooding and DeNiro are excellent in the lead roles. It is wonderful to see that boss champion racism evolves to respect and love through the determination of Carl Brashear, drive and yes, a sense of honor. The name indicates the source of their binding. I never noticed when he last looked at how great a portrait of Carl Lumbly's Carl's father, Mac Brashear, was. In this way, it is the cornerstone of the film, for it is Carl's memory of his father, which helps him lead hard times. I'm selective on what movies I buy. This is one of the rare ones I want on my shelf. It will be seen many times in the future, I'm sure.
