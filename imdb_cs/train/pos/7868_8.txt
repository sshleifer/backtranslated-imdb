Again, Madhur Bhandarkar takes you on the wild side. And remarkable, literally and figuratively. Mumbai hi-society - stars and starlets, glam dolls and witches, dealers and brokers, and all the smelly amount - are in sharp focus. In a typical tabloid fashion, their worlds are developing, and each colorful story is a clever piece of conspiracy. The ever-fighting star that the producer cast after he acquired it, the stewardess and her most significant husband, a pedophile businessman and his neurotic woman, reporters and the captain of the police; all the shades on the display and countless shades between them. <br /> <br /> Bhandarkar makes a swing of digging dirt on dragon kings, dancing queens and living dead. Atul Kulkarni packs a blow, just like Boman Irani and Sandhya Mrudul. Sen Sharma Konak is effective as a former reporter, but could be a little dolled in accordance with a change in occupation and party circle. Very focused (140 minutes) And refreshing another movie, it's worth the money.
