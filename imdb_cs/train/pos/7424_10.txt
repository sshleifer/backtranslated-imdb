I was 16 years old when I first saw the movie, and it's always been a huge favorite. Of course, you can not refuse Kristofferson's appeal in the movie - HOW IS THE FINE THAT MAN'S ???????????? Sheesh. It's still there. He's a bad boy that every woman secretly wants. His acting is flawless. He played drunk / druggie just so that someone who really went through it - and he had - in '76 he finally got on the car, so it was all very real. Music is great, and although in later years I thought Streisand was not somewhat correct for him in some physical beauty, I think it's a bigger problem for the audience than women. Our girls just look at Kris - and of course the boys look at the female interest - my husband can not watch the b / c film - he does not like her look. But I forced him to sit on the red scene of Ferrari on the way to the end to see how good it was - the camera was so perfect and you were in the car with him with a blast - you should see it my 50 "plasma - WOW !!!! And finally, the quality of the transmission was great - anamorphic wide and really clean with great color and very low noise except the dark areas that is normal for all the movies. <br /> It brought me a lot of great and I loved the film together, I bought a copy for Christmas, I would like to watch her with her yesterday. <br /> <br /> They tried to sit down with the original with Judy Garland, but I think that this I just can not get to an earlier time Watching all the concerts in '76 was just like what I've lived on. <br /> <br /> I'm working on Streisand's comments but it just seems to be talking about he and he still have a dock Kris said, or details about the scenes in the movie, her voice sounding exactly the same as now. <br /> <br /> Look, if you grew up at the same time as I (born in 1960), you will love her. <br /> <br /> Vendula
