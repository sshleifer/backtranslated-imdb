I'm a huge fan of Simon Pegg, and so far I have watched a lot of his films, and none of them has made me laugh. It has not happened how to lose friends and Alienate People. <br /> <br /> This film is basically a good guy who tells people. But he has an innate set of ethics that prevents him from doing things that can only be celebrated. But eventually it ends up doing them, the culture of life. The film is well-lived by humor, romance, a good actor, and a little dancing. It's one of those movies where you could be happy when it's over.
