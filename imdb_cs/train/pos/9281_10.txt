I do not know how and where the Iranian directors make their inspiration when such a plot comes. In fact, it's a very simple conspiracy that many directors might want, but they may not be able to project a movie on the film as Jafar Panahi did. The film is like two worlds that are spinning and at the same time one connected to another - the football match and the battle between the sexes that happen behind the walls of the stadium. <br /> <br /> You feel that you are in the movie, one of the characters, and watching the movie, as if you also want to see a soccer match. You will feel exactly the same feeling of excitement and feelings as those female actors in the movie. It grabs it so that you want to see the end, you want to find out the verdict, you will see what happens to the girls. <br /> <br /> I like the interrupted conversations between a smoking girl and one of the military practitioners. It's like Venus VS Mars, it really shows the difference in the minds of men and women and the struggle of women to gain the same rights and opportunities, especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran. This is Jafar Panahi's second film I've seen (the first is Crimson Gold) and I'm looking forward to another observation. <br /> <br /> I'm addicted to Iranian movies and this is a must!
