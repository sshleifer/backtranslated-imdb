It was a great movie with a good story. My children (10, 7, 5 and 4) all loved this film, including myself. The music was also fantastic. No, the horse does not speak, but instead the story says the Spirit. And hear the story told by the horse if it was an experience. I think the title says everything, the "spirit". This movie really gives a feeling of family, home and friends. I have to say that my four-year-old boy and the five-year-old girl were really affected by this film, and they even got into it, they laughed so hard, and they finally excited the spirit. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the "Spirit" with your family and let your spirit lift up with this uplifting story. Your children will love you. I think you will.
