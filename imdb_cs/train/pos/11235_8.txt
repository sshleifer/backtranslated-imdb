Well done and along with "new ways" it's a great sequel! Fab to see James Cawley in the last episode "Vigil" Look at it! <br /> <br /> I like the growing characterization and I think we have good substitutes for creators in fan production. This show can capture the feelings very well as they say, improved over the years with experience, and I hope with further experience, a powerful script editor and picking timing and CGI that HF ​​(I have a huge soft space for Lefler and McFarland (great I'm very happy with the fact that I'm a little tired of the Lefler's laws, it's enough, Shelby is great (if it's a little upstart) and it's okay to get a Commodore Ian ship is nice (like Fred Flintstone ), but he lacks the courageous edge of the commanding officer and looks like a doctor, counselor and Rawlins are right in the money in my eyes, just like Wonderful Nechayev (what a beautiful accent - a real Russian!) (Well, I guess Rene comes from Bohemia.) /> <br /> It's my vote, and CGI's kewl. Some of the greenscreen is obvious, but on a small budget whaddayagonndo? <br /> <br /> Really glad I am that! <br /> <br /> (OK, some the acting is not great, but it's a fan-made and is therefore allowed to be variable - sorry CMM. Cole) <br /> <br /> Gay material is placed on too strong (Graham Norton will embarrass). Trek does not pay too much attention to hetero couples, so why do gay people report with all the snogging? It's not necessary to show one's sexuality to such an extent - I hope it's the tone and let Aster & Zen be non-tokens - I do not care about my gay friends otherwise, they're just normal guys. <br /> </ b> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can say everything I do from Trek OST and I work most of the time but the timing can drop and now (the end of "The worst part 2" is lacking in crisis and adjustment.) They love the fact that they use the "Galaxy Quest" music! <br /> <br /> I can not wait for another! Dazza <br /> <br /> "Never surrender, never make sure!" <br /> <br /> Viva Forest Border
