Matthau and Lemmon are the best - everyone else in the movie is great too. Dialogue is great and very, very humorous - and the scene where Lemmon's character tries to clean up her cavities in the restaurant, keeps me lying on the floor with laughter every minute. Anyone who accidentally sees that it is not such a great continuation should not turn away from the original. I recommend this wonderful film to everyone - I just love it. And the fact that Jack Lemmon plays his character so straightforwardly with tragic overtones is, in my opinion, only added to cheerfulness. These two great boys have created a series of movies together, but this one is the best - no doubt.
