I always enjoyed Chuck Norris in the movie. Although acting may not be excellent, combat scenes are fantastic. I also enjoyed seeing Judson Mills, who was looking at him. In my opinion, the Norris brothers proved to be a great entertainer, and that was another fine production! I hope you will see this movie!
