The only reason I'm giving it 9 is that the other actors who played Tadashi's torture were not at work. I suppose it's just kids who have become the right age and handy, but they were not well trained and their scenes were minor harassment. <br /> <br /> I say that I do not intend to follow American standards because it is full of ambiguities and variations that the Japanese culture easily embraces and is not in line with the moral limitations of black hats / white hats. "For example, there is a randomly witty moment when Tadashi's small group of jokai associates finds that they are released and abandoned by other yokai, and Shojo - the humorous Kirin Herald - does what many stressed Japanese adults would do.Tip: That would not be the case in Disney, and this image also has the best beer placement you've ever seen in a children's movie. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, there's a time when a nursery teacher will press a few bullies with her In Japan, television commercials were a couple of years before the movie came out, a stop-motion of a clay animation about a child depressed and playing guitar and singing blues in his room, his mother screaming at him from the stairs, then someone gives him a cocktail bar and cheer and sings a happy melody, but his mother comes and tells him to quench again and gives him a dirty slap that leaves him The teeth in my head I mentioned this ad because it was considered fun and I did not hear any objections when I was there. There is much more bloodshed and physical cruelty on the screen in the "Great Yokai War" than it would appear in Disney. As a parent, if it was an American film, I would have rid myself of such things, although it may not necessarily be a moral lesson at the end of the picture, which of course is not black and white either. Since it is a Japanese film, I agree that these cultural standards make it possible to create images that would not achieve the standards and practices of US cops. But I would be a bit concerned about seeing young children without giving them any pre-show briefing and / or post-show debriefing about violence and other off-color affairs, or I would expect you to be older than you he showed them.
