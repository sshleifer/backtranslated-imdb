Michelle Rodriguez is an acting actress who could be the charging force for other actresses. She has the courage to place her in a rarely seen girl role very early in her career (and pull her), a performance that should be recognized. Although her later films have made her the same role, this film has been filmed for her robustness. Her character is a romantic student / warrior / lover, trying to overcome her frustrated existence in projects, which is a bit exaggerated in the movie ... but not a girl. This aspect of this film is not very original, but the story goes deep when the excited relationships that this girl has to deal with comes to boil and her primary anger takes over. I have seen that the actress in the movie has decided so aggressively, and I'm glad that the original smudge appeared in Hollywood. This film got me 7 because of the average story of the youth ghetto, but she has such a great actress who shows a rarely seen role in a minimal budget. Good job.
