There is nothing that does not like Moonstruck. I'm from an Italian family from New York, and when I look at it, I got a little home. Actors and acting actors, plot, subplot, humor ... were all fantastic. It starts a little slow, but in two days it happens a lot! I fell in love with LaBohem for this film. Moonstruck number 3 is on my list of favorite movies. It's a "good feeling" movie where you leave the "amore" buzz or repeat some of your favorite lines: "old man if you give these dogs another piece of my food, I'll kick you until you are dead "; "Chrissy, bring me a big knife," "who's dead," "you love him Loretta ....., well, because if you do, they call you crazy because they know they can." I've always given Moonstruck when it's not good to see anything, because it makes me happy.
