After the cold sex scene, between Andou and Gina, South America, we know that Andy is a wage manager who finds himself in a difficult economic situation where he needs extra money? Did we also find out he was stealing from his work and using the money for his drug addiction? Is he also trying to keep up with a wife who could have a relationship? <br /> <br /> In order to solve all his problems, convinces his brother that it is okay for the loser to join him in the plan to steal a small business of his parents? Their parents are happily married and the jewelery owners are in the Westchester district of New York? Sixty thousand dollars are all they need to get their lives out of their despair? <br /> <br /> Three major characters are important in this movie? <br /> <br /> First two brothers? Each of them is a complex individual, threatened by different motives and involved in doubt and disappointment? Both are desperate figures, financially and emotionally? <br /> <br /> Andy is selfish? Does he feel he never loved his father? It is a spoiled influence, transforming a brother into an assailant, and his beautiful wife is an adulteress. Is Hank a puppet too weak to resist the wishes of his brother? His ex-wife is one of the reasons why she needs money because she owes her hundreds in child support? Wanting to regain the confidence he once had with his father? <br /> <br /> The third figure is their tired and honest father, Charles Hanson (Albert Finney), especially in spooky climate scenes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> More information about details can reduce the impact of the film and thus the fun ... <br /> <br /> Tomei's performance brings great depth and emotion, even due to its appearance, touch and special movement. <br /> <br /> The Lumet direction is solid, fresh and brutal.
