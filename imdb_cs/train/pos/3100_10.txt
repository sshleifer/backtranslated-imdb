By the end of the first hour, my jaw was comfortably nestled between my legs. The film never and never mean, I leave in action. It can be a mild action, but it's action. Again every cast member fits perfectly. Explosions were realistic, persecution was possible and the fight was incredible. Matt Damon will be Forever Jason Bourne. All I really have to say is that every Bourne movie gets better and that's no exception. Events, betting, plot. As they do, I will never know. I applaud the person who wrote the screen into each of these films. Because if he did not do such a great job at the first movie, we should not even talk about it. <br /> <br /> So you can not see it in theaters, go to the cinema if it's still out there where you live, but if on December 11, Bourne returns to you!
