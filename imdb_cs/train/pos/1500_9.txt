Now most people do not watch classic movies like this. Most friends only look at movies from the 1990s to the present. That's a little bit sharp. <br /> <br /> Most old movies like this are masterpieces unique in their own way. Just because back when these films were thought and made, it was when the ideas were fresh. Now people are attracted to think about new ideas. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to the movie. For true fans of classic horror. It's for you. The film is based on a Scotland Yard investigator who investigates the disappearance of a film actor and encounters three other strange events with former residents of the same house. <br /> <br /> I will not say anymore because I will lose the film more than I do. But it's an amazing movie as old as it is. And it would not matter!
