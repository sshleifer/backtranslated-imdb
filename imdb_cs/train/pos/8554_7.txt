Wow, this was another good turn from the original American cake, not as good as a camp band, but certainly better than that gutted mile. Dwight and Erik Stifler lead a comedy in this, but I actually preferred a dialogue in this one-mile mile. The script was written much better and the comedy flowed smoother, but most of the comedy came from sex, but is that okay, because that's why we watch these movies the same way? Tiny Rock also had a really good friend, given the intense effort to feed him in a mile, his pinstripe scene was amazing and I had to laugh my ass when I saw her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film was, in my opinion, a certain improvement compared to a ninety mile if you liked some previous American Pie movies, you should love the beta house unless you see all American spin spin-offs waste money.
