Meteorit falls into the land of a small town and brings jelly. The old farmer invaded the stranger in his hand and young Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) took him to Dr. T. Hallen (Steven Chase). The local doctor carefully treats the blister and asks Steve to investigate where they found the old man. When Steve returns, he sees the blob killing a doctor. Steve and Jane are trying to warn policemen and residents, but no one believes them, while the blob attracts many people, getting bigger and bigger. "The Blob" is a cult and classical sci-fi. This is a low-budget movie with many musicians and actresses (except Steve McQueen), terrible effects, but also wonderful and very, but very fun. This is the first time I've seen this classic (I saw a remake in 1988 with Kevin Dillon), and I really recommend Steve McQueen and science fiction B-films from the 1950s. The movie that is the subject of my 1400 review can not be better. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "A Bolha" ("The Blob")
