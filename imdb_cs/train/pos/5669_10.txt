In her first nonaquatic role, Esther Williams plays a teacher who is the victim of a sexual assault. Provides gentle performance, proving that it can be highly effective from the pool. As a detective who has solved the case, George Nader may be doing his best. And he's so nice that it hurts! John Saxon is a student under suspicion, and despite being impressed by his credentials, Edward Andrews is his over-guarding father who is extraordinary. He bought in a beautiful Technicolor, a clumsy moment is an irresistible hokum and sometimes surprising drama.
