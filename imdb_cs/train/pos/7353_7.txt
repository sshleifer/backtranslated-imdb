This movie could be one of the most underestimated films about Bollywood's history. This marketplace in 1994 had all the good performances, music and direction. I remember being in Allahabad when this movie ran and it was sometime in March at the time of Holi, people playing their song "Ooe Amma" on their loudspeakers in the highest volume. If someone who likes to watch Some Like It Hot and hurry over Marilyn Monroe, he should see this movie. Deep into Govinda. As many of you know that this movie was filmed in southern India and after Sholay was one of the few blockbuters to hit the Silver Screen. Movies like this Indian comedy would never be dead.
