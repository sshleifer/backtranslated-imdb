Uggh! I did not really feel amazed at the film, although I must admit it is technically well done. It reaches 7 for very high production values, but in terms of entertainment, it is rather bad. In fact, I consider this one of the most overrated films of the 1950s. She won Oscar for Best Picture, but the film is sometimes boring with so many dances and dances and dances. This is because, unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs together with a strong story and acting (such as MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS), this film is almost singing and dancing. In fact, this film is the story of the longest song and dance, and if you're not into it, the movie gets bored with you quickly. Give me another story! As a result, with exaggerated production numbers and a weak story, this film is like a steady diet of meringue - it does not meet in the long run. <br /> <br /> I think ... this is the movie that beat the "Market Track called Desire" and "In the Sunshine" for the best shot! And to make it even worse, the "African Queens" and "Ace in the Hole" were not even nominated in this category! For me, it's even more amazing that "Ace in the Hole" lost the best song, the screenplay for this movie - although "The American in Paris" had almost no story and was mostly driven by dance and song.
