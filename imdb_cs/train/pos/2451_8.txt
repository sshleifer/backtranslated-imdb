George Lopez is a humorous man with no comedy. The first episodes I've seen too much of this make jokes at the expense of his mother. As I watched more, there were more and more varieties. No one on the cast is really sure of his joke. It seems to me that this season, George is becoming more and more like the family sitcom. At first it was not, but more and more gets into the groove. This makes his performance more fun. They added a couple of characters to make George play this year. His wife's dad is increasingly involved in the land. His mom is still there, but not as central as the previous period. I think it's wise to tell George with comic timing and the lack of good ABC sitcoms, George Lopez has a good chance of being here on ABC long after George W. Bush.
