David Zucker directed one of the most comical comedies of the year with this fucking farce. Yes, it is a matter of gained taste and depends on the wealth of sophomoric gag, but it is always fun in its entire contradiction with some recent comedic efforts. The film is full of all sorts of jokes, from obvious to weak, that you need to pay attention to everything that's in the frame, or you probably will have to skip it. Just like his previous efforts, which include "Airplane!", "Top Secret!" And "Naked Gun," humor is flying almost every second. There are so many moments that work, it's easy to overlook the few who fall. What makes this film from other light imitations in the spoof genre is that it has a real story. While others are addicted to making fun of too many famous scenes in almost random films (take "Mafia!"), This film tells a new story with sex characters. It touches on sports movies in general, but also satirizes the real sports industry instead of announcing specific films. Even for people who do not care about South Park, its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, are doing a good pair of lead actors with natural chemistry. The film also makes extremely effective use of portraits of athletes, sports announcers and other personalities, especially a funny piece with Robert Stack on "Unresolved Mysteries". By the way, keep the credits for the final joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. Overall, Zucker has achieved, with words that perhaps relate to a mix of sports film, domestic dunk.
