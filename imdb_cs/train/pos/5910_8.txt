OK, OK, do not bend. Just kidding. <br /> <br /> "Bustin Out" is actually a better and truer headline of any. <br /> <br /> Rasism and Criminalistic Dramas get satirical treatment from our animator Ralphie's boy. And he's doing one of his better works here. On the crime front it shows the truth. They will build it, defend, then boredom and stronger opponents will cause them (maybe) to lose. See for yourself what is happening. <br /> <br /> Really? I do not know. Scatman (RIP) and love walrus (also RIP) are black and main sight, I saw it as an attack on racism mostly. The fact that Richard Pryor liked him says so well. And younger (before "Miami Vice") Phil Mike Thomas there was a nice surprise. It's an animated movie "Blackspotation". That's a good thing. Done and done well. Some of them will like it (like a lynching scene), but unfortunately it relies on the fact. But Ralphie REALLY really had to think about this title.
