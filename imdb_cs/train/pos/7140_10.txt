20 of 10 This is a really amazing story about the evacuated warlord and ugly carpenter Tom Oakley. The boy (William Beech) is accused of Tom and it is immediately obvious that he has serious problems when he sprinkles his bed in the first night. William is illiterate and terrified, but suddenly they find consolation in the loneliness of each other. It turns out that William has talent as an artist and we see Tom's talent as a choirmaster in the amusing rendition of Jerusalem. William became friends with Zacharias Wrench, a young Jewish boy from London, and together with Tom and Zacharyas they finally learn to read and write and feel part of this small, narrow knit community. Just as he settled down, William is recalled back to London by his mother, and here we know why he's so bad. His mother is clearly mentally ill, and when Tom does not hear from William, she travels to London to look for him. Eventually, he finds out that he is holding his dead sister where he is bound in the cellar. After some time in the hospital, Tom realizes that he has to drive him and take him home with him. The culmination is the hot-sweet end when William tells him to be adopted by Tom and at the same time to teach his best friend, Zacharias, was killed in an air raid in London. For me, it was one of the most moving scenes when Tom was talking to a home office clerk. I love "im" and "for what is worth, I think he loves me". <br /> <br /> It just is not better that it does it?
