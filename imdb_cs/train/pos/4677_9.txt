I understand this movie as a debut and as such is very impressive. He has a sense of "real india", but director Todd Yellin has a clear photographic and editorial vision, command and judgment of a mature and experienced professional. The shots are well framed and thoughtful and serve to move the story forward. He and scriptwriter Ivan Solomon deliver a story that has much more depth and lyric than typical "color by number" scripts. It's a story that needs tale talent talent Judd Hirsch to work. Judd is as usual usual; as well as Scott Cohen and beautiful Susan Floyd. The real surprise is Elliot Korte, who plays Adam Groden. Yellin was able to take away the nuances of a young actor in a role that could easily be devalued by a stereotype or overlap. Anyway, I found the film refreshing and entertaining.
