Timothy Dalton liked me very much, though he was young and too handsome for him, but I thought Zelah Clarke was too muddy and short. This version, however, was very true to the novel and very well filmed. I have seen 4 versions, Orson Welles is still my favorite Mr. R, although George C Scott did it very well, and it is throwing between Joan Fontaine and Sussanah York, though they were both too old for the role. I recently saw the brilliant TV version of Rebecca with Charles Dance and Emily Fox. I'd love to see these two Jane Eyre. When I looked at the version of Ciarin Hinds, I think I'm Jane Eyred out there, but I will never pull the first few minutes when I heard Joan Fontain's voice telling opening the first version I've ever seen. I always want to go back and read the book again.
