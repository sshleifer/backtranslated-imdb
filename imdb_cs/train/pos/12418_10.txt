This film and its sequel to Barry McKenzie has its own, are the two greatest comedies ever produced. A great story, the young Aussie Bloke travels to England to request heritage and meet her friends who are just as nice and innocent as she is. Is it a key full of great words where else can you find someone who needs such a bad drink that he is as dry as dead dingoes donger? great characters, top-class acting and has great gray dresses and other Fosteri consumption, then three more films will come together. Best shot. <br /> <br /> And some of the funniest songs you've ever heard are full of great personalities. Definitely my two favorite movies of all time, I watch them at least once every fortnight.
