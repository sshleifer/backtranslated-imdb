Another show likened this group to the cross between Monty Python and Twin Peaks, also suitably. Still another review that explains the differences between comedy we use with non-critical and black comedy is also worth it. <br /> <br /> Look at the whole thing, all three series. At the end, all the characters are tied and the jigsaws fall into place just like the novel by Douglas Adams. Detail and complexity are stunning. Strongly postmodern. Badly sad and surprisingly tragic. Not for children. Not for those with thin skin or for those who do not have objectivity. I mean-provoking. At the same time literal, figurative and unreal in distracting ways. The darkest comedy I can remember. And perhaps the most beautiful thing I'll ever see.
