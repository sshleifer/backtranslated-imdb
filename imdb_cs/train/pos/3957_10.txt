Three Stoogs are always some of the many actors I loved. I like almost every one of the shorts that they did. I love all six Stoogs (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are fun and also the star of many other great actors and actresses, many of them in many short shorts! In my opinion, the Three Stoogs are some of the greatest actors ever and it's always the most fun comedy team! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite Stooges shorts with Shemp is no one other than Spouse Attention! In this short film, beautiful Christine McIntyre, Dee Green, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders, Lu Leonard, Maxine Gates, and Emil Sitka appear. Green and McIntyre provide great performance here! There are so many funny parts here. This is very cheerful short. There is another similar Three Stooges short as the one called Brideless Groom and I recommend both!
