"Seizures of Life" is a parody of life and death, happiness and depression. Black and white are always in our lives. Mel Brooks's performance is great as always, and other actors are also cool. This movie has some taste of Capra, so it's so good. <br /> <br /> There are some unforgettable gags like the one where Brooks tries to make some money dancing on the street and all the people around just ignore him or when he meets a funny crazy man who believes he's Paul Getty and then start arguing and slapping each other. If you have not seen it, you do not know what you are in the rest. <br /> <br /> This film tells us about the old and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich. <br /> <br /> The only difference between this film and reality lies in the fact that this film has a happy end and no reality. <br /> <br /> Yes, really, Live Death.
