This movie is good for what it is, and unpretentious; I never would have seen it twice: I'm Peter Cushing completetist and that's why I watched it. The best contribution of this film is: BREVITY and EFFECTIVENESS. Compared to other similar films, DOES NOT use the legs forever because each of the four (plus one) segments lasts less than 30 minutes, the last one is below 10. Good vibration. In the first part, the horror writer who suffers from the "writer block" moves into a remote old house looking for inspiration. He finds too much when he begins to represent one of his fictional madmen. Drawing drawing similar to PREMATURE BURIAL. Good use of reversal: the writer is mentally ill ... or (as the end shows) his wife wants her mistress to play along with her husband's phobia to make him mad and secure his domain. Will they survive to enjoy the fruit of their sophisticated plan? In the second segment, after a long time, friends have disappeared in the same remote old house, but they do not seem to help to visit the bizarre horror museum with a wax statue of the long lost love of their youth that once separated them. The Gothic Museum learns that the woman who was portrayed is the deceased ax with the murderer ... or was it? <br /> <br /> The third segment was less interesting for me. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the actor of horror films - who thinks he is the best of all - is set in the depth of low budget C films. In search of a costume that favors his fictional vampire, he gets a real deal. This segment also lacks the strength of the first two. <br /> <br /> Efficiency is fair, with 2 initial segments contributing to its large volume. A good movie, fed with grain of salt. Not the best Cushing or Lee ... but it's worth watching.
