Spoilers - As for the characters and their relationship to the land. <br /> <br /> This is a high quality movie. The subject is instantly gloomy and gripped. The determined determination of the character of Stephen Rea, Burak, is simply charming. With his apology, his apologist, a constantly fledged expression, is doing well. He is how we would say in England about the character of Inspector Taggart's television series, which should be gloomy because he sees three murders a week. Well, that's not strictly accurate as Chikatila has worked for several years ... You get a real sense of blind resistance from the USSR bureaucracy, greatly portrayed by Joss Ackland of this type of role). The key character (and I write it as a remake of the invasion of body hijackers is shown on BBC1) is Donald Sutherland's character "Mikhail Fetisov". His quiet support of Burak is perennial. And it takes over Perestrojik and controls the involvement of the FBI into profiling. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> This is the necessity for me.
