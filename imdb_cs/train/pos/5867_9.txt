Jacknife is a masterpiece of the 1980s. It is a film that is breathtaking with an amazing actor and a very interesting directorial touch. In Jacknife, lovers of European and American cinematography can find the stuff they cover. The script is very convincing and full of beautiful characters. Ed Harris gives one of the greatest performances up to date. He portrays his alcoholic hero in a great way that he can feel his broken heart in every turn. Robert De Niro thinks he's one of the greatest actors of all time in one of the simplest but also the most realistic performances in his career. Jacknife is never bored because he shows his heroes without any typical Hollywood character. After the war, no one is a hero. Everyone is lost and this movie is about that simple truth. None of them can repair their pieces after the war, just like the heroes of this film. Jacknife is about the illnesses of the soul that war is creating. Simply beautiful movie.
