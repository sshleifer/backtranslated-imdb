I was amazed at Chavez's stance against globalization for some time, but when I saw the film at the Amsterdam Documentary International Film Festival, I realized what he really did. This film tells the story of a coup / conspiracy of Venezuelan elite, oil companies and oil companies that love corrupt Western governments to remove democratically elected President Chavez and return Venezuela back to brutal dictatorship. This film is essential for anyone who believes in freedom and justice and is also a lesson to the rest of the world! I call on people from Venezuela to take the matter in their own hands and save their country from similar Halbburton and Bush regimes.
