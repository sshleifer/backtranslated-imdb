*** 1/2 off ***** While I do not like the fact that this is an English dubbed version, as some reviewers mentioned, it should be noted that it seems to be found in many hearts of Quebecois. But it was a film, like a child I was an enthusiastic admirer; when I realized it was done for children, I evaluate it on a relative basis. The story is about creating an awesome snow fortress for children in the winter break, and turning back for control with weapons such as snowballs and other feces, like idle hands and leisure time is equivalent to winter break lessons. If I had children, it is definitely a movie that I would try, and I would be interested in it, because the snow wall amazed me when I was young, and I think kids now agree, although Pixar and all the computer animation maybe I obsolete and just do not realize it. In addition, the film's report is surprisingly allegorical and positive in that for children (even adults).
