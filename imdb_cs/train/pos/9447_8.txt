An amazing four-man drama on a weekend canoe on a remote river. They are pacifists Ed (Jon Voight), adventurous, violent Lewis (Burt Reynolds), unpleasant Bobby (Ned Beatty) and dear boy Drew (Ronny Cox). The first 40 minutes are great - there is an unbelievable duel banjo sequence, an interesting interplay between the characters and the stunning widespread cinematography Vilmos Zsigmond. Then two shelters attack Ed and Bobby. One of them raped Bobby ... and the path became a nightmare. Just incredible. The landscape is incredibly beautiful, but this terrible violence takes place. To be true, Beatty's rape has never bothered me - I very much realize that despite good acting. This film also shows how characters change - Ed has pacifism tested, Lewis becomes weak, Bobby is violated by one of the people he had mocked before, and Drew tries to keep his sanity. John Boorman's play is also very assured, and the sounds of the forest and the river make the mood really great. <br /> <br /> Acting is usually good. Voight is all right - he was better. Beatty is all right - but it's his debut film and he has the courage to have such a risky role. Cox is very good, especially when things start falling apart. And Reynolds is just great - one of his greatest actor works EVER! As it was not even nominated for an Academy Award, she escapes me. Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are too believable as hills. <br /> <br /> Strong movie - NOT for children. Try to see the uncut version - the TV version is blocked. It is also necessary to view letterboxes to capture breathtaking pictures.
