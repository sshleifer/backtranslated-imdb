Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor alive. An English aristocratic snob in a viewing room, a passionate Irish thief in the name of a father, a deadly but violent butcher in New York Gangs (ten times stronger than Adrian Brody in a pianist), and as insulting Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in my left leg (only a few names). His roles are all influential, but each is separate and totally unique. It varies completely with every character it takes. And I'm starting to believe it can act like anything else. Anything. <br /> <br /> As Cristy Brown is stunning. He does not share the character and regrets the character. Complex successes. And Cristy Brown comes alive. Clever person. An embarrassed man. Human. <br /> <br /> This film is an inspiration, despite a small breakdown in the scene and the like. Yes, it is predictable. But is it stupidly sentimental? No. I laughed. I cried. No moment of cheese. Proof that this is not a Hollywood movie. My favorite scene is a scene in the restaurant when Cristy discusses painters with Eileen, Peter and her friends. Here's where Daniel Day-Lewis reaches the action peak. "I will kick you into a single part of your anatomy that is animated." "Exhale the cripples!" And his performance will never slow down, he never fits and is beautiful. Simply. He has a lot of time on the screen. I look at it again, and I'm never tired of Cristy's sharp eyes, twitching and guttural expressions. You must see. Fo fo, yeah!
