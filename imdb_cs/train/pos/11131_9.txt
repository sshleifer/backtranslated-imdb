I went through the list of Oscar winners and was surprised that this film beat Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid for the best painting in 1969. After what I actually saw, I was no surprise. It was a long way from time to time with regard to his style, cinematography, and the use of flashbacks to help shape Joe Buck. The most amazing for me is the depth of Joe Buck's character in such a short film. I think Voight captured naivety and malice when he was provoked. The two scenes that really caught me were after he got into the theater and the older man asked him. I think when he looks in the mirror, he tries to find out if he really is the one who has done - or is going to - something terrible. I think it was a great decision of Hoffman. Otherwise, it may be graduate. Anyway, it was considered to be great for some reason.
