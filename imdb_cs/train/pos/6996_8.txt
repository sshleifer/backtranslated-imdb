This movie was really a great movie about something that affects us. I know I've gotten into it so many times. Thank you for the fact that Will Smith jumped to the social problem of text messaging while driving. People, do not do it. An hour and forty-five minutes is not enough for this thing. I personally wanted to blow my cell phone after the movie. I was glad to see other people in the theater who saw a message and unload their phones with empty popcorn bags. I decided to ban all text messages on my phone and encourage others to do so. If you care about your family, let them watch this important public service Notification of text messages while driving or they could kill seven people. Thank you for showing us the way.
