some people think the second series was where the scooby was destroyed .. I totally disagree. The show did not seem up or down and scrappy to win my opinion as a very good chrecter.i looked at the poll on jumpedtheshark.com and 72% people said that the scrappys second series was scoobys downfall.OK so the load said yes, but 28% still can not be bad. I like the way most episodes focus on comedy. i believe the show would go garbage if it was the same 5 people / dog solve a mystery in the same formula.scrappy was breathing fresh air into the show.sure, some people tuned but when introduced scrappy viewing character DOUBLED.Na parade.VÅ¡echny episodes and segments were very fun I was impersonated yabba shorts and. But at the end of the day his point of view, if you like scrappy or not is a matter of opinion, there is certainly no fact involved.But in his opinion it was a great series that gave the beginning of the tire , show a new formula and lease of life.
