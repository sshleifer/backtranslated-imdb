Of the elements that make the best of it, I have to say that # 1 is Christine McIntire. Shemp's scene when it's poisoned and her reaction is really spectacular. I imagine that Christine, as he was proposing a poster, tried to keep laughing at the scene, but in fact it seemed to her even more obvious evil that she smiled that Shemp might die. Helping this to excel is Goon. His gaze was a great cross between the terrible and the comedic goofule. Few characters would choose to meet in a dark aisle or elsewhere. I would like to make a secret of this secret a little, but hey, when this one is good, who will complain. I do not.
