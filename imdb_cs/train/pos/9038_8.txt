I loved the October sky. The thing that I loved most was music. It worked in two ways: in the first hour of the film, it provides the viewer with a time frame. This is done by playing songs from the late 1950s. In the second hour, he took the instrumental score. Music now fits perfectly into the mood of the movie. <br /> <br /> I did not just want music, but I also liked the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was a great surprise to me. He has delivered first-class performance, just like Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). I've seen this life-by-life movie already set for you twice, and I've enjoyed it for a while.
