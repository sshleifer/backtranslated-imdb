This is, in my opinion, the best Emma. When I saw the second version (1996), which is also good and read a book, I think with certainty I can safely say that this is a true interpretation and is the most faithful masterpiece of Jana Austen. The 1996 film with G. Paltrow is also good, it's just that it's almost like another story altogether. It's very light and fluffy, you do not see the darker edges of the character, and if you just want a nice movie, it would be okay, but the complexity of some points like the Churchill / Fairfax involvement is so shiny that it is virtually non-existent. But if you want the characters to become a bit more, more real and multidimensional, the TV version of 1996 is superior. Emma is a remarkable person, but she's wrong. Kate Beckinsale is a masterpiece in showing little character traits. You see her look reluctantly disgusted with some of the simpler interviews with Harriet Smith, yet it does not make any remorse that he has destroyed Harriet's proposal until this action ends at the end of his own marital happiness. You see her narcissism, and that reflects Frank Churchill in hurting others to achieve their own goals. She played a matchmaker for Emma, ​​and she had a new friend when she stopped working with her when she suffered her husband's loss of marriage. For Frank Churchill, she is the promise of a woman she loves while she and her wives are treated to keep their secrets. The book is aware of it all in the wake of all the mistakes she has made. Both Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Paltrow are convincing in their distraction, but Paltrow's childish and stagnant, while Beckinsale's awakening is more real and serious, and you see the transition from childish, selfish behavior to a kind and thoughtful adult. Both versions are very good, but I prefer this.
