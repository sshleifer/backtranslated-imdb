But this movie has been one of the funniest horror films I've ever seen. The effects are so bad you just have to laugh and act, and say it's not gibson. But Gary Browning, who plays a cop, is so damn bad he's getting good. I do not know but he himself is making this movie 10. You have to see if your horror / slash movies cause his bloody and funny at the same time. Killer film.
