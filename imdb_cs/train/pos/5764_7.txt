I originally reviewed this movie on the Amazon about 6 or 7 years ago and threw it out. I think I called it "miserable" and "little". Well, well, most of the standards are Turkey. It has almost no production value, what little land has almost no sense, and acting is at the level of the third-level game. This means that over the years I have grown like a classic camp. In fact, all of Todd Sheets' films have this effect. It's almost like Ed Wood in this regard: Watch them over and over again and choose flubbed lines, continuity errors (the same zombies, two different places!) And other mistakes. Say this: The leaves are very nice and while this is one of his first productions, it's not so great that it's better. And I have to add that the only really decent actress / actress in the movie is Kasey Rousch, although I can be impressed when I went to school with her.
