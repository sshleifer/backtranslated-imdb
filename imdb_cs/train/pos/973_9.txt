Wow! So much fun! Probably a little bit for normal American kids, and it's really a stretch to call this kid's movie, this movie reminded me of a lot of Time Bandits-very Terry Gilliam all the way. While the whole story is largely straightforward, Miike still throws in many unreal and Bunuel-esquire moments. The whole of the first act is violently adjacent to the scene on the scene of the normal family life of the main child / hero, the spiritual world, and evil before it appears. And while the end has a somewhat ambiguous aspect that is common for Miike's work, layers of meaning and metaphors, especially the anti-war / anti-seclusion message of human foolishness, are pretty damn. As a manic and imaginative pastime like other great movies, Miike, instead of over torture and gore, he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from Japanese folk tradition creatively conceived through CG and puppetry wrapped in imaginative multi-stage adventure. F'n rad and one of Miike's finest!
