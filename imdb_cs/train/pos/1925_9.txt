It must be one of the best comedies on television. It is the sweet idea of ​​a show that turns around a close family and transforms it into a fairly realistic yet funny view of a typical family, supplemented by siblings and parents, brothers brothers, vigilant guard fathers and nurses. I'm almost surprised that it's Disney! <br /> <br /> Because of this, "8 Simple Rules" knows it's a comedy and does not try to be more. Too many concerts (like "Sister, Sister" and "Lizzie McGuire") think precisely because her leading figures are now teenagers, then they should deal with social problems and eventually lose their humor by being too hard. These are the traps of "8 simple rules" that they avoided; solves some problems (such as being excluded from school) but enjoys doing so. In fact, the only thing that was really serious was understandable when it sensitively addressed the tragic death of John Ritter and his character. And I think though John Ritter will unfortunately be missing because it was the reason the show made his mark, "8 Simple Rules" can still do well if he remembers his humor and makes Cate's father a second version of Paul Hennessy.
