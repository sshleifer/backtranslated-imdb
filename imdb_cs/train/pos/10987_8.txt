When I walked through the Sci Fi weekly section of my local video store, I lost hope to find some good movies I have not seen before. Cypher's rental was like a very llamar horse. My son is so crazy with the current sci-fi "B" that he did not even bother to see this. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I did not see anything about Cypher when he was released in Australia. It had to be very quiet or I just missed it. That was a really nice surprise! This is not B movie. It is not a "blockbuster" of epic varieties and does not try to be - a more silent film that needs to be seen several times because it's a conspiracy to fully enjoy it. Special effects are strong when used - my only complaint is super helo is leetle of course CGI at first glance, but they have it on the right it's the 2nd look, and that everything else is top of the page. In any case, these effects are secondary. <br /> <br /> I will not do anything about the story. The structure of the conspiracy has a Russian aspect of the Doll, which a bit resembles Basic Instinct (though with very different content). I just say that Jeremy Northam's choice for leadership was the major stroke. The actor was born in Cambridge, England, and his accent for this film hit his ear as a type of an extremely forced new English dialect, it's a tad off key. Check out the latest plot of plot and see why it's such a great choice! And Lucy Liu is also right with her, "she kisses me - it will shoot me". <br /> <br /> I rarely watch movies for several days in a few days - it's one of them.
