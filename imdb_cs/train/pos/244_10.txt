I did not know what I expected from "Ned Kelly," but he absolutely loved it. It was dark, dramatic and grasping. She also felt very authentic, I felt I was transported back to the 18th century. I have never been a fan of Heath Ledger when I saw him only in teenage movies, but he is quite urgent in this role. Ledger plays with the dignity and intensity of Ned Kelly and shows how a highly temperamental boy has become the most famous killer of Australia. Naomi Watts is great in supporting role as Kelly's lover. We highly recommend - and it's from Aussie!
