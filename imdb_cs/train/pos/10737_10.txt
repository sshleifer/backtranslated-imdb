If I did not know anything better, it seemed almost like a scene, but it was not. It was perfectly set up and how they managed to get all these shots is amazing! The unfortunate events of September 11, 2001 are combined in this documentary and the classic shots that have become this unfortunate classic. Only history in the shot should make it MUST see for any American or person touched the tragedy of September 11th.
