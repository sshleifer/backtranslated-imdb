Short subject MGM MINIATURE. Clarion Editor in Cole County has to decide what are the real IMPORTANT NEWS for his readers: a terrible frost that may be catastrophic for their crops or the sensational shooting of a famous gangster on the main street of the city. <br /> <br /> This is a nice little reel with a good introduction from the comic dealer Charles `Chic 'Sale. Today's audiences are likely to be more interested in the look of unhealthy James Stewart, who is Sale's nephew / assistant. Slowly speaking and somewhat miserable, Stewart shows many of the attributes that would make him a huge star in a very short time. Often overlooked or neglected today, one and two reel shorts were useful for studies as important training for new or growing talents, both in front and behind the camera. The dynamics of making a successful short subject was completely different from the dynamics of the film, like writing a rather short story rather than a novel. Economic output in terms of budget and timetable and capable of rendering a wide range of materials, short items were a perfect complement to feature films.
