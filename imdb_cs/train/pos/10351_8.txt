When Chamberlain's family room is camping at Ayers Rock in Australia, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) sees her baby being dragged out of her tent by a ding, and then begins a misery that no one has to experience. It seems that the story of dinga is not believed by the public or the press, and the whole thing will turn into a circus. Lindy does not even help because she will not play in a jury or courtroom, she's alone and it's hard to poke, so everyone of course thinks she's guilty because there's evidence, light. Sam Neill is excellent as Michael Chamberlain, the Seventh-day Adventist pastor who has doubts about his faith and maybe his wife. It is good (or bad) to see that people are equally pretending and stupid elsewhere, just as in the states because the Australian public does not believe that the story and the media are just fans of the flame. Finally, Lindy is sentenced and sent to prison for the life of hard work, but a few years later the missing evidence appears and she is liberated, but only after the life of the family is essentially destroyed. Heart-broken story, very well done, a bit long, but it's worth seeing a lot. 8 out of 10.
