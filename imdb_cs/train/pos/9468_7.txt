I saw a special preliminary screening of this day. I have to tell you, I'm not a huge fan of either Dana Cook or Steve Carella, so I had no expectations. Finally, I was looking forward. Dan in real life is the story of a widow with 3 daughters who want to spend their weekend with their family. While in the bookstore she meets the woman of her dreams only to find out that she will become his brother's girlfriend. The film is quite well made - soundtracks, cinematography and acting are all top-notch, especially Steve Carell. My problem with this was mostly that there seemed to be a lack of character development, mostly with the character of Dan Cook. We never participate in the relationship between Dane and Steve's characters, and I felt it could help a bit when I showed Dan's inner conflict about being in love with Dan's girlfriend. Given in real life is definitely a solid, sweet film - definitely a nice break from all the horror and action films we got this year.
