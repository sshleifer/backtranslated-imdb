HUSBANDS BEWARE is a remake of the classic BRIDELESS GROOM jewelry. The new film scene at the beginning of the movie is great. Stogs are always cheerful when cooking. After the first minutes of shooting, however, we cut the original shots of BRIDELESS GROOM. One thing I noticed about these remakes from 1953 to 1956 is that it fits into a new story. They do the insertion when the old story line does not match. <br /> <br /> BEWARE has a new end, but I will not let those who want to surprise. <Br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars.
