I've seen virtually all the movies of Cynthia Rothrock, and this is the most funny for me. It reminds me of the early movies of Jackie Chan. It is true that Mrs. Rothrock may not be the greatest actress but she is very good at looking at both martial artists and the very cute young lady. This movie, probably the best of all of her films, was the most entertaining.
