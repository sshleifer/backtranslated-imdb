I've had a morbid fascination with tornadoes for over 40 years because my fifth-grade teacher, my native Texan, told stories about those he saw in his youth. Fortunately, I have lived all my life in the middle Atlantic states where the tornado is rare and usually not as violent as the Midwest, but I have two close meetings, one in the PA and the other in the NJ, the last decades. <br /> <br /> I liked family scenes, especially the conflicts between Jack and Dan Hatch. When the tornado was close, Dan knew most of what he had to do, and probably learned at school because I know tornado safety is an important subject in parts of the US where these storms are more common. However, characters in the movie did two things that some people think should be done or safe in tornadoes, but in fact they should not be done or they are dangerous. When the siren Dan and Arthur came through the house, they opened the windows. For years, this is what people have been saying, but the tornado safety web site now recommends that this not happen. Also, people were exposed to hiding in the underpass of the highway. This method was popular in the early 1990s by the crew T.V. during a relatively weak twister in Kansas. In the most serious tornadoes, however, people can be pulled out of these underpasses. It happened during the Oklahoma epidemic in May 1999. <br /> <br /> Tornado in this movie hit in autumn, which is not the usual time for it to happen. (Again, one of my close encounters took place at the end of September). They also traveled from the northwest to the southeast while most of the storms in the northern hemisphere led southwest to the northeast. However, it is not all uncommon. The famous tornado that hit Joliet, IL, began in the early 1990s in the same direction (just as with my next encounter). I think the movie should be set in the spring. This film was based on a book that was based on a real event that happened June 3, 1980. But that was still a convincing story.
