I absolutely loved this movie. I'm not sure what's special about it, but I think it was wonderful and should be available for DVD. The women were strangers, and yet they were well enough to spend time in a villa in Italy. The actors, in my opinion, have done a great job. The characters were all so different and yet clever that it worked. There is humor, drama and relationship problems in time. It takes 10 rows, but I just can not think of it, so I'm just going to shake it until I get 10 rows. Sorry about that. What else can I say it's been the last time I've ever seen her. I'm looking forward to reshaping but not available.
