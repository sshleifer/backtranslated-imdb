It was a great pleasure for me to go for a Milan film shot in Milan. Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who he rightly and fortunately portrayed in a film of Milanese philosophy. The film tells the story of a standard career Milan couple, starting from birth to death. Parents' wedding is so typical of any scheme that becomes original and includes all the wedding guests in a recollected story of how a couple approached and felt in love. Life is difficult in the "city" of Milan, and after the old sweets have become harder and harder, then the product: a child that weakens the place of strengthening the pair of relationships, because of the "selfish effect" typical of today's "metropolis". The advertising environment with all the "creative" stressful atmosphere helps to get involved in the plot well. We are losing living values ​​and that's good and deeply reflected in this nice and sharp film by director Senza Pelle. Actors are well chosen, Stefania Rocca is a nice and well-characterized and positive surprise, the unexpected good Fabio Volo, well known for the TV series: "Le Iene". <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
