I was pleasantly surprised that I really liked the movie. Funny writing (I got some "inside" jokes, I did not do it anymore - maybe because of actors talking over), great acting (notably John Cassini), great portraits, interesting and unique direction. I followed her when he saw Jeffrey Meek (he was very disappointed that it was so short, it was flashing and you miss him!) But the movie was remarkably entertaining. I will really watch her before sending back to Netflix. I think actors and actors want to look forward to this film. The end is rather awaited but wishes to do something else (and more positive). The pity that the film was not better accepted, except in the "festival" market. I suggest it to anyone who loves playing biz.
