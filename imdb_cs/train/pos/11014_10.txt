I enjoyed watching Cliffhanger, at the beginning when this woman (Sarah) was full of fear as she slid, I thought it was a terrible scene because I thought that when you see it, the nerves in your body they get to you because it makes you full of fear and your heart beats faster. I liked watching Cliffhanger, I think Silvestar Stallone is a great actor and I think he will be known as playing Rambo and Rocky.
