This is a stupid film of a thinking man. If you do not expect Star Wars and enjoy British humor, it could be just for you the classical classic she has for my wife and me - by taking Cary Grant and Jack Nicholson's "voice" as Martians to the over-simplifying Big Bean population is a movie that you can either sleep or watch carefully and enjoy anyway. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone, but if you like a relaxing easy humor that has a quick mind to see the joke how it slips, you'll enjoy this movie.
