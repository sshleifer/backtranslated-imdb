Adaptation scenes often have a big mistake. Often they appear, it looks like the movie camera was simply placed on the stage (for example, "nightmare"). Sidney Lumet's direction keeps the movie alive, which is particularly difficult because his painting offered no real challenge. Still, it's nice to look at what it is. Chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is pretty great. The dynamics of their relationship is surprising. Caine is fantastic as always, and Reeve has one of the few chances he really does. I admit I've never seen Ira Levin play, but I hear Jay Presson's Allen's adaptation is true. The script is incredibly intricate and constantly guesses you. "Deathtrap" is an extremely funny movie and is recommended to almost all fans of the scene and screen. <br /> <br /> 7.4 of 10
