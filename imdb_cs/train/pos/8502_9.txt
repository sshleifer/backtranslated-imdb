Gung Ho is one of the movies you want to see over and over again. Michael Keaton is responsible for bringing a Japanese automobile company to his city, creating jobs for the Hadleyville people. What happens after it's a funny moment after another. Both cultures collide and it's up to Keaton to keep things together. See great performances from Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. All are perfectly occupied. Do not be fooled by a low numerical value. That's 7.5 in my book. It is interesting to note that the name Hadleyville was also used in the high meridian. Yes, there is a real Hadleyville, but in Oregon.
