This movie is a great example of good stories. The game is great. The story is inspirational without being too manipulative or fake. There were a couple of points where people were likely to make them better or worse than they really were, but because it is a Hollywood movie, they have shown amazing restraint. There was not even one explosion in the movie, even though they had one option. The film, which had exciting parts, was not filmed in the action movie. The story focuses on an extraordinary man in unfortunately the usual times. Great!
