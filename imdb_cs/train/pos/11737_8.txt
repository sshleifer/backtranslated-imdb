OK, this movie is stupid. I think it's a good way, though. It was stupid and it was one of the better "silly" films I've seen. Jokes and gags are deliberately wrong, but they have gone so far as to make all the right remarks with me. Supporting characters were relatively shallow and average. It's a pretty weak conspiracy, but it works fine. <br /> <br /> Elvira's character is centered here. She is nice and cute. Cassandra Petersen has the world of acting talent that is currently living in this film. in the upper part of the acting talent, the physical attributes, which were sincere, amazing. Few men disagree. The pieces that show her character were also some of the most enjoyable scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> I had a smile ear to my ear from the first scene to the last. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended to fans of comedy and fans of beautiful women. I wish I could do a dozen other Elvie films.
