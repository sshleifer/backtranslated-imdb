I was not a fan of seeing this movie at all, but when my gf called me and told me she had a free advanced screening card, which I labeled just for seeing Eva Longoria and laughing with Jason Biggs. <br /> Overall, it was better than I expected, but not much. it was like the momentum of losing a guy in 10 days and just like heaven. a typical romantic comedy I think. the film was relatively short (about 85 minutes), but it was enough to tell the whole story, build some character development and have a decent happy ending. the whole thought of the spirit that pursues her former husband was an interesting plot to follow. Eve tried to keep sarcasm and paul rudd, and the rest of the accompanying cast (mainly Jason Biggs) kept the laughs of a smooth pace. <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked the film just because I had a lot of laughter to hold on, otherwise I would have given it a lower rating. hey his cat and I review this movie from a guy's perseptive in order, it would be more fair fight if women's films were reviewed and put there thoughts about it.
