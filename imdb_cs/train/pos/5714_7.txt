I was so excited to see this movie because I've always heard that it's very scary. Interestingly, it's a Japanese film that they chose to bring to America, but in fact, they shot Japan with the original crew! I think it made the movie ... more of Japan (which is probably why he managed to be absolutely successful, unlike most Japanese-American horrors), but also a bit inaccessible to the American audience. The difference in what scares the Japanese culture and scares the American culture has been felt throughout the movie. This worked well in the moments when they wanted to capture the nervous fear of the main character: a frightened fish in a large, busy, unknown Tokyo pond. The story was also quite confusing. In a typical Japanese style, it is extremely complicated and confusing. The beginning of the movie is actually in the middle of the story and from there we keep moving forward and backward until we see the end and the beginning of the story at the end of the film. This constant overturning of time was very confusing to me. I also did not think that some things were explained so well, and I had to ask my friend to explain it to me (she already saw it, just like a sequel that obviously reveals more story). <br /> <br /> Overall there is plenty for American spectators, lots of strange pictures and strange details that are healthy splash jump scenes.
