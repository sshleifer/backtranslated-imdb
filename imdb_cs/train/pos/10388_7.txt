I'm a huge fan of the Dukes of Hazzard TV show. And I really liked it. I enjoyed much more than I did with other summer stars. It's a funny hearing of people who, with this film, are going to justify themselves as a "lame fence" and "it's a lot tougher than a show." Somebody remembers the roughness of humor in the pilot episode? Daisy makes jokes of incest, and Bo says that Luke probably had half the children in the orphanage. The only reason he was cleansed is that it has changed over time. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to plotting. It was a perfect dean's conspiracy. In fact, as a remake, the source material will probably be more true than any television show that has moved to a big screen. While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville are not exactly like their small screen versions, they do a great job and work well. I was not very fond of Burt Hogg's Burt. And I would like a little more incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe. In the movie, Roscoe is a little ... scary. And who did not have a smile on his face when General Lee raced down the streets of Atlanta and the back roads of Hazzard? br /> <br /> People, let yourself enjoy a movie that is just a justification for nostalgia, bikinis and car chase, you will not regret it. It's just a great stupid movie!
