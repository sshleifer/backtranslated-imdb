The idea of ​​Sarah Silverman, who had her own show, was worrying me first. The movies that appeared were not very fun and her humor is a little out of the ordinary. But I was very surprised to see how her real colors shone in this Central Century comedy. Maybe I could put her on a level with Amy Sedaris in Strangerece with Candy - Sarah is a distinctive true sociopath, very similar to Sedaris' Jerri Blank. One crash of this show is its supporting cast. Her sister is good; Occasionally it was fun, but eventually it did not steal Sarah's show. The remaining part of the cast is, however, extremely below average. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that Central Comedy gave Sarah a chance to show her a unique and crazy sense of self and humor.
