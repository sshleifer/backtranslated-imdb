<br /> <br /> If you are interested in pirates, pirate films, American history of New Orleans / early 19th century or Yul Brynner, take a look at this movie and create it with your own eyes. Do not be postponed with a variety of insignificant reviews. My reaction to this was that she was funny, well acting (for the most part), has some very humorous dialogue, and is doing a great job that portrays the charm, appeal and legendary fascination of private Jean Lafitte. While not all the events in the movie are historically accurate (can you show me some historical film we have managed?), I feel the film is accurate in dealing with the role played by Lafitte in the history of New Orleans, the hateful relationship between "worthy" the citizens of New Orleans and this outlaw who was one of the most popular sons of the city. Do not worry about what the film does, but watch for what it does, that is, to study one of the most popular historical figures of New Orleans and America.
