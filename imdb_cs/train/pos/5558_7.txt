This story is known in the long-running Tom and Jerry cartoons, especially in the 1940s, the only difference being that two cats instead of one are threatened to be expelled unless they catch a mouse (Jerry). Tom has an extraordinary friend ("Butch?"), So it really upset Mammy Two Shoes who can not believe they have a mouse despite the two cats in the house. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the one who caught Jerry can stay while the other gets a boot so the competition is on! Although it is a well-known territory, I still liked it because the cartoon had plenty of original visual gags to make fun. You are not just that cats compete against everyone but Jerry in the equation as well, so it was good enough gags that we definitely recommend if you are a fan of Tom & Jerry.
