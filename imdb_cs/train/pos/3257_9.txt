I just saw this movie on TV for the second time. It's beautiful, warm, sentimental, very romantic. I have rarely seen that actors are better able to show their love and gestures to the next. - Chopil Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey, Jr. and in particular Mary Stuart Masterson just overturned himself. Masterson probably has the most difficult role and is just adorable. <br /> <br /> The film is in the spirit of both romantic movies, such as when you slept when Harry met Sally, Seattle sleepless and "high trick" movies like Big, back to the future, Peggy Sue married. I hate to say this because this cast was excellent and I would never change any of them - but I think it did not succeed, just like the above mentioned films, because the cast of the cast was not so great Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox and Kathleen Turner at the time the film was shot. It's not perfectly written - for example, character lines are not particularly memorable. Yet it is perfect. <br /> <br /> Romantic desires are really tangible, the "feeling" of people who fall in love is greatly communicated, love is timeless and ubiquitous sweeping, a sense of loss, and the desire to re-capture that connection are so touching delivered. You're moving again and again. In fact, it is a comparable film Made in Heaven - the same romantic desire. You will see - it's beautiful.
