This recreation of innocent murders in 1959 in Kansas, based on the book Capote, is shot so much by Brooks and cameraman Hall in black and white, giving him a documentary feeling. Blake and Wilson perform well as killers and Forsythe as a policeman watching them. The scenes that led to the murders, shot in the house where the crime took place, with the soundtrack of gusty winds, are quite intense and cold. Brooks drives with lots and uses some interesting crosses between scenes. The only complaint is that it is somewhat excessive, with separation and somewhat preaching.
