Kurosawa rests in a story that features a variety of characters, like Shakespeare's drama, and acting is a true story, with each star playing its part as part of a larger story. It's moving, fun and interesting in all parts. The character's evolution is almost perfect, cinematography is lively and impressive, and the story attracts you. I would like to say that "samurai savers" and those obsessed with dynastic late 18th and 19th century stories from Japan can reduce this film as Kurosawa's worst job. Maybe it's not his best, but even in his worst case, Kurosawa is better than many of the best. This story is based on the improvement of the secular lives of ordinary people at times of great change, that it is timeless, even though it is in the recent past. I would warmly recommend to any fan of the film and especially to those who are likely to continue reading the novel on which the film is based.
