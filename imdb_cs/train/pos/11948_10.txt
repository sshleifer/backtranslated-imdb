"Match Point" and now "Scoop" both convinced me that Woody Allen not only makes films in England (and that Scarlett Johansson is the right member), but he confirmed what I knew for years: he did not have to concentrate on neurotic rich New Yorkers. In this case, Johansson plays Sondra Pransky's journalism, which Magician Sid Waterman (Allen) puts in his fading box where he meets the ghost of the murdered reporter Joe Strombel (Ian McShane) who tells him that serial killings have been committed by millionaire Peter Lyman Hugh Jackman). So she knows him and ... well, I do not know how much I can tell you without leaving it. But I can say that this is probably Allen's most fun movie for years. There is a ubiquitous unique style of humor (especially the line about his religion). <br /> <br /> So, surely you like this movie. If nothing else, it will love you so much for London. But it's so damn funny. Even if you do not like Woody Allen, you have to love this.
