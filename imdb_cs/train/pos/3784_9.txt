One of the most underestimated films I've ever seen, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey is the second funny adventure of Bill S. Preston Esq. and Ted Theodore Logan, aka Wyld Stallyns. There are two ways to look at this film: First, you see a silly dialogue, a far-reaching conspiracy, a teen idea. OR .. You see the ghastly frustrated idiots who were once again in a situation that was too big for their brains. Build this plot by Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzeneggar and become a big blockbuster. Bill and Ted go to the story with the same degree of honesty, just Bill and Ted. It's a tricky fence that is coping with it, but when you look at the film, not as a gothic comedy, it's much more like an adventure of two boys who do not have any work in adventure.
