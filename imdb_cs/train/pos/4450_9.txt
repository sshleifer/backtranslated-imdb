An old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat. He wanders in the woods to witness murder, but he sees murder or loses his mind? Is he aging? The movie is so great because the viewer has to realize what's going on. There is very little dialogue in this film, but it does not need words, the whole movie speaks for itself. You knew what was going on, and I liked it. The second part I liked was the footage of the forest at the end of autumn and winter. It was nice, but the only thing I did not like was a look at the old man in the underwear. He could tie the cloak a little more, but otherwise, it was a pretty deep film.
