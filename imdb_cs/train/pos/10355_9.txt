A fascinating film based on a true story about an Australian woman, Linda Chamberlain (Meryl Streep), has accused her of killing her daughter. He insists the dingo has taken a baby, but the story is very suspicious. The film is in fact about the media circus around the case, the way the Australians interpreted what was presented in the media, and the mental linguistics that ultimately led to a woman's conviction based on hardly any hard evidence. I like films that challenge the media, as well as movies that are hard to see how people are just systemic. I always thought the jury should be shown 12 angry men before they were through their duty. It is not, as it was often called, a liberal film, but a clinical view of how we as man interpret events based so much on our prejudices and the desire for vengeance. Screaming in the dark is also clinical. Schepisi makes sure the film is not melodramatic at all. Some may find the film boring or dry, but I found it impressive.
