"The Secret Sun" reminded me of "Rapture" (1991), with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but this Korean production is a better film. It portrays supraregional Korean Christians in the provincial Korean city and experiences the main characters with them in interaction with a terrible personal tragedy. Shin-ae is a widowed mother who moves to Milyang ("Secret Sunshine" in Chinese) from Seoul and her young son. She chose Milyang because her late husband was born there (killed in a car accident) and she feels she needs to start a new life in a new place. He does not respond well to the remorse of local Christian enthusiasts, whose one member tries to persuade her to come to her church and prayer meetings. Shin-ae is essentially reckless and removes these people as politely as he can. In fact, almost everyone in Milyang is throwing at the beginning, but some of them are persistent in attempting to attack their world and the consequences are often merry. To say more, the film must be cast, but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the lead role (Jeon Do-yeon) is amazing. After reading that she was awarded the Cannes Best Actress Award in 2007, I expected it to have a decent job. But Mrs. Jeon is captivating and it is not possible to take her out of sight when she is on the screen. The film is a kind of crazy job by Evelyn Waugh-esquire, which shows how fate can feel madly equally strangely inevitable.
