This film is one of the most entertaining, saddest and most accurate portraits of mentality that seems to have gone through the Balkans 45 years after the time. All the usual characters and conflicts are presented with such anger, sadness and love that it is not possible to decide whether paying or laughing would be a more appropriate answer. The accuracy of the rendering and the timelessness of the types, however, makes a great film to watch if we want to understand a bit about what has overtaken the former Yugoslavia for its madness. In fact, no diplomat dealing with the area should try something until he sees this film and his twin, * Marathoners are a temporary ruler. * Did I mention that this is one of the most fun movies I've ever seen?
