The only reason I make this film 8 out of 10 is that, in my opinion, there are several films that are perfect. This little picture B is a tense story, well said. I have always been interested in Alexander Knox, but I have seen only a few movies. Here plays Wilhelm Grimm, a sad man who turns into a monster. They betray everything and all without stress. Performance is one of the coolest performances I've ever seen. Since World War II, actors who played Nazis or other bad films have been occasionally nominated for an Oscar. I imagine that, since it happened during the war, the academy felt it honored to perform as if it were an honorable evil. But Knox in this performance - a man so bitter and consumed guilty that he does not think he will suffer another. It still does not work. <br /> <br /> Marshha Hunt, who usually plays a filbert or a social butterfly, is occupied against the kind of best performance I've ever seen. Perhaps Oscar is not good but the best of her career. Nothing against her; I used it in the "gentle" roles she often played. But here she proves that she has gone to a heavier drama. If you like human dramatic stories or stories about the fate of those who suffered in the hands of the Nazis, I highly recommend this fine little movie.
