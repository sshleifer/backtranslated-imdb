I had mixed feelings about "Les Valseuses" (1974) written and directed by Bertrand Blier when I started watching him, but in the end I liked it. I would not say it vulgar ("Dumb and Dumber" is vulgar, "The Sweetest Thing" is both vulgar and unforgivingly silly); I would say it shocking and insulting. I understand why many viewers, especially women, do not like or even hate it. It is the embodiment of the misogyny (or so it seems), and the way the two anti-heroes deal with every woman they meet will seem undeniable. But the more I think about it, the more I realize it somehow looks like a beautiful little jewel. I'm fascinated by how Blier could get away. The film is very entertaining and very pleasant: it is well written, the acting of all is first class and the music is sweet and melancholic. Actually, when I thought about it, two of my friends did something good for the women they met: preparing a woman on the train (Brigitte Fossey, a lovely blonde who started her film career with one of René Clément's most impressive debuts, "Forbidden Games" (1952) years) for a meeting with her husband she had not seen for two months; found that the man who finally managed to get the frigid Marie-Ange (Miou-Miou) came out and satisfied; enlightened and educated the young and very willing Isabelle Huppert (in one of her early performances). Their encounter with Jeanne Moreau encourages this comedy to a tragic level. In short, I'm not sure I would like to meet Pierre Gerard Depardieu Jean-Claude and Patrick Deweer in real life and invite them to dinner, but I had a good time watching the film and for two hours almost flying - it was never boring.
