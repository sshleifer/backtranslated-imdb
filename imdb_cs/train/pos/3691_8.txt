The whole does not even get to the sum of parts. No problem. This film is a set of some of the most diverse creative directors of our time and some really famous names in the cast. Segments are designed around the same theme, "Love in Paris," but the similarity ends. In fact, given that the approach to the subject from all of these different directors takes so many different forms, it is amazing that we can even feel that we are still watching the same movie. No great effort has been made to turn it into a complex whole. This buffet has so many great ingredients, I'm glad nobody tried to put everything in a single dish.
