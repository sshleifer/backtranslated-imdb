I first saw it when they showed it around the 1993/4 Easter time and they did not remember much about it, I bought it on DVD last summer when I started to get Michael Jackson (he liked his music before) and enjoyed I get older I'm older. It's a good movie, but it will not be such a classic movie as The Sound of Music, West Side Story, Wizard Of Oz etc. Michael Jackson as an actor was good and so the other members were cast. There were disturbing scenes, like the little girl Katie had gotten into the cry of gangster Frankie Lideo played by Joe Pesci. The scene that scared me when I was younger turned Michael into a robot. My favorite song on the movie was Smooth Criminal. I think it was better than Thriller, in my opinion.
