Douglas Sirk directs this excess drama about unhappy wealth. Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack) and Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) are childhood friends with different views of life. Kyle is the female son of a petroleum magnate; Mitch works for the Hadley Oil Company. They both fall in love with the same woman, Lucy Moore; but it's Kyle, who has the means to get her legs off and marry her. Sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) seems to be an urban nymphomaniac and carrying a burner for Mitch, who always seems to be the one who cleans Hadley's confusion. Ambitious with preload; a little over the top, but the stars make it see the movie. I was most impressed with Malone. Round rotation: Robert Keith, Edward Platt, John Lurch and Robert J. Wilke.
