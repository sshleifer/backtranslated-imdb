My gentle father is like reading a book, chapters after a chapter that you read it (with your eyes), and learn more about Harilal Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi. So little is known about both of them and this film is uniquely describing them. However, the title deceives, like the film about Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son, like Harilal and his mother. And Akshaye Khanna and Shefali Chayya do justice to their roles. <br /> <br /> Such movies are like jump years. They will only spend so much time. Gandhi My Father is also about an internal struggle that is sometimes more difficult than any fight for freedom ever made. <br /> <br /> Look if you like a high quality cinema.
