It's a great British movie. A cleverly hidden script with many sensitive lines that perfectly captures what magic sponges can do to men over the weekend. As usual, Phil Daniels is excellent along with the most under British actor Geoff Bell. Peter Bowles with a hinge hanging from his mouth is casting a masterpiece and Gary Stretch with his delight looks bringing something strange atmospheric piece. Though he seems to be billed as a movie biker, I think he will find the audience out of it, purely on the assumption that many people have done it and got a T-shirt. also a great original soundtrack with a blinding version of Freebird. This really can be the heir of the 21st Century, which has met the famous comedies of Ealing. Just like weeds in Welsh fields: it's a grower!
