This movie has always enjoyed me. Compared to the serial mum, Mr. Waters returned to his harsher side. It's not nearly as polished. <br /> <br /> There is a dark side. A report on how success and glory change man - but more importantly, how people around you are changing. <br /> <br /> This is not a fake moment. <br /> <br /> The characters are somewhat cartoon ... but I want to believe what Mr. Waters is trying to achieve. It's fascinating to watch Mr. Waters develop ... That's really his best job.
