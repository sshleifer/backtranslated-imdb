What is "Cry Freedom" like? It is simply a great and unique experience with the creation of South Africa and how the black people in this country have been suppressed by white people. The main character of the story is Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), Editor-in-Chief of Daily Dispatch in South Africa. Woods writes several articles critically speaking about Steve Bik (Denzel Washington). Soon Woods meets Bik, and he changes his views on him, and he also begins to understand what authorities are doing to black people in South Africa (right from the top, even the police chief). When Biko dies in police custody, Woods decides that he has to write a book about him and that no matter what he has to post. But Woods must escape from his country to release this book, and he must also put his family in second place so the world can find out the truth. Attenborough managed to make a good film about people, the main message that black and white are the same because we are all people. The story brings us to South Africa and this movie is a great way for the whole world to know what happened in this country and I am disappointed that only 3200 people have filtered this film. It's a movie from which we can all learn something. Although it is a bit long, this story could not be presented in a shorter way because the director wanted to show how hard it was for Woods to publish this book after the death of Biko. <br /> <br /> Also, the relationship between Woods and Bike was great, just like the families of these two people and all the problems they are going through. Sometimes, however, sacrifices (Bik's death) must be made to make the truth come true (Woods Book).
