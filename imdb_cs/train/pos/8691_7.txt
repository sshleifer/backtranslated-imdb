Film star Alain Resnais likes to work with those actors who are part of his family. We also see members of the Resnaise family such as Pierre Arditi, Sabine Azema, André Dussolier and Fanny Ardant, who deal with serious issues such as death, religion, suicide, love and their overall consequences for our everyday life. The formal nature of the relationship shared by these people is obvious as well as friends, they are addressing each other through a formal one. In 1984, when he made L'amour à mort, Resnais dealt with time, memory, and space to reveal the mystery of the fundamental question of human existence: Is love stronger than death? It was 16 years ago in 1968 when Resnais made a rather similar film Je t'aime Je t'aime, which was also about love and memories. The message of this film is loud and clear: true and deep love can even give science to embarrassment. Dead lovers regain their lost lives and leave physicians to care for their reputation. L'amour à mort is like a game that is not at all didactic. This is a movie in which the music score is in perfect tandem with your pictures. why this movie can be easily understood.
