I loved this episode. It's so great that all 5 of them connect and stop LutherCorp and save the world. I also like this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen / Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen / Green Arrow) are playing in it! I just hope Clark will enter the League of Justice and we will follow this group of heroes all over the world! =) It was really exciting and the audience's interest in what's going to happen next. I think Chloe should also join the team as a watchtower, that would be such a thing he could do next to the Planet Day, because he does not have the super power. I also want to find out what types of Lex items I would use for 33.1, I wonder what other types of powers other people have in the world!
