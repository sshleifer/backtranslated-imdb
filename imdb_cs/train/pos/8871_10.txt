It was a great movie that had a lot of subordinate questions. He dealt with issues of racism and class. But she also reported that you became familiar with yourself and assumed responsibility for yourself. This movie was so deep that it gave a message that you and only you can control your destiny. It has also turned out that knowing yourself and being content with who you are, is the only way you get involved in society. What others think about you is not important. I believe this movie did a great job when it showed it. The actors I think have been able to translate each character in a beautiful way. I just thought it was amazing how deep this movie really was. Looking at you carefully, you will not see how deep the film is, but when you look at it, you can see the underlined meaning of the film.
