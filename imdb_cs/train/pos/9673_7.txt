Paulie sounds the most sacrificial, tearful and sentimental waste you've ever found, yet it's much better than you might expect. The plot of conspiracy could so easily set the tone for the whole movie, but in most other departments the film is charming. If you're wondering, Paulie is a parrot. Bored for a little girl with speech problems, Paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her. He even sits on the shoulder during a speech therapy lesson, and eventually becomes a super-intelligent speaker himself. However, Paulie is sent away by the girl's mother and he spent the rest of the movie trying to get from NYC to LA to reconnect with her. So, why is this horrible movie quite successful? First, it boasts some interesting and impressive animatronic effects. Secondly (and much more importantly) he has the courage to accept his absurd assumption and tells of a truly moving, often humorous story, without worrying too much about obvious shortcomings. Third, he has some surprisingly powerful performances, including Jay Mohr as a werewolf, Gena Rowlands as a kind lady and Cheech Marin (yes, a Cheech Marin! Cigarette) As a music immigrant. Maybe it's not a classic, but Paulie is a good fun for kids of all ages.
