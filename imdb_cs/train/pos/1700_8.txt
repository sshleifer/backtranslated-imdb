I loved this movie. you have to respect jeans who dress like little Martians. True, the story can sometimes be thin, but you can not get rid of how it happened. I've been looking at it again and again when I was the 8th child's movie, and besides, it has some of the biggest quotes at all. Blanzee's "Home on the Range" interview is amazing. <br /> <br /> Very well if you ask me, 8 out of 10.
