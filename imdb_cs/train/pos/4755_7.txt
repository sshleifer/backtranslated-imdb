A bus full of passengers is stuck in a snowstorm. The police closed the bridge - saying it was dangerous and they are stuck in a small caf√© until the road is cleaned up. However, after a while, their boredom is turning to worries, as it seems that one of the passengers was not originally in the bus and could only be a stranger! This leads to a conclusion that is ironic, but also rather funny in the low-speed path. <br /> <br /> This is another funny episode of The Twilight Zone. Instead of typing changes or social commentaries, this message does not contain any permanent messages. It is also very observable, so who cares? Exactly what is happening, just look at yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, this star John Hoyt - the face that most of you know from countless old television shows and movies. In almost every case, he played a real grouch (like Charles Lane at the same time), but the boy liked to see me - how he perfected a hilarious personality while at the same time he was a bit humorous.
