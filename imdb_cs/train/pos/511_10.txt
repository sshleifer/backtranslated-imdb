First I saw this movie almost 21 years ago, when it was ITV (before the cable and satellite days) Matin√©e. I was out of school with the Mumps and I was completely wrapped up in the movie. I have it for a video purchase of about 10 years and I want to get a copy of the DVD. David Niven is my favorite actor, and I think it's a travesty that he's been watching so many times when the Oscars appeared around him. I also think the queen should knit him, for it was easy for the film industry, if not more than Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins. the way the movie moves from black and white to color and back is well done and the movie has starred actors such as Roger Livesy, Marius Goring and Richard Attenborough.
