Excellent farce! This, of course, is all that is supposed to be. Fortunately, there is no social or political message, not even the smallest attempt in this direction. Could the plot actually take place or take place at a certain time or place? It's unlikely because it's just a movie and the movies are based on fantasy, not reality. The only goal of this film is to have fun, not to educate and entertain, to throw a gorgeous and carefree reality into the wind. I think most would agree to expect enlightenment and authenticity from the documents. But for fun I want what is now described as "not-invented," which is a game for pairing in all respects. A few giggles and obvious laughter are good fantasies.
