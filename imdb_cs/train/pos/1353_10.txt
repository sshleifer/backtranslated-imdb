The cast is different, and now we have another approach that we have in the smart Networth vs. the supposed "Magna" professional team, but boy, if you think the intelligent street team would have trouble getting you right. While the Magna Team was sometimes struggling, the street team simply fell apart a week after a week. First of all, some things to repeat when it comes to "Apprentice 3" first goes on the same absurd mentality (from Trump) and the game in this series: if you are the right project manager but you lose, the team will turn to you and you will be thrown out despite the fact that your teammates are often those who do half-jobs. It is simply absurd that the game that claims to hire the best candidate really "weeds" the best, while dysfunctional candidates recoil until one is left and the best one. lol <br /> <br /> Anyone this season we've seen a total curse, backstabbing and even gay stereotypes done as teams try to make campaigns. <br /> <br /> The list of victims still cast by Tara Dowdell, Audrey Evans, Danny Kastner, these three are the only ones I think Trump has unfairly fired, the rest really came because they only provoked conflict, anger, and misery. It's amazing because one candidate, Audrey Evans, said how the one who did the good work was out and how some of her worthless teammates are still playing. Yes, it's a game, it's "The Apprentice" where manipulation, backstabbing and always popular "all gang on the project manager" rules mentality. It was a fun ride, though the candidates were given a wide range of photographic shooting tasks by constructing minigolf playgrounds, building new apartments. <br /> <br /> And yet it's still an 'apprentice', so all you can do is basically laugh like madness and chaos, it's the winner.
