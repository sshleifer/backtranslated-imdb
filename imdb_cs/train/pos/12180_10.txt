In my opinion, GUY THING is a cheerful, humorous, sexy, romantic and absolutely beautiful movie that boys also enjoy. I thought Jason Lee and Julia Stiles would be dazzled as a confused groom and his soon-to-be-cousin. When you ask me, the screen lights up like a spell. You can also feel their chemistry between them. Before I pack it, I would like to say that the performances were excellent, the direction was flawless, the design was nice, the casting was perfect and the costumes were perfectly designed. In conclusion, for anyone who is a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles, I recommend this movie. You have a lot of laughter and excitement, so go to a video rental shop, borrow it or buy it, kick it with a friend and watch it.
