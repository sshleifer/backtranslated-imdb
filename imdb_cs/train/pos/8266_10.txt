This most famous achievement of social realism, Georg Wilhelm Pabst, is based on a tragedy at the beginning of 1906, when nearly 1,100 French miners died, because the explosion of coal dust deep in the Courrieres in northern France took place three weeks after the fire and eventually released the mortal gas that caused fatal consequences. Estimated designer Erno Metzner creates sharp sets that simulate tragedy and provide a perception of reality accompanied by unrivaled sound editing, with the only music creating integral orchestras at the beginning and ending parts of the work for which the phonetic effects are equally important to the fascinating visual composition of the excellent director. Pabst's "invisible editing", which discourages shots from triggering player movements, is reflected by a smooth incorporation into this landmark film, which also portrays exquisite cinematography using camera-mounted cameras, allowing the director to move between the scenes without cutting. Although the cardinal theme of work is related to the socialist dogma, the unforgettable power of this film takes place in its details, born out of the incomprehensible skills of Pabsta, who wove numerous conspiratorial lines into a cinematic tapestry that brings admiration for German rescue troops, very proud, though not neglects disastrous losses for families of French victims; certainly, the key triumph that is now full of cinema stimulation as it was at the time of its first release.
