The secret of KELLS can be the most beautiful movie I've ever seen from TRIPLETS BELLEVILLE. Though very different in style, KELLS shares with TRIPLETS and KUNG FU PANDA, the incredible artistic direction, production design, background / layout and color richness that is a feast for one's senses. KELLS is so rich - almost gothic in its arrangement (somewhat resembling Klimt), beautifully flat in overall terms, decorated in Celtic and light design, but the characters are so simple and appealing - And that all works beautifully. You will love the characters from the moment you meet them. You are so attracted to every detail of the story and to every stroke of the pencil and brush. What Tomm, Nora, Ross, Paul and everyone in the Cartoon Saloon (and their extended crew) have achieved with this small budget / very small crew movie is absolutely stunning. The fundamental support between our animation community is phenomenal. This movie is breathtaking and humming among our colleagues in the recommendations of this movie spreads like a mad fire. Congratulations to KELLS for many awards, a nomination for Annie and the current Oscar qualification tournament. Everyone is a very deserved nod, really ...
