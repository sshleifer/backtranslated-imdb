I first saw Martin's day when I was home in The Movie Channel, and I still remember the impact on life. He touched me because no other film touched me and I remember how I set my eyes off. When I saw it for the first time, I could not find it anywhere else. I would like to ask and no one ever heard about this movie! I think it was one of those rare movies that many people did not know because nobody, and I think nobody, knew what I was talking about. I've been looking for and looking over the years, checking out video shops and scanning cable TV listings, but it's always coming. Finally, in 1996, I found out that I could order it separately, so I did, and I probably watched her at least 50 times - and still crying for me. <br /> <br /> Martin's day is Martin Steckert, a man in prison (but a really good guy) who wants to return to a special lake where he grew up as a boy. It was a strange place where he lived out of nature, he spent time with his dog and left himself enjoying life. He soon escapes into the movie and begins to return to the lake. Even before the cops find him, Steckert is preparing the kid as a hostage to persuade the police to come back. off. Soon, Steckert and his hostage (2nd Martin) become best friends and have plenty of adventure fun - ranging from the toy car to the train, all on their way to this special lake. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, Steckert has great memories of him at the lake like a boy. <br /> <br /> I will not destroy the end for you, but I will tell you this movie is to be seen. It's the best movie I've ever seen in my life! I am undoubtedly the biggest fan of EVER! I managed to find a song that both Martin's are singing throughout the movie ("I'm going back, where I came from ...) I even plan a trip to Canada to see the lake and the cottage where Martin's Day was filmed, a fool I know - but that movie means so much to me for me.
