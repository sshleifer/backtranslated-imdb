For anyone wishing to gain a sense of Soviet insight into modern Russian history, this monumental film is a treasure. The story begins at the turn of the century (1900) in the yellowish sepia colors of old photographs, which improve in the mid-century to black and white and full of colors when the story approaches modern times (ie, the 1960s). /> <br /> The story focuses on a boy in a remote Siberian village that is marked by the arrival and arrest of the anarchist during the time of Tsarism. Later, after the revolution, he joined the Bolsheviks and brought Soviet communism to his village. His son, according to local beauty, fights against the Germans during the Second World War. When he returns to the village, the oil industry is taking off and we are looking at some Soviet economic idealism. This film is long and slow but completely logical and very well crafted. This can be seen in three parts.
