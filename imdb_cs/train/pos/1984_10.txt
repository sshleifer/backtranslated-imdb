One of the best musicals that is timeless and worth seeing over and over again. Delicious! Actor acting, especially Ron Moody as Fagin, is excellent. Costumes are beautiful ... even shabby. The two young boys who play Oliver and The Artful Dodger are gorgeously talented. Oliver Reed is doing a great job in which Bill Sykes sees where you can not help, but I hope he will come to the horrible end ... which he does. <br /> <br /> The dance is cleverly choreographed and fascinating. Oliver can stand with his own people like My Fair Lady, Sound of Music, Oklahoma, etc. Movie for the whole family.
