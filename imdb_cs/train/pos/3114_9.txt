I'm going to be pretty short to destroy you. This movie is amazing. From the beginning to the end it is full of real excitement. Battle scenes are fantastic, the pursued scenes are charming and moving at such a rate that they really feel only slowly until the end when it's explained, but that's just because everything that preceded it. Damon shines and really turns out to be a very solid actor, to dare you not to believe him in this role. This is the role. The welcome addition of the David Straithrain series (I hope I wrote that close to the right) as a frantic CIA agent who killed Bourne. It is non stop and will really leave you on the edge of your seat most of the way. Some things in the end are just smidgeon absurd, and so negates rating 10. The end is left open for the continuation and I hope they think we do more of them because no one was wrong. An excellent movie in all and the fantastic end of the amazing trilogy. P.S. An agitated camera did not hurt any action, but I think we could do without it. The good news is that you really notice when people talk and not so many actions.
