As a convert to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I try to absorb as much as possible the history of the new religion. I was invited to participate in the presentation of this film with my children and other young men and women and their families from our department. <br /> <br /> On a beautiful spring evening, we drove to Kirtland, Ohio to the historic village of the church. We had to book at the Vist Center to see this movie. As my film review was limited to just a few church documents, I was interested. The only "feature films" I saw from the church were "Legacy" and "My best two years", as I thought they were very well written and pre-created. <br /> <br /> The missionary performer has sent out tissues that indicate that several people have been deeply moved to the tear point for this film. I thought "OK ... but it's enough to move me to tears." Imagine my surprise when I'm crying! It is indeed a very exciting and inspiring testimony by the Prophet Joseph Smith. <br /> <br /> Look at this and believe it is a powerful message!
