"Sweet is never so sweet without being sour." This quote was, in my view, the subject of the film. Tom Cruise plays a young man who has been given everything in his life. It takes things for granted, and there is a full swing in this wonderful movie with a great twist. This movie will keep you in a plot and you will not be able to stop it to take a break in the bathroom. It's a movie that really takes you back and looks at your life and how to live it. You can not really appreciate the better things in life (sweet), like love, until you get bad (sour). The theme really "opens your eyes". The only complaint is that the movie is very distorted in the points and is hard to understand. I think the end is perfect. I recommend that you look at it and see yourself.
