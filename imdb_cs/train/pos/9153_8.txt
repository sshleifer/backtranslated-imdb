Finally, I finally got to hear about the great things. That actually exceeded my expectations. Since it was a budget, it was a surprisingly competent and well-filmed movie. Lack of finance has actually helped this film in several ways, especially with regard to the story. Like the Blair Witch Project, this movie was all the better that it was filmed instead of a movie. Another bonus: While most of the low-budget horror films (even the best of the best) suffer from mediocre or unintentional hysterics, this film actually has a talented cast (except for one or two characters), especially two. The only thing missing from the film was the original story. It borrows heavily from well-known films like "Deliverance" and "Wrong Turn," but if you are like me, films of this nature will never be horrible. Besides, the director is interested in the whole thing. I would be very glad to see what the director would do with a bigger budget, and I think it's only a matter of time before we find out ...
