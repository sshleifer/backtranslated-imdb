All right, tell me. it's a terrible movie. The plot (as it is) is terrible, it makes it worse. But the film was made for the sole reason and for the sole reason, like all the horrible movies Mario Lanza ... just to hear the voice of the star, in this case Pavarotti in his main. Well, maybe Lanza movies are also an excuse for him to hit on women, but this movie is about Luciano's hearing. It's worth watching the movie. The big opera star, who finds himself in the face of fear, finds humility and love on the way, and many hit numbers are falling apart. I have to admit that I am prejudiced at many levels. I'm Italian. I'm a big fan of Pavarotti (is there something about Pavarotti who is not big, including his fans?). And when I first saw this movie, I walked alone, saw the height and depth of the possibilities of life and love for the first time. Just as horrible as this movie, beautiful voice and memories are enough to breathe deep life and love again. Yes, it is cruel and terrible. But the voice is immortal and timeless, and the voice is all about him. So I give this film a high rating in the hope that someone who has never heard of Pavarotti will listen, watch and enjoy a new level of music and love, especially since he's gone now. Like Italian food you've never tried before, try it! You can be pleasantly surprised, like Luciano's lover or future Pavarotti peep.
