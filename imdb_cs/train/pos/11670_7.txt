Nice plot and dubious characterization make no difference when the movie is as fun as this one. Live events and spectacular stunts - for your day - give this film a real zip. And there's some real comedy about ripping chemistry between the two drivers. Quinn also makes a good villain, though his role is completely overshadowed. But do not be fooled by the hard-rooted role of Maureen O'Hara, it's as sexist as any Hollywood film of that time. You could forgive it for the time it was made, but it's still hard to get past. For all the heroism and horror of an adult out-of-screen situation, it's more than a good adolescent's time.
