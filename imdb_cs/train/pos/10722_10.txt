The Spacecamp is one of the movies that kids like, and mom and dad can also have fun. I grew up in the eighties that I liked this movie, it's a conspiracy and all the actors. I recently bought this movie on DVD, so when I have my own kids, they will be able to watch this movie just like me. The plot is fun, a group of children set off on a journey they never expected when they were moved into a space beyond the robot. They were initially in auh, but when they realized they had not enough oxygen to slow panic. As soon as they got enough oxygen from the space station, they returned to the ground as even better friends and a new respect for life.
