If you have not seen it, you do not know what you are missing. When you do it for the first time, you will be in pains lying on the floor, which accumulates with laughter so hard, and probably wet. <br /> <br /> This is funny. So far, it has not been the only comedy show I've seen is peak or even approaching. So many classic insets, stories and segways .. Drunken Uncle at BBQ, Gi Joe, Mr. T, goony goo goo, ice cream, you say one of these things to anyone who saw this performance and I bet you dollars to the cones that they will not be able to keep a straight face and burst out laughing or the rest of the talk. classical!! It is a shame that you can not get it on DVD .. <br /> <br /> Rating 10+ out of 10
