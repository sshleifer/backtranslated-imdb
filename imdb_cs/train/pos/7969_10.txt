Homeward Bound is a beautiful movie. You know the part where Shadow falls to ditch ... thing, I was crying * when I was only six, I cried! it takes a lot to cry me! Dogs and cats are well trained. Nice family film, * not * for completely cured non-fluffy people or animals-hate, but could for soft-like-bullshit a.k.a. people like me. <br /> <br /> Good movie overall, 10/10!
