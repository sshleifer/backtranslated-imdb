In addition, my list of favorite filmmakers is: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) God Allmighty 3) The rest ... this movie is actually better than a book (and a TV miniseries, even if it's an easy performance with the director). Flawless shooting, acting and (Kubrick's world number one skill) music - making it a masterpiece of horror. I watched the TV miniseries a few years ago and I liked this story, and I had hope for it when I did it. IT BLEW ME AWAY !!! It's much better than I ever imagined. It starts slowly (trademark of Kubrick) and has a lot of downtime that builds tension. The intro scene is a classic by all means, and I watched her about 20 times only because of the shear atmosphere she is making for the whole movie. Also, the film does not offer many gore (it has enough, and it is by no means carefree) the trend I hate in recent horror films. Just watch!
