I watched this movie for the second time to try to find out why he was not as successful (commercially or artistically) as he should be, and discovered a great artistic merit - which eventually could be his commercial commitment. /> <br /> First, this movie is attempting to "serious" science fiction, social commentary, more than action adventure. There is some action, but it is not. If you focus on it, you will end up (as others have noted) with the bad clone "Aliens". Again, this is not what it is all about. The film is about transforming Todd (Kurt Russell) from human to nearby machines and back to man (mostly * back *). But because you are not trying to provide a typical Hollywood-style response, Kurt Russell has to do this transformation without talking and, to a large extent, without any expressive expressions. And he really does a great job - it can take two glances to realize it. The surrounding "social logic" is flawed and it is never sufficiently explained whether Todd has the ability to hold up against the army of allegedly higher units coming from his experience on the battlefield or his newly discovered human or whatever, but the film still makes a wonderful show for Russell's talent depreciate).
