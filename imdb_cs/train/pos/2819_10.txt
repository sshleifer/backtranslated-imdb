This movie is bufoonery! and I loved it! "Dragon Lord" (Jacky Chan) and his friend, "cowboy," have made a fun movie, meaningful and just stupid. The film is a rare combination of good and evil fighting and (in some ways) miracles and entertainment that grows. Long Shao Ye brings the viewer through the everyday activities of a young "dragon master" (so named because he is the son of a wealthy family) and "cowboy," which involves performing smart and complicated ways to escape the study (with the help of the entire household, including a teacher) competing in relatively male (and idiot of interesting) ways to get the affection of a local girl who is competing in "football" (you'll see what I mean) and the list goes on. Somehow they find themselves in the middle of the fight to save a shipment of valuable antiques and the lives of several people. The film has serious moments. But they do not push but rather inspire. Boys' playfulness does not lose in this exchange, but is actually used against evil. What I really loved in this movie is how it ends. Not a typical confrontation (which was amazing in itself), but well, you will see. Let me just say that it really captures the spirit of the film. Stupid, funny, meaningful and nostalgic. great movie.
