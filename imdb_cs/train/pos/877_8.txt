Jean-Jacques's career began with his answer to the essay question: civilization is evil to us. This intelligent and exciting film supports this argument. In this sense, he repeats the theme common to French films: society is real, identity is construction, freedom is criminal. Here the idea is treated literally. Both main characters are found and each other only when the rules are violated. This discovery may remain true in France; in any case it is quite romantic.
