This is the best series of my kind that I've seen all year round. I can not help thinking that it's just my luck - the series I love will get six episodes (and next next year) and a constant stream of cookie-cutter policemen shows that never ending episodes. There are many reasons why new tricks are doing. Scenarios are good and a mix of outstanding characters, playing is a top flight, and a mix of comedy and drama works. Stories are not all unforgettable, but this is not why I'm watching shows like this. <br /> <br /> The theme song is popular and we were disappointed when we found it was not available in any published edition. Great thing, the BBC - the triumph of a sense of sexual appeal (except the young guard no one there is no eye lolly, and though it is, it can still act!).
