Many commentaries I've seen on IMDB for this movie do not really do it. First of all, let me just say that this film will not be taken seriously. It's supposed to be fun, but a stupid film that does not require thinking just to enjoy it. If you look at this movie with the intention of seeing a masterpiece either in a movie or in humor, then you will be very disappointed. Still, if you want to watch just a fucking movie with talented actors / actresses and some good phrases, then you'll enjoy it.
