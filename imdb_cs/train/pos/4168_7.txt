Not only does this film have one of the great film titles, it is the third team of children's actors from the 70's, Ike Eissenman and Kim Richards. It seems to me that this movie is broadcasting the Halloween week back in '78 when against Linda Blair in Strangere in our house. I missed it when I first chose when I decided for another movie. Later, repeatedly, I saw that I had made the right choice. The film is not really bad, but it really lacks chills or surprises. Still, I liked the scene where Richard Crenna shoots the family dog ​​without success.
