I find it a so-so romance / drama that has a nice ending and a generally pleasant feeling. It's not a Hallmark of Hall Of Fame family that is considered a "normal" behavior, but because it's the stars of Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, I would expect it to be a much rougher film, at least in the language. <br /> <br /> The most memorable part of the movie is showing how tough it is when you learn how to read and write when you are already an adult. This is a great movie theme and it includes some of the scenes in question, but to be honest, the film is not that memorable. It's still a fairly mild, nice story I'd like to recommend.
