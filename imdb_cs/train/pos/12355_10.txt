I understand those who do not like this movie due to lack of knowledge. First of all, those girls who are not Geisha, but brokers, and those who do not know the difference, do not understand half the movie and definitely not the end. This is a complete artistic work on the life and needs of women at this time. Everything is important, and certainly the way to dress, all over the film means more than words. For those who thought it was a boring geisha movie, I suggest you read a little about this company before making a conclusion that is so out of reality. This is Kurosawa's life, and I'm sure the director understands Kurosawa's silent meaning to the right intellectual range.
