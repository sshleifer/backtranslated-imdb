Let me start by saying that I'm a big fan of Carrey. Still, I confess that I have not seen all of his movies * cough * magical * cough *. Bruce the Almighty was pleasant. None of the rest of the reviews really happened in the way they are coming to an end, I do not know what the writers thought. Somehow I did not feel like this film was a bad attempt to rebuild the Liar Liar. Steve Correl of The Daily Show is HILARIOUS and so is the rest of the cast. Look at Bruce the Almighty if you're a big fan of Jim Carrey, or you just want to see the cheerful piano music that's somewhat funny.
