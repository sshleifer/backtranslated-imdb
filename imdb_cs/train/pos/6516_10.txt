Hi. I just watched this movie for 14 days in 3 days. I'm a history teacher who has too much time on my hands. I need life. I found a film with a striking resemblance to break the mountains. I also found that I looked a lot like Jean Lafitte if he was white. also my favorite line in the whole movie was by Mr. Petey - "this child can capture the chipmunk's eye of 300 yards!" oh, and my favorite scene in the movie was when the British came and one drummer who was so dedicated to his work and drumming until death as if the drum had ended the war completely ... but that would not be. Well, that's all I want to say about this movie. Oh, one more thing ... brown brown is a crazy physical bipolar mood that swings with BEEYOTCH. that is all.
