I have seen this jewel of the film in Cannes, where he has been part of the fourteen-day director. Welcome to Collinwood is not surprising. Great entertainment all over the world with all the members of a strong cast where they play their socks. It's sometimes laughing about a loud comedy about a little cheater (Cosimo, starring Luis Guzman), who is about to steal a car and send him to jail. While in jail he meets a "lifer" who tells him about the "ultimate bellini"? what for you and me? there is a certain fire-rich quick scheme. Does it turn out from a deserted building to a city jewelery store? which could be net millions. Sounds like that? ??? well throw all kinds of hideous characters and incidents along the way and you have ingredients for one wild ride! ??? the word moves from one of the low lives to the next, and soon their team gathers to try to spend money on Cosimosa 'bellini' with an unsuccessful boxer Perou (famously played by Sam Rockwell - surely a star in production) and reluctant cheater Riley (William H. Macy ) who is forced to bring his child with him because his wife was locked up for scams! <br /> <br /> Based on the Italian film I Soliti ignoti (Big deal on Madonna Street), which also inspired a similar movie to "Collinwood"? `Palookaville '. This knocks on the places of the last effort and although it is written and directed by the Russo brothers, it definitely has Coen Brothers shades about it. Produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, who has a small but cheerful role as a crippled security switch.
