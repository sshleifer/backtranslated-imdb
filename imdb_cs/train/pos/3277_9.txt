This movie is fantastic because it examines the story and fantasy in the way the child will be, for adults. The idea of ​​children's drawings becomes a place where they can physically visit and influence them. At the same time, you could learn all the child psychologists and say that he really is exploring his subconscious, just as we all in our dreams when we sleep. The piece that gives me brown puddles is when Dad is in a paper house and chases her. The only thing I can not do is sell it as a horror movie ... it really is not. If you want to see something that the British have a lot of stories that guess you without the usual cheap excitement that most movies have to use, then look at Paperhouse.
