A special, yet emotionally disturbing chiller about a spooky middle-aged man (William H. Macy) who eventually decides to leave a family business (murder for rent) operated by his silently demanding father (Donald Sutherland) and flirting with another patient Neve Campbell). <br /> <br /> Talk about a big dilemma, but "Panic" is a top thriller that looks like "American Beauty" meets "Professional". Macy and Sutherland are here. The remarkable debut of the first author / director Henry Bromel. I am surprised that this film did not have the chance to stay in cinemas for more than a few weeks.
