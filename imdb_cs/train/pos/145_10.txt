The continuation of the "Kingdom" is bloody and even more twisted. I saw only half (I was exhausted and could not sit in all 5 1/2 hours), but I loved what I saw. Spirits, blood, murder, poisoning, mutant babies, voodoo ... it all has it! If you have a strong stomach and strange movies, that's for you. <br /> <br /> You also do not have to see part 1 to understand ... you will lose it! <Br /> <br /> Does anyone know if kingdoms 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Sitting in these marathon movies in the theater is tiring. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, probably not "Kingdom 3" - Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after being shot. But you never know!
