Late one night on a deserted road, Martin Sheen filmed the yarn for Robert Carradin of Hopalong Cassidy and friends who watched a group of murderous cattle shooters who killed several men and kidnapped Cassidy's girl. <br /> <br /> Writer / Director Christopher Coppola They could suffer the wrath of Purists William Boyd by dare to make a modern low-budget movie with their beloved Hoppy, but I'm glad he did it! No character should be so tied to an actor who no one else ever leaves to play with him again! I thought it was a good fun and interesting update for classical programmers from the 1930s and 1940s. Though he is guilty of some bad acting, it's pretty serious and unpretentious, so it's hard I do not like it. All the production is a little odd, but really enjoyed the scenes between Sheen and Carridine. The fact that we are watching the story in the story causes surprises and exaggerations to be more appealing.
