It's one of the quietest, relaxing and beautifully animated movies I've ever seen. With beautiful music throughout the movie, sounds and music can make you feel like you're in the movie! This movie is not great not only for children but also for adults. They teach you lessons, like never forgetting who you are, doing anything you can keep your mind on, and courageous and courageous. This movie can make you cry even in times, which is always a nice touch in movies. This movie is fun, sad, cute and keeps you on the edge of your seat! Some movies really give you a fuzzy feeling after seeing them, and the movie "Spirit" is definitely one of them! With my 9/10 star vote for animation, music and great movie idea, it gave me a lot of spirit!
