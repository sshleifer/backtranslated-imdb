In October 1945, American German descendant Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) arrives in post-war Frankfurt, and his bitter uncle Kessler (Ernst-Hugo Järegård) gets a job on the Zentropa train line as a conductor of a sleeping car. On the way on the train he learns his profession, sees the ruined occupied Germany and meets Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the daughter of a former strong businessman in the transport sector and Zentropa owner Max Hartmann (Jørgen Reenberg). Leopold remains neutral between Allied forces and the Germans and realizes that there is a terrorist group called "werewolves" that kills Allied sympathizers and lead subversive acts against allied forces. He falls in love with Katharina, and he first learns to be a "werewolf." When Max commits suicide, Leopold is also pushing "werewolves" and has to stand up and decide. "Europa" is the impressive and disturbing story of the Kafkanians about the great Danish director Lars von Trier. Using Fritz Lang's expressionist style, alternating with beautiful black-and-white cinematography with colorful details, this film finds Germany's difficult period and some of the problems that this great nation had to face after being defeated in the war. It was very impressive that the occupying forces destroyed the resources that would allow a faster reconstruction of the destroyed country and corruption with a Jew who should identify Max. Jean-Marc Barr has a wonderful performance in the role of a man who wants to stay neutral but everywhere is manipulated by everyone. Max Von Sydow's hypnotic narrative is another touch of class in this award-winning film. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Europa"
