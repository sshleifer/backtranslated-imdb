After the usual pursuit, Jerry accidentally unfolded inside the bottle of invisible ink that was part of the chemical set. He quickly finds it invisible ... so predictable results appear, which means he uses his new hidden state to torture Tom. Jerry often protects but often has a sadistic strip that cats him whenever possible, even if he is unprovoked. Tom Tom thinks his eyes are fooling him when the mouse trap cheese disappears in front of his eyes or the milk from the bowl. Tom can not take it to try to sleep this nightmare, but Jerry will light his paw! Man, I hope little children had no idea to follow these cartoons in the 1940s and 1950s! I've always found Jerry, a little mouse, more evil than cute. Fortunately, in cartoons, in general, no matter what damage a character suffers, he is gone within a few seconds and he is back to normal. <br /> <br /> The best part of this cartoon is about two-thirds of the way when Tom finds out what's a story with Jerry, and he's trying different methods to detect where the mouse is (eg storing flour on the floor to see his tracks) .
