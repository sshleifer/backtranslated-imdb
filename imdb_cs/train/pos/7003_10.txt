The emotional impact of this film is reversing words. It is elegant, delicate, beautiful and tragic, which developed within two hours. This is Will Smith, when she was born into her acting skills, her whole line. Who knows? I've seen Pursuit of Happiness, and I thought it must be a coincidence for the revolutionary actor, Smith. His performances in both films make Smith a totally different dimension, talent specification, scenario selectivity, I'm not sure, but now I see him differently. Seven pounds is one of those movies you want to fully enjoy your essence, you have to suspend your faith. Do not look at the conspiracy, observe it because of the fragile state of the human heart, literally and metaphorically. It is a story of human guilt, reconciliation, love and sacrifice.
