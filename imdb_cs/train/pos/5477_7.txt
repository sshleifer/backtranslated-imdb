The original uncensored copy of this amazing film was discovered in the congressional library in 2004 and showed up in several specialized theaters around the world in 2005. According to the current reviews I found online, the original has all the worst dialogue and innuendo intact; they were later either removed or completely re-filmed by a study before the first release to pass the New York state censors. I also read that the DVD is "expected in 2006" and one can only hope! Fortunately, this will include a comparison between the two versions. Note that the released censored version was originally available on the Laserdisc I've seen. Stanwyck rules!
