I thought this movie was a lot better than most film critics did. Though it has its confusing parts of the conspiracy, it is not much to interfere with your understanding of the film. That is to say: If you are not open to more liberal political thoughts, then that is probably not the film for you. I thought all the actors in the movie were excellent. Each character has its funny moments, and the audience at the Tribeca film festival has made all the difference. I thought the satire was in one particular area overhead, but it's deliberately done. John Cusack is right that although it is set in the future, he really sees you presence.
