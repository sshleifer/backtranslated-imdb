Reese Witherspoon's first trip on the big screen was memorable. It seems to be a fresh, clean face of "tween", which is tiny and boring, but undoubtedly Reese. I always liked her as an actor, and she had no idea she'd started her young career. Actually, I got some respect for Reese to know who was so early. I say that because whenever I watched her how it worked, characters so far, in every imagination it seemed to have her own personality who lived with this figure quite nicely in reality. Reese's film experience was a parody of Little Red Riding Hood Reese did with Kiefer Sutherland. Somehow I supposed it was the "first time" for the first time.
