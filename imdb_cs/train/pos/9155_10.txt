Whoever came up with the story is one sick person. I rented it for sleep in my sleep and all six of us were afraid because we all are together in the acting class and we know a few actors from the class. Besides, they all scream the whole weird night, I have horrible nightmares. I still thought God, if I went back to the bathroom so I could be stabbed in the middle of wiping or something. I could not even go to the bathroom because we watched this terrible horror movie. I also thought why all the girls in this movie are naked, but do we have no boy units? You should make a horror film where the killer is a girl and cut off the units. I'd look at it again and again. Call him hard or soft or something stupid. I give this movie only 9 because you avoided me.
