Overall, I would have to say that I liked the movie. Some combat scenes are really good. Especially the fight against Leung Ka-Yan. One point that really bothered me was the fact that they used the Asians to play a black man. I mean, really. Talk about bad taste. During the battle scene you can see that one of the warriors on the floor laughed. Otherwise, Sammo copies the fight with Bruce Lee perfectly. 5 of 10 stars.
