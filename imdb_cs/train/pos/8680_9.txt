Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is a very lost player on the short cartoon market. This market is basically dominated by Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies shorts, coming from Warner Bros. But MGM is also able to release hidden gems such as "To Spring," an amazing story about the most beautiful period of the year. /> <br /> In the environment described, the spring is not caused by natural cycles, but is produced. And who? Small elves living underground. Every spring, when it starts to snow, they start working. They begin by felling rainbow rock columns and then clotting into debris and using these rubble to change to color fluids that move up to the ground and carry grass, flowers ... In other words, spring! The first half of the cartoon describes the production of the spring, but the second part is a bit different. Old Man Winter returns and tries to prolong the winter by destroying the work of elves. So from this moment we are helping to battle between the elves and the Old Winter Winter. <br /> <br /> The music you hear here is beautiful. The melodic parts are held in the head as an ink spot on a paper sheet. The second part of the melodies is exciting and perfectly suited to action. It's just fantastic, Giorgio! Animation sequences are also a pleasure. The colors are well blended and every little detail is displayed in a massive, epic environment. The concept itself is great. Elves attract characters, and so is the old man winter, which effectively depicts the cold and ruthless feelings of the white season. <br /> <br /> There is also a strong message here. The fight seems to be lost to the elves at the end until one later comes the elf jump into action and it leads to victory of elves in the winter. So it is: the only person can make a difference. <br /> <br /> Finally, "To Spring" is a remarkable lost classic of short cartoon. Even more remarkable is that the director of this cartoon series debuted here. And who is the director of "In the spring"? It's sure William Hanna ...
