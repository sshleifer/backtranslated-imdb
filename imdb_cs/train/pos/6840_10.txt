the fact that the movie is predictable is not a problem. this movie is like a beautiful picture that looks forward to. the museum scene is like a nice music video. apres sex scene is a well-known scene in all our adult lives. but the film would have no interest in me without Keith Gordon. keith gordon is perhaps one of the most underestimated actors of our time. almost everything I know about acting came from studying mostly his eyes. he had the most attractive face. his character has features that look at man, sensitivity and devotion. keith gordon is gorgeous. BTW, I'd like you to shave your beard now because his lips, jawline and Adam's apples were his prettiest set beside his eyes.
