I'm sure many people outside Australia have never heard of the legend of Ned Kelly. I once saw a documentary about a man, but that's the only time I've ever seen or heard of him. And I think this may be the biggest problem that this film has to face. Nobody knows anything about it and probably will not be a lot of people on this topic. The film tells the story of Ned Kelly's life. The Irish immigrant has lived in the northwest Victoria for life, but the authorities have never been too welcome. Police always blame him for everything he thinks, and are constantly harassing his family. When Kelly is full of what's going on, she creates with her brother and two men a gang. They start robbing banks and even kidnap the city for 3 days. All this violence leads to hunting people organized by the police, and when they kill three cops they are forbidden. Finally, they will take the Glenrowan pub where they have a party with all the visitors and wait for a train full of police to derail a part of the route they have ripped off. But the train is able to stop in time because someone warns them and what will follow is the battle of life and death between the police and the four gunmen ... It is very hard to tell if everything in the movie is true or false. I think no one really knows, because there will always be two camps to tell everyone their truth: one camp says he's a hero, some Robin Hood, the others say he's a common criminal, murderer, and thief. I really could not tell you which one is right, maybe both of them, but what I can tell you is that the facts in the movie as well as the documentary are the same. <br /> <br /> The movie was a nice addition to the document I once saw, and I really enjoyed the performance of all the actors. Heath Ledger, Orlando Bloom, Naomi Watts, Geoffrey Rush are all actors who are well known, but less well-known actors in this show show that everyone knows how it should look good. I really enjoyed this film and gave him 7.5 / 10
