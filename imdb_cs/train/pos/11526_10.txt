I was following this movie from the obstacles to the whims .. I like alan arkin and the cover captured ... I read my back and I immediately knew it would be either the best or the worst movie I've ever seen ... I think I'm he was lucky .. I laughed from beginning to end .. alan arkin brings the great character of this movie. Since then I bought a used copy for my own collection and watched it all the time .. I have this film to recommend a lot of people and everyone enjoyed it the same way I ... I see complaints about menu and dvd functions .. but it does not remove from movie .. disc was created for Blockbuster exculsivley, which is why they did not allow you to jump over the previews. besides, you should not let DVDs stop you from watching a great movie.
