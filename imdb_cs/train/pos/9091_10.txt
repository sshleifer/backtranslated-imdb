Wonderful movie. In everything you might want in the movie. Huge battle scenes and lots of other events. Conclusion and romantic love story. <br /> <br /> It's like an old swashbuckler movie. Completely fun from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Editing was fast and you never get bored for a second. The story is like the classic story of the troubles in the royal household. The actors are beautiful and the sets are magnificent. Costumes are spectacular and stunt work is imaginative. The special effects are also amazing. <br /> <br /> Gary Stretch is really impressive as an actor and a gorgeous look. Looks like a certain bet for Super Stardom. <br /> <br /> John Rhys-Davies is wonderful as it usually is. He is one of the best actors of our time. And Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is excellent and perfect for the front lady, even the English accent with remarkable success. <br /> <br /> I have found that the film has won a number of awards and I see why. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is an amazing independent film. You will see it for sure. <br /> <br /> I recommend this. And give her TEN +!
