I think it's a great movie. because you see how Diana lives at home. she got so much aggression and she wants to prove that girls can also fight. I think she and Adrian are great actors. Because of this movie, I have a box. It really did me. the only negative part I think. It's end. because it is fine between Diana and Adrian. But you do not see how it is at home. And I really did not like you, you do not even see how her father and her brother are doing. but I think it was a great movie and I think I'm going to look at it much more :) I recommend it to everyone, even if you do not like the box, you can see more than just the box. I had a great time tracking it.
