I like this movie but can not get what's in this movie tht does not like. People who do not like this movie must be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can not believe Mr. Carrey is all the makeup. And I'm sure most of the actors and actresses in the movie have made a movie before. And there's a new face in the movie. Taylor Momsen, who plays Cindy Lou Who. As he opens, Grinch (Jim Carrey) comes out of hiding. And it makes some fun for Whoville. Sicne we know that who loves Christmas. While The Grinch does not like Christmas. And even fun little Cindy Lou who (Taylor Momsen), daughter of the postmaster of the city (Bill Irwin). The film was directed by Ron Howard. And Anthony Hopkins's voice story is done. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets From Space) is cast as mayor of whoville. Who does not like to talk about Grinch near Christmas time.
