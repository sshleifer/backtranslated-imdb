This is a slowly moving story. No action. No crazy tension. No sudden surprise. If you can not see a movie about two people just talking and walking, about a story that is slowly developing to the very end and about romantic love, do not waste your time and money. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you are in a dialogue, master story telling, thought provoking thoughts and finding true love in life, then it's your movie. I recommend that you watch this movie when you are most alert, because the pace, music and overall tone of the film can give you waves of mood. It's really fantastic. I really do. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are occasionally harassing their manners, but fortunately, chemistry between the two causes the acting to be very natural, warm and gentle. They act and feel each other from the very beginning, so you feel like an intruder. <br /> <br /> In your interviews, there are excellent comments on many topics that trigger thinking and conversation between you and your partner. I thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young figures, but I can underestimate their intelligence. Still it did not destroy the film. The whole story is very simple, which in my opinion gives the film charm and eventually it's too much. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: The movie's progress is slowing down. The dialogue is fascinating. The story comes out gently, systematically and in substance. Building up to the final is satisfying and eventually rewarding.
