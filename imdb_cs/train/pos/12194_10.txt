Surreal film noir was released shortly after the "real" genre classic "Maltese Falcon", "Double Compensation" and "The Postman Always Circles Twice". Welles movies should not be evaluated against others. He played under different rules. In fact, he played. It begins where other femme fatale movies leave, so the vaguely logical (but interesting) whodunit is adorned with the Wellesian scenes (typical fast fire), dialogue (lots of "hard" philosophy) and unusual gambling (good Hayworth probably deliberately one-dimensional). Welles "genre" could mean a "formula", but he seemed to use "mysteries" as a background for his "fun".
