"Sasquatch Hunters" was not really as bad as I thought. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (Rick Holland) and his sister Janet (Stacey Branscombe) are accompanying Dr. Helen Gilbert (Amy Shelton-White) Gary Sturm and Julius Devera's assistant to find some bone in the area. When they make a camp, the team finds a giant burial ground and other strange bones that kill in the area. When group members begin to disappear, they begin to walk through the forest to safety. It was found that Sasquatch was murdered and the group joined together to survive. Good news: It was not as bad as I thought it would be. The film actually begins to pick a little steam around the hemisphere when the creature invents. This is a master series of scenes because the whole group is exposed to the attacks of the creature and the tension in the game is extremely high. The wooded area is most favored in these parts, which increases tension and reflects when the person who roams in the woods gets their benefit. Also spreading quite liberally through the film is the effective use of out-screen groans and roars that are really ruthless. They really add a lot to making this part so creepy, as well as when it comes to cries. It is quite effective and works well. It is quite nice that the later part of the film will pick up the pace, because it goes quite well on the high note action. One scene that I feel specially has to be the scene of the first scene. When a person walks through the forest of creation, he discovers an expedition that seeks for it. He raised his hands to the holler to him for help, the other he was going to announce his presence was attacked from nothing and killed quite hurriedly. That surprised me, and actually jumped a little at first glance. Bad news: There were only a few things you can complain about and one is the usual complaint. Creation here is mostly a terrible CGI that made it look ridiculous and destroy any credibility it might have. The threat air triggered by the opening of the movie is almost blown out of the window when the creature appears on the screen. It is so scary that it is a shame that no work has been put into it. I have complained a lot about it and it is something that really should get rid of it, because it does not look realistic and it is quite fake. Another big thing is killing off the screen. Very often in the movie, a man grabbed and then pulled away, and then found a bloody body afterwards. It is quite difficult when kills look nice and juicy afterwards. Otherwise, in fact, I do not really have a big problem with this problem, because everything I usually criticize about this topic did not really bother me, but it is also called for others on this subject. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: I liked it a bit, but it still is not the best Sasquatch movie at all. It should not be taken seriously, and if it looks at it, it's really nice. Fans of these movies should look at this, and those who love the features of Sci-Fi Creature could also find nice things here. Rating R: Graphic language, violence and some graphical skeletons
