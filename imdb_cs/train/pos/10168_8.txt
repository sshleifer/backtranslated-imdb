See that it's Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd in a movie about a dead girlfriend pursuing a new girlfriend. She is Gabrielle of Desperate Housewives and a guy who wore "Panther Cologne Sex" in Anchorman. If you expect the Golden Globe nomination, then you have to re-examine how you watch the movies. However, if you are willing to stop reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a fun movie, then you are in the right place. The characters are funny. They work very well. The real game is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. It's as fun as it was Friends, she was funny and good looking at the same time. I went with my wife, I liked it and me.
