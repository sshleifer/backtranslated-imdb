In this wonderful film, I enjoyed China's cinematic recreation in the 1930s. The story is simple. An older male artist wants to pass his art to a young man, even though he has no living children. The faces of the actors are amazing to see. The story reveals the allegiance and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their desire to be well treated. The operas in the movie remind me of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, which was more sophisticated and complicated. The story reminds me of Dickens' story of the days when the children were almost hungry. This conspiracy is a little predictable and a little too sentimental to me, but it's worth looking at heroism, humanity, and history.
