I have not seen such a beautiful animation long. With respect to Pixar, I have to say that Ratatouille or any other film that created them can not be compared with him. Animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here. The graphics are stunning, backgrounds are blown, almost every object in each frame is perfectly rendered. Sometimes I felt the tingles on my spine - so much I loved what I saw. The plot is totally romantic. Equally romantic as an animated film can also be. The characters are nice, especially Hector, a blue rabbit who owns, pawns, rocks and rules! The other characters are also very nice. Humor is top-notch. <br /> <br /> Generally, it seemed that the creators did not make much effort into doing so. I think it looked as if it were not too big differences from the Pixar & Dreamworks people who are always trying to think about something new. And I am very glad that the product of the European animation studio has turned out to be so great. They made a beautiful, moving film, candy for the eyes and the heart. The only minus is the stupid beginning and that's why 9of10 is not 10/10
