I caught it last night on a bowl. I liked the movie. I traveled to Russia 3 different times (adoption of our two children). I can not give my finger exactly why I liked this film except I saw the "bad" turn "good" and "good" again "half". I liked the look that Ben Chaplin lived through the film. Just like "I can not think it's happening to me", whether it's good or bad, it's the same look (and it works). Great end. 7/10. Rent it or catch it on a bowl like me.
