I have never heard of this movie until I saw DVD rental as a bit skeptical, there were many films in the past with good cast files that can not do anything wrong movie scenario and in some cases do not seem to care. <br /> <br /> Although he has just watched that there is no reason to keep this movie a theatrical release, it's good. A story like most of this genre may seem a bit of a while at a time, but there seems to be a good amount of realism that allows that impulse to get. I was pleasantly surprised at the great work of Justin Timberlake with such a great role, OK that he is not an Oscar material yet, but he learns every role and shows a lot of promises for the future. Dylan McDermott was also incredibly good in his unexpectedly unpleasant role and is definitely the cream of this movie. Finally, just do it. you will not be disappointed, you will not get bored, in fact, I think you will be happy with the end result.
