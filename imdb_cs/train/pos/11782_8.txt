I do not know if it contains spoilers or not, but I do not want to risk being on the black list until 3462. I do not agree with commentators who describe * Guns, Steel * as "politically correct" and "neo-Marxist". They could not watch the same series I did * * * did. The * I * series has depicted the history of European colonization in America and South Africa without specific inaccuracies. I did not see anything in the series that portrayed Europeans as bad people who were lucky, though Europeans were often * happy * and nothing good with luck. I have not even seen native peoples portrayed as bad innocent things. If there is such a thing, Inca was rather arrogant - how would you expect it to be a leader if it were an alien if his country was not subdued in some vivid memory by some other world power. <br /> <br /> I certainly did not see anything that could be considered a Marxist or a neo-Marxist, except for the most incredibly flexible ideas. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, many African people have built-in immunity to malaria and other tropical diseases that Europeans lack. At a time when they were at the peak of their success, the civilization of the Aztecs, the Mayans and the Incas * was as advanced as all the rest of the world - and as rich; sometimes more. Native Americans and Khoi-San * were * destroyed by smallpox and other diseases presented by Europeans; as well as European colonists, were destroyed by tropical diseases such as malaria. (NOTE: People Khoi-San are completely different from all other subsaharan Africans.) So I do not see what some commentators are complaining about. The only thing I can find to complain is that the series does not tell me anything I did not know when I finished the seventh grade. In fact nothing new in historical information in this movie is nothing new. However, it presents some nice dramatizations of events such as the conquest of the Incas; production values ​​are very high; and meets several questions that have not been included here and there in the sixth hour of six hours of Mrs. Gruber's social care at Milan's high school. If you rent or buy it, provided you have a decent primary and / or high school education, you will not learn anything new, but you will have fun and fun time when you want what you have already learned (or learned) in when you did high school.
