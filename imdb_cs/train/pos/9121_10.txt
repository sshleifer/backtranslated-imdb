THE APPLIANCES CONTAINED TO COMPLETE. In twenty years since 1984, this film is about the future of Prince in the music industry. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that sums up Prince's music production for the past ten years perfectly, which is, if you chose the two best tracks from your last 10 albums, you should have one fantastic album! <br /> <br /> The scene plays like this. Prince ran into the cloakroom after playing one song, and the club owner walked into the dressing room to make the headline for his fall of grace in the 90s and putting the album that only the hardcore fans would be able to tolerate and promote his art. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Spooky huh! And what a musical underscore that makes the Prince even more evil when it strikes Apollo on the ground in two separate scenes! It made me feverish that it was not the only scene of the women who got tortured in this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm a comedic sparring between Morris Day and Jerome Benton, because these two have stolen every scene they were in. But what was funny when you threw a woman into a wastebasket? It was simply ugly! The second unpleasant piece was the outline of Prince's father's chalk on the floor, thoughtfully provided by a Minnieapolis cop, causing the Prince to go even further! FANTASTIC! <br /> <br /> Purple Rain is a funny movie overall because it is a soundtrack of Prince songs that increases its value by 110%. But the film again gives us another theory of the prince and his music because the film tells us that the greatest song of the prince of the film was written by Wendy, Lisa and Princess Wife to beat the musical father! and the creators are trying to tell us that the prince stole all his best songs from his father after finding his father's musical sheets of written songs? Maybe that's why Prince began to get exhausted in the 90's because he's exhausted his father's thoughts ??? ........... Hmmmm .....
