If you have a drama in life, whether it is yours or someone close to you, the degree of pain that this woman (but in my view, that perhaps it could be a person) is going through, they are very real. It's a film about failing to cope with your pain, not knowing what to do to help yourself through it. Obviously, it is also a film that they do not know how to help someone close to get over their pain. It's a movie that realizes that everyone is alone in their misery. This is a movie that could push someone over the edge ... which hardly sounds like a recommendation. I'm not sure I'd recommend anyone seeing this movie, especially someone close to me, but for me ... it's a movie that brings things to perspective, it shows real pain and it's very important to be alive. Realizes that hey, you or a person close to you have been experiencing pain, hey, all the things you are afraid of now are of little importance
