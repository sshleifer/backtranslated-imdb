When it was originally broadcast in 1984, my wife and I recorded on our first VHS recorder. I still have this aging tape that I try to watch every year. It was the year my first child was born, and when I see Christmas carols in this incarnation bring beautiful memories of happy times - many hours spent with this movie are playing in the background. Finally, I broke up this year and ordered a DVD, which made me write this short reaction to the film for a while. The story of Charles Dickens is greatly captured here. George C. Scott is absolutely amazing and utterly believable as Scrooge. Support for the cast is just as spectacular. This is, in my view, a flawless production. Small details add fun. The game "reminds" Scrooge's nephew and the wife who plays with his guests is a clean thing. (Since then I have re-created it with my college students from English as a short afternoon from school work!) I honestly think that I do not have just a few ways to have fun during the holidays that I like more than to look forward to this CBS, originally sponsored by IBM. (By the way, it's fun to watch an old tape with original IBM ads ... which show how many computers developed in 21 years.) Wonderful how things changed!) Bottom line: The Christmas card is a timeless story, and this is a timeless classic. Enjoy ... and God bless us, everyone!
