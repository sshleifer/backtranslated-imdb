Okay, let's get it right. I'm really not science fiction, but for some reason I like Stargate SG-1. <br /> <br /> Jack O'Neil takes his SG-1 team through Stargate. A circular device that creates a wormhole. It gives you the opportunity to travel to distant worlds. It may sound like your usual science fiction series, but it is not! Give them today is not set in some remote millennium, like many other sci-fi series. That's great. It gives you things, events and things you can do, and you can jump to a series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all gadgets. Of course, they are certain, but thanks to O'Neil, who likes simple terminology, there is not much. <br /> <br /> The series has a nice mix of events, humor and drama. If you like a lot of special effects, you will not find it here. They do not use many bad but limited amounts of well-done special effects.
