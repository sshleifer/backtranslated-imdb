Another masterpiece of Woo! <br /> <br /> This is the best movie I've ever seen! Woo - RULEZ forever (except for some moments in Hollywood ...). John Woo - Major Director of the Century. Maybe I'm not more intellectual than a lot of great directors ... But it's a lyrical and spiritual idol of all people who have a free mind! <br /> <br /> His films like great poetry! Woo is a movie fire! Woo is the movie Biron! Woo is Mozart from Bloodsheth !!!! IMHO violent in Woo films is not the director of bloodlust, but a tool of art. The themes of Woo films are more humanistic, that more new movies.
