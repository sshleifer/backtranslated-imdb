Originally I rented this film for my daughter because I'm interested in football - and so I was not disappointed (except that the plot was hit by soccer scenes). As a dad, I suppose I was a bit surprised by the introduction of lesbianism - but I have to admit that these questions are now as children's full availability for kids (as unpleasant as I feel about the subject). In this way, this emotion was perceived directly into the main premise of the film - that at a certain age you must trust your children to make their own choices. This dilemma is a young British teenage girl - Jasminder (Jess) - an East Indian heritage that dreams of professional football. The resolved marriage of her older sisters in a traditional Hindu marriage provides many rich opportunities to explore (in a nice way) her hopes and concerns about her future. <br /> <br /> The multicultural challenge was a very exciting technique to explore Jess's frustration with the expectation of her parents - again, in reality, they do not differ from most relationships between the child and the parent. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY, football scenes are great (a lot to learn in slowmo) and while I did not need a story - something was needed for the movie to go.
