This is not another alert view of the Holocaust, but rather an intimate story about the events that took place in a small street in Berlin and some of those who participated. This movie begins in New York, where Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) mourns her husband's death and all the family members gathered to her. Ruth's daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader) slowly learns that her mother was raised Aryan woman named Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), and then travel to Germany and finds a 90-year, who tells her about the events on Rosenstrasse. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Lena talking about Berlin in 1943, when the Gestapo kept all Jewish spouses in a building on Rosenstrasse street, too when he is supposed to have the immunity for marrying the Aryans, and after nine days a group of women will wait outside and scream for their release. Eight-year-old Ruth (Svea Lohde) expects her mother to come out and have no place to go but meets with 33-year-old Lena (Katja Riemann) who will marry her. Lena's husband Fabian (Martin Feifel) is also inside and eventually tries to socialize with Nazi officers to do something. The film is directed by Margarethe von Trotta, who makes her feature debut nearly 10 years after he worked in television, and while this is clearly not one of her provocative efforts remains one of the most respected directors in Europe. It's not one of those Nazi movies, in which we look at the horrific acts of cruelty against Jews, even though we see that gives any serious treatment, but instead it is rather telling small events that marked the life and death of interested parties. This film is not trying to shock anyone to even open the door to discussions about the circumstances, but what he just wants to do is just to shed light on the small but real life event that occurred during the historical period. Part of the power of the film comes from the actors and there are some good performances that are especially famous for Riemann and young Lohde and it is always good to see Schrader (Aimee & Jaguar) in a key role. It's not a great movie, or something that changes your view of World War II, but due to the fact that innocent lives were killed because of the events that happened, I think the reason is in itself important enough to tell the true story .
