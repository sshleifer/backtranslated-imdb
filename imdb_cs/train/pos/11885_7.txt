This film for French television deals with the tragic effect it has for a close knit family. When Leo, a young man at the heart of the story, is diagnosed as an AIDS virus, he tells his parents, they just can not believe it. The film is a characteristic study of how this family addresses its theme. Director Christophe Honore must be congratulated for bringing this honest account to the screen. Nowhere, but in France this story would get into the movies because of the subject. Reports have a devastating effect on Marcel, a young brother who hears about what Leo has done, despite the way parents want to protect themselves from reality. Yaniss Lespart and Pierre Mignard are doing compelling work on displaying brothers.
