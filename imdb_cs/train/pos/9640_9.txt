Most Hollywood films do not capture the full range of young people's experiences. This movie shows exactly how to do it right. It combines elements of humor, suffering, insurrection, etc. In a way that is complex and sympathetic. The end could be a bit brighter, but the fact that the director does not tell you everything before you means that this movie assumes a smarter viewer.
