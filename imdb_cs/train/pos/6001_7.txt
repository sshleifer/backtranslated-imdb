In no case is a masterpiece and far from the best Errol Flynn, Istanbul still has a lot to do. Location and beautiful technicolor cinema brings us back to the past. Errol Flynn shows the moments of his past glory and is fine when Jim Brennan, the pilot who is past, returns to persecute him. The picture is in fact a remake of "Singapore" in 1947, and the story seems to be terribly conceived and clich√©s according to today's standards. Also, many of the supported casts seem to just "walk through the moves" in this picture. Many people also compared it to one of the greatest times, CASABLANCA. While watching the movie I have seen many similarities, but hey, Casablanca has inspired countless imitators, so do it for what's worth. Finally, if you are a fan of Flynn, or old-fashioned love stories, you might want to watch this movie. Otherwise, I would recommend Casablanca or the Maltese falcon as a good introduction to some Hollywood classics ....
