"House of the House" is a flawlessly built film, and one of the few films I've seen revealed to me on the screen with amazement at how clever and unexpected it ends. I first saw them on the video for several years after reading the review of Roger Ebert, who claimed the best 1987 film. I had my doubts, mainly because it is not as well known as other films of that year. Boy, I was for surprise. It's one of the smartest and best-written films I've ever seen. The script is quite a bit of a job, not only in terms of conspiracy (which turns and rotates and pulls the carpet from you just when you think you've made it all up) but also in terms of character development. In my second perspective, I realized that Mamet's script succeeded not only as a smart film with tension, but that each development of the plot contributed to the understanding of the characters and their motives. The climax of the film is particularly effective because it is absolutely inevitable. Of course, it comes out of what we know about the characters, and is therefore much more than just any intervention. The performance of Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegno are also greatly added to the film. I can not imagine another actor, except Mantegna, who would play Mike, and Crouse plays only a good amount of restraint to indicate the suppressed criminal stance. Their work and Mamet's extraordinary screenplay make up one of the greatest movies of the eighties. It is really necessary.
