It was a great Italian film "ZOMBIE" by two great directors Luci Fulci ("ZOMBIE") and Bruno Mattie ("HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD"). Lucio started this movie and he was sick, so the great Bruno took over and it turned out surprisingly better than I expected it would turn out so if you saw "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD" directed by Bruno Mattie and if you saw "ZOMBIE" directed Lucio Fulci and he liked both or one of the themes, then it's a movie, make sure he has a great make-up witch "ZOMBIE" which equals the great-looking "ZOMBIEM" has a funny "ZOMBIE" flying head! And the birds "ZOMBIE" spit on you acid and turn you into "ZOMBIE" People), but they are mostly just great toxic "ZOMBIES" as in Bruno Matties "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD". So if you like Italian movies "ZOMBIE" or just movies "ZOMBIE" Italian film "ZOMBIE"!
