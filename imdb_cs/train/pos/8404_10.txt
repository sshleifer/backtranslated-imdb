A simple but appealing film about being a simple yet good-looking high school graduate who has dreams of having his own "favorite van" in the world to become a "dance hall". <br /> <br /> Bobby, our hero, spends all the savings to get the vehicle of his dreams. Sharing and loving to make a quick start with girls Bobby gathered in a local pizzeria but finds out that great responsibility, dangers and pain come with being the owner of such a mechanical miracle. <br /> <br /> Van is my guilty pleasure. It captures the mood in the mid-1970s and has enough unintentional humor to get into the "so bad it's good" category.
