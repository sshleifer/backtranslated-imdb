I have seen this movie recently in Winnipeg - appropriate, given the location used. For the first time in the 1970s, I read a book about the Lawrence Book, and it has always been a very powerful picture of aging attempts in our society. When I was young, it rang and resonates even more. When the movie came out, I was glad if I could survive the story. and was thoroughly impressed, especially with Ellen Burstyn's performance. We can give a complete human being, although the character is generally clever and decisive - someone you do not want to live with. It's great to be able to see that your favorite characters come to life so authentic.
