Previously I wrote that I loved "Titanic", wept at the end (many times) and I was in his 60s. I also wondered why this great movie, which received so much awards and was applauded by so many critics, only got imdb.com users only 7.0. <br /> <br /> Well, I looked at the distribution of user ratings. While 29.0% of all votes gave it 10 ratings, 10.7% gave 1 ratings. These 10.7% of these irrational users imdb actually exhausted the overall rating to 7.0. <br /> <br /> In my previous comments, I blamed this very unusual pattern of voting (a sudden increase of 1 rating, with a high score of 10, falling only gradually and then suddenly reversing the course and jumping at level 1) to one thing: hatred Leonard DiCapri. Believe me, I've tuned in enough chat rooms to see young people (mostly young men) seeing how they are doing it, and who shame it on the left and right. He absolutely hates that man, and they will have no role in getting him any credit in Titanic. (Reply to one other user: We DO NOT TALK someone who really does not like the movie and gave him 5 or 6 etc. Everyone has and is entitled to his own taste But no one can convince me that the imdb rating for Titanic, Titanic shot at only 7.0, it is a fair reflection of the overall movie. <br /> <br /> Let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern "Titanic" with five randomly chosen cashiers and critical "bombs" ( there are many others, but these 5 show up). "The Heaven's Gate" (1980) was quickly pulled out of theaters after a very bad boxing show and the IMDB voters' ratings were: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 rating (overall rating 6.1). "Big Top Pee-wee" (1988) earned 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 rating (overall rating 4.5). "Cat People" (1982) earned 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 ratings (overall rating 5.8). "Blind Date" (1987) earned 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings (Overall 5.3). "Jumpin 'Jack Flash" (1986) received 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 rating (overall rating 5.2). WHAT WERE ALL THIS FILMS TITANIC? ALL PERCENTAGES OF ITS 1 RATING ARE SMALL !!!! Until "TITANIC", and none of these candidates was ever awarded as the only one. Again "Titanic" received 10.7% 1 review! Compare this with the other 5 films I just mentioned. Can there be any explanation other than hatred for the Leo factor? <br /> <br />
