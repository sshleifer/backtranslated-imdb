The League of Lords is one of the most entertaining, unforgiving, darkest and most unforgettable comedies of our time. And so it gave way to other comedies of his film, many of which copied style, but we never did. Unlike all the other sketches that appear around, Gentleman's figures are loosely linked. First, everyone lives in the fictitious town of Royston Vasey, in the back of northern England. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The first characters that welcome newcomers are Tubbs and Edwrad, the homeowners who are supposedly located in a remote location, most people probably do not know about their existence. Other specialties include: the Denton family, obsessed with hygiene, cleanliness and toads; Hillary Briss, who sells a special but fortunately unknown brand of meat; Pauline, a restart officer with a sharp tongue and sharper lips; Mr. Chinnery, a kind veterinarian and the threat of all four-legged things; Geoff Tipps, a plastics businessman with prominent humor, often with pistols, electric tubes and. . . . . . PLUMS !!!!! <br /> <br /> Despite being a comedy at heart, the League of Lords often goes beyond the genres without seeming to be spoofing or tearing away from other people's material. There are a few horrible links, such as the disappearance of tourists, a couple of quiet twins, a obsessed circus owner, and a sudden outbreak of bleeding from the nose. Even more significant are the moments when the series takes on a more sophisticated tone and the above-mentioned figures such as Pauline and Geoff are shown in a sympathetic, more vulnerable light. Film adaptation is the best proof of this, but some fans may decide to belong to the local. The equally underestimated third series also has a different route, instead of the drawings, each episode focuses on an individual character with each story leading to one conclusion regarding the plastic bag and van theater company van. Although many fans may not enjoy the structure of the film or the third series as well as the first two, they are certainly signs of how the inventive League of Lords can be and not afraid to explore new areas. <br /> <br /> In short, the League of Lords is definitely worth the look, just as the welcome sign says: you will never let it!
