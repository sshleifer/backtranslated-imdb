First, tell me that before sunrise, like all the movies, there is no film for all tastes. Some people seem less smart when they realize this, but it is remarkable to think about how this little harmless film comes from some people. For me, like most people here, a deep chord hit me in front of the sun, I was really stunned, moved, inspired by it. This is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one watch. It creates some of the most amazing unforgettable feelings and emotions you can imagine. It is impossible to imagine this world without thinking about the kind of inspiring feelings I have gained from it. The film works as a community of two fragile souls that begin to recognize each other. It is very intelligent and inspirational, not so much as one conversation necessarily relates to the other, or the significance of the themes of Jesse and Celine's discussions, but rather the little nuances, the perfectly expressed reactions that evoke each other. It captures the honest, romantic and yet summer human emotion that begins to bloom in the magnificent Viennese environment; convinces us that their evanescent relationship can be the greatest compliments in the world. And what happens after that night is open to debate, but I have no doubt that they will not disappear again. The easy comments of Rockythebe and the below-mentioned user are hopeless examples of that, accept and respect those who love this movie. <br /> <br /> Look at it and change your way of life.
