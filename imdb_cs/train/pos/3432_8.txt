This is one of the most important films that must be in the context of time. Dating in Tallinn was carried out in 1993. It was a period of chaos, confusion and gross disruption not only for the ordinary inhabitants of Estonia but also for countless citizens of other former nations that were part of the mighty Soviet empire. It was in such a tense climate that a young country was born, called Estonia. Given that the newly established governments face difficulties, Estonia has also faced numerous problems because some corrupt officials have manipulated state machinery to fill their dirty pockets using their selfish means. This is one of the main themes of this film. Lack of Tallinn appears as an Estonian film but was produced by Finnish director Ilkou JÃ¤rvilaaturi. He tried to best encourage as many as possible doses of Estonian humor. That's why he can call him a comedy film of political undertones. Since ordinary people are involved in this movie, we can say that this film is good versus evil. is not a new concept because it is readily available in most religious books of various beliefs. Taintedness in Tallinn shows us how ordinary governments can be suppressed by corrupt people as well. A nice movie that can be watched on a sunny day.
