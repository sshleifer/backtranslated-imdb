I have seen a lot of science fiction sci-fi since the 1970s; some terribly wrong, and others thought provocative and really terrifying. Soylent Green fits into the second category. Yes, sometimes it's a small camp, and yes, the furniture is good for giggling or two, but one of the films looks terribly prestigious. Here's a movie, 9 years before Blade Runner, who dares to imagine the future as a somthing dark, haunted and nihilistic. Both Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson are far better than the Ten Commandments and Robinson's assisted suicide scene is profoundly predictable by Kevorkian and his ilk. Some of these attitudes are dated (to the filmmaker that the concept of "woman as furniture" takes place in our oh and politically correct 1990s), but rarely find a movie from My Decade that you can really think. This is a movie that I would like to see on the big screen, because even in a wide-screen presentation I do not think that the overall scope of this film would be payable. Look at it.
