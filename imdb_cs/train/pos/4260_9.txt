After Fatih Akins first worked "Im Juli", which was quite good, he created a truly amazing Italian family epic. His German film, which, unfortunately, is a poor precondition, causes us to rarely produce more than average films;). But this movie makes some very good snaps of time then. "Solino" is about an Italian immigrant who arrives in the Ruhr region of Germany during the 1960s. Immigrant and his family start the first Pizza restaurant in the region. The characters are excellently drawn. Especially Gigi, the main actor. You live every second, every feeling you do. His brother, who plays Moritz Bleibtre, is not that good. Well, just do not trust him. But the character is well balanced and fits perfectly into this scenario. I feel an urgent need to compare the style of this movie with the Godfather style. Many people probably hate this movie, it says it's boring. Is not there much tension? - yes, but a bizarre movie. 9 out of 10.
