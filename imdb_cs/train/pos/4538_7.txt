I did not even want to watch this movie after reading Maltese review and 1 1/2 ratings. I watched it on my son's advice, and found it to be much better than I expected. I could have 2Â½ stars from the 4 star system. You have to watch the movie more than once to understand. If you do not know much about religion, you miss a lot. I graduated from high school in the year when the film was shot, so I can better concentrate on it. Yes, there are some prejudices in the movie, and to a certain extent it's weird, but it was the 1970s, so what do you expect. I see why the film may not like it; however, I do not understand people who say it is boring. The film is all boring. You will either hate him or love him. If it's boring, you're probably dead.
