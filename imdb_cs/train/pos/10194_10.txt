That would work much better if it happened like "Mitchell in Malta". At least we'd be spared Joe Don Baker, who ran around the otherwise landscaped Mediterranean National Park, dressed in that ridiculous cowboy outfit ... not to mention being an old Western gunman. Mitchell's Mitchell, the film would also not suffer from a lack of police brutality. Oh, okay. At least the comic comments made by Mike and Bots have made this pleasant fare as an episode of MST. But I can not imagine it myself.
