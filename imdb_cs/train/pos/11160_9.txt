This is really the biggest Swedish film of all time. Not only is his story revolutionary but also among the first films that represent the new generation of Swedish humor and Swedish comedians. Felix Herngren and Fredrik Lindstr√∂m are now the two most intelligent and funny filmmakers in Sweden, and this film really makes it clear. <br /> <br /> "Adult People" is a heartfelt and cheerful story about adulthood and the question of whether we would be better off without it.
