Director Ruggero Deodato, the right icon of horror film fans after managing the key and famous Cannabal Holocaust. Nevertheless, do not expect him to find any such renown in the film that is being reviewed here, because it turns out to be incredibly tame in comparison and plays more like Conan's inspiration for a young audience. Such a description can instantly postpone most fans of the entire genre inspired by Sword & Sorcery Conan, but before you turn your nose, you have to say that this movie is so fun! <br /> <br /> It is mostly played laughs and features of two huge and very sympathetic heroes in the form of David and Peter Paul aka. barbary brothers who both seem to have a ball with their characters. The popular B-movie Richard Lynch appears as the main villain in the bush and it is also great to see the roles for Big George Eastman and Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> Added to that, the ladies are amazing to see and suitably dressed for the duration of the films (the basic and much welcome component in the genre!) What I can say - this is just a really fun and carefree takeover of this genre and I recommend it with all my heart!
