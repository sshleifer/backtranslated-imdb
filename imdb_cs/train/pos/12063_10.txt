The Woman in Black (1989) is a television adaptation of the modern classic fantastic story Susan Hill, which was released just a few years before the film was shot. Unfortunately, this movie was not released on DVD and if I knew it was deleted on VHS. Its availability is in direct contrast to popularity among those who know about horror films. The story revolves around events in the coastal community at the beginning of the 20th century when his young lawyer is sent to conclude the affairs of a recently deceased widow who died in her isolated marshland estate. What he thinks would be a routine and probably boring task will change into a nightmare when he finds out that the old woman is attacking her death and that the spirits of her past are not satisfied. The story is narrated in a gentle but brief way without being near, brilliant, or too exuberant. An apparently tight budget can contribute to the fact that there is no nonsense, but that's exactly what the story needs, and why it works so well. This is what does not seem to scare you. When he said that, there is one particularly scary scene that relies on visual and works on perfection. I was watching this movie during the day and it still made my nightmares almost a week later. If you like scared, do what you need to get up and watch a copy of The Woman In Black.
