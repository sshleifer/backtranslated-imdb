Larry Burrows has a clear sense of lack of something. Since he missed a major baseball shot at the school, he was convinced that his life would be better if he did the shot. One night his car breaks down again. If you go to the nearest bar and wait for a towing vehicle, Larry becomes a barman Mika, who does not know that Larry is going to change his life forever ... ... <br /> <br /> The alternative living premise of the cinema is hardly a new thing that goes back to "It's a wonderful life" and shows no signs of trouble with the recent Sandler car that was clicked. It is a genre that has produced very mixed results. In 1990, this production was led by James Belushi, rarely mentioned when the subject was created, seems to have largely been forgotten. Which is a shame because it radiates spell and is not short in humor. We know that we are guided by the fact that its final report is over, but it is a fun and pleasant way to go down. The film also serves as a glimpse of what was a great comic actor James Belushi. I mean, if his style of smart wailing and larking exasperation is not your thing ,? then you are likely to avoid this movie. But for those who engage in Red Heat, K-9 and Business Care, Mr. Destiny is right on your street. Together for the ride are Linda Hamilton, Michael Caine, Jon Lovitz, Hart Bochner, Jay O. Sanders, Rene Russo and Courteney Cox. <br /> <br /> Fate, pure rescue fun with a boyish message in your heart. 7/10
