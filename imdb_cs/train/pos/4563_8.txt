It is hard to imagine that this film is based on a true story and how Christy has managed to achieve this miracle is so hearty. Daniel Day-Lewis is a chameleon, really hard to imagine how much effort he has spent to create this disqualified character. On-screen monitoring is a shocking and breathtaking experience. The film is not as pessimistic as I thought before, the story is a bit clear and interesting. Christy is not despised by normal people, his life is also varied and gorgeous even though we can be aware of loneliness and painful quarry with his eyes. One important factor in Christy's success is his mother's support, which seems much more eager, and the unknown actress Brenda Fricker also deserves the Oscar-winning role for this role, and this tiny little middle-aged woman uses her to fulfill Christy's dream. Good luck for Christy! And Hugh O'Conor is also excellent as a young Christy, what performance for a baby! Christy's love story is very well done, trusted. Christy wants love and nothing can give him the right to love, his restraint to the beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole (surprisingly played by Fiona Shaw, I'm deeply engaged in her role in the Harry Potter series, a nasty Aunt Petunia, so her appearance in this role is really out of my mind, but any woman has her own youth ...) is paranoid and insulting, compassion with him, love is a sword with two edges, happiness and agony are next to each other. <br /> <br /> Btw, Jim Sheridan's work is good (in America, BOXER, etc.), except GET BICHE or DIE Trying ', God knows why he chose to steer the crap! Really for him career, what a pity!
