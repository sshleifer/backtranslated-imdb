Josef Von Sternberg directs this wonderful silent film about Hollywood and the former imperial general with the Russian caretaker who was there. Emil Jannings won the Oscar, partly for his role as a general, who ironically hides a bit in a silent image as the Russian general. The film is falling to his days in Russia, which led to the fall of the country to the revolutionaries. William Powell makes his debut on the big screen as a Hollywood director, who will be filming Janings in his film. The film serves as an interesting look at the fall of Russia and the imitation of the backstage of Tinseltown in the early days. Von Sternberg adds one more classic, full of great elements of romance, intrigue and tragedy.
