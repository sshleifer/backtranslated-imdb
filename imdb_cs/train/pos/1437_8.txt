We often see films about undesirable events in politics, but I still recommend the "City Hall". In the role he was born, Al Pacino plays as mayor of New York, who must deal with shooting a boy. But it turned out that nothing he does will have a real effect. In this film, the characters are just as redheaded as we would expect from anyone involved in a political scandal. No matter how much you trust the politician, you may have doubts when watching this movie. I understand that I can not name any concrete example of something similar to what this film is portraying, but that is not a point. If we have the perfect impressions of those who are at the top, this movie will shatter those thoughts. Surely, I encourage you to see. Also starring John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Anthony Franciosa and David Paymer.
