Wonderful movie! The DVD has recently been rented and has been built with this amazing work. Douglas Sirk was a film genius and performed from Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone (Oscar winner), Robert Stack (Oscar nominated) and Lauren Bacall, who can not describe the words. Paul Verhoeven earned this film brilliantly because Dorothy Malone plays Sharon Stone's murderous inspirational guru in his Basic Instinct. What a great joke! <br /> <br /> At the turn of the film, it's merry, riveting, camping, biting, horrible, persuasive and eye-catching! Surely it's grandaddy every dirty big-and-little soap opera screen, but none has a dazzling style as you would see here: the camera work is smooth and polished, the use of color is breathtaking, the assembly setup set to the title song is beyond memorable, one dimensional characters are unforgettable and the final picture will have a scratching head as the censors at that time let the final cut! While most older, high-end movies may sometimes be a boring hole, sitting down, written on the wind contains so much and it's so fast that it's actually shame when it's over. Thank you Mr. Sirk for the craft work - and Todd Haynes, who drew attention to what happened to one of my favorite films of all time! VIDEO THIS FILM !!!
