Expecting another Nunploitation movie with superior parental abusive and agonizing accusations, Flavia proved to be far more than I expected. In fact, he has a feminist story, even though I do not think such a term existed at the time the movie is set. It certainly was not practiced. Women (and Jews and the poor) are largely oppressed and locked up in menial positions in society. Throughout the story, Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) testifies to the tyranny of her time until she simply can not sit and actually does something, though with disastrous results. the sequence has Flavia as a young teenager close to the battlefield. He sees the wounded "evil" Muslim soldier (one of the few still alive) and tries to help him. Before she can, her hated father takes a soldier and raises her head in her face (great family dynamics, huh?). Then her father forced her to join the monastery where she witnessed even greater injustice. Although the scenes include violence, rape and nuns, I consider it to be a historical drama more than an understatement. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are many ingredients for difficult exploitation, but acting, camera work, storyline and music are too good to stay at that level. Most of the "nun" movies I've seen usually have the basic premise: A good girl gets somewhere in a monastery where her mother is the supreme bitch who likes to whack people and / or make her life like hell. Flavia spends much of the first part of the film that passively casts doubt on all the atrocities that happen around her. Most of her passivity is forgotten when she becomes acquainted with the strong and temperamental (but slightly foolish - like somebody else like me, but it's much easier for boys) Sister Agatha. When a group of Muslims attack their abbey, Flavia and Agatha do not shoot in fear as the other nuns. Their invaders actually act as their liberation (about the cruelty and close slavery of the Abbey). In fact, he is a Christian, not a Muslim assailant who touches the precious sister Agatha. <br /> <br /> It's Agath's death that sends Flavia to her violent crusade against those who oppressed her ... Their father treats her as dirt. Her Muslim lover leaves her at a very inconvenient time. I do not want to give up the rest of the story too much, but be prepared to be shocked, destroyed, and grieved. It's a great movie, so do not touch its (undeserved) reputation as prey. In addition, how can a movie with Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli be on Earth? I'm not familiar with other parts of Maria Casares, but Sister Agatha is hell of a character. I have read many great reviews of Synapse (US), but I love my German X-rated copy of Cult DVD. It's not anamorphic / 16: 9, but it actually has a bit more pictorial information at all edges than Synapse. And there are also many great, wise or entertaining lines of dialogue (many of Agatha's Sister) "Why is God the male? Father, Son and Holy Spirit? They are all men!" -Flavia <br /> <br /> "These men are afraid - look at them, sister - They are afraid their power will be taken away from them!" -Sr. Agatha (when it comes to Christians fleeing after the Muslims come) <br /> <br /> "Woman, where are you going?" Muslims will not give you anything that Christians have not done! -Sr. Agatha (to a group of fledgling Christian women) <br /> <br /> "Lord bless the Muslims - to be afraid of these pompous Christians." -Flavia <br /> <br /> "Do you just have to look at a Muslim who will do your underwear?" -Sr. Agatha <br /> <br /> Closing the Message: "Flavia Gaetani, who is not yet a Muslim - is no longer a Christian - has been punished as a destitute nun." The film idea comes from events that took place during the Muslim invasions of Italy culminating in even today it is remembered as MARTYRDOM 800 AT OTRANTO "
