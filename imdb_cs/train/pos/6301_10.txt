I participated in the film symposium and this film appeared after we saw a not so big film and we participated in 40 minutes of discussion. Although it was incredibly late and we were tired, the whole audience really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I personally thought the movie was jolly in all the right places and I loved a special expression of cast. The film really grows.
