I and 2 sisters have watched all three Tenko series and I agree that it is by far one of the BBC's better series. The entire cast was very convincing in the parts that they portrayed, and although the third series was somewhat slower, it was convincing watching and my evenings used to be without it. We have no doubt that we will be watching again because it is a series that I would never hurt watching. Exceptional tracking and full marks of the BBC for such a brilliant series and casting. First rate in all departments and recommended this series to anyone, although some age limits should be considered due to some adult material. So thank the BBC for the release of this series on DVD and Video.
