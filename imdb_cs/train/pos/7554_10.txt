First, this movie is 34 minutes long, which means you can watch it three times in a row and still spend less time than you would watch most other movies. Second - you have to do it. This sensational short film explores the potential of animation through the world of playful or frightening, but always strong, pictures. Cats that come and drink from a water elephant, a circus with a bird that consumes the sky, and pigs eating their own fried meat - that's just the beginning. Scenes and images, exceptional in themselves, flow together without obvious causal links in a way that requires re-observation. In addition, DVD contains an amazing commentary from the director who only enhances viewing due to the extremely free dialogue. The commentary gives some interpretation of the scenes, but also provides invaluable quotation marks for the creation of cat soup: "Well, artists asked what we should do in this scene, but I did not know, so it's hard to tell why it did the way it did "(this is a bad paraphrase by the way). Also, the sound throughout the movie is very good, very accurate and very moody. The absolute minimum viewing experience should be as follows: <br /> <br /> First view: Watch DVD without comment. Second Watch: Watch DVD with comment. Third viewing: Remember without comment. <br /> <br /> Once you've watched it three times, you will not stop there ...
