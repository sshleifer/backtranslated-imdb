Just two comments .... SEVEN years apart? Hardly evidence of inexorable power! As already mentioned, the low telecom budget status of 13 GANTRY ROW is an attenuating factor in its limited appeal. He said it was not without mercy - whether as a fun or a haunted trip alone. <br /> <br /> It's true that AMITYVILLE HORROR is overwhelming in its most basic land - with only a lot of horror. Another case of intrigues! Gibney might have had more value if she played Halifax - she was investigating a couple of seemingly unrelated murders with a "house" as the main suspect. The scenario is better than average and total high standard production. It simply can not involve the viewer, especially in key moments. When I chose a DVD for only $ 3.95 last week in my regular video store, I can not get rid of the expenses. $ 10.95 would be acceptable for the movie. Just do not wait for the fireworks!
