I'm afraid this is a movie that you have to ACTUALLY WATCH get out of it all. This is not a soulless movie, like ..... "LEATHAL WEAPON PART 58" do you know where Riggs is really crazy? it is not a movie that is almost the same as the beginning at the end. you can run everywhere to talk about the phone to do what ever and enjoy it any way.I have previously noticed that most people who do not like this type of movie are the type that will do anything but watch the movie and then slam it because ..... the duh does not understand or does not understand or what happened. Do not let yourself into the kitchen !!!
