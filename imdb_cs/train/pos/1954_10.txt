I thought this movie did the right job. He was not as creative or original as the first, but who was expecting it. It was all fun. the more I think about it, the more I like it, and when it comes out on DVD I will pay it very proudly, every last cent. Sharon Stone is great, she's always, even though her movie is terrible (Catwoman), but this film is not, it's one of those films that will be underestimated all my life and is likely to become a classic for 20 years. Do not wait for a classic, watch it and enjoy it. Do not wait for a masterpiece or something like that that sticks and the soul touches, just let yourself get out of your life and get involved in theirs. Overall, this movie is fun and I recommend people who did not see it, because what critics and cashiers say does not always count, they see it for themselves, you never know you could enjoy it. I bet a hat to this movie <br /> <br /> 8/10
