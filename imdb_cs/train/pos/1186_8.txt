He talked a lot about "psychological Westerlands", but he is one of the few who really is in this genre. He has great stars that work very well, but the director makes this a good movie. Stewart Granger loses the British stereotype of the safari hunter to play a hunter with a former former buffalo that is worshiped in the West as one of the best. Robert Taylor plays at the beginning (as opposed to the usual young teenager, Taylor's figure is also middle-aged) who wants to kill buffalo and attracts Granger to trade with him. They hired two other big names actors, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn to be their skins. Granger is being chased by a bison that he killed because he knew he could be guilty if he died, and they know that if they are lost, the way of life of native America will suffer greatly. Taylor will soon reveal the sadistic side, but it is a realistic sayism, unlike the one-dimensional sadists of modern film that makes silly and dork. He is insecure and needs human society. Yet he does not stop at murder. The end is two against each other, with a surprising conclusion. The psychological effects of what they do are well described.
