In Arlington Heights, IL we never had a cafeteria at any elementary school (1961), so I went cycling out for lunch and always watched this game. It is true that I was 11 years old, but I thought it was the best! I would pull out hidden pictures on the board and see if my family or friends find it. I also recall the victory of gorgeous cars (Pontiac or Oldsmobile) if the contestant got the final hidden image game. I even had my home version! It seems to me why this game lasted so briefly. I enjoyed music and hidden paintings - the only thing I ever got was a lemon hidden as part of a bridge across a garden stream. <br /> <br /> Really good memories are associated with camouflage.
