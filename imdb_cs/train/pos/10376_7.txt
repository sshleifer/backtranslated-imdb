I was just looking at Roll and how happy it was. Toby Malone's performance really stood out, I found out that I was actually looking at what happened to Matt in the whole movie, which in itself is a lot of fun, very spicy with a good combination of well-rounded characters, which is quite a success, time. There are plenty of good twists, anyway, he'll guess you until the end. The other characters that need to be watched are absolutely crazy, tiny and sneaky attractive Jesse. You do not have to have a huge budget for a Hollywood blockbuster, but do not let him put you down, you could do a lot worse than check it out, you will not regret it. Good entertainment. 7/10
