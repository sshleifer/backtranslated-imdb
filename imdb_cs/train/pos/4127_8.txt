I know there are some purists who are behaving for anything that is not exactly the original, but sometimes spin-offs can stand on their own merits. I like the new Iron Chef because it is similar to the Japanese version, but it also takes care of the American spirit. I love Alton Brown as a commentator because he explains things with taste. Iron chefs are very interesting. I know the originals were probably the best chefs on the planet at the time, but Bobby Flay is the only American Iron Chef to beat them. Mario Batali seems to have the most fun in cooking, making comments and crazy in making. I watched the series and all the players worked well. Referees are not always the best choice. There are a few exceptions, such as a lawyer turned to food, but most judges are questionable when he is able to handle what is being served. I like when I look at the chef and the challengers are surprising. The food at the end always looks amazing and sometimes inspires me in the kitchen. Maybe it's all you can ask, really want to eat what is being served. The only thing I really would change in the series is to ask people to make a little bit of a light. Sometimes the mood becomes a bit tense and it's not always fun to watch when you expect more fun. I liked the version with William Shatner (Iron Chef USA), because it was as overwhelming as the original, but I can say it was a pretty expensive thing. I wish he stayed with this version and hosted - between Bill Shatner and Alton Brown, who would be grinning in an hour. As long as you do not expect the original Japanese version and you can take this series of your own merits, you can consider it a pleasant hour.
