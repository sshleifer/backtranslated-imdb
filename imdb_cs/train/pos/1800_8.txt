All the dogs that go to heaven are on the same level as the waterfall down for scary children's movies. Both were dark and quite ominous, but also the most beautiful experience a child can have. It was one of my favorite films as a child. I was in love with Charlie, and in a tender age of about five or six years, I admit that ... I had dogs for my buddy. All dogs explain the dark story of Charlie's incense and his partner in the Itchy crime. The story begins with Charlie escaping from the death row and going to the nearest club to deal with a gamble. Of course, as a child, I did not understand the concept of this film. I loved songs and animations, but as I am older, I wonder why this film has not been disturbed as a young man. These are pretty mature topics - gambling, murder, hell, and jail, but in the world of good-natured Disney movies, it's something that every child should watch once. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is some crazy transvestite crocodile scene, and hell scares me more when I'm young, but it brings a terrible message that parents should not ignore!
