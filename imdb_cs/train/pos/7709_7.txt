I know I like this movie and I usually do it, but as others have mentioned, it's a bit long in the tooth. I also found that the furious hormones of all male crews are a little annoying. It's a wonder they did not start breathing and saying moons. I also have to say that the film is leaving the cold overall. It is a very sterile atmosphere that penetrates the film. On the plus side, the effects are great (except cartoons), as well as effects, props, costumes and of course Robbie. If this robot was not in this movie, I do not think he is as popular as he / she is. The other half of the movie lifts the pair as soon as we begin to investigate the forgotten gadgets "Krell". As many times as I've seen this movie, Krell still lets me scratch my head like exactly who or what it was. Based on what was produced at that time, besides "This Island Land," the Forbidden Planet Mile is above the average science fiction films of that time. Color film also contributes to its enjoyment. Certainly a classic in itself, bugs and all, and it deserves it.
