This is one of the most blameful entertainment movies ever! <br /> <br /> I'm embarrassed to say that my favorite character is TISH, but I keep watching her giving her a "cool super cool" suit with a "like bitchin" strip and sticking to the stones on her face. But anyway, the film is actually one of the few "family" films that keep you interested. I know the beginning stretches, especially when you know what's going to happen, but the other half is probably one of the most nervous segments in family film. millions of people claiming to love this movie, in fact, to rent it is pretty embarrassing, but I admit that the Internet is hiding behind. <br /> <br />
