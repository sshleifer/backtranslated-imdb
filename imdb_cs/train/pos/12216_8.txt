The film enters the cinema in Indonesia this year (2007), two years after its official release and after many illegal DVDs found the public's way. It seems that the popularity of the illegal DVD leads to the release of theaters, and yet the public will be watching. The movie is a great epic, bringing Japanese culture to your home. In a sometimes humorous way, the story of a theatrical writer who writes the story of his theater is told, because the regular Kabuki theater plays are something he considers boring. At first, the audience might be a little confused about the story we are watching, but when the story unfolds, we see that love between male and female daughters leads to the great story of the new Kabuki theatrical work. <br /> <br /> The audience stays in the dark when it comes to a story that really should have been in Japanese traditions and mythology, but it does not matter. The way the story is narrated with love for theater, expression, vivid colors, humor and tragedy, makes it a great ride on the Japanese cinema and theater. Let yourself go completely when you watch this movie, try to see it in the cinema rather than at home on TV. <br /> <br /> One critical point: The soundtrack is sometimes a bit unpleasant. Although most of them are great music, there are a few moments in the movie that I think they should choose some more dramatic music. But perhaps the fact that the story contains moments of humor has made it possible for the director to choose even lighter moments in music.
