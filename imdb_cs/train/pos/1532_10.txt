This, like the murder she wrote, is one of those shows that after a stressful day at school I sit in front of the TV and watch. Why? Because I really enjoyed it and it's a shame that it's no longer in the air. Dick Van Dyke is amazing as Dr. Mark Sloan, who murders his son. He brings him to a largely unknown but very competently supported cast, namely his real son, Barry Van Dyke. Victoria Rowell is also good, but I noticed that every series of her hairstyle is changing. I also liked Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter, but I was very fond of Michael Tucci like Norman and he was confused as he suddenly disappeared. This show is so entertaining, with big guest stars, it's sometimes obvious like Colombo, but every episode has always made it easy. At the end is a great series with two inches up and ten.
