This little movie has long been on my "list". Do people realize that doctors at the turn of the century have been treated by stress, menopausal, emotionally abused women (as well as mentally retarded)? All the devotional, agile Christian attitudes of that time were deadly to explore the TRUE emotional feelings that would allow us to accept the suffering of the soul, let alone examine what it means to accept our humanity. Can you really imagine (according to today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books were forbidden because it recognized that women had feelings and emotional responses as great as men? Think about it! The sensitivity of this film still gets me and I give it to the director for taking his eyes.
