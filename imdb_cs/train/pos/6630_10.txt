This is an important movie. Invites the viewer and urges you to pay attention. There's a lot here. The director seems to be interested in dividing some of the tired film conventions. Unlike a lot of recent American cinematography, this film is interested in what it takes to make the film the first place. The DVD contains plenty of bonus features and there are two comments that explain the movie to viewers who are still bothered by the initial viewing. When the films were held at Sundance, more than a few listeners felt uncomfortable and angry. This is a Sunday morning coffee film, not a Friday party. It's a treasure for a dedicated spectator.
