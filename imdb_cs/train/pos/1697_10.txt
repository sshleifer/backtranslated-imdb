Basically, this film is one of those rare movies you either hate and think the suicide boundaries are the best thing to do but to sit for two hours. Or, as in my case, you see it as a cultural hit, one of those movies where humor, conspiracy, acting is actually very hidden, but for those of us willing to go looking, trust the director well, The reward is: U laugh your A .. !! The fact that U has to find the things mentioned above actually makes the film even more fun because it gives the impression that the director does not even realize how humorous is his film, which seems unlikely, and lies at the rudder of this spectacular project called: Spaced Invaders!
