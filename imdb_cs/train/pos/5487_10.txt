You've never seen anything like that. Once the coup has begun, it's the most dazzling thriller you've ever seen - even if you know the result. And it's all real, because it's a document - amazing. <br /> <br /> By the time it was over, it was on my Top 10 list of all the great movies. <br /> <br /> Do not forget about fans of right-wing fans. Everyone who knows who watched this movie gives him a 4-star rating. Even if you do not care about politics or Venezuelan politics, you will find yourself nervously charged and - believe it - at the edge of your seat. It's a mountain bike ride.
