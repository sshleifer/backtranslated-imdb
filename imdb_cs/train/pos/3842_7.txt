Occasionally a surrealistic thriller that will push most of the human buttons. 4th person will certainly offend someone with a politically correct taste. The protagonist of the story is a bisexual alcoholic catholic writer, Gerard (Krabbe), with a very twisted sense imagination. Verhoeven offers up to Gerard has an example of everything bad with a modern man. He is powerless, vicious, unable to control his urgency, afraid to commit to meaningful relationships, and absolutely apathetic to life in general. As the character points out in one place, he is a professional liar, incapable of remembering the truth. The film opens with Gerard dreaming of the spiders who consume Christ and then wakes up and begins a long march to his own destruction. Going for one person (probably a friend), then chases another at the train station. Later, the lecture will meet a woman who seems to want to help or maybe have more malicious plans. He quickly captures Gerard on his site and attracts him by sex and money, having a lot of both. She also has secrets, like three dead husbands. Is she lonely and really looking for someone to educate - or is she a deadly black widow and attracts Gerard to his death? Will Garard be the fourth man to kill? The woman is Christine (Soutendijk), and Verhoeven is doing everything in order to guess what she is doing. This is an interesting movie with lots of sex and intrigue. It's similar to Verhoeven's <em> basic instinct </ em>, but it has much more depth and is certainly shocking. There is a lot of strong gay content that can make some audiences outrageous. We highly recommend fans of intelligent psychological thrillers or anyone looking for something completely new.
