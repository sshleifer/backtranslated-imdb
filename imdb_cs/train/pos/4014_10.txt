Spoiler for anyone lucky enough to see this movie at all (so it's not really a spoiler). He saw this film when he was released and still remembering his parts. It's all in a small town in the west or what's left of that city. It is more like a ghost town with a small population. Among them a couple where the woman is particularly bad. He lets his man die at the end of the movie and leaves the city, but he has to go through the desert. We never know what to do with her, but just before she leaves her dying man, she shoots after her and deliberately does not hit her and instead of supplying water. She does not even realize that she will soon be thirsty. Mark Damon kills a couple of bad guys in an entertaining estate - but that's another story I do not remember very well. The remaining impression of the film was that it was one of the first moments when I saw a really ominous woman on a movie that pretends to be something other than a malicious one - it can not be compared to a witch in "Snowwhite," which is easy to find out. Very tight western with several main characters and still absorbing.
