SPOILER INCLUDES With the possible exception of John Wayne, there was no other actor sitting in the western saddle higher than James Stewart, and this film proves it. This excellent revenge story centered around the Winchester rifle, has only one weak spot I can think of: going to Will Geer as a very unstoppable Wyatt Earp. The casting of the villains was good: Stephen McNally, like dirty Dutch Henry, Dan Durya as Waco Johnny Dean and John McIntire (versatile in playing both good guys and bad guys). Showdown between Stewart and McNally on the cliff is great! I would stack this West against the entire decline of today's West. They would not have a chance!
