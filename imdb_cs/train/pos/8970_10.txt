I explored this film a bit and discovered a site that claims it was actually an inner joke about the universe of gays and lesbians after WWII Greenwich Village. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, Warlocks and Witches represented an alternative lifestyle. John Van Druten, who wrote the scene, was obviously cheerful and very familiar with this Greenwich Village. I thought it was ironic because I saw a bell, a book, and a candle for the first time in the theater when I was in the 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me. It was hard to get me into a movie that did not contain horses, machine guns, or strange monsters, and I was going to get bored. But I remember the moment Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak at the top of the Flatiron building and threw his hat away while the camera followed the trembling to the ground. Since the magnificent love theme of George Duning has increased, I suddenly got a feeling of falling in love. The first mixing of romantic / sexual love left me crazy when I left the theater. I'm sure I'm not the only guy in front of adolescents who was surprised by the surprising direct view of Kim Novak. It is ironic that homosexual parables have been able to trigger heterosexual puberty in so many of us. I'm in the late 1950s and last night watching the movie again, and those same feelings were upset as I watched the hat touch fifty years later. . .
