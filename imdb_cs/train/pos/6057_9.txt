Sure, because it's a great picture and great sound, it's a great home theater "show off" drive, but this is also a touch track and an informative document. The parallel stories that are linked in this film will be of interest to all viewers. Young, old, boys and girls find it deep, we are all car fans, especially high-performance indy machines, which are the result of generations of blood, sweat, tears, ingenuity and perseverance. Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder are perfectly matched to visual and content. I do not want to end, but the last driving procedure for "Days like these" Quincy Jones could bring tears to the eye. Enjoy it!
