Wow! it's a good movie! The game was not good at all, but if you look at some moments in the movie, you turn it over and watch again, it's brilliant! The man at the beginning of the film walks with a suitcase against three. WOW! I never expected it. Then he puts the coke in the trunk and escapes. I bet the smoking against these three was one of his friends who sold the drug later. A genius quotes: "" nice shades, I need a couple of '' '' 'their' 'if you think you can take them ..' '.. just brilliant! And the fight is the best I've seen. on the other guy he picked up after he hit the head of the first guy against the table WHAT'S HIT And in the middle of the movie, one man in the car shot once, then 3 falls, is really good to think It's a lot of money to get these boys The end was great, it was so exciting that James Cahill walks up and down the stairs and shoot Jason peters after his distraction moves Jason Peters falls and returns again when he is dead I can not say with other words how great is this movie!
