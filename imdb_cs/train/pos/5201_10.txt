The Human Tornado is a 70-year film campaign in which comedy comedy comedy Rudy Ray Moore plays, perhaps the most liked. The film tells the story of Dolemite, a bad furious pet who gets on the wrong side of a white, racist sheriff sleeping with his wife. Dolemite barely escapes and travels to sunny California to visit an old friend, the night club owner (and Mrs. Dolemit's "ladies"), Queen Bee. It seems, however, that the rival nightclub owner with Mob clutches attempts to rock on the muscles, so Dolemite takes things into his hands. Rudy Ray Moore has shown many diverse talents including strong dramatic skills, mastering Kung Fu, impressive singing (giving two songs on the soundtrack), touching with compassionate ladies, and overall convincing charisma and intense sense of comic timing. This movie has everything, people: Deep plot, blistering action, laughter-minute comedy, beautiful women in distress, slam-bang ... what could you ask from the movie? Run, do not go to the local video store and rent The Human Tornado today. And do not forget to share it with your family.
