Plainsman is an entertaining western, no doubt a classic that is still real today. Gary Cooper is the wild Bill Hickok, perfect for the role, along with John Wayne and James Stewart, were the best players who played their generations on Western Heroes. Jean Arthur is great as Calamity Jane, no one he knows he played better than she. Even if it does not have to be historically accurate, the film can capture the most important information about Hickoku and the time it takes. Sometimes you have to sacrifice history to make your opinion and that's what DeMille does here. Hickoku's friendship with Buffalo Bill, the sale of rifles to India, a great manufacturer to compensate for the losses that Custer and Little Big Horn would have lost due to the end of the civil war, a turbulent relationship between Buffalo Bill's wife, a religious woman, Hickok who killed a lot, and an unusual love affair between Hickok and Calamita, all makes "The Plainsman" an unconventional and interesting film. Anthony Quinn has a very short look that shows how great actor is going to happen. A lot of attention was paid to the demonstration of the original weapons of that time.
