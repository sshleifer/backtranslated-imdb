Since Douglas MacArthur has hit more lives than a better American president, he deserved a better film biography. Not that Universal "MacArthur" is bad. It's just not everything to be. <br /> <br /> Oddly, the potential was there. From the very early "Star Trek" episode "The Corbomite Maneuver" (1966) to the recent HBO films Something Made The Lord (2OO4) and "Warm Springs" (2OO5), director Joseph Sargent became one of the most prominent human film directors , a man capable of gently shaping the emotional shadows of the performances of his actors and conveying the audience exactly where he wants to go. Producer Frank McCarthy also gave us "Patton" (197O), legendary Jerry Goldsmith recorded both films, and Universal asked for the film to be "four years in preparation and production." Yet "MacArthur" is absolutely reasonable and is not much more than that. The film begins at the beginning of 1942, shortly before the frantic general was ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Dan O'Herlihy) to flee the Philippines to avoid being captured by the Japanese. This film omitted: · The birth of MacArthur in the 188O in Arkansas border barracks is still subject to attacks by indigenous American tribes, thus proving that his remarkable life has surpassed the distance from bows and arrows to thermonuclear weapons; <br /> <br /> · passing West Point first in class 95, · joining his famous father, General Arthur MacArthur (who won the Medal of Honor on the Civil War) in Japan, China and , most importantly, in the Philippines; <br /> <br /> · Her heroic use in the 1914 excursion to Vera Cruz; <br /> <br /> · as he jumped on the trench of the First World War as a mountain goat, often wounded and blindingly promoted to the brigadier general; <br /> <br /> · his post-war service as the youngest and most progressive commander of West Point; <br /> <br /> · his participation in the military court of Billy Mitchell in 1924; <br /> <br /> · its direction of bonus markers in 1932; <br /> <br /> · his efforts to keep a poorly funded army as a Chief of Staff in the early 1930s; <br /> <br /> · his departure from the US Army to become Field Marshal (!) of the Philippines Army; <br /> <br /> · and reactivate his FDR shortly before the outbreak of World War II. <br /> <br /> All of this is omitted in favor of the extended MacArthur shots that try to fight when we were evacuated by a PT boat, so we know that "General Mac" is a legend but not why; nor can we afford why the accusation of cowardice so hurt for "Dugout Doug" and so clearly unfounded. The rest of his career is currently straightforward: His island hopping "Hit 'em where they are not" campaigning, fulfilling his promise to the Philippines? "I'll be back!" - his top achievement, the victory of peace in post-war Japan, then a contradiction with the opinion with President Harry Truman (rightly feisty Ed Flanders) about the conduct of the Korean conflict that resulted in his full shot, and finally his congressional statement that "the old soldiers just disappear" , after which he just did. Everyone is fairly historically accurate and they all have a very deliberate lack of commentary. Sargent and the producers are almost painfully away from decorating the historical record with their own consent or disagreement: If Macarthur's acts seem to be noble, let them be presented as such; If it seems egoistic or bombastic, let those concepts register without comment. Given that Joe Sargent is very experienced in being gently manipulating his reactions, he again sees Warm Springs - this refusal to offer comments seems to be quite deliberate. Historically, it can be praiseworthy, but it almost renders impossible the viewer's efforts to place this extraordinary man in any rational perspective. And finally there is some sort of "made at a cheap" to feel the movie because there is "Midway" released at the same time. Both films have been featured in "television" directors - Sargent in this case Jack Smight on "Midway", and both have been made for TV-appearance. Even the march of Jerry Goldsmith, although perfectly usable, lacks the subtleties and sublimity of his "Patton's" theme-just another way in which a man more than life is remembered by a very ordinary film. <br /> <br /> This man was incomprehensibly extravagant and petty; there was such magnificence, and he loved him, or he was angry, we must realize that MacArthur did what no military commander did before him: he won peace. Finally, "MacArthur" like many movie biographies? is a good place to start exploring this remarkable man, but a bad place to end it.
