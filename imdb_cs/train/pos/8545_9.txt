Overall, I found this movie quite fun and fun to watch, with lots of laughing loud moments. <br /> <br /> But this movie is not for everyone. That's why I created this quick question if you answer yes to any of the following questions than I recommend following this flick. (1) Do you enjoy rough sexual humor? (2) Do you like humor? (2) Do you like amazingly hot girls? (3) Do you enjoy observation breasts? (4) Do you enjoy watching a few breasts? (5) Did I mention all the nice boobies in this movie? If you noticed a spoiler alert, it is referring to the mass amount of nudity you can expect in the movie, I myself have no idea what the conspiracy was about. Not that it's important.
