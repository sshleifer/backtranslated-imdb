I watched, fascinated and fascinated by voice and physical action. The roles played by each character were performed with perfection. Texts, words, every gesture, sunrise all told. The film spoke to me. It illuminated me with another perception of a man who believes in humanity. Who Believes in Peace and Fine Behavior. I was also kept unbelievers, sacrifices and human dignity was portrayed. Force without grace is demented and without feelings. To the power at the cost of mankind is so incredible. This movie feared me for people who are no longer in this world. And it's sad to think of them. I love this movie for interviews and face expressions for all this. This movie can be blessed.
