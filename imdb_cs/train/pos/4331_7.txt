The murder in Mesopotamia, I have always considered one of the better poirot books because it is very scary and has a genius ending. There is no doubt that television adaptation is visually striking, with beautiful photographs and a very horrifying music scene. As always, David Suchet is as perfect as Hercule Poirot, the comic episode of the episode is Poirot's mosquito battle in the middle of the night, and Hugh Fraser is good as a somewhat naive Captain Hastings. The remaining part of the cast brings decent performances, but it is important that they are not overshadowed by two drivers, which is a danger in some Christie adaptations. Some episode was quite spooky, a juxtaposition of an episode tragic like Five Little Pigs, an episode I enjoyed much more than this one. Especially what happened to be spooky put down music when Louise Leidner sees the scary face through the window. About the adaptation, the book was rather loyal, but I say there are three things that I did not like. The main problem was stimulation, relatively slow, and there are some scenes where little is happening. I did not like the fact that they were doing murder to Josef Mercad. In the book I see him rather nervous, but the interference of the idea that I make him a murderer and who can not evolve makes him less attractive, although I'm glad he did not let go of his drug addiction. (I also noticed that the writers missed the fact that Mrs. Mercado in the book fell into hysteria when he believed he was another assassin killer). Another thing that was not so impressive was that I felt that it might have been more if the adaptation was from Amy Leatheran's point of view, as if it were in the book, Amy seemed somewhat less sensitive in adaptation. Altogether, despite some misconceptions in the name of the writers, I liked the murder in Mesopotamia. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
