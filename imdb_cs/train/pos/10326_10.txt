We often talk about cinematic sights - Kane, Godfather, Bout de Souffle. But one film is too often overlooked by "serious" film critics. Of course, I'm talking about classical Doc Savage (M.O.B.) This film is not only exciting but also seriously explores the question of the exploitation of developing countries by American imperialism. Not to mention kung-fu. Besides, it also had the biggest soundtrack in the movie (except, of course, Queen's glamorous work on Flash Gordon). Although it's a bit rarity, this movie is worth looking for - it will pay ten times the effort of your search.
