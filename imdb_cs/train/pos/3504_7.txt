This movie feels like a film project. As if the filmmakers chose the cross-section of the company without experience and got to work. Characters are a bit uninteresting and naive. Despite this amateur feeling, the film is effective. It's like a cross-section of life with neighboring children who are trying to realize or promote their honest sexual feelings.

Probably the most enjoyable way is that the main character grew slightly in her romantic relationship and realized a greater depth of sexual feelings. Good watch, but nothing will change ...
