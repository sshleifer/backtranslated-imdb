Critics did not like this movie. It bombed in the states and as a result received limited impressions in Britain. Which was a big shame because it represented British rather than American humor and was first to show in Britain. Nicole Kidman looks stunning and is absolutely convincing Russian. Ben Chaplin is the character of Dustin Hoffman of "The Graduate" and "Birthday Girl" has at least 4 scenes that remind the viewer that the classic of 1960 (despite being a completely different story!). it changes several times from comedy to black comedy to thriller to adventure - but it is an unforgettable, moving and restless breath of fresh air compared to an average mega-budget jerk. <br /> <br /> Look at this open mind!
