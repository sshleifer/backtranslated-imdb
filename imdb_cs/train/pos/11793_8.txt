I'm following the series back to me as quickly as possible. I'm trying to watch all Star Trek things. This is the third month and now I'm in Season 3 of the TNG and I have already passed the DS9. Star Trek is the biggest television phenomenon ever achieved. <br /> <br /> "Shadows of Gray" are the first record episode in the TNG series. When I just watched the shows, these clips were fresh in my mind, but I noticed how few of them were shot again because the movie looked better. Season 1 has always seemed to me to be really dark and ugly - and the actors looked stupid, as if they were not in their own skins. The show is basically just made of the biggest hits of happiest and saddest moments in Riker's life on Enterprise up to this point. The Data and Riker scene in holo-deck is the classic moment of new friendship. My next favorite is when a 2nd officer on a Klingon ship calls Riker's authority as the first officer, and Riker defeats the living CRAP from that klingon. Then the admiral kicks his $ $$, but good. This whole episode is a heck of a reminder that many crazy, great things happened in just two seasons, with another 5 and a bunch of movies! At this point the series begins to really develop the emotions that link Riker to Deanna Troi as Imzadi. Until that moment, they have mentioned this fact, but have not used it yet. Let the record show that ST Wiki - Memory Alpha claims that Imzadi means "first" and indicates that he has a confidential relationship with Riker and also remains deeply close to emotional. This episode also proves that in the future he will have a tense romantic interest in himself. <br /> <br /> Here is an article: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Imzadi By this point in the series, production value is up to speed and Star Trek TNG will settle into sci-fi behemoth with which he wants to become. I see it again as an adult, I see now what the SCRIPTOR provides for the Star Trek Universe. They really need to create a new ST show after all the current shows. The DS9 movie would also be nice.
