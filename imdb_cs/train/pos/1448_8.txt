Throughout the country, and especially in the countryside, people with any political ambition should take the time to see this movie. The film is called "Town Hall" and with little imagination, its synopsis can be held anywhere in America. That's what happens in New York. Here is a story of popular politics on behalf of Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino), who is capable of leading a large metropolitan city with very little effort. His right hand is none other than Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack) an equally clear person who has the ambitions associated with his teacher and both seem to be intended for a higher office. Everything is heading in this direction until the police shoot off an investigation led by Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda), who believes that the guilt is toward the town hall and the mayor. A six-year-old boy and the death of a police officer are blamed on a career criminate whose controversial freedom leads to an apparent overthrow of political pay and urban corruption involving trade union leaders such as Danny Aiello played by Frank Anselmo, corrupt courting officials like Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and mafia bosses like Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa) who are deeply involved. They are also party officials, such as Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff), who works for the Probation Office in New York. But it is a relationship between the mayor and his deputy, who is charged with the task of accidental shooting. A great vehicle for Cusack and a certain bet candidate to become a classic. ****
