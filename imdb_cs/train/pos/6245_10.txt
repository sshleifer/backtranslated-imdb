"Hundstage" is the first fictional film of a farmer (before he drove large documents as "animal love" or "models"). Seidl has been working on this project for more than 3 years, but costs only about $ 2 million. actors are very good, especially unprofessional actors who played almost alone. Cinematography is also good. the whole movie is shockingly disturbing and some scenes may be too big for "ordinary" viewers. The film shows a lot of sex and violence, but also that people are lonely and unable to communicate with each other. I must finally say that it is one of the best and most appreciating Austrian films in recent years. please excuse my bad English. <br /> <br />
