I've seen this important intense movie tonight. His most important and best work is Richard Gere and Claire Dane. Gere deserves an Oscar for having been forced to retire early as an administrator of a sexual offense. Claire Danes is hateful as a woman who is about to replace her - a woman trying to learn everything she can do in investigating one last case in which Gere's character believes that one of those who is in charge of monitoring can have a young girl as a hostage. The subject is shocking, sexual offenders and those who watch them, but we will not soon forget this movie. I know Gere's show will be hunted for a long time. Ever since Anthony Hopkins photographed the serial killer, the screen image was terrified and I was surprised. The movie opens with shocking statistics, so do not forget about the opening credits. Intense and unforgettable. Richard Gere's best role to prove a man can act. Danes can do as well and both can do extraordinarily well in this often demanding movie. This is a true movie and Gere gives a multilayered deep-felt performance. Just give him an Oscar ... it deserves it!
