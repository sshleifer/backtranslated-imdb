Pecker is a funny and funny movie about a small town in Baltimore, whose daily and humorous routine breaks Pecker, a young photographer who makes "real things." No nice models, no gorgeous men, only heavy housing. This amazing film captures the amusement of the plasticity of the urban art chain. There is one particular scene when a homeless woman who buys in Pecker's fashion has the same precision as one of Whitney's artificial junkies for just 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars. It simply shows that no matter what money you have, you may not always have a taste. Again, John Waters sends you to an endless spiral of laughter and raw reality. You can have your own traditional Hollywood movies with special influences and mountains of personalities, but give me "Pecker" or "Hairspray" (another great John Waters movie) through "Titanic" or "Godzilla" every day!
