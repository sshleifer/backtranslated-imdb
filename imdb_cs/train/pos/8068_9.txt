To watch this film from the beginning to the end without laughing at a certain point, it almost takes the act of faith because one must always say: "It's old," "classic," "dear," not because, the film is so bad, but because it is in its best condition so good. This is a dated film. It's also a classic if it's damaged. I'm not inclined to confuse people, in principle, and I have more than a little irritation when others do it. Doing the fun of The Informer in my mind is a bit like giggling on the idiot sevant when dribbling his orange juice through the tablecloth. Yes, one says to himself, he is an idiot, and yet, when he is at the top of his game, he is also a true connoisseur. The same goes for the informant, who is occasionally very scary and yet boasts gorgeous photos, fine acting, gorgeous score, and a good, decent simple story. Finally, what can not be forgotten is that politics, religion and psychology are united in the church so that the scene seems evil and over the top, and yet it is sometimes life. The impersonal people of a simple faith behave differently from us (probably brilliant) modern people, and the scene is not so incredible (I buy it, but I know it is Irish) as embarrassing. Yet people behave like they say such things. Not all are hips, and it may not be desirable for everyone to be hips. Are today's people much better than those seventy or eighty years ago? And which way? I think yes. We are different. Now look at the movie.
