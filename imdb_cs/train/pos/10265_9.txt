A unique film about a bewildered woman (Lindsay Crouse) who gets involved in sharp men. Joe Mantegna gives the best performance to Oscar-caliber. Absolutely charming the first hour as Mantegna shows Crouse's "rope" of his con game. The story of the story goes a little later, but it still stands as a unique picture of the innocent, captured in the dark world. It is definitely worth it.
