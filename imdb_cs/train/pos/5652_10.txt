I love the series! Many of the stereotypes rendered by Southerrners as hicks are very obvious, but these people are too often. The depiction of southern governmental circles is also true, but sympathetic characters also remind one of many good things about the South. Some things never change and we see "old good boys" every day! There is Lucas Buck in every southern city that just has to make phone calls to make things happen, and the story of "after" the "white waste" is too well known, apart from the supernatural elements, it could have happened in the modern south. I think Trinity, SC must be in Barnwell County!
