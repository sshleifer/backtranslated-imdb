As a person who has lived with a brain pallace for more than forty years, I find this film inspirational. If someone with such a serious CP case as Christie Brown can do so, then there is no reason not to achieve my own dreams. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker both have great performances. <br /> <br />
