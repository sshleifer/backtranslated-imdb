The fascinating and yet disturbing sight of Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin of late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a rodent, dilapidated mansion that the city regarded as a health hazard. It is very clear that these two are eccentric in the past. Little Edie seems to be the most when it comes to the idea for ten years, even though it is 53. The content is almost composed of two things. The first is interviewing Little Edie lambastes Big Edie for taking all her potential suitors and destroying her aspirational career as a writer, actress and dancer. This discussion is usually very rhetorical, pointless and often fun. The second part consists of long shots of attempts to sing on both sides. Everyone of course thinks their singing is perfect and it's just the second one that sounds bad. In one amazing scene, Big Edie is actually physically attacking Little Edie with her wand just to stop her. Very glamorous, however, a person feels that there is some serious exploitation and the objects are too far to know them. It seems to filmmakers to consider it a strange performance in a circus that comes and records every day (and giggles) about any bizarre behavior. Finally, it's a sad picture because it shows how the world just went through these two. Their hopes and dreams are falling apart as the house they live in. In spite of their harassment, these two need each other more than ever. Or without the other would not be a refuge from loneliness. The most amazing line comes from the Big Edie, which many cats lightened throughout their bedroom. Her answer to the scent complaint is simply unbelievable.
