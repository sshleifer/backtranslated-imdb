Buddy is a fun family film at a time when "humanizing" animals and making them cute was an accepted way to get people to be interested in them. <br /> <br /> Based on a real story, Buddy shows the great love that the main characters have for the animals and each other and that they will do something for themselves. <br /> <br /> While it's not the perfect movie, the animated gorilla is fairly realistic most of the time, and the quarrel that occurs in the home is usually fun for kids. This film lacks the opportunity to deal with the misconduct of bringing pets to pets as a pet, but it shows trouble. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p>
