Maybe it was not as good as the whole, but the second episode, which was the first one I said, was so memorable, I still remember it today. I became a fan of Dick Francis. I would recommend if you were interested in racing and secrets. <br /> <br /> The Kokney Slang Chicana Chico, Chico Barnes, is much more fun for those of us who have never been close to hearing the London Bells but they are attractive and the show is interesting. Sid Halley was one of Francis's most interesting characters and the show really minimizes some hand problems. Interestingly, electronic handhelds of the kind used in stories are apparently less user-friendly than those invented after World War II.
