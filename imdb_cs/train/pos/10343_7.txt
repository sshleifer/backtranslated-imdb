"Wonderful Mr. Williams" star Melvyn Douglas, who in 1939 produced five films, one of which was Ninotchka with Garbou. His star was Joan Blondell (Maxine), who also filmed five films a year, of which three of them together formed! Douglas is Lieutenant Williams and he and his colleagues are exposed to the dead body and have to find out what really happened. Audiences are aware of their collaborators - actors (Clarence Kolbov√°, Donald MacBride, Don Beddoe) have always played the office of ... senators, bank presidents, police officers. The one who dunns has a comedy about it - the police always throw themselves on themselves, and even Williams and his girlfriends fight verbally. Some fun gags - Williams even takes the man they've arrested with their girlfriend. There's plenty of fun stuff, so you're slowly starting out and waiting for later entertainment. You do not want to give up some spoilers, so you'll have to capture them on Turner's classic movies. Director Alexander Hall was mostly comedian and allegedly was somewhat concerned with Lucy.
