I saw this movie in the theater and was deeply interested in it. Again, it was when Claire Danes was a good actress, not the stupid, arrogant Hollywood female she is today. By the way, this film really hit me as one of the more brutal, realistic, beautiful films about friendship. How far would you really go for your best friend? By the end he moved me into tears and still tears me when I look at it (my own). I remember when I left the theater, I called my best friend and sobbed at her how much I loved her. It's a great movie you can watch with your best friend. But be prepared for an almost certain conversation after he turns to you and asks if you have done something for her ...
