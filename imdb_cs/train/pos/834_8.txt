Dark Comedy? Šibenice humor? How does a comedy develop from a murder? It can be a risky business because the viewer is obliged to get rid of his moral values ​​and laugh at the anger of a man who kills people. So the story is rock solid with a good dash of suspended reality to make it work. So Pierce Brosnan, the Irish response to 007 is now occupied as an alcoholic who smokes, a chain that kills people to live and has a life crisis. He meets a struggling merchant, Greg Kinnear, and after a rocky start he learns that he needs a friend. But Greg has happily married Hope Davis and Brosnan and sees the basic things he does not have, love, home, and life. Add actor actor, Philip Baker Halla as hit mana manager and we are at the races. Brosnan is surprisingly crude and crude as an anti-hero and Kinnear gorgeous as his counterpart, a very human trader. I hope Davis adds a spark as a very conventional wife of Kinnear, who is fascinated by this abandoned one, who casts herself in her life. The end is beautiful and surprising. You should let the theater feel at least partially good - if you can stop being horrified when killing people.
