This movie scared me when I was just a child. It's not "Citizen Kane," but it has moments. The hand burst scene is good. The conspiracy is good, even if the characters are not - it could have something to do with acting. Put some people with the highest name into the roles and then look at what you have. It was one of those to shoot, modify (what little was there) and distribute the type of films in a few months. This is a classic low-budget sci-fi and deserves to be payable. I rated 9 other films of this genre and age.
