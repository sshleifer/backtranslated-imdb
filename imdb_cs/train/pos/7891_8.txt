Now all kids and teens from Springwood, Ohio are all dead expecting that one teenager (Shon Greenblatt) is still alive. Freddy (Robert Englund) lets him go and the teenager does not have a lot of memories when he comes to a new city. When a hard female psychologist (Lisa Zane) tries to interrupt a new patient. Find out where he is from. She brings him to Springwood to awaken some memories, but three teenagers (Lezlie Deane, Breckin Meyer and Ricky Dean Logan) who have unexpectedly come to a ride. When she arrives in Springwood, the psychologist has some memory that she lived in the town before. While Freddy knows the real secret of his true identity. Direction Rachel Talalay (Ghost in the Machine, Tank Girl) has made a grim, but somewhat different, sequel with some visual style and fun moments for this horror / fantasy / thriller. Yaphet Kotto (Alien) has a supportive role as a dream psychologist. It has some brilliant visual effects (not everyone will love the top, especially in 3-D) and some good style in his narrative. This DVD is characterized by powerful anamorphic widescreen transmission (1.85: 1) (also in Pan & Scan mode) and powerful Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD has an original theatrical trailer, to move on to the Nightmare view and information about the cast and crew. The "Elm Street" series, the eighth disc, has interviews with the actor and crew of this sixth film. The sixth film is also in the 3-D film for film climax, but you can also watch it on 2-D. This is the last of the Elm Street films until Wes Craven discovered Freddy in another, darker style in New Nightmare and a silly, but surprisingly pleasant spin-off horror film "Freddy Vs Jason". Watch Robert Shaye (New Line Cinema co-author and CEO), Roseanne Barr, Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper in fun portraits. Written by Michael De Luca (John Carpenter is in the mouth of madness). From the director's story. (*** Â½ / *****).
