Outside the home is a different world and the family is struggling to make a line between the fathers' authority and their hopes and dreams. The period is captured; Light Bakelite Launches, Georgian Floors, Picture Frames, Wallpaper, Short Skirts, Crazy Boys, Mini Van, Shiny Modern Mangle .... <br /> <br /> The place is captured; The wind brought a glacier carved out of a rocky landscape, walls of local stone, community, freedom. But there is so much more; Childhood, happiness, sensuality, pride, values, freedom, authority, insurrection, violence (in the deepest sense), love, fight, puberty, naivety, morality, trust, sacrifice, horror, acceptance, revelation, comedy and parenthood. (And in no particular order!). This film is a richly woven expression of family tension, which is equally important today. The fact that some of them are not solved directly is in itself a proof of today's attitudes, but the fact that they are all here is a testimony to acting skill, story, and direction. <br /> <br /> If there's anything wrong with this movie, it's all a deeply rooted and incredibly renowned tension that will eventually turn away. Maybe I can not understand it - the mystery and grief that many teenagers feel will really disappear if they deal with them (**) - maybe the movie is trying to send this message - it's worth it. is the movie trying to say? Children: Parents were also young, parents also fight, everyone is making mistakes, everyone is learning, things are changing, fighting can end up happy. Parents: Do not try too hard! Try to remember that your support is the key to their coolness. Sounds simplified, is not it? Sometimes the film is similar, but then you notice how much it is attacked and revealed. The film is classic. <br /> <br /> (**) - No problems in itself.
