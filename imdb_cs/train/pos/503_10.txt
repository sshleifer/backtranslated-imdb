After seven years of watching this terrible nonsense called Star Trek Voyager, I felt quite numb. Another Gen and DS9 were a bloody good thing and Voyager destroyed the TV Trek. It opened with probably the best pilot for the Trek show. The crew was really good, just like the selection of actors for the parts. Scott Bakula played in the deep universe a typical First Time Captain, and his untouched way of doing things was a refreshing change before all the captains already know everything. The rest of the crew was really nice in their roles, and I think they were in good first season. When the show was prematurely canceled, I was really disappointed. In the Darkly mirror, he showed us what the cast is capable of. The pity that film or television has never been considered. So much back story and the founding of a federation that has been told, including the onset of hostilities with the klingons ..........
