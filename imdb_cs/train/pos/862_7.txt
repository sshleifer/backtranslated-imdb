Carla is a secretary who is basically deaf without her hearing aids. When she finds herself overloaded at work, she is able to hire Paul to help her. Paul is just out of prison and his past is not entirely behind him. Let's say a story that has many twists and turns a little more. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the movie is how sound is called when Carla hears and when she can not be - a "point of hearing" (as a point of view). The initial scenes that have done so, as well as the early development of the character of Carla and Paul, have been more interesting to me than later, some of which have been difficult to track and / or spread a bit of credibility. There is also some unpleasant violence. Again on the positive side, cinematography was very good. The film is worth seeing, but maybe not looking. Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on 4/28/2002.
