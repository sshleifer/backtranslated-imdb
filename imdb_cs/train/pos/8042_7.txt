**** SPOILERS **** The film "Sniper" is undoubtedly based on the use of the legendary American naval sniper Carlos "Gunny" Hathcock. Poor, spoke, Master Rogers, who raised scores of up to 300 confirmed and unconfirmed Vietcongas and North Vietnamese soldiers killed during the two tours of "Nam". It shows how the truly lethal and efficient trained military sniper Tom Berenger is cool and deadly as Sgt.Thomas Beckett, who is at the end of his career as a top US sniper, but later in the film he realizes that life as a civilian will be useless. Since he has nothing to do with his skills he has learned in the US Marines, unless he decides to become a crowd hit. Backett reluctantly accepts his fate as a professional professional killer of his country. The story of the Sniper film is focused on Sgt.Beckett, with the help of a former sharply shot silver medalist and American government agent Richard Miller, Billy Zane, being sent deep into the Panama jungle. The two snipers are to take on board rebel general Miguel Alveraze, Frederic Miraglitto and Colombian drug king Ra√∫l Ochoa, Carlos Alveraz, who supports him in the planned military takeover of the country. <br /> <br /> We see earlier in Sgt. Beckett unfolded and took the lead a rebel who feels like the best scene in the "Sniper". For this it shows step by step how Sgt. Beckett with the help of his observer Cpt. Papich, Aden Young, is doing his job. There is also a partial conspiracy that was later interrupted in a film about DeSilva's resistance sniper DeSilva, Eward Wiley, who persecuted Beckett and who later killed Papich as they both were waiting to be led out of the jungle by a military helicopter. You would like to think that between the two, which would culminate when the film ended, but Sgt, a deadly cat and mouse appeared. Beckett had no trouble at all when he sent DeSilva early in the film when he used the unsuspecting Miller as a bait. The most damaging film was ironically the last fifteen minutes when the story went from one shot to one to destroy a sniper film on a Rambo-like ending with Sgt. Beckett and Agent Miller fight against the entire battalion of rebels with bullets as thick as the London fog. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> who does it completely secret.
