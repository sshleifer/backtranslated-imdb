I saw this series when the world premiered at the Toronto premiere film festival. I liked the thought of a movie where the two men gathered and told the director of every country that he would make a film about the 911 movie. These directors never met until the project was complete and they saw how it looked together. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All the pieces were very strong and some were controversial. If you are an American, you may not like it because some of these pieces can be found anti-American. However, I know a few Americans who enjoyed these series. The piece I found the best was the one from India. This was how the Muslim family living in the States had 2 sons and one of them was missing. The Americans gave them a cold shoulder and automatically assumed they were linked to a terrorist bombing. Caught my mom's despair and humiliating these charges so well that it brought tears to me. Finally, we can see that her son died as he tried to save many victims from the crash of the tower. That was a real story, and that was what happened so real. There was a lot of emotional and powerful pieces, and the African song was one of the best. It was funny, but as strong as the others. It must be seen for all, and let's hope America will cancel it and let it play in its own country.
