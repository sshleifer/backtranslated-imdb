A classic series that should be at least repeated or launched on DVD.Billy Toth, after realizing that she was admitted after the death of her parents, sets out on a journey to find her real parents. After various rituals of passage, his search will culminate in his father's identity being stolen and used by a businessman in Europe! If I remember correctly, the series ends on the Austrian (?) Downhill slopes and the cliff at the top of the cliff, leading to the death of the father of Billy's traitor. filmed on spot in various destinations all over Europe and appeared polished and incredibly well made with some episodes passing into the sphere of film noir and crime thriller.The main arc was often overshadowed by the slices of life that Billy had gone through during his years turning to find his secret mothers and father. The class acts, but underestimates and forgets.
