Super, unusual Audiard movie, Read My Lips is a crazy, lonely thriller. It is perfect for Vincent Caselle's splendid sculptural charisma and features an amazing performance by Emanuelle Devosa. Devos is a repeating element of Audid, just as KArin Viard appeared for Jean-Pierre Jeunet: unconventionally beautiful (all of them call it so unattractive), a versatile and capable subordinate profile. <br /> <br /> This is almost a definition of her role as Carl, a put-on office dog shell, driven by colleagues using her deafness. Yet she found ami d'exploitation if you like Cassel's ex-con Paul. Each of them uses the unconventional talents of the other (the theft and the reading of the lips) to fight in their situations and create an unconventional romantic rapprochement. Devos / Audiard directs Carlina's deafness and her servicing, twisted inner world with a discreet, stylish taste. In this movie (2001), Audiard is already clearly controlling his manipulation of tension, action, and investing his frame with a real visceral experience that becomes a big hit - the Prophet - nine years later. 7/10
