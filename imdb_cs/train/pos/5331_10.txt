just watched the sky in the TV missed the first half an hour. I wondered if it was a true story, so I watched him until the end. at the end there was nothing that could happen, what happened to everyone. it reminded me of the speed, but at the end of the day it is not supposed to be released at the cinema because we saw the following error. we saw that they removed the hood and then two shots of a wagon with a police car in front, which he tried to slow down when the hood was turned on again. it had me on the edge of my seat, especially when I thought the baby would be on the bridge and, of course, when the bridge did not stop and then it was. I'm afraid I got into tears so it was not that bad !!!!
