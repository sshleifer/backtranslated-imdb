The last claimed men will find James Coburn, who makes a long sentence separating himself from the chain gang. And he and his friends are heading for the Mexican border of prison and security. No, because Koburn has a mission of revenge. Kill the mild officer who brought him and killed his wife. The Peace Officer is Charlton Heston, who is now retired, and he knows what Coburn is after. As he explains to his daughter, Barbara Hershey, Coburn was thrown into the hut and was involved in Waco as a departure. His Indian woman was killed in a hailstorm fired. It's not something he would be proud of, it was a secondary accident in search. <br /> <br /> So that we can not allow Coburn to know how good he is, the bad guy who really is. Heston is his usual proud hero, but the actor's awards in The Last Hard Men go to James Coburn. He blows everyone else on the screen when he is. <br /> <br /> Coburn gets a clear idea of ​​how Heston has kidnapped Hershey and brought her to an Indian Reserve where his white offices can not touch. He knows Heston has to make it personal. <br /> <br /> Coburn's gang includes Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulal, John Quade, Larry Wilcox and Jorge Rivero. Heston has Chris Mitchum, who is his son-in-law. <br /> <br /> The last Hard Men is one ugly and brutal western. Andrew McLaglen drove it, and I think it might have been a project originally intended for Sam Peckinpaugh. It certainly demonstrates a lot of its influence in the liberal use of slowing down on violence. That's a lot. <br /> <br /> For the little Peckinpaugh lite, The Last Hard Men is your movie.
