As a child I loved this game. I played it in the spring of 1993 with my friend Andrew. I played Axel or Blaze and it was Adam and no matter how often we played, we were never bored. Then came Streets of Rage 2. And we quickly forgot that this album exists. <br /> <br /> You play as former Axel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding policemen who have left their forces to get the bad guys in their own way. There are 8 levels that can work in a dilapidated and corrupt city led by Mr X's evil. Fighting all the bad guys and the end of the level is much more fun. Level 4 (The Bridge) was my astonishment, because you could catch the unfortunate after holes in the river. You even have the chance to become Mr Xa's true player at the end of the game (at a price). This leads to the "bad end" in which you become the head of the syndicate. Exactly, as much as possible, it's a secret because you will destroy the syndicate on the way to Mr. X, but it does not matter. Streets of Rage has really fantastic music. Composer Yuzo Koshiro has gone through absolute miracles with limited Sega Genesis technology. The main theme, Level One, Level 4, and Final Boss are standout tunes. <br /> <br /> As a Wii owner, I'm proud to have it on my console forever. But with Streets of Rage 2 also available, it will cause the first to make it a little obsolete. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> Great melodies. <br /> <br /> It's easy to get up and you're hard to get down. <br /> <br /> Cons: br /> <br /> Much worse than infinitely more complicated Streets of Rage 2. Bad enemy AI. Baddies often leave you instead of getting involved in the fight. This is especially angry with the level 5 boss. <br /> <br /> The lack of combo moves. <br /> <br /> Lack of decent weapons. <br /> <br /> Bad male models are repeated too often. <br /> <br /> Graphics B- Sound A- Game B- Permanent Challenge B-
