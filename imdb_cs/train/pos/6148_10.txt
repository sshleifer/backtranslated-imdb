IN LOVE MEMORIES DAVID TOMLINSON (1917-2000) When I was watching this film for the first time at the age of 4, I was fascinated by this story of witches in World War II. The scene that attracted me most was the struggle between the Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. It was extraordinary to see this army without the body go to fight the amazing singing of their march. This film is fantastic, from the road to Portobello Road (which has become the most popular place in London) for the trip to Naboomboo. Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are a really fantastic couple. She's always great, she seems to be a good family aunt, and David, with his always surprised face, is her great coordinator. we will miss him a lot.
