The first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and not very entertaining and had a dramatic feature where Bill (mother) was facing all the usual problems in life, but this element was a little depressing and did not mix well with those comedy elements, which is probably the reason why he was released. It soon became one of the most entertaining comedy series that the BBC ever did! The chemistry between Bill and Ben was very entertaining and there were always so many great and unforgettable sketches in each series. Christmas specialties were fun and really at Christmas. <br /> <br /> The show ended when major actor Gary Olsen played Bill, which was very sad because he was a great actor in movies like Up 'n' Under and a very humorous man RIP <br /> <br /> an undervalued show sadly disappeared from our TV screens and will not repeat it often - although it appears on UKTV Gold once in a while but it should be repeated on the BBC one or two to show this brilliant comedy to a new audience
