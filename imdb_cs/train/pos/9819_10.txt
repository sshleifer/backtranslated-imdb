This is a great movie from the lost age of reactionary dramaturgy. My most popular actor, Robert Culp, skillfully portrays the trajectory through constant liberal justice and belief in the system, kneyererk conservativism and the fear of crime and murderous psychosis. The teenagers are a collection of purely frantic evil stereotypes, and the eventual message of this film makes Dragnet's episodes flattened. But what really shines is the incredible pace of the film, building fear and paranoia in degrees, as well as the feeling of the whole of California. Cars are really great, as I remember. I'm giving this film ten, and I'm not going to protested someone watching this movie and not chanting every minute. Remember, because it is made for television, it does not mean it's not a great art.
