I saw this film at the BIFFF festival in Brussels in the spring of 2004. What a surprise! This German production, a stylish and imaginative shock, is one of the most awesome flicks I've ever seen. Please note: this is no joke! This terrorist has a lot of good actors (as an example: Peter Martell as a European guru has a strong presence), excellent direction, nice production design, very good soundtrack and lots of heavy gore sfx like Italian horror films of the 1980s. Meat of torn pure bones ... and the blood is running in red ... this wild heart-shaped stopper will grab you ... and give you some dark dreams ... Must-see!
