If the filmmakers attempted to bring reality into the conspiracy, it would be just another waste of time, money, and creative effort. Fortunately, with all the feigning facts on the wind, they created a comic miracle. Who could hand over a movie in which an ambitious pilot spent the entire film that acted as Jack Nicholson, complete with the Lakers T-shirt. Do not suggest this film as waste.
