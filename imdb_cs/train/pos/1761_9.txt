Only once in a while we will get an R rated comedy that gives everyone time and attention. It is even more rare when critics will like it. I just came back from The 40 Year Old Virgin and I can honestly say it was one of the biggest laughs in my life. I went to 10:35 and every line was filled. Not only that, they all laughed all the time. It's two hours of continuous laughter. I venture to see this movie and do not have to laugh. The story is simple. The man is forty years old and virgin. Still, behind this simple five-joke, we give a deep and complex story that is not just one of the most fun to ever witness, but behind it are real lessons. Steve Carell plays as Andy Stitzer, a 40-year-old virgin. We know Steve Carell, in my opinion, one of the best thieves of the scene of all time. Steve Carell, the theft of the merry scenes from Bruce the Almighty and especially Anchorman, has come a long way since he eventually and proudly gained his moment to experience as a star. No one will forget their name once they see this ubiquitous, merry, crazy, merry, merry comedy. Beauty about the film is not 100% silly. The great writing of Judd Apatow and Steve Carell has a real intent and is not just a story. A major lesson to learn is the rough and vulgar, uninterrupted ride of the film. Although the film is not presented as best as possible, the film gives us more than just a nice time. His sober attitude will make you laugh all the time, while at the same time we see the real life struggles of people like Andy and his colleagues. The end could not be better. Not only does it deliver what we promised, but it gives one of the most memorable finishing figures that the comedy has ever seen. It would be perfect if Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson appeared in some way, but you can not win all of them, now you can. <br /> <br /> Finally I think, as Roger Ebert said, Catherine Keener gives unexplainable perfect performance like Trish, the only woman Andy really has the heart. Not only does he make us laugh, but he is crazy when he sees how he clearly drives the story. She was cast in a role and she and Carell have amazing, not to mention the fun chemistry on the screen. The Canadian rating-wise, again, Ontario escapes away with 14A, while British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba all slapped a 40-year-old virgin with 18A. The same thing happened to the four brothers, in my opinion the second best film of the year, and I can honestly say that I love Ontario more and more. All the other teenagers in the state: happiness is creeping! <br /> <br /> Overall, Steve Carell gives one of the most entertaining performances I've ever seen, and almost everyone in the actor's cast is devoted to nonstop laughter. Everybody will love a 40-year-old virgin this summer, and I encourage everyone to see it as quickly as humanly possible. It's the best comedy of the year, hands down. Fighting over the long yard, wedding crashers and of course Apatow and Carell is the last unforgettable comedy, Anchorman. It's a comic masterpiece and deserves a remarkable amount of praise from critics who have been loving it. Every one of my favorite critics loved it and immediately deserves a place on the IMDb Top 250. Steve Carell is a huge star. Watch one of the brightest years right now. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Objectively? 9/10 <br /> <br /> Subjective? <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
