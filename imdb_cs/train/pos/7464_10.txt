I've been thinking about it a few days after I saw it. This is a great movie for me. Wide Shut eyes have the same effect on me. I'm tired of these people who require these happy Hollywood cookie-cutter finishes. I intend to see it again tonight to understand the plot a little better - but no matter how emotional the film's messages were, it was totally uncomfortable.
