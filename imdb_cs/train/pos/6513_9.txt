To be Honest With you I think everything was so good in this movie, there should be no reason why it was not going to theaters, Deaths in the movie are amazing that FX are amazing when used. There are a few tedious moments when the story is about a little girl, but in all of them it was a very good movie, which I hope will one day get the props that they should. The first part of the film is why he came directly to the video, killing a little boy, but then the story is based on a little girl and her mother who came to visit a friend of his mother who moved to try to become a writer. The property she buys happens to be where a witch (dentist) lives and everyone who lives in her house or goes to her property will be in great danger wanting nothing to give away really little information if you wanted to see this movie then it so it is worth the rent
