It is without a doubt my favorite Le Carre novel and transforms itself into a silver screen with all the love and care that one can desire. I read a review on these sites that seem to find nasty characters but I believe it lacks. All the stories of Le Carra are basically love stories, and that's no exception. It is the exact reflection of the period in which it is set. Theft is the key to everyone for the good of anyone. Pym education is so close to me that I find it cold watching. Peter Egan is in his best role and the late lamented Ray McAnally is incredibly good. Even the smallest roles, such as the Andy de la Tour, Tim Healy and Jack Ellis, are in place. This is Dream Dream Impresario Dream. The story should not be devalued by a misinformed description, but it is enough to say that it refers to young men of slow but inexorable destruction and descent into espionage and betrayal. All my sympathy lies in Magnus Pym and his only (not sexual) love for Poppy (RÃ¼diger Weigang) - as amazing as ever, his only true friendship, but also by the definition of another in a long line of betrayal. I love it.
