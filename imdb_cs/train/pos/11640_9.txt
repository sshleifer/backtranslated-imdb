What I liked best in this movie is that, just like Hitchcock movies, it's a thriller that does not take too seriously. Hitchcock realized that people were going to the movies to have a good time. Something that seems to have forgotten Hollywood in recent years. It's a thriller, but she has a lot of laughter and always has one eye for the camera. Rachel McAdams is gorgeous, as always. Cillian Murphy is crazier than he was in Batman Begins. In old times, it was the guys who always played the bad guy. Nowadays, we do not see much because I suspect Hollywood agents are a poor career, but Cillian Murphy is really good at being bad. Direction is a surprising style. The story is good, but the dialogue could use some sprucing up. <br /> <br /> "Red Eye" is a really fun movie and people clapped when the credits were closed. If you're in the mood for a pleasant thriller from escape, "Red Eye" can be your ticket.
