Today there are very few performers who can take me all over the film with their presence. One of the few people is Judy Davis, who has built a successful career to create characters that are rough but very vulnerable. She has a role that most other artists would treat melodramatically and deliver a fiery, deep emotional intensity that draws attention from everything else on the screen. Her skills are well represented in "High Tide," a film that has coincided with her for the second time with director Gillian Armstrong, who gave Davis her first major success with My Brilliant Career. In this film, Davis played a young woman who was committed to the world, despite the suffocation she felt from her community and education. In High Tide, however, Davis's character, Lillie, is roughly the opposite: she gave up any hope for the future when she was young, and after the child's birth she goes from her responsibility and takes a life without direction or meaning. When she finally meets her daughter years later, the thought of taking care of her child is modest; she knows it's her chance to steal her failures, but how can she be honest with her daughter and still get her respect? Gillian Armstrong's film films usually relate to stories about characters who desperately want to communicate with each other but face obstacles that create their personal habits and habits. "Oscar and Lucinda," for example, concerned men and women who desperately needed each other's love but were always vaccinated with a desire for coincidence, represented by their addictions to gambling. Here we are immersed in a family of families torn apart by the fact that the mother is unable to commit herself to steady life and her redemptive efforts, even though she is quite convinced that it is too late to change for the better. It's not just a movie with great performance at its center, but also a rare success: a totally convincing story about redemption.
