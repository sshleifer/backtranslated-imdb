He is trying to be the epic adventure of the century. And with an actor like Sh√¥ Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies, it's really a perfect B-adventure of all time. It's really fun, a crazy adventure that, even if it's a mistake, captures your interest. It must have been the biggest film for the people who did it. Even in the 1990s, he does not have a modern feeling. It has more of the same feeling as the old film Errol Flynn. The big adventure movie is a great thing in Hollywood, but I'm afraid the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies. On the other hand it has a real feeling. You can not hate it. I think it's a good adventure film. And I really love the soundtrack. Damn, I want the song.
