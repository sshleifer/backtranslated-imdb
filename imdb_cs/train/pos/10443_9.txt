Richard Linklater is a beautifully directed mixture of teenage romance and Parisian travel is one of the romantic movies of the 90th best thinkers. Julie Delpy, in one of the ten most popular shows, will become a Parisian girl who spends her day with a foreigner on the train of Ethan Hawke. The dialogue (and its oodle there) is sometimes meandered and extremely precious, but this portrait of two young lovers who have a romantic, intellectual, and spiritual connection is full of wonderfully entertaining, moving and weird moments.
