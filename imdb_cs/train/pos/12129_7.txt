It's a well-written film by John Cromwell, who was not a great director, but who did some fine films including the 1937 version of "The Prsoner Zenda." In London, which was only able to handle Hollywood, atmospheric, but nothing like it, it is a story of obsession and confused love from Somerset Maughan's novel. I was looking forward to seeing it on DVD, as I had never before seen and admired Bette Davis, and wanted to see her in a role she considered one of her early great. So I bought it. Well, she looked good, but I'm sorry that her London accent just laughed at me. Bette Davis was one of the biggest film actors, she made no mistake, but she did it here. It was impossible to take her character seriously. It was not as terrible as Dick Van Dyke's 'Mary Poppins' accent, but close. Leslie Howard was the next major actor, and he did it well. He was a gentle and intelligent actor. Supporting actors have freed themselves. It is worth listening to Mrs Davis's vocal gymnastics.
