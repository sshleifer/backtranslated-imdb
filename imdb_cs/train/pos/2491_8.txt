Budgetary constraints, time constraints, scenario shooting and subsequent cutting, cutting, cutting ... This crew is a group of good young creators; thoughtful in this scenario - yes, allegorical - smart in zero dollar effects, when time and knowledge are all you have, rely on actors and friends, and others for their time, devotion, places; and obtaining the first function in a can, which is a 1-in-1000 thing. These guys are making movies. Good. Take a look at their Heartland Horrors shorts collection and see the development. And I can guarantee that working with them is the most fun thing you do in business. I am confused by the harsh, insulting criticism of this film, and I wonder whether a reviewer even heard a word about dialogue, thinking about one thought or concept, or if all that was required by that work was a visual gore, a ruthless look at what would be horrifying for the audience. Let "Empty Acre" bring yourself. Do not assume what you expect it to be just because of his supernatural assumption that he has come to the horror / thriller genre. It's a dramatic depth beyond what you can pinch the blade to someone with respect to a message that does not interfere with the visual center of your brain, rather it's empathic imagination to experience another suffering of soul and soul. Mark Curling, Curtis, "The Empty Acre"
