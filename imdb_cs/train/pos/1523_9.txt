GBS wrote his own screen adaptation of this Nobel Prize, but lived not to see it (he won the Oscar in 1938 for the great adaptation of his play PYGMALION in 1914). When Otto Preminger shot (produced and directed) that production, seven years after Shaw's death in 1957, he met the British author Graham Greene, who adapted and was a solid choice. Greene uses Epilogue material to create a framework that combines two act acts (one early and one late in Joan's story) into a single and very satisfying whole. Where there is a tranquil tranquility on the stage, it works just as well with returning to the king Charles Balais' bedroom (where the man Joan put on the throne dreaming about the events that led to his current situation), and more material from Shaw's Epilogue - Performance of John Gielguda Warwick (English "King of Manufacture"). Most of the language is a solid GBS, and performances by the stalwart Shauvians (like Felix Aymler's Inquisitor or Harry Andrews' de Stogumber) to the relatives of newcomers (the film based Jean Seberga career) are the first. Anyone familiar with Richard Widmarch's rogue movies can see him playing a fragile and somewhat stupid Dauphin, but the performance - strangely best billed - is professional, though probably mischievous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Go to the expectations of quality entertainment and you will not be disappointed.
