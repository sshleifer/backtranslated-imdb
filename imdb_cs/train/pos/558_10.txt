Classical drama / action western with incredible cinematography that is well ahead of us (1954). The production is very good and you can say that it was done with pride and love. Unique view of NORTHT WEST pioneers in the United States is highly educated and entertaining. This film is very poorly rated because most people do not like seeing the fact that many "scribes" in this particular time and place have been very curvailed / corrupting like most developing countries today. Action sequences could be more realistic, though, but still this film really covers most of the basic information. Not for an audience that just wants pure western-type testoterons for this movie is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy .......
