Victor McLaglen's performance is one of the best in film history. I think we can all feel "Gypo" because we all fought what is right and what is not and was wrong. It was one of the first artworks released by the great American Film Studio (RKO Radio Pictures). The film about Josef H. Augustus is best here. However, the overwhelming part of August was largely overlooked; did not receive an Oscar nomination that he rightly deserved. This is a psychological drama, with thought, philosophy, sadness, all spoken in the smallest words.
