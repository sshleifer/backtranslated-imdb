This was the second item in the regular Columbo series and today it keeps well. As soon as I look at the DVD carefully and see how it is built, I am very impressed by the direction of Bernard L. Kowalski (who has guided the MACHO CALLAHAN fine as well as countless television episodes) - seeing how the post-murderous action of the killer is reflected in the effect of the divided canvas on his two eyepieces, watching how the murder itself is displayed in mounting mode, observing the view from the point of view of the corpse. Also, the wild but impressive avant-garde musical score of the famous jazzman Gil Melle was incredible and helped enough to create an atmosphere. And Brett Halsey's supportive performance as a golf pro was great - such softness and complexity in a role that nine out of ten times will be a one-dimensional cutout. The "Formula" has not yet been set when this episode was shot, so Columbo's methods still have some surprises. Of course, Falk, Robert Culp and Ray Milland are the finest actors and it is a pleasure to see the work - all men are known for many other roles, yet they are lost in their characters. This whole recording of the Columbo series - and many others - is as well created as a very good feature film.
