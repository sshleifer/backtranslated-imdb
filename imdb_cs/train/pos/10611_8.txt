What another reviewer called a lack of character development, I say underestimation. The film did not move one overhead with over-explanation or unnecessary story. Yes, there were a lot of unspeakable stories we just glimpsed, but it was primarily a one-day shot into an event that catalyzed the change in all life. Jindřich Tomáš's performance was really a beautiful study in acting of acting, focusing on reaction rather than action. Good rental.
