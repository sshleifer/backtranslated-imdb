This movie is about two boys who have created a sport in place trying to get 2 to get a hot chick. BASEketball becomes a nationwide sport. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is a beloved captain, but he is hated when he loses the NBA to another rival team. She meets the girl of her dreams, Yasmine Bleeth, and finally kisses. the first time I saw this movie, I drank my pants, it was so funny. must surely see for all comedic fans. If you love South Park, you will love it! Maybe you do not look at the kids, it's a bit unsuitable for little guys. some dudi give her 6 1/2 out of ten, I give it 11 out of ten. I like coop on rocks I have to go bye thanks for reading this
