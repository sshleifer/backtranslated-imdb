Great movie. Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, the songs are amazing, the dances with special mention for "Portobello Ballet" are wonderful. As for the animated section, the match between the animals became an instant classic; the top with the armor attack is cool and fascinating. I recommend seeing a restored version of 134 minutes or at least 112 minutes of video. Here in Italy we have only a 98 minute version, although the movie was introduced in the original edition in the course of 117 minutes. If possible, watch a German videotape: it was generated from a 98-minute run, but it is not always about World War II and about all the scenes between English people and their Nazi invaders!
