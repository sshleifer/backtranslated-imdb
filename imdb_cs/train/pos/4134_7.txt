Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson, and Binnie Barnes star in "The Lady X Divorce," a 1938 comedy based on the play. Olivier plays a young lawyer, Everard Logan, who allows Oberon to spend the night in his hotel room when the London mist is too dense for costume ball guests to come home. The next day his friend, Lord Mere (Richardson), announces that his wife (Barnes) spent the night with another man in the same hotel and wants to divorce her. Trust the woman that Oberon, Mrs. Olivier. Oberon, who is a free and granddaughter of a judge, pretends to be the lady in question, Lady Mere, when it's really Leslie Steele. We have seen this plot or its variations of dozens of times. With this occupation, it's wonderful. I mean, Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon, the great team at Wuthering Heights? Pretty special. Olivier is devastating, handsome and has a great job with a comedy while portraying a nervous, nervous lawyer. Oberon gives her the right light touch. It looks an extremely young, fuller face, eyebrow Jean Harlow, and a very different hairstyle for her. She's wearing some pretty street wear, though her first dress looks like a birthday cake, and she tries to play Snow White in one of her dresses. Binnie Barnes is gorgeous like the real Lady Mere. The color in this is a mess, and as others have mentioned, it could really benefit from a restoration. It is definitely worth seeing.
