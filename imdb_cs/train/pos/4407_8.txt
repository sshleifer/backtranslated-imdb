For those who commented on Patriot as accurate (which basically satanised English), it was interesting to see this movie. It seemed to be the bloodiest war the Americans had ever been involved with, and it was the only nationality. It was therefore very refreshing to see something reminiscent of historical precision coming from this side of the Atlantic, which does not mean that America is either a martyr or a savior. Overall, what brought this film home was the real horror of any conflict and how the acts that were committed in the war were just doing worse acts, often culminating in the suffering of innocents. It was not a movie where you encouraged someone, but everyone was drinking it and they all left.
