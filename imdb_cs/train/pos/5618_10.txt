This is a scary movie. Creepier than any other David Lynch, and it shows what a great director Polanski is because it's not his usual type of work and he's a BRILLIANT. Everything starts with Trelkovski moving to the Paris block. She soon learns that a former tenant, a young woman, has committed suicide and believes that the other residents living there have brought her to her. He is also convinced that he is trying to do the same with him. What is the result of a terrific and terrifying view of paranoia. The entire production is wearing classical horror: from the imagery to the music, the viewer can feel the poor Trlkovsky terror. <br /> <br /> Are they all to kill him? Or maybe just despise him? Is there a difference? Find yourself. 10/10
