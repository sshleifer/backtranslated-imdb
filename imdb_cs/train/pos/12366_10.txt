An amazing film, one of the best horror films of the seventies. It is a realistic setting and atmosphere. As usual, the usual negative comments were inevitable. I have noticed that most of the horror films of a certain period often do not reach enough. Obviously, most horror films are old and must be denigrated, it's like a mental mechanism that reflects on the possibilities of music critics. Before you read the review, you already knew what the final judgment was. In the movie a good gift because 10 is really done. Raines reads very well and the film as the way it was produced reminds me of a lot of Kubrick movies. It's really an impression. Excellent movie really. I consider the film anthology of the '70s.
