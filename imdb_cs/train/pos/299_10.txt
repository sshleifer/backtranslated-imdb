Peter Bogdonavich has created a bunch of really great movies and THEY ALL LAUGHED is one of his best. Cast could not be better equipped to play this light, but slightly bitter comedy. Interestingly, the humorous, light touch of Bogdonavich employs so effortlessly, giving the film a more disarming emotional core. Fresh and instant film begins without an absolute explanation. There is no soundtrack that would keep us. We meet characters in action and as Bogdonavich sinks down the streets of New York, the film unfolds effortlessly. Robby Muller's camera captures everything with a succinct simplicity that seems accidental, but certainly not. The cast is amazing. In any case, classic.
