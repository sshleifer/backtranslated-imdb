This is a complex documentary showing many things about early gay life. To put it, it was when the word Gay was used for homosexual revolution, and not just for gays as a descriptor. Or is it still used today? I believe most of the film comes from 1968 to 1989. It was released in 1993, so it happened. <br /> <br /> I touched the documents that capture the love of one person after another, a period. Love expressed in a way that can only be true love. There are many scenes of incredible empathy and pain, along with scenes of joy and pleasure. There are scenes of life as homosexual and life as homosexual. The film itself was the work of love and I believe it will be a diamond. At least, the film gets an understanding of the devastating impact of AIDS. As I write this, I think this movie looks like I was set up earlier. The advances in medical, political and social sciences and culture since the movie was shot (15 years ago) are amazing. Of course, in the case of AIDS itself, it is not yet done. Damn I do not think we're on all fronts. <br /> <br /> Anyway it's a pretty darn good document. I would like to encourage someone who feels he does not understand homosexual life, homosexuals or AIDS, so he can watch this movie.
