"Panic in the Streets" was a decent thriller, but I felt a little disappointed. The central theme of the city that is attacked by the dead in modern times is fascinating, but the film never explores or develops it. It's fun and fun, but it's not as interesting as it should be. The script for this film is really weak and brings the whole film down. None of the central characters are really convincing or credible. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the movie is very well filmed, so it compensates for poor scripting. Elie Kazan's direction keeps the film exciting and moves at a rapid pace. There are some exceptional sequences, especially the unforgettable peak of the climax. When his direction merged with better scenarios a few years later, one would usually have nothing wrong. Also acting is very good. Richard Widmark was always an observer of the lead man and doing what he can, with a signed figure. Paul Douglas spends his time screaming a little too much, but he does a decent job. Outputs in the cast are two villains. Zero Mostel, known primarily for his comic roles, is really slim as one of the best characters in the cinema. Jack Palance is, no doubt, a cold villain. "Panic in the Streets" is a disappointment, but it's worth watching. (7/10)
