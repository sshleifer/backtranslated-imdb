EDMUND LOWE (which somewhat reminds me of Warren William), leads a nice cast of an interesting little secret that moves at a fast pace and runs only a matter of hours. Douglas Walton plays the unfortunate jockey who seems to be deliberate on his own extinction (hypnotism, anyone?), And the suspects include a good number of supported cast - all of Virginia Bruce, Kent Smith, Frieda Inescourt, Gene Lockhart, Jessie Ralph, Benita Hume, Rosalind Ivan and HB Warner. As an added bonus, Nat Pendleton is a pampering puzzler - and you get a load of decorative decoration for the luxurious interiors of a rich house. It must be a file that has been used in many other movies. On the plus side, the secret is not so complicated that someone can follow the plot with reasonable certainty that he is not too confused. All of a sudden it's clear to Detective Philo Vance - and then he has a final confrontation with the murderer who gives the film a handy five minutes of trouble-free tension. Well done and time is a fun way.
