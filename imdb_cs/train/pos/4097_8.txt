Youth, Sexuality and French Landscape - One of the most unique movies you'll ever see. If you see it, it's not a bad performance when you realize how hard it is to find a copy of it (a combination of scarcity and censorship.) It's sometimes erotic, sometimes disgusting and sometimes funny. Tiny teddy in the middle, but you can not say anything about bizarre movie fans until you've seen it at least once.
