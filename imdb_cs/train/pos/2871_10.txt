Comment? Just like my comment is necessary? We are talking about all kinds of masterpieces, for all years and all generations. These are only the types of films I still have the patience to watch. In this, as in other Disney movies, there is some magic. All the characters are in some way "live" and "real", so it's easy to understand the message even if you do not understand the language (as I did not understand when I first watched the movie because I was about six years old). Maybe my English is not that good, but I learned what I know from most of this kind of movie, and that's one big dimension of this kind of movie that is rare today. But there is one big shame. In my country, it is now impossible to watch this or another Disney movie! We have no copyright, so our children are affected to enjoy and learn from these kinds of films. So, this time, we're looking at the movie "Once for a Dream" or ...?
