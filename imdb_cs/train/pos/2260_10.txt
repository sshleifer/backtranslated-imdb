DAMN GOOD FILM! The one who is seriously underestimated. The songs that the children sung in singing in the film gave me a sense of pain but also their hopes for the future. Whoopi Goldberg gives good performance here, but the best performance in the whole movie is the actress who plays the title character. I wish she was in more movies. This movie should have a higher rating. I give it 10/10.
