The Sabrina Teenage Witch was one of my favorite T.V shows: I looked back every day back to my back when I got home from school. Meanwhile, I think I've been watching each episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect teenage girl / witch with normal teenager problems that we all can concentrate on. It's funny, smart, outgoing, funny and much more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick very well fit this part like Sabina. Zelda, the intelligent scientist, and Hilda crazy, hideous, can make perfect balance in Sabrina. Though I have to agree that years of university studies are not as good as her high school years, but that does not mean they are not good yet. I think the end was amazing, though it was not what I hoped made sense, and I loved him anyway. :)
