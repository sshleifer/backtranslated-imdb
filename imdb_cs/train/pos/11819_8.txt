Just lift it on DVD and watch it again. I love bright colors vs. dark shots. It's not a big fan of Beatty, but it's a great popcorn movie. Pacino is stunning, as always, and well, this film marked the time when Madonna was absolutely the most special. I wish she stayed for a while with "no breathing". Charlie Korsmo has the first big role, other than "What about Bob?". The effects of make-up were the pinnacle and most of them stayed for the most part. Beautiful scenery and mood will take you directly to the comic strip environment. Cars, a wardrobe, a building, and even street lighting are a great sound, not to mention perfect lighting, although scenes with lots of red paint can get an unpleasant feeling because it tends to blur a bit. I just wish Beatty got the chance to continue. Overall, it's fun for a couple of hours.
