This film captured me when he started in a cafe in Arizona and Richard Grieco (Rex), "Dead Easy", "04, decided to have something to eat and gets hot and bothered by a very hot, sexy waitress. "Nancy Allen (Maggie Hewitt), Dressed to Kill," 80, is a television reporter and always looking for a novelty. Maggie closes in the hot tub, and Rex calls her to tell her she wants to get out of the Western style with the local top policeman in town. It's another movie, however Nancy Allen and Richard Grieco are the only two actors to help this image COMPANY!
