First of all, I heard great things about this movie, including the retro / vintage scene and the stocking lovers who absolutely love Betty Page and did not disappoint. Captured in a very pure black and white color with added color for key scenes, the film gives a documentary feeling about Bettie's early life and career. <br /> <br /> There are many things I did not know about the Site. First, the gangs were raped, later on her initial attempts to develop her acting career and then the charming photos, first with a cameraman-packed man who did not get enough, and later with Klawsy, Paula and Irving, who, despite their slavery and Fetishes meet as very friendly and friendly people. If they were such modern pornography producers, maybe better porn would be a consequence! The film does not primarily concern the crime of pornography, but the attempt to show what kind of environment existed in the 1950s for those who produced fetish and naked images of women. This environment was extremely repressive, perhaps good, because it meant that there is no effect of "saturation" we have today in terms of pornography. It seemed to be much less rough. The page comes across someone who enjoys her work and does not seem to make her worse. Many of her photos are tied up and shrouded (and attempted to talk), raising the whip with bloom, and so excite photographers who take pictures and see in "starter-style" girls' slavery films that looked quite tame with hardcore stuff, which we now have. The page never became an actress and instead was abandoned when she was thirties for "Jesus Christ". Her belief in God and Jesus will never disappear, even when bound and anchored, she still insists that God has given Him "a gift" to do "this thing". When I see this movie, I'm more informed about the page and amazed her modesty, conviction and attitude. It's unique, compared to the blondes we have at our disposal today, and someone who can really say, "She lives after porn."
