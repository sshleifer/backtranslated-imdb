This movie is best described or compared to "Big Fish" by Tim Burton. But it's less charming and more facial. And of course this is not the father, but his grandfather who tells stories. The film story also moves back and forth (so the IMDb story can tell you more than you would like to read before watching the movie). It's funny and impressive enough, even if you get from one story to another and you also have dramatic moments. You are also surprised by things you would not expect. A nice little movie that deserves your attention, especially if you love such movies! :O)
