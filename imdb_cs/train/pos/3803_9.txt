What people can not understand about this movie is that it's not the beginning, the middle and the end, it's just the end of a long series of 26 episodes. Do not forget that when you are all talking about how the world has not been sufficiently explored. That was all done on a TV show. <br /> <br /> How great and stunning are the visuals, I think the *** SPOILERS *** argument between Lian-Chu and Gwizdo near the end of the film was what really loved me. Seeing the characters I experienced in 26 episodes, he fought as if it hurt, and seeing Gwizdo sadly crossing the floating ruins while Lian-Chu was shaking his blade, he almost ruptured. <br /> <br /> Then we got a complete contrast with Lian-Chu, who fought the mad dragons (which was previously featured in the series), while Gwizdo is madly and indirectly threatening to kill Zoe. * Shudder * I am surprised that this particular scene was not mentioned in the warnings. Any boy who has a sense of purpose will be able to see that Gwizdo was not alone and was fully willing to strangle the girl. It was pretty bothering me and I'm 15. The world is awesome, the plot is much better than most millionaire burgers and it was a nice way to see some of my favorite characters going. Look at it. :)
