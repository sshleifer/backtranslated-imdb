I've seen Maslin Beach a couple of times - both on free television in Brisbane. I will not go into whether it's good, bad or otherwise, because the others did it well and really covered it. I'll say it's so Australian. Only in Australia can we have a film about relationships between people who spent the whole day as naked as the day they were born and look for free commercial television. I have a friend from the US who is constantly surprised by what we found on a free TV compared to her home country. Sex and CIty and Huff are just examples. Despite the fact that our government is trying to lift us to the US 51st, it is good to know that at least some things really remain Aussie
