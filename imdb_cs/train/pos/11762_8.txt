You've ever performed in your life, set out for sporting activities, tried out the best, and then you've come to an important segment where you've been given a chance to be a hero and a champion for a short while. . . failed? I believe that many of us have had that moment in our lives. This is the premise of "The Best of Times". In this middle-aged story the banker named Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) suffers from the deep melancholy of football mistakes that happened years ago, is inspired to play again the game. . again. To this end, he has to convince one great footballer Rena Hightower (Kurt Russell) to come back. Reno, who is happy with his life in the past, sees that there is no need to change the past record, which is better as it ages. Added to both, their problem is the fact that the years have elapsed and moreover, both of their marriages are floundering and need re-vamping. It's not easy when his father-in-law (Donald Moffat) usually recalls the biggest drop. However, Dundee is persistent and will do anything to try to correct the biggest mistake of his life. Great fun for anyone who wants to enjoy their youth again. ***
