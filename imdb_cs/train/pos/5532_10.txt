Maybe I'm interested in foxes, fox stories and everything, but I thought it was great done. <br /> <br /> I really liked it turned out when Lily was not comfortable, like fire and peace trying to get too spoiled here). I think it's important for children to see and try to understand them. After reading a few more comments, I'm a little confused, it is said that at the end - sleep - the mother and her son appear because she was the one who told her son about her story. The movie I saw at the end did not have a mother or a son, just painting a girl with a fox. Could anyone tell me? Anyway, I really liked this movie, although some scenes may be a bit slow, which can be difficult for high-energy children. Still worth it if they can sit still.
