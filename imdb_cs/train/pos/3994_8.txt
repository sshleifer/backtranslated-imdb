I went to this film just because they dragged me there and I would leave immediately because the audience consisted mostly of older people and I felt out of place. But the film was fascinating and did not focus on old people. The characters were very real and believable, and in a few hours I was debating about film, characters and storyline. There are some quite fascinating scenes out there, but they are essential and will help you understand the situation much better. Overall, this is a great and valuable film - slightly out of the mainstream, but that does not mean that this movie can not be used by people who prefer the mainstream. It's an exciting and exciting film experience.
