If you like CB4, you have no idea what you are missing if you have not seen this movie yet. This movie is crazy, cheerful and contains much more information about the hip hop industry than any other parody film ... It's unfortunate that this movie was not released on DVD because it's one movie I've ever watched loved and wanted a copy. If you really want a good laugh and you like hip hop and you are a bit familiar with some of the artists in an old school, definitley rented this movie. There are not so many places to rent videos that have copies, but if you come across one, you will not be disappointed.
