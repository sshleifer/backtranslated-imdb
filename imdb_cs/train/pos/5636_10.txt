In "Brave New Girl," Holly comes from a small town in Texas, sings "Yellow Rose of Texas" at a local contest and admitted to a prestigious art school in Philadelphia. From there, the film becomes a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I loved this movie. It was full of great singing, acting and characters that kept the movement at a very pleasant pace. The game was, of course, amazing. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun are excellent as well as Nick Roth. Working with the camera was really good and I was very happy with the end (it seems that the sequel might be in the process). Kudos to the director and all others involved in this production. Rather jewel in movies.
