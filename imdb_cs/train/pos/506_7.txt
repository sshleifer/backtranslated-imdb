A strong pilot, this two-hour episode does an excellent job of setting the character and background for "Enterprise", "prequel" of the original "Star Trek" series. Several times they come across the Trek and clich√© conventions - candid colored color cosmetics never look like style and I can already predict silent references to T'pol as "Seven of Vulcan" - but the set looks like strong figures are well-rendered and can already see hints, that this particular crew will have to be much more inventive in different ways than those that were earlier (later?). Scott Bakula will make a good remark as a captain with Kirke's harshness and boldness, but without his sadness and kindness, and I look forward to the way the series will include an engineer, a master of weapons and a communication officer (not just a celebrated telephone operator!)! . It seems that writers have taken one big mistake in Star Trek: New Generation, Deep Space 9 and Voyager: Instead of starting with a large file cast and giving short shrift characters, a smaller core of characters begins with later a little more variety is added - which I hope will happen, because after half a dozen episodes, more varieties will be needed.
