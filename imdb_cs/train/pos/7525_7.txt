Bettie Page was an icon depressed in the 1950s when it represented sexual freedom, which was ten years away, but high in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young adults. Gretchen Mol makes an excellent job of portraying the scandalous Bettie, a small urban girl with acting ambitions and a great body. Her acting career did not go anywhere but her body brought her to the top of the glory on a certain edge of the field. Black and white photographed with colorful interludes when it came out of the world of exploitation in New York, these films made for television movie (HBO) have good production values ​​and very credible support. The problem is that she is emotionally rather flat. It's hard to create attachment to the character because Bettie is portrayed as someone quite shallow and naive about the business they are in. A separate government investigation takes a lot of time on the screen, which slows the film towards the end. But it is definitely worth watching the history of time and seeing the cumbersome government repression that was characteristic of the fifties. 7/10
