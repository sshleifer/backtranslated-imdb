Do not forget the story and enjoy Fred Astaira, who makes Foggy Day and several other dances, a duo with an unfortunate Joan Fontaine. Here we see that Astaire does what are basically "scenic" dances in a cleaner form than in Ginger Rogers movies, and before learning to fully exploit the potential of the film. Best of all: the fact that we see Burns and Allen before their comedic career in radio and television husband and wife makes the kind of dances they had to do in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in their paramount college films from the 1930s. (George was once a tank instructor). Their two numbers with Fred are the high points of the movie and it's worth waiting. The first trio soft shoe is warming up to the exciting carnival number "Chin up", in which three of them sing and dance through rides and other attractions. It almost seems spontaneous. Fan Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find it worth a "suspicion". I've seen this 4 or 5 times and helped you find a quick button forward.
