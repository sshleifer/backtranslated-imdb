I just want all the fans of this document to know that Martin Torgoff is my uncle and I'm so proud of him. This mini-series, which turned out to be VH1, is a great view of the drug culture in the last 30 years, and my uncle worked very hard on it. The amount of time and effort I've been watching in this document, and the book that started it all (Can not find a way home) is much better when I watch it on TV. I know she loves what she does, and she does it well. His eloquence is reflected in the interviews he himself did, and the amazing additions he himself adds to this commentary. From music to video and everything in between, it is a great document that truly shows the experience of drug culture through the eyes of someone who has experienced it. I appreciate any comments from those who enjoyed it (or not) and would like to hear fans! Three Wishes to Uncle Martin !!!
