I'm a huge fan of John Denver. I have a great collection of my vinyl music. I saw this Christmas specialty when he was originally on TV and he loved it. I have my original vinyl album and CD. I have my original CD and later release. Later, some songs are missing. I see it was released this year with all the original songs. To my surprise, I found the original CD for sale for $ 75. WOW - to think Christmas Cd would cost a lot. For me, they do not want the treasure to sell. It's my favorite Christmas CD. I could never find it on VHS or DVD. I'd like to have one version. If anyone is available, let me know. Thanks
