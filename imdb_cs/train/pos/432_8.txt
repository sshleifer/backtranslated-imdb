I watched it just because I played Josie Lawrence, whom I knew from Whose Line, in any case, a mad British improvisation comedy show. I was very pleasantly surprised by this hearty and magical dear. It is uplifting, touching and romantic without being sentimental or sentimental. The characters are <br /> <br /> all real people, with real weaknesses, worries and needs. Look at that!
