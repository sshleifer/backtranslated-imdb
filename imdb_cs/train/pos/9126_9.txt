This film is excellent and scored great. Prince's Oscar for music was richly deserved (many people do not know he won one). I think it's one of the best movies to learn as a couple later that night. Big surprise: Prince is doing a great job and he's pretty good when he transfers the pain to the camera. Morris Day, Wendy and Lisa are good at supporting roles. Very cool guideline.
