I think this is a great example of the differences between the two cultures. It would be a great film that would appear in the sociology class. I thought it was quite funny and I must say that I'm scared to "leave the band together and do the job." It seems that most people do not realize that this film is not just a comedy. It also has several dramatic elements and I think it suits it. Overall, I give it 8.
