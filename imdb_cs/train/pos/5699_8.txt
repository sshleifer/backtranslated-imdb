One of the most disturbing and tragic periods in American history has begun. Members of the Summer of Love Culture, at the end of the seventies and early eighties, were eventually a tool for old puppet beads and all night parties and evolved back into the mainstream of life, whatever that means. For those who could not grow up their juvenile and sometimes irrational swelling, it was their wondrous culture. The love of drugs and the sense of authority associated with a dislike of authority, values ​​and "founding" is the world that captures the film. <br /> <br /> The 1960s were a period of revolution and violent change that ripped the American "house". Once the battle is over, we all have to deal with the consequences of the massacre. The characters in the Miracle House are the icons of the disappointing 1970s; part biker, part hippie, part cheater, all disabled. No ideology to express, just a feeling of dissatisfaction with everything and loyalty to nothing. Ron, Billy and David behave like some Robin Hoods with drugs. They talk about love and behave violently; they shall take from the rich, and shall sell the miserable; they steal from everyone. <br /> <br /> Holmes and the company are the ultimate result of strange crashes of anti-affairs like sex, drugs and rock & roll when lab technicians are bored and go on. <br /> <br /> The film is skillfully directed and traced and captures the frenetic world of drug fans in their element. The fact that Holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant. The story was narrated in Boogie Nights. This is the story of a transient and forgotten era.
