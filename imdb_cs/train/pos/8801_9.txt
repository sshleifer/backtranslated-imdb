This is the biggest film I've seen in 2002, while I'm used to using movies. She is rich and makes a beautiful artistic act from these 11 short films. From technical information (selected directors) I was afraid to have a pro-American basis, but ... it's kind of (11 times) personal tributes. The weakest point comes from Y Chahine: he can not "swallow his pride" and considers this event a deserved punishment ... It is really the weakest part of the film, but it testifies to the real freedom of expression of the whole work. The oddest comes from a Mexican almost conceptual artistic film ... I'm still not sure what A. Gonzalez Inarritu had. Another 9 is perfect (K. Loach, S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf, ...) or almost perfect (C. Lelouch) and made me either a smile or cry, or even let me get stunned. I still do not know if S. Imamura's fable is actually related or not to the catastrophe on September 11, but she is so pretty that her finals instead of deeply "doing" it.
