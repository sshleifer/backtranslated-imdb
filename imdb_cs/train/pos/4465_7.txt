ANCHORS AWEIGH is a fun MGM musical that enjoys fans of the genre, but I would not rate it with a classic such as SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BAND WAGON. This was the first of three musicals that appeared together in Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Kelly and Sinatra starring Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, two sailors in Hollywood, who meet a young boy (Dean Stockwell) with a young aunt (Kathryn Grayson) fighting an actress who works as an extra on MGM. Although both boys are initially attracted to Grayson, she ultimately votes Joe, but Clarence later joins the waitress (Pamela Britton) who teaches them from his hometown of Brooklyn. Deep paper leaves room for some great musical numbers, including "We Hate To Leave", Joe and Clarence are lamenting their colleagues on sailors as they leave the ship. Grayson's cruel rendition of "Jalousie"; Sinatra is a dreamlike rendition of "I Love Too Easy" (a number that is sadly removed from some of the prints of this film), and "The Worry Song," a fantastic dance that Kelly does with animated Jerry's mice from Tom and Jerry's glory. Kelly also makes a kind of fantastic Ballet Kissing Bandit, which competes with his pirate ballet in later PIRATE. Kelly is in top form, in a robust and energetic performance that brought him his only Oscar nomination for Best Actor, and Sinatra is an extremely shy figure here undoubtedly sexy. A fun turn for fans of the MGM music factory.
