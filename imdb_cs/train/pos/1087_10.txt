There is so much to love in this love little comedy. Anyone who ever built or bought a house, or even just was not enough space, finds it more than a grain of truth in a situation where Mr. Blanding was in a monster. Melvyn Douglas, with a great comic flare, and acting as a Blandings attorney and a voice of reason. And well, Myrna Loy is in her best condition as a rather fragmented but extremely patient woman. But the best performance is Grant. He is an American man, especially important at the time of the release of this film, when the nation, after the end of the war, was in the forefront of lack of housing. Topics are universal, lack of money, fear of work, fear of infidelity. Make sure it is amazingly packed, but you have to remember that it was a time when the world just recovered from the terrible war and wanted a happy ending. Today it is relevant and I have to portray the poor reviews I see in my current preference for gross comedies. The appearance of the film is neat and some great comedies are good, especially towards the beginning. While it may have lost some social significance, it is still a jewel almost sixty years after his release.
