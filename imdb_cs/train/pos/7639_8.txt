It's not a big movie. The game is not amazing (some sub-charters are even playing badly), the movie is not beautiful in any sense. Nothing really inventive or new. If you like great movies, this is not for you. but it has a great - a really big story. Larry's story works because we know this story from our own lives. A girl we did not ask for a date, a test we did not succeed, the friend we released was in our history. This movie works because it touches it, it's a great story because it's small. It is a life we ​​all have, regretting that we all have, and yet the message will hit: every life we ​​could live would have their disadvantage. The first time I watched, I was 15. He was shown at a party at his school. 16 years later, it still reflects on her, and every time I see it, I smile on my face. Bach. It'll be fine. You will be happy with what you have.
