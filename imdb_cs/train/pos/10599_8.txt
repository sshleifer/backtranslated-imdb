SPOILS Many different comedic series today experimented with the idea of ​​obscure independence at one moment or the other. In the early episode of the "Family Guy" cartoon, the Griffin family finds their home is an independent nation of the United States, and the story goes from there. Back in 1949, however, Ealing Studios produced a wonderful little film alongside the same idea. <br /> <br /> After children's jokes, the inhabitants of Pimlico will discover little treasure in the treasure. In the investigation, it is clear that the small area is a small starting point for the long lost state of Burgundy. Starting from London and the rest of the UK, small street residents experience joy and trouble with an independent state. <br /> <br /> Based on the time the raid was still in use, this story is brilliantly and equally inspiring. The performance will be presented by Stanley Holloway, Betty Warren, Philip Stainton and young Charles Hawtrey, the film is well stocked by some of the best actors of their generation. These actors are also well-aided by a great little script with a few cracks. The feeling of respect, despite being more than 50 years old, the story never feels uncomfortable and constantly avoids viewers. Ealing Studios was one of the best exporters of British film ever. With movies such as "Pas na Pimlico" it's not hard to understand why. Fun from start to finish, the story is always fun and always worth the attention.
