"The cinema is dead, the cinema lives long!" said Peter Greenaway, one of the most modern and most productive contemporary directors, at last year's Anonimul Romanian Film Festival, which was in the third year and takes place in the Danube Delta. This year, Jafara Panahi won the offside prize. I saw this evening in Bucharest on the retrospective of the festival. The cinema is dead but still alive. Panahi's film, in a way, tells how Iranian society looks. The digitally shot offside movie is a story inspired by a real event that has become Panahi's daughter: the problems and risk occurred when he decided to take part in a football match. It is forbidden in Iran, as we are informed. What Panahi can do is provide just a small amount of money, but probably a lot of work, intelligence and humor, cultural models in society that give women a clear level. The absurdity of laws becomes comical. The film has a happy end because the Iranian team is going to the world cup. I most appreciated the concept, the idea of ​​this film. I would be very happy to see other panahi movies that were forbidden even in Iran. I think he can be considered an activist of the director.
