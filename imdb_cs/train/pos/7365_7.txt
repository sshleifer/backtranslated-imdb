I found it very moving when Spike and Heaton stay together for the whole movie without saying that there are not a few eyes on the way. I thought the persecution was postponed. I think the relationship between the two is the forefront. I've already realized that Heaton has such gay intentions. My favorite scene must be a bit where Heaton and Spike are stuck in the swamps and Spike is running. Generally, I thought Spike would not return. I have to say that if it were not our teacher of the movie that would be watching us, I would probably never have seen it. Overall, I thought this movie was pretty good and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of British movies.
