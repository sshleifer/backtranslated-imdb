Forget about the depth of meaning, leave your logic at the door and great with this manic-witty, utterly absurd, ultra-campaign "live" event. MYSTERY MEN is the broadcast of every superhero you've ever seen, but its unlikely superwannabe are so interesting, varied and great that they are unforgettable characters in themselves. Dark humor, utter stupidity, bona fide action, and even touching moment or two, combine to make this comic fantasy of loving losers a true winner. The comedy talents of actors who play Mystery Men - including one Mystery Woman - are the perfect foil for Wes Studios as what can be described as the bargaining basement of Yoda and Geoffrey Rush as one of the most off- (and bizarre) ghastly villains who have ever left from dark comic pages and on big screen. Prepare for laughter, encourage and say "yeah?" more than once ... enjoy yourself!
