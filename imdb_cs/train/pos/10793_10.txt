There are several spoilers in this comment! <br /> <br /> Unlike the comments I've just read nativetex4u and a few others, I really liked the movie and would like to see it as a weekly series. /> <br /> I'm a fan of Judson Mills, but also a huge fan of Chuck Norris, and yet I admit that some of the action scenes may slightly stretch the line, the story fit right with the other weekly series they are currently being broadcast. <br /> <br /> The opening for fifteen minutes, when Deke ran from bad boys after throwing out their rockets, was very actionable. I do not think so many "professionals" were not able to hit the target, but the action was definitely there and Deke, though hero, had to survive. Regarding the comment on the need to "get the film into a can to fill the time-out after the play-off." This film was not originally scheduled by CBS because this year's broadcast and filming was completed in May 2001, which is good 4 months before the terrorist attacks on the US <br /> <br /> If the author pointed to the film instead of giving him it tried to avoid it, maybe they would realize the story of the story: Rashid, the character of Bin Laden, had plans to launch a nuclear facility in the US. The President's person was called to find and eliminate the problem. Perhaps the writer should actually see the movie before attempting to comment.
