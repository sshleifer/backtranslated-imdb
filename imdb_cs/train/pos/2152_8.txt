There were some great moments of reality that portray modern life (not only in Japan, but everywhere). It shows how suppressing culture can be and wants to come out of the form it has created for it. Dance was just a means of saying, "do what you love, even if it's against the norm." You rather Billy Elliot, as I would say. I also liked the movie. <br /> <br /> Humor was well-timed and touching moments were so real that you felt an inconvenience between Sugiyama and his wife, tantrums in the dance hall. I loved Aoki-he and the wig, and his excitement on the dance floor simply screamed! Actors all did a great job, the story was well written. I watched her a second time and captured some of the little nuances I missed during the first tour. Good entertainment!
