Even though Stardust seems to be a fantasy film with predictable ending and average performance, it's definitely not the case. When I saw the movie, I knew it would be one of my favorite films. And I was right. <br /> <br /> Stardust is more of a fairy tale than an adventure film. It has this magical "aura" from the beginning to the end of the film. The story is well written and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Like any story, it has some morality. That is why we know in our hearts that the evil brothers will not take the throne but an innocent boy who can overcome every obstacle and difficulty they face during their journey. We also know that true love is Yvaine and not Victoria, a material girl who is shallow and manipulative. <br /> <br /> I have to add more credits to Claire Danes. It literally shines in this movie. Her eyes have this spark that fits perfectly into her character. Besides, he and Cox have a chemistry that makes romance in the movie even more remarkable. The rest of the cast are well-known actors and actresses who of course make Stardust an interesting and "highly classic" movie. Overall, the film is fantastic, places magical and storyline interesting. was very disappointed that the film was not nominated for more prizes. I have to give at least 9/10 stars.
