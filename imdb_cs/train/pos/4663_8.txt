I saw the film's description on TCM and I let it run just because I like both Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, so I was surprised to find out that I really liked the film and found it totally exceptional. Of course, it's really dated, but as part of the season, it's worth watching just gentle humor in looking at life and lifestyle almost forty years ago. Now, the only problem is trying to find it on DVD so I can watch it more often. I was also quite impressed with the performances of Smith and Ustin as lead, and with Karel Malden, Bob Newhart, and Robert Morley and Cesar Romero's acting performances.
