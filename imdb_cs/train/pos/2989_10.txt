First of all, I'd like to say what I'm a big fan of Bette Midler. Stella is a very good film with a wonderful cast (Bette Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alvarado, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason). This is one of my favorite films of all time. She is a mother who in her own way raises a child, goes through a lot of things beyond her to make her daughter Jenny, which Trini Alvarado played brilliantly. This movie is very good and I suggest that you pick a copy to watch it. Roger Ebert gave 3 1/2 stars! And it deserved 4! GREAT! I give it 4 out of 4!
