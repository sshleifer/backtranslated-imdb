So far I have not read Kurt Vonnegut's book from which it has adapted, but I will get acquainted with one of his other works and I wonder how it will be translated on the screen. Overall, I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonnegut's novels. This is the story of an American living in Germany who is accepted as an American spy. His job is to seize the high-ranking Nazis and send secret messages to American weekly radio programs. But when the war is over, he is convicted as a war criminal but escapes to New York where a different strange conspiracy is waiting. If a mother's night has a problem, it's that she tends to get a little too sentimental times. But for most of the film schmaltz is kept to a minimum and a very strange plot is carried by skill and aplomb. And there are some wonderful moments of black comedy involving three right-wing Christian fundamentalists and highly rated Nazis in the prison cell. We highly recommend.
