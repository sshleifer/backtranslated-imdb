I'm not a very good writer, so I'll keep it short. The World in War is the best document of the Second World War I've seen. I have seen various documents of the Second World War (not only English / North American) and it seems to me that this document is the most complete document of the Second World War I have seen. I think he could talk a little more about the Great Depression and why Hitler came to power but works very well to cover the war. It appears to be complete and objective / fair for all. It does not exclude or diminish the role of different nations. It has lots of original shots, including color shots and many eyewitnesses (it was made in the 70's when it was much more alive). He has great music and narrators. All-in-All I gave this 10/10 because it's so good. (I did not see a special version on DVD so I can not comment you)
