I always enjoyed watching this when he appeared on television every year in the 1960s. It's a typical Hollywood historical epic, dramatized, stylized, and full of inaccuracies, but what it is is a fun movie and good-looking movie. Cecil B. DeMille at the end of his life is executive producer of this remake of the 1938 film. His enhanced actor, Anthony Quinn, who supported the '38 Beluche ', is director of his debut and laurel song because he never it will never be. DeMille has assembled a crew that recently worked on her 10 commandments and helped pull Quinn, including a long-time DeMille collaborator / actor Henry Wilcoxon who oversaw the project. Of the Ten Commandments, directors Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, costume designers Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph, writer Jesse Lasky, cameraman Loyalk Griggs, assistant director Francis Day, director Arthur Rosson, directors Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira. Lester, who as a costume design team received a nomination for Oscar Buccaneer. A great actress from DeMille, led by Yul Brynner as pirate Jean Lafitte and Charleton Heston as future president General Andrew Jackson. Also in the cast are Charles Boyer, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom, and Inger Stevens. In just two hours, it stretches in some places, but it compensates for some of the great combat scenes. I give him 7.5 out of 10.
