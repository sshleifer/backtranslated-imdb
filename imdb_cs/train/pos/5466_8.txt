An outstanding, pre-eminent amoral story with Barbara Stanwyck as a new inspiration (Nietzsche!), Which expelled her sensitivity and exploited, used the man for her sake. The German philosopher is not really fair, but interestingly Hitler came to power this year. Stanwyck, even in this young version, does not do much for me, but she certainly performs well, sometimes to drive herself and the film ahead. It was not such a meat on the display as it could be expected, but a lot of risky situations and amazing shouts and cues. Great entertainment, if not especially attractive presentation of men, and in fact I do not think of an attractive view of a golden soccer woman. Yet it is life!
