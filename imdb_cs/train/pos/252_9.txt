The performances were excellent, the costumes gave a unique feeling for this period and were a Victorian living historian, I was amazed by the accuracy of the weapon and attention to detail. I do not think you need some knowledge of Kelly's saga to stay with the flow of this movie, but by understanding the events and attitudes of time you will need some basic historical knowledge. Do not wait for some rather stupid people to do, some of the characters that have the Auzzie accent, as we know it, were at that time a country at the time of childhood. some elements of fiction, but these are necessary for wider watching of the movie. Gregor Jordan said in an extra feature on the DVD that he wants his movie "to be interested", and that's exactly what happened to me, so this movie gets thumbs up. you will not regret
