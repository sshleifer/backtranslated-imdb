Since I saw this movie when it came out in 1981, it was one of my best favorites. Blurb I wrote for Amazon is down and I'm just thrilled that it will finally appear on DVD on 10/17/06 - 25th anniversary of the movie. The last credit in this movie explains his appeal - "Thank you to the people in Manhattan on whose island it was filmed." A charming and humorous romantic comedy, a love story written for New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is a native) who can identify each locality (West 12th Street, Ansonia, the old FAO Schwartz, Plaza, Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits, and Western Club). One has the impression that the entire cast has knocked out of the screen like him, and this intimacy is clearly communicated. I laughed, I cried, it was better than CATS. She was not only a widow to Dorothy Stratten, it was Audrey Hepburn's latest performance (she had a girl after this movie), and her inner beauty came out of the screen. Buy yourself, prepare a big popcorn bath and turn around with someone you love.
