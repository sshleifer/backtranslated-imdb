This is a wonderful movie in many ways. Everyone in my family enjoyed it. The animation is excellent and easily demonstrates that there are many producers who make films that are as visually as great as something that comes from Disney's studio. One difference from the usual Disney fare is that this Dreamworks movie is not a crazy kick for comic relief. And there are no sudden moments when the characters break into the song. I'm sure the scene at the beginning of the movie would not appear in Disney's illustration: the birth of the Spirit. But it is done tastefully and is not offensive at all. The "spirit" was a great breath of fresh air. Do not get me wrong. I have loved Disney for years and will continue to do so. <br /> <br /> "Spirit" is another example of a great animated ride. When it was over, my children wanted to look again. I had the same feeling. I strongly recommend.
