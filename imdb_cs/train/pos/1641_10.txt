I saw it 25 years ago at PBS. It was very difficult to watch. So real. Watching this small family fight in the winter was a leaking heart. There is no time for courting: fate puts us together and we put our shoulders in the sandstone and we do it. This was based on the current diary of a woman I read many years later. She said in her diary that her parents died when she was young, and all their troubles and sisters had to work on a farm to feed. She learned to go mowing, which was not a lady. She was afraid that no charming prince would want a woman with sunny, dank hands, but this husband was so happy that his new wife knew how they were chopping and she was happy. Both were widows and worked together to build a new home. It was so, so sad when the child died. Of course, if they had it today, I'm sure it would be okay. It just makes the tragedy extra sad. I cried so hard. But then they went out and successfully pulled out a new calf. Spring is on its way and life continues. She had two more boys in her diary and lived.
