This movie was a fantastic comedy. It was a lot of comics like Akshay Kumar, Rajpal Yadav, Paresh Raval and John Abraham. Rimi Sen was good at playing Akshay Kumars' wife and so were all hostesses. Mr. Hot as Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Mr. Cool as Sam (John Abraham) are two fashion photographers who like the same girl Maggie (Neha Dupia). When John Abraham cheats his work, Akshay Kumars becomes a senior, and Akshay Kumar is really jealous, because his apartment must be given to John Abraham and Neha Dupia is beginning to like John more. Akshay Kumar wants to be better than John Abraham, so he finds an apartment and sets out with three different girls (Nitu Chandra, Nargis Bagheri, Daisy Boppana).
