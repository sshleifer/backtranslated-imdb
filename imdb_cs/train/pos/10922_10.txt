When I was very young, on a local TV station, they would show kung fu movies of all kinds on Saturday. I've seen a lot of kung fu movies at the weekend. I remember a lot of them. I've seen great moves like Crippled Masters, Blind Fist Bruce, Kung Fu Zombie, Shaolin Drunken Monk, Rage of the Master, Tattoe Dragon and ... Five Deadly Venoms. I remember the day clearly. We and my dad just got lunch at Burger King. check out what movie it would be on Saturday. We ran in the house and jumped to the couch, turned on the set and dug at 56. The usual introduction of many movie clips in kungfu in the background with Kung Fu words on Saturday. Then he was the title of the film. He said five deadly venoms. Then the film started. A bit of my burger amused with a pre-credit sequence. I loved this movie the moment it came. My favorite figure was Ropucha Venom. This story was hard to follow at this age, but it was not what attracted me ... it was a fight. The fight was so ... amazin g. I groaned every time the ad came and soon 2 hours of the best movie I've ever seen finished.
