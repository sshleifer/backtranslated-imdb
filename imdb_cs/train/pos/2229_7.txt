I read a few scary things about this movie so I was ready for the worst. "Foggy, structured." While some of these accusations may be worthwhile, this movie was not as bad as your average DVD programmer. In fact, it actually had aspirations. She tried something beyond the typical immortal nonsense. And God, there are several interesting things going on. <br /> <br /> Barbeau is a miracle I see. She is carrying the film right on her shoulders. <br /> <br /> This does not mean it's a masterpiece. UNHOLY will eventually collapse under the weight of his own ambitions. There are too many (unexplained) subplots that try to work together. And the story plot created by travel in time is never really busy. For example, if Hope knows her mother is evil and eventually kills her brother, why does not Ma kill the first sequence in the movie? Looks like it's out of your way out of the way to do it. Nevertheless, I give UNHOL points for having tried it. Little ambition is not a bad thing.
