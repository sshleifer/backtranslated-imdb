Another comment on this movie made it sound bad. Because the talking pictures were so new - I think the script and the acting are good. Davis was so young and fresh. She has not yet found her own style that we expected. Yet it is great to see it this way - the craft is still learning. <br /> <br /> Such a lot of clich√© came from this film and it seems that this film has fired some trails for the next 70 years. My voice is visible and remember how young this type of film was. Keep and open your mind and you may be shocked at how you were concerned about this figure because you are 1934 and how we perceive the beginning of the last century as clumsy .. I love it and I hope you will think of your own idea that it will not be influenced by other negative and one comment.
