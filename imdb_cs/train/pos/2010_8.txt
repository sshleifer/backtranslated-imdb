I thought this movie was pretty good. Some parts were cruel, but it is understandable because it was done more than 55 years ago. I thought the best performance in the movie was given to Michele Morgan, who played Millie convincingly. Jack Haley is also really good as Mike O'Brien. Although I'm not a big fan of Frank Sinatra, I think he was very good in this movie. If you have a craving for stupidity, the movie is higher and higher than the top of a musical comedy. <br /> <br />
