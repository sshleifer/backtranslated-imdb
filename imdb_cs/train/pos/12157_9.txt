1930s. Elegant, elegant Adele (awesome with Debbie Reynolds's dignified dedication) and annoyed, embarrassed Helen (the magnificent Shelley Winters, who is full of affection with the usual histrionic man) are mothers of two killers. They leave their sparkling pasts in Midwest behind and move to Hollywood to set up their own dance school for aspirants of old children. Adele begins dating a love millionaire Lincoln Palmer (always fine Dennis Weaver). On the other hand, the religious fanatic Helen soon falls into despair and madness. Director of Curtis ("Night Tide," "Ruby") Harrington works from the Scandinavian screenplay Henry Farrell (who wrote the book "What Happened to a Child Jane?" It was based and written "Hush ... Hush, Sweet Charlotte" really creates a comprehensive and convincing psychological horror thriller about guilt, fear, repression, and religious fervor, amok. The super theater has a full-featured ball: Michael MacLiammoir as a pompous teacher of teaching, Agnes Moorehead as a rigorous radio evangelist for fire and sulfur, Yvette Vickers as the ugly and overwhelming mother of the fraternal childhood star Logan Ramsey as a snoopy detective and Timothy Carey as a haunted bum. The developed talent recital set a piece with Pamelyn Ferdin (Lucy's voice in "peanut" TV cartoon specialty) serving as emcee and the original "Friday 13th" victim Robbi Morgan doing badly bawdy dead on Mae's western impression qualifies as definitive highlight. Davis Raskin's spooky score, a fantastic scene with Reynolds, which represents an incredible tango in a cozy restaurant, the delicious atmosphere of the depression, the fine cinematography of Lucien Ballard, and the awesome macabre ending are all just as great and effective money. MGM presents this amazing gem on a clever two-volume DVD with the inscription "Whoever burned aunt Auntie Roo?" both shots are presented in sharp widescreen transmission along with their theatrical trailers.
