This short subject, Joe McDoakes, was obviously inspired by Warner Brothers star, "Thank Your Lucky Stars," one of those star-wielding star wars. In that one Eddie Cantor played himself and was a comedian who wanted to penetrate films except for his similarity to Cantor. George O'Hanlon, who played McDoakes shorts, is alone and McDoakes, who is trying to get a break in the movie. Like Thanking My Happy Stars, several Warner Brothers players conclude a contract with players with a free moment passing through this movie. O'Hanlon was sent to a central actor for a small role in the First World War, but McDoakes looks like a message. Poor is so nervous at his great moment, he begins to think about ways to deliver his only line. Maybe it sounds like a real movie star to help. 86 later shows the excitement of director Ralph Sanford and patient Clyde Cook, who plays the British soldier as Cockney. McDoakes. It is worth seeing this very entertaining short subject that was nominated for the Oscar to see what happens to O'Hanlon / McDoakes. Both.
