*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Released in 1956, and at that time considered quite irrational, Douglas Sirk is still a great thing over the tip of the candy melody. It seems to be a family rich in oil, Texas's dysfunctional family, which includes a big brother Kyle, who is insecure, weak, wounded, and very alcoholic, who plays Robert Stack in a very moving and vulgar performance, and his sister Marylee played in an extreme way Dorothy Malone. The performance of Mrs. Malone is sent to us through the eyes she uses to show us her emotions, which mostly consist of desire (for Rock Hudson) and jealousy (Lauren Bacall). Malone is the only actress I've ever seen in movies that come into my eyes first. Do not let me down, its performance is at least an absolute horn, and it's one of the highest candidates in the 1950s. But it is also terrible, because as sweet and attractive as Malone, she is not a very good actress and she is not capable of being gentle or shadowy. Her performance is one note. Mambo is doing a bad Mambo and in a great set, like always a good guy Robert Keith who plays on the stairs, Sirk mixes with the almost crazy Malone, who gets dressed. Stack (who was to win the Oscar) and Malone (who won the prize, but should not) were the real stars of the film, those who set up all the hysteria, both sexual and otherwise. The "true stars" of the film, Hudson & Bacall, will turn gray and brown, which are predominantly costumes. Hudson, who was a better actor then married for playing childhood, and best friend Stack is and stalked loves interest in Malone, who through most of the movie happens and moans over Rock. But Hudson does not want any part of it, and instead is in love with Bacall, who is married to Stack. No one is very happy and no one is happy for a long time. Stack-Bacall marriage is breaking down over the seasons long, and Stack is largely into oblivion because he thinks he's sterile and can not give Bacala a child to prove he's a man. Sirk, who was a very intelligent man and had a long and fascinating career in films and theaters in Germany, ended his Hollywood career at Universal in the mid-1950s with a series of intense vivid color "female films" or melodramas. Although they were predominantly adapted from a medical or source material trace, they became masterpieces of the genre in Sirma's hands. Sirk had a wonderful sense of color and design that he brought in these films and filled his wide screen of characters with characters who played their emotional lives between strange color combinations and lighting, aware of shadows and lots of mirroring reflections. In the "Written", characters are always peeking out of the windows, listening to the door or getting involved. So in the end, after a lot of violence, accidental murder, abortion, and another Sirk, the film ends with the final and surprising scene of "reborn" and reformed Malone in a suit for a man sitting at a table that found a miniature oil bottle.
