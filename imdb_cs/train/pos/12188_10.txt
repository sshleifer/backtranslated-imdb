Pure Orson Welles genius is one of the greatest movies. Welles is thrown into a murderous conspiracy, only to be set up as a guy, which is what he is referring to, the sarcastic commentary, "the big dummy I am." The story is so complicated that I still do not know if the victim knew that his life was to be lost. The shooting scene in the Carnival Hall of Mirrors is one of the most amazing films ever made. Only the scene is worth accepting. This is the only time when Rita Hayworth sometimes played a complicated but believable temper. Nobody other than Welles would have the nerves to cut her hair and turn them into a brass blonde. No one should miss this picture.
