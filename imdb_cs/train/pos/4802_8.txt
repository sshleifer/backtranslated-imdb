I just saw this episode tonight on a recently added presentation of one of our local independent channels, which now presents two episodes every day. As the gentleman opposed in the second, I agree that maybe it was not one of the best programs in the series, but I still find it fun. My dad was a friend of one of the directors (in my hometown of Cincinnati) because of whom young Rod Serling worked in the media - and I remember how Dad was telling how talented and creative he was there. Overall, the "Twilight Zone" is definitely one of the true classics on TV, and due to its production during the Cold War, it provides not only a look at this era in the country but also today (today) a nostalgic image of technology, creative views and actors of this time decades. <br /> <br /> * A small "spoiler". <br /> <br /> This particular story describes, just like other presentations in this series and elsewhere, a story in which the neighborhood has to provide a "surprise" that ends. Sometimes there are characters on earth, elsewhere, while the story first indicates that at least one is "earthly". These usually included a message (as here) about the situation caused by the crash of the day, which in the time of this Cold War was eventually supercharged. <br /> <br /> Today's stories like this provide a nostalgic look in this world view 4-5 decades ago, yet they provide some food for reflection. - just like this episode. <br /> <br /> While the dialogue did not have to stretch significant talents, it still represents a simple, important message and useful 20-minute entertainment and interest.
