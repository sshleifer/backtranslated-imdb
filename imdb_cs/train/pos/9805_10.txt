Fans of the capital rejoice! This first season of this series is now available on the DVD and I recently got my copy! Although there are different moments in the first and second seasons in the Cubist Business Journal "CAPITAL CITY", each member of the team plays a significant role in a particular central or peripheral line. The group of employees of the principal merchant Wendy Foley (played by Joanna Phillips-Lane) is balanced with its own different ways, interests and personalities, for most people, a seemingly sterile subject of financial trading that adequately deals with the cast occupation performance. In fact, this seemingly dynamic young employee team is in direct contrast to the relatively old and old manager Shane Longman, representing Lee Wolf (Richard Le Parmentier) and James Farrell (Denys Hawthorne). I suspect that such an unconventional way of working as a Wendy team's employee would not become a reality if Peter Longman had inherited his thirty percent share in society from his father for a young, brave "free spirit" and allowed a more fashionable, relaxed, modern way of doing business to become a reality . To some extent, Wendy's direct superior, Leonard Ansen (John Bowe) watches in the traditional way of managing the company, but he likes Wendy to see that in most occasions he has a "middle ground". It seems to me that the main interest in the series is based on the lively romantic attraction between Declan Douglas Hodge and the cold, confident blonde German businessman Michelle Hauptmann (played by Trevyn McDowell), where the audience was constantly wondering if the situation between the two colleagues would evolve as close friendship / love they have no doubt. <br /> <br /> We are looking forward to this title and hope the second season of thirteen will not be too far!
