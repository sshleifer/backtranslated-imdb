I really liked it. Many Korean people will feel good about this movie, because many of them have a teacher when they go to school. Cinematography was average. The film would be better if the angel or movement of the camera were more irregular. However, the treatment was very pure and unusual. Also, acting was very good. Kim Ha Neul usually played an innocent poor girl in a Korean soap mist. This time, however, cute tomboy plays very well. Kwon Sang Woo also plays a very credible role. What I like best about this movie is that the character's emotions are not too exaggerated. There are many Korean romantic movies that characters call the river in front of the audience, and I always thought it was very outdated. This movie was not that stupid. <br /> <br /> Very fun and well done.
