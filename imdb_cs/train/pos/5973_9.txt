It's a great, ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the obsession of the mid and late 1980's when it is supposed to be bad metal music. I remember being curious about metal teens when I was a child. It did not help me finding a crime grave in my cemetery where I was ten. It turned out that this weird metal kid dug some old bodies and used his bones in some strange sacrifice of Satan. So maybe something like I was discouraged from the metal for a while, but now I love her like 24 years old. I bought this DVD for $ 6 and I expected it to suck as a result of the lame cover, but it was because of my surprise that it ruled. This is the extreme demonic power of the metal. And you have to love the scene where the guitar shoots the lasers and vaporizes his head in the crowd. This movie is amazing, if you like 80s and bad movies, it's for you. 9/10!
