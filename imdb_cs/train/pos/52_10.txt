This movie is incredible. If you have a chance, watch it. Yet, a warning, you will cry your eyes out. I do it every time I see it, and I own it and I've been watching it many times. Performance is excellent. It deals with darkness and pain and loss, but there is hope. This movie made me look different to the world: according to my English teacher representing the experience. Also, if you have seen it, note the interesting use of shadows and lights. The home room is a phenomenal movie and I rate it 10/10 - really - because of excellent acting, amazing plot and dialogue with heart. Very tight, very moving. He does not give all the answers but makes many good points about humanity
