This is an unpredictable little movie, and I have to agree that there is also a special expression in it. <br /> <br /> The adventure of a young man who decides to become a famous Las Vegas illusionist is partly about watching their dream, partly about the others' dreams and everything about what is happening in the showbiz. I thought the movie was charming and it has a moment or two real spell that makes the whole thing useful. Alan Arkin is amazing as a magician who has never been, and his mentoring Max makes a fun and moving relationship. <br /> <br /> It is not likely for everyone, but if you like movies about the way, then I think you will like it.
