This movie was seen by my husband and I when it came out in 1978. It was a revelation to us. We really thought we were the only gay and lesbian couple who ever married and had children. We were obviously mistaken. Love can come from where you do not expect it and you may not want it. But we both chose this love. And no, we have never changed our sexual orientation. Such things are for the Christian wack. When we were young, we both had issues, but never the opposite sex. As we grew older, we stopped dealing with extramarital affairs. This story is not too concerned. However, the suggestion that they became heterosexuals seems to me to be quite unrealistic. My wife and I have slept together for the last 40 years. We're still gay. End of the story.
