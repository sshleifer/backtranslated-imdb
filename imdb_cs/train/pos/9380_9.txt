The beautiful old-fashioned thriller, which comes as a cross between Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch, "Red Rock West" follows a bad return of the injured veteran of the unemployed oil worker N.Cage when his luck turns from bad to worse after ending with empty tanks petrol and barely enough money for a cup of coffee in one city at the back. From the outset, it was found that Mr. Cage might be down but not out and could be broken but not stolen, even in his current convenient circumstances. As a result, when he is wrong with Mr. J.T. Walsh for the man he had been assigned to murder his wife, Cage calls on his wife to warn her of her husband's intentions. On the other hand, she gives her even more money in Mr. Walsh's murder. Mr. Cage decides to leave while he is still ahead, but when he goes out of town, he hits men on the road. As soon as he could go on, he would take the man to the hospital where he would find himself shot. Mr Cage is detained by deputies calling the sheriff who appears to be Mr JTWalsh. Events are complicated when Mr.Cage escapes from custody and avoids the real hitman on his way. the logical turn of events appears on the screen, the narrative flow of the film at this point seems unstoppable. Mr. D. Hopper is conveniently occupied as a hired assassin, as well as Mr. Cage veteran USMC. This small piece of serendipity keeps Mr. Cage alive long enough to think of a murderous trio and survive, a bit more battered but still unbowed. It is a tribute to all concerned that what sounds on paper remarkably like a piece of nonsense is in fact tense with an extremely well-done picture with subtle performances all around. "Red Rock West" is a movie lover. Within five minutes you know that you are traveling somewhere many years ago, but during the trip you will be very happy.
