This is a British comedic film that is screaming and the one I could watch again and again without being tired. Petr Ustinov never played a bad role, and it is no exception, especially thanks to his dry joke, but a very clever plan. Karl Malden was my admirer because he played on the streets of San Francisco. I believe Maggie Smith is the real star of this film, and she seems to be so awkward in everything she's trying to do, but she's really turned on, especially at the end, when she tells everyone she's invested so much money that she discovered washing your clothes. One thing I am interested in, could anyone tell me why I can not buy it on DVD or VHS format in the UK, could someone help?
