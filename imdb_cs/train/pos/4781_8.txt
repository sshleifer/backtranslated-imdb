MULHOLLAND DRIVE has made me a definitive fan of David Lynch. He is a modern genius because he is not just a filmmaker. His stories and his style have the magic that goes through the screen. So STRAIGHT STORY was a great surprise for me, with its easy tracking of the story and the sun sets. Still, there is Lynch and, although not far from his best, it's a movie that you should not miss. Later Richard Farnsworth's performance is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> 8/10
