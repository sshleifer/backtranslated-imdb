I know it's technically not the biggest TV show at all, I think it was shot on video and its limitations are reflected in both the audio and the visual aspect. The activity may at the time be a bit crumby.but, I love it show so much.it it scared me out of me when I first broadcast in 1988. Of course it was 5 years old.but I recently bought a DVD from the first 3 episodes that unfortunately I hear them now deleted.and I also heard that Warner would no longer be publishing because of the bad sale of the first DVD. Also, the TV show did not have the same feeling as movies, in fact I thought it was more sinister. Although the color palette is similar to the nightmare on ul. 4 (both the movie and the TV show were made the same year), it has a more serious tone, while the fims are becoming more and more sardonic and joking. freddy as a clown wise cracker.but I think it was the power of this television show, you did not have freddy popping every minute utes cracking a joke before and after killing someone. In fact, it has more dream feeling that it strengthens the soft focus lense.im not sure whether its deliberate by the show makers or just the limitations of the video shooting. I love this show and do not act as an accompaniment to the movie, it can be very nice. much better than anything today on television.
