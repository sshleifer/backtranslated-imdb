I think this film will work only on those who have all been shut down by the giant humor of Lord of the Rings. Well, I was. And so I like this movie very much. Especially I like all those flawless LotR superheroes that are so perfectly and disdainfully parodied. The best is Gandalf's counterpart (brave and wise and completely humorous conscious guide): Almghandi, cowardice and dead transvestite. Sauron's counterpart ("Sauraus" from East Germany, of course) is simply wearing a bucket with eye holes as a helmet. Aragorns alter ego is another idiot idiot who is trying to repair his broken sword ("Ulrike") with a Scottish tape legend. And "Strunzdumm" (the Wormtong counterpart) has a very strong resemblance to Brad Dourif! And do not forget Grmpfli and Heidi ... huh-huh
