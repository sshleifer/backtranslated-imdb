He caught this movie in 1990 by video coincidence and without knowing why I was. Many horror fans have probably missed this thought that it was a typical prison movie, and they did not like it because it was not what they wanted to see. The above factors are probably the reasons for the low rating, but just ignore it and give it a whirlwind if you are a fan of this genre. He has strong suits in all departments, from the script and the atmosphere to acting and the prison itself. <br /> <br /> Absolute diamond, a movie I'm still delivering on video today. Look at it.
