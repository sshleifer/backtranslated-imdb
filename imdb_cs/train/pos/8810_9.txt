I first saw this movie when it was broadcasting on the now defunct Trio Channel a few years ago and recently watched it - Sunds commercials - sans commercials. For the first time, I was overwhelmed, and found that she was even more involved in the second watch. Yes, some segments are far from perfect - Amos Gitai's hysterical commentary stands out as a painful thumb - but 11 09 01 is a complete success. The best of the performance: The amazing final segment of Shohe Imamura, which contemporary critics such as the stupid Mick LaSalle misinterpreted as an attack on "terrorists," but is now revealed as a masterful anti-war polemic; Samira Makhmalbafova's introductory composition that combines deep empathy with the September 11 victims with Afghanistan's preconception of children; and the funny Idrissu Ouedraogo crusade for Osama bin Laden - hunting almost as serious and successful as the one for REAL Usama. The Youssef Chahina Segment is a noble, though unsuccessful experiment that has the courage to remind the audience that Bin Laden and al'Kaeda are basically the creations of American foreign policy and the CIA, and although the characteristics of Sean Penn's study seem to be an effectively hot-and-cold piece of film. Overall, a major tour and fascinating look better than Oliver Stone's world-wide shopping mall.
