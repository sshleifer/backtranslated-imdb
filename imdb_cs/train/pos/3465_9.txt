I sat down to watch this film with great anxiety and little hope. I did not think that this film could fulfill its subject. But it did, and then some. First of all I have to say that Jared Harris has done extraordinary work like John Lennon. Occasionally Harris seemed to bring Lennon. Similarity was often mysterious and clearly studied Lennon's manners and vocal cries. Aiden Quinn was quite good as McCartney, who also resembled Macca, though he sometimes went over his Scouse accent. This fictitious work was well written and well controlled. It was, of course, pure fantasy, but sometimes I felt like a voyeur who was looking at the keyhole at this meeting. The scene on the rooftop was moving as McCartney told Lennon what he had never heard of as a child - he was worthy and important, and he could never be guilty of abandoning his parents. I also liked the scene in the park where their couple danced with absolute desertion to the reggae band! One of my complaints would be the following: I'm not so sure John was just as cowardly as he was portrayed in the movie at this stage of his life. He matched his home situation quite nicely, and he was actually known to be very friendly when he approached the fans. Only a few years later he was very friendly when the killer first approached him in the autograph on the day he was assassinated. Mostly this film served to re-create these feelings about what John might have lived for a little longer. I'm pretty sure the Beatles will come back together at some point. And I'm pretty sure Lennon and McCartney are still friends today. Okay, VH1. He'll watch it over and over again. <br /> <br />
