"Magic" is not a very powerful word for the magic of this film. You found yourself relaxed and saw the others in a more pleasant light ... Every film that has such a civilizing effect on viewers deserves serious attention. We rarely soaked in such beauty. As if that's not enough, it's funny. Performances are exceptional, but special mention must be made to the miraculous Miranda Richardson and the gorgeous Josie Walker - both of which are open as roses. Why DO NOT this movie on DVD? He deserves to live forever.
