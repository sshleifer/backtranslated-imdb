I first saw this movie when the BBC passed it around 1988 when I was working at the UK 2000AD. My friend Steve Parkhouse was uploaded to the VHS and sent it to me. Until that moment I really saw only kung fu films Shaw Bros. with their cruel lighting (so the audience saw movements clearly), so it was my revelation that I was seeing something that looked like it was illuminated by Ridley Scott coming out of Hong Kong. This was also my first appearance on Tsui Hark movies (apparently, "Choy Huk"). Yet for all the smoke, backlit exteriors and ambitious special effects (stop-motion? In the Hong Kong film?) In the heart of Chinese GHOST STORY lies a simple and moving love story that is all the more real thanks to the outstanding acting talent Leslie Cheung (as tragic, tragic waste of life) and the beauty and elegance of Joey Wong. Joey is gorgeous, but it's her ballet hand gesture that gives her character unreachable eroticism that is difficult to analyze. And though Joey is now almost 20 years older (gawd, who of us is not?), It will always be a permanent image of this actress. Some reviewers have said that the film is simplistic and lacking in surprise, but it is missing the fact that this film was based on the famous Chinese story written by Pu Songling around 1700! It's a bit like complaining that Romeo and Julie has a predictable end and just a copy of WEST SIDE STORY. (I just wanted to get away from my chest!) <br /> <br /> For me, Chinese GHOST STORY is a characteristic romantic story. He has a great tragedy because we know that Chio Sin and Sin Seen can never be together. This is an acceleration because none of us can be mature until we experience a great loss. It is a sacrifice because the sacrifice is an essential part of true love. And Wu Ma's comedy styling will not even hurt a bit. Enjoy the Chinese story of GHOST STORY by trying not to look through the Western culture filter, and you will do it well.
