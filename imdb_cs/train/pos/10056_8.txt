We looked at it in our class of women's health problems, which shows how many societies are treated less favorably with men than men and I absolutely loved this film. I plan to try to get her myself. The story is very moving and I would recommend it to everyone. I'm a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what I needed. This is a movie for the whole family despite her ratings. This is a movie I will show my children. A professor of our class wanted the film to be primarily designed to educate women, but this film was more than that. It's one of those movies that will make me go forever and be popular.
