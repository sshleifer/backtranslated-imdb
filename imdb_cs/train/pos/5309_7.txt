The best thing about this movie is that it's fun. He is full of humorous characters and interesting situations, beginning with the bliss, innocent Pecker (played likingly by Edward Furlong), who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in everyday life. Other great characters include Peck's friend Matt ("It's a thief, but he's really a nice guy"), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who is dependent on sugar), and Pecker's Catholic grandmother who is discovering life in the Virgin Mary's statue in her room. <br /> <br /> The film gently suggests how daily life is to offer wealth and strives for this point not to be too difficult. There is always the risk of moving to a "holy than you" when reporting on the value and dignity of "ordinary people" - but "Pecker" avoids these traps and gives viewers enough breathing space for viewers to compare this message with your own ideas on the subject. I recommend the film mostly because it's a lot of fun.
