Every night I watched VH1 this week. This is an amazing revealing portrait of the drug epidemic and how drugs were exposed in the media in the late 1960s and over 70. Woodstock, Easy Rider, The Beatles, Death Morrison, Hendrix, Joplin. Vh1 created a complete complex display of life and times during "drug years". From the Sanfrancisco Bay area to Studio 54, he documents the development and development of drug and death drug trafficking and a new life that has inspired American culture. From Marijuana to LSD to Cocaine, this document shows how the drugs got into the country, the hippie movement, the conservative resistance, and the way the drugs influenced art (music, movies, etc.) that contain lots of fascinating interviews and recordings of reels. <br /> <br /> Drug Films: The Easy Rider Madness Blow Boogie Nights
