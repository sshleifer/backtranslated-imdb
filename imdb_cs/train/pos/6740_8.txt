The wholly rounded character of the main role of this film, what the cop rips with his past and on the path of self-destruction that the audience so clearly reveals is unique for his time, 1950. <br /> <br /> Along with stunning music and well-written conspiracy is a great example of the film noir at its best. Dana's eyes reveal anxiety, Karl Malden stands out as his boss who does not make any nonsense, but also has compassion with those under his command in the district. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger made this type of film just his own. If there is any mistake, it will be with the breath taking beauty of Gene Tierney, which looks strangely out of place with the alleged cop. But their scenes in the cafe are beautiful and true. <br /> <br /> Tom Tully, in the bit of his father, is perfect, just like Gary Merrill as a hood. Large lighting and mood adjustment. A building where deaths happen very atmospheric, I love an old woman in the basement. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10.
