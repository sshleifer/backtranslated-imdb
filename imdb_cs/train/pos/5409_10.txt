I love this movie! The animation is great (for the Pokémon movie), cgi looks so amazing. I love music in the movie. They kept the Japanese music so well. As for the story: it's great. She has a great feeling of friendship. Celebi is a very cute and powerful Pokémon. Ash is really great in this movie and I like Sam's friendship. The only thing I did not like was Suicu's appearance, but he suddenly appeared, helped Ash & just a little and left. They could get a little bigger in their movie. But overall, amazing movie! I can not wait to get the American version on DVD!
