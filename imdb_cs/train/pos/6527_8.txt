The document begins by setting the perspective for several light years. Traveler travels through the milk way with the sounds of our earthly lives as a cosmic monument for (maybe?) Aliens. The documentary includes images of Willy Dixen, Robert Johnson, Skip James and J.B. Lenoira. Záběry J.B. have never been published before. The narrative is from "blind Willie" Dixon. However, this is an actor. The film shows the work of all these early blues men, followed by the covers and performances of musicians such as Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds among others. <br /> <br /> Death by J.B. Lenoira (John Mayal's song) is striking in the story. Lenoir is politically committed and is considered to be Martin Luther King and his peers. His political interests can be found in the topics of his texts. <br /> <br /> Blues are considered 'THE' Native Music of America. Blues are rooted and the rest is fruit. <br /> <br /> The title 'Soul of a Man' is after Willie Dixon's song.
