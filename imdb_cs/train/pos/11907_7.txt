Hitchcock was of the opinion that viewers are really not interested in what threatens the protagonists - only that they are in danger and need to escape. This film proves that Hitchcock was not 100% correct. The police believe that Jean Simmons is guilty of a criminal when it is not obvious. Trevor Howard decides that their best practice is to run. And so, the body of the film has our charismatic couple, who avoids and turns off trains, buses and buses - jumping over the rocks at the top of the waterfall - hiding on the roofs of the shipyards. All the good exciting thing - but I could not get rid of my mind that it's all useless. He should stay. <br /> <br /> In other words, MacGuffin was not strong enough.
