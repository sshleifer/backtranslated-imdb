I bought it a while ago, but I certainly neglected her until the last night. I like Juliette Lewis, although I'm Brad Pitt indifferent. After that, I have to admit he's a perfectly gentle actor-his character was utterly believable and I thought "Brad Pitt" at all. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I can not say the same thing for David Duchovny. I'm a X file fan and I had to look twice to confirm the date of this movie, as I thought it was a few years later. I like the Spirit, but I found my character a bit two-dimensional, except where the voices are. The part was strong, it looked like a character, a good intonation, etc. Otherwise, I was still thinking "Agent Mulder", which is a pity. Michelle Forbes was a delicacy. Why did not I notice her before? (I will look at what role she has done and what she has seen). I am a little concerned about the stereotyping of this film by Lewis and "Natural Born Killers". Interestingly, he sees the contrast of characters - in NBK he is a willing companion, while he is doing violence there and trying hard to decide the Early Dark Side until it happens. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the film almost unreservedly. In addition to Spirituality of a character that was far from being created (and may have been "screamed" somewhat by Pitt), it was perfect. I was also delighted with the end result - glad that the innocent heroes had not died, yet they had to suffer first. It was realistic, tense, disturbing. <br /> <br /> If you like NBK, you can enjoy this movie and vice versa.
