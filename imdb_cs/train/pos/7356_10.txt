If you have not seen Eve Longoria from the television show "Desperate Housewives", then you are missing. Eve will be one of the greatest Latin stars and you will soon see her in the theaters. It was Eva's first film and he's doing a great job. She was 24 when she shot her, and then she looked hot. As for this low-budget film, it's the first time to be the best director to have the soon-to-be released movie "Juarez, Mexico," which is currently playing at many film festivals throughout the United States. In fact, it seems he may have limited theatrical release from some reports. What would be nice to see is "Snitch'2" with a higher budget.
