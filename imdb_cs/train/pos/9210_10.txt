I feel it's one of the best movies I've ever seen, I'm an older man and I love most of the westerns. I like movies based partly on facts, if I'm not mistaken, it's such a movie. I also like revenge movies, which, in my view, is also good. Some of my favorite parts of the film were an introductory scene with whipping and shooting. I felt the coral bit scene was a little exaggerated, but it did not affect how I feel about a complete movie. I have seen what I think is the continuation of this film in an episode of smoke from smoke. I also enjoyed it. I recommend you take the time to watch this movie, I look at it again. I also felt that the romantic parts of this film were playable. I thought it was so unusual for Randy Travis to play a villain, but I always like his acting.
