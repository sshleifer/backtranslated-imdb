I saw this Saturday night at the Provincetown Film Festival and it's a film of my own - it's really staying with me. Thinking very smartly of what is probably a great novel, it is a dramatic drama with completely rounded characters, a thoughtful assumption of life choices, and I'm not exaggerated. one of the greatest casts ever made in over 100 years of film. Amazing work from everyone, led by Vanessa Redgrave as a dying, frightened Newport mother and Claire Danes as her much younger self. Meryl Streep's daughter Mamie Gummer, like Mom, is a real deal; Patrick Wilson looks like Paul Newman around 1958 and does not exceed the charm; and what is the pleasure of seeing such outstanding actors such as Barry Bostwick and Eileen Atkins contributing sharp and detailed portraits. Hugh Dancy, also from the stage, does not lead to a huge clich√© the role of an unfortunate rich fool, and family matters are resolved perhaps better than real life. But it is a deliberately thoughtful, visually gorgeous meditation on real life issues, and you can cry about it and do not feel as if you are being manipulated with care. Also, what a magnificent car parade of the forties and fifties.
