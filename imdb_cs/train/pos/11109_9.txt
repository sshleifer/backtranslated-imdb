Sopranos act as an airtight, dynamic exploration of American life and how American experience is shaped and defined by money. By setting up a story in the Underworld environment, David Chase eliminates all the obstacles that prevent the terrible, low Earth and immediate deconstruction of the postmodern era. <br /> <br /> Every character is an aspect of American industry. Tony Soprano points out that it was a hard-frozen job, torn between family duty and the need to keep his "business" on the keel level. The convergence of these two things is an imperative that keeps the story moving. The characters of Christopher, Paulie, and Bobby reflect the loyal - but self - serving subjects present in every business, who are more confident than necessity than merit. With the nature of Ralph, Joe Pantoliano's essays of an excellent interpretation of the charismatic psychopath, the twisted entrepreneur who is the flourishing of violence are tragically balanced by his overwhelming gaining power. And Dominic Chianese is the ultimate symbol of an outdated old guard who maintains strength through established relationships and up-and-comers needs to avert guilt. Though abrasive and sometimes disturbing, the Sopranos gained their place as the highest television track. <br /> <br /> PS A good accompaniment to Chase would be The Shield, another violent drama that can make the worst of the characters interesting.
