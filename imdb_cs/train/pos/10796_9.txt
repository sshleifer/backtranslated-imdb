If you are a fan of one or both of Chuck Norris & Judson Mills then it's a movie to see. It has a lot of adventure in it. It's great to follow up to President's Man. The chemistry among the main three stars (Chuck Norris, Judson Mills, Jennifer Tung) My personal opinion. This movie along with the original proved so good that networks should think of it turning into a regular series. If you've seen President Man, I recommend this movie for you. If you've seen a presidential man: line in the sand, but you did not see the president's man, let me suggest that you do it. you will not be disappointed by either of them.
