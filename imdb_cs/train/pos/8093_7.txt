My friend had the idea of ​​watching the animated LOTR after seeing Peter Jackson's Return of the King. So I finally bought it from e-bay, and I thought from the beginning that it would suck. In fact, it was not as bad as I thought it would be. The animation was good for their time, they used a unique method of mixing live action with animation to create interesting effects and the one who made the voice for Frodo sounds a bit like Elijah Wood. <br /> <br /> Not the biggest adaptation of the book, but believe me, I've seen much worse. It skips a lot of things because both Fellowship and Two Towers are compressed into a two-hour film. Definatley is worth watching, kids might like, but absouls are no comparison to Peter Jackson's trilogy.
