Man, some of you have to cool down. This film was an artistic genius. Instead of looking for reasons or messages that would justify it in your reality, why can not you understand that it is a fiction? Story. Fun, for God (no toy is intended). It seems to me that too many people here are trying to be film critics - and they do not do well. I am so impressed by the fact that Bill Paxton's film and work directed me to contact him personally to tell him. I know if you did not try to analyze heck out of the story, you can just enjoy the film. Me and all my friends did it!
