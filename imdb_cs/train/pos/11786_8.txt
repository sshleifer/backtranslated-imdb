This is almost typical of Lynch. However, what makes this movie a bit unusual for Lynch is the fact that it looks very raw, almost amateur. But I believe that Lynch does this in order to provide a greater sense of realism that serves to increase the intensity of unreal moments. However, many typical Lynch motifs are present, such as: floating camera work; scary music; long (unbearable) pauses; hanging curtains; Dark lights grow darker at slow (almost unbearable) tempo; extreme close up; issues of women in trouble; supernatural, hateful, omnipresent characters who stand in the hot faces, temporarily forget, in the darkness and so on ... The performances are great and short is the thought provoking. As usual, Lynch leaves almost everything to interpret. Many questions are left unanswered, and it ignites the imagination. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant effort from Lynch. I just hope he will make some shorts, more in line with his two PlayStation 2 ads. They were inspired.
