Very rarely, one meets an indie comedy that leaves a lasting impression. Cross Eyed is a precious gem. The writer's director has not only solved the challenge of managing his own work, but giving cheerful performance as a bad roommate. The script is not only interested in the situation of a struggling writer, but it transforms so many comedies into the furious writer's world that you can not help but commit to Ernie as a character. Very fun things. Despite a small budget, Adam Jones will give the film a serious look. It does not start when it comes to making a good movie. I can not wait to see what's coming. The guy can make people laugh and think; It is strange.
