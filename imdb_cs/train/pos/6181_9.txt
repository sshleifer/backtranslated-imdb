A very nice movie that will give you information on how to watch old musicals / mysteries. Do not get closer to the secret of Agatha Christie or even Thin Man as a movie noir, but it's much more interesting than your typical "boy meets a girl" or "let's imagine" a backstage musical. As a musical, it is not Busby Berkley or Freed, but it can raise classic "cocktails for two" and strange "sweet marijuana." The film takes place in real time during theatrical performance, the evening premiere of "Vanities," where murder - and soon another - behind the scenes. Did the killer find out before the curtain fell? Sure, but the search is fun, though somewhat predictable and ruined explosions of comic relief (fortunately in the shape of the choir goddess goddess Toby Wing). The stupid cop is just a little stupid, the front hero is a bit too sympathetic, the lady is a little merciful, the unfortunate prima donna is too scared, and the in love does not feel too self-sacrificing, but as stereotypes go, they are quite stylish. There are a lot of really beautiful choir girls who are selected even better than girls for the Busby Berkley musical of the same period, which is sometimes a bit shiny. Yes, this movie could be much better than it is, and the number of the Duchess of Ellington is embarrassing, but if you like diving in old movies, it'll be a really stunning trip.
