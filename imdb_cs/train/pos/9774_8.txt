This movie has its ups and downs, but for me the good things in this movie predominantly outweigh the fools ... What is not so good with movies are really dialog, sounds, lighting (I'm the only one who noticed the way the lighted sets were, was amateur and acting ....) Very good is a very original story, a very intense atmosphere, a gore factor that is very high, and the effects that are made the highest. <br /> <br /> So it's definitely worth watching or maybe even have to see for all those horror and gore fans ....
