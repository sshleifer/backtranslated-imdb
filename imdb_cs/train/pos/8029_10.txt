I'm curious about the use of Beckett's rifle in the film and the bullet bullet that is supposed to fire. If it is freely based on the effort of Carlosa Hathcock, I think it's 7mm. bike. I'm also curious about the rifle itself. In the final Sniper film, he also commented on the rifle the Vietnamese man had used, which belonged to his father. Beckett mentioned he thought he was the best shotgun he ever did. I would like to know which rifle is also. I know this particular rifle was made around World War II or in advance. I just could not get a closer look at watching the movie to find out. As for Mr Hathcock's killing, his longest shot was 1.47 miles, and he had 93 confirmed killings and 14 unconfirmed killings. After his wounds somehow healed from being burned in Vietnam, he spent the remaining circles in the USMC teaching the snipers he needed in the field. His sniping career is still mentioned by our brothers and sisters who train in the USMC. I found his name from a friend who is a former Marine. Any information would be great.
