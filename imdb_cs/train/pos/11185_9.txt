Since this is one of my favorite novels, I was very excited to see this move. I was not disappointed! Yes, of course, there are a few things I could decide on, but I think the film is in the true sense of the book and it was a really good movie. It seems that Stephen King's movies are mostly bad, but it's one of the good ones. It's such a dark story that I think is why I like it ... and what's better than the dead come alive ... and something about the animals that are coming back from the grave is also scary. If you saw the movie, do a great favor and now read the book! It's a well written game on the screen, the actors could do a better job (I'm just saying it to Rachel and Ellie .. it was so scary) I liked everyone else ... and the most important thing for me ... it was stuck with the truth with a novel.
