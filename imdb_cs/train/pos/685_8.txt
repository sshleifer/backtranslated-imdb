Ghost Story (The New House) is an amazing horror story. This is from the cycle of fear and the Ghost Story series of the early seventies. The beginning and end of each story is told by Sebastian Cabot. Do you remember him from the early family series, Family Affairs in the 1960s? This particular story is Barbara Parkins and David Birney as the main actors and the main characters in the story. I saw it recently and I was so scared! If you are alone, I do not recommend you to look at it. is amazing, no gore or curses, but very scary. Barbara Parkins played a young bride. David Birney played his husband. Although the actors were very good at their parts.If you like scary, fun, scary ghost stories, then you will like this little jewel. I gave this high score. I highly recommend this story.
