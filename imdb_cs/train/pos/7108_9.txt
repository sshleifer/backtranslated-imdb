Do you want to solve mysteries? Do you like a complicated narrative? It's for you. Brilliant, clever film Francis Leclerc (son of the legendary French Canadian signatory Felix Leclerc). An amazing photo and a smart editing is the word Leclerc, strongly assisted by Roy Dupuis, who is the dythirambic in the lead role. The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur, a vet at age 40, who just woke up from a coma after being disconnected by someone unknown. The Tourneur tries to remember who struck him when the deer's suffering on the road ended. He has a strange behavior during the fight and seems to have taken over something. It is not a ghostly, but very mysterious and well-played movie. I have my hypothesis about the end (I think the Indian caused an accident), but this end was open to all the explanations. I strongly recommend 9.5 / 10
