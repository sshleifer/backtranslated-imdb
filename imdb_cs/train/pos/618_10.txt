This movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> I was "enchanted", I should say, and surprised at how it happened. Casting, sequencing, effects ... everything! Magnificent! I thought it was a love affair, yes, but what the other people did was that it was fun and healthy. For me, it is a representation of a modern fairy tale. It's like a modern peter pan ... just amazing <br /> <br /> I would definitely buy a copy of this moment when he got to the market. <br /> <br /> This movie is really double you MUST be one ... !!!! 10 stars for it!
