It was a typical B-class movie in Hollywood in the 1960s, yet he managed to surpass expectations. Why? She has a wonderful plot and is backed by Nina Foch, George MacReady and Dame May Witty, as a woman's dad from all the people. When a young lady answers the ad for a secretary, she will certainly get more than she negotiated. The only talents that her employers are looking for are those that lead to her disappearance. It seems that Witty and MacReady want to hand over her as her daughter-in-law and wife. MacReady killed his true wife and wanted Foch to allow himself to claim the body. The film deals with how Foch tries to get the city into town to trust her and how she is practically frustrated with everything she does. Why do not people trust her?
