"What would you do?" is an issue that will hold in your mind a few weeks after watching the emotional palace of Brokedown. You will also wonder if Alice (Danes) says the truth or not - a problem that is left unresolved and right. This is a particularly good and beautiful film. Although it is sometimes slow, its pace is a reflection of the story - but much of the film will have you at the edge of your seat; they want to know what's going on. Finally, let's introduce you to the leaders of the boots, played by Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes. Performance Bill Pullman is also praiseworthy.
