I just want to say that among all so-called classic hip-hop movies I've seen them like Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin ', Style Wars, etc. IMO BEAT STREET is the best among others. Whenever I ask other people about what is their favorite, then it seems that BEAT STREET jumps the most. But it is the lowest of all. 4.3 is just punch "under the belt" (if you say, 5 points is a belt). I like a musical performance, breakdancing makes me turn, RAMO has made me throw a piece ... well, its classic !!!
