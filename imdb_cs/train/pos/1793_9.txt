I saw this movie on Sunday afternoon. I absolutely loved this movie. I loved everything from moments and moments of glamor to moments where Mamie Gummer (Lila) weeps because of her bad decision to marry a man for her parents and not because she is really in love. I loved these moments because they were so real. At first I was really scared because I was hoping it would not end up like Bobby, which was a great shot but a badly written film without real meat. But I felt completely different in the middle of the movie. You will laugh and cry, but in the end you will want to see Evening again. Trust me when I say.
