This is a really funny show, made in a haunted way, like the movie Tim Burton. It is worth seeing because it is much more creative than most of the concerts this season. Best of all, it's not "reality". I wonder why the viewing public is so prepared to take such shows (which lack creativity) and ignore wonderful shows like this, which in fact have a creative bending. While some people read the assumption, I think it's really unusual. It's much more fun than "Ghost Whisperer" and "Medium". I think it's the funniest thing on the trumpet because "My Name Is Earl". And, the narration and the music are amazing. If you like shows that are a bit off the beaten track, I recommend it. It's not as strange as Twin Peaks, but it's really a kid.
