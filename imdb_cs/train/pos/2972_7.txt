I have to admit that I am a big fan of South Park and I expected basketball to be funny but not as good as it turned out to be! I think it happened when you were together David Zucker, Matt Stone and Trey Parker. This movie has so many replay values ​​and in no way bothers to take seriously. The swing style of humor mixed with Stone and Parker works flawlessly. The type of humor present in the basketball was not popular at the time of his release, and if he went out today, it would be a hit. Do not try to be critical, just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughter. Recommended for anyone who has a good sense of humor.
