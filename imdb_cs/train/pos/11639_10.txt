I saw an advanced movie for this movie tonight. I totally loved it. The film kept me on the edge all night. Cillian Murphy is extremely scary as a villain. For those of you who have seen Batman, his character has been much more scary in this movie. He played his character very well. The worst "bad guy" I've seen in a while. Rachel McAdams was great. Everyone in the audience laughed, gasped and furious at the same time as if we were on the lookout. This tension holds in the movie. The amazing part is that the end was not anti-climatic. Finally, I was not disappointed. I felt happy. Trailer is not a fair movie. The film is much better than the marked trailer. Do not wait for this movie to appear on the video. Go for it. Although I did not have to pay to see this movie, I'd like to give him 10.75. Enjoy!
