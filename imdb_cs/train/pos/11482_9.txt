This film is basically shot on the camera's handheld actors in it. In some ways, the mercenary is a different way the video log of the murderers is full due to the "Columbine" attack. While this film does not answer all the big questions, it gives you an insight into how easy it would be if you got away. The film shows how actors have illegally shortened shotguns, made piping bombs, and came up with the action plan "Zero Day". The actors (if you can say it) were great, they apparently hardly borrowed their own lives, but I did not find them in real time actually playing (something that Tom Cruise was supposed to try). Using CCTV and 911 at the end was brilliant, but I'm not sure if we need the last scene. Overall, although it is a really good film on a very difficult topic.
