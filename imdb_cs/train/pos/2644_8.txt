I do not know what he thinks is so adorable about this film, but for the first time I've seen it, I wanted to see how it ended. I'm not a big fan of Paul Winfield or war drama, but I really wondered how and when Winfield will find her baby. All he knows is that the boy has green eyes. In truth, I have not seen this movie in a few years, nor did it appear on television over the years, but this film is a rather isolated person after the pain of war. Winfield shows a very sympathetic and warm-hearted image of a man lost in memories. There is a fundamental message in this film that he is looking for the latest decay of human morality after the war and the reality he faces. Why this movie is not yet on DVD or video is a mystery for me.
