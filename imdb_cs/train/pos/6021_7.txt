Although it may not necessarily be the so-called "classic" film according to today's standards, it is worth seeing. The main reason why, after experiencing this film, you have felt that you have also experienced the anti-cultural idealism of the 1960s, whether it be good or bad. a movie in SUNY Geneseo's English Literature Class, and though it seems to be just a nonsensical 60-degree icon, the film is not far from being simply thrown. if you leave the film feeling unhappy and confused, the movie has made it a job: it has brought a deserted view of the future that will leave you uncertain and upset. Perhaps it was the same feeling that the movie was trying to explore in the youth, as it turned out. As such, "Zabriskie Point" does not have to tell a very good (or interesting) story, and at the same time its characters can be unilateral and predictable. However, it is so well expressed in this kind of clich√©, the rebellious desire to come out of the existence that Mark and Daria must share. Even anti-establishment students are just as inappropriate as those with whom they revolted.
