I have just finished viewing this finely-designed film and a beautifully played film. It was lucky I'd waste my time watching a movie on a lifetime movie network for terribly disturbing advertising. Reading past comments convinced me to give him a shot. After all, the worst thing could happen was that during one of the boring, but long, spank ads, I fell asleep. So why did I watch it? mainly because when IMDB gives the movie "WEIGHTED DIAMOND" 5.8 WHO STATISTICAL AVERAGE was 7.3 It must be a hit. I was absolutely delighted that I took the time to view this movie, commercial chicken and everything. Helen Hunt continues to amaze me with my ability to accept difficult roles to adapt my core persona to each role. The portrait he painted in this film of a heavy but receptive human policeman was beautifully executed. When a scene calls for rapid, timely, and timely wordplay, it can stand on top with any actor. Yet she is endowed with delivering emotional feedback bundles without telling the word relying solely on facial expression and body language. Without ads that, according to the design, kills the continuity of any good film, it would be a real nail-birch. I gave him 9.0
