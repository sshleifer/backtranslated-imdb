The pioneering Technicolor Cinematography (the winner of the special technical success of Oscar) is really charming. Add an endless range of glamorous costumes and a romantic dream team like Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer and you have a nice "picture". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a fictional plot, blown gambling is very good. Nevertheless, before that (1936), there were still no breathtaking Technicolor films, and since then very few, they can overcome the breathtaking visual experience of the beautiful colors. Cinema fans who enjoyed the famous color cinematography of "Robin Hood" (1938), "Jesse James" (1939) and "Gone With The Wind" (1939) will not be disappointed with the fantastic work here. "Garden of Allah" will always be synonymous with brilliant color cinematography.
