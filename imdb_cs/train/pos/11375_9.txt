This film tells a stunning story with history and compassion. From a careful description of crime scenarios to the mental health of the investigator, you will be thrilled. It is an absolute necessity for anyone interested in criminology. Relations between Interpol and the way agencies work together are also great. Not too much. I recommend it to anyone interested in Russian history. How the police work with a political party the way it was ... It's really fascinating and frustrating. Settings are beautiful. It's the first time I've seen this movie. This does not diminish its impact. It's not too dramatic or graphic, but it leaves it pretty imaginative, well, you'll see.
