Mendez and Marichal gave us a serious, persuasive and painful analysis of the social, spiritual, economic and political crisis that 108 years of colonialism had created in Puerto Rico. A beautiful island with the most remarkable people I met, and although our nation refuses to confront its imperial responsibilities, Puerto Ricans may die and die. The spiritual crisis the colonial situation in Puerto Rico has created if it undermines families and the basic institutions that maintain any society. Corruption is uncontrollable to the point that people do not pay taxes (which led to a nation's fiscal crisis), and the feeling of cynicism and distrust penetrates the island's culture. Fortunately, the grant allowed this painful but powerful movie to be produced. It has to be seen. . .
