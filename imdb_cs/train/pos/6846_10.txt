The film gets my stamp approved. The scene in the museum requires dialogue without dialogue. This is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in the history of the film. Dickinson's character Kate is very well developed and her performance is felt all over the film. Angie Dickinson's best work done from Bod Blank!
