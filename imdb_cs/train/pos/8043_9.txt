I've heard people who say this movie is boring. I do not think they were watching the right film. This is not a prototype action movie, thank God. It's a psychological career about the novice and his teachers that it's about killing people. In this way, it works exceptionally well, with amazing performances from Berenger and Zan (who does not love the movie as in other roles - actually looks like he is acting). I was disappointed with the action towards the end - much of it did not make much sense and was unsatisfactory due to the accumulation from the rest of the film. But watch Zane's face as he panics himself while Berenger is doing dirty work.
