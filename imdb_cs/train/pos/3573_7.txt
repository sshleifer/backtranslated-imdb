this movie was almost a great imaginative film. A mix of Shakespeare, Pop, Jazz and Fairy Tales. This film was an imaginative twist on Cinderella. Thanks to the strong cast, headed by Kathleen Turner's perfectly-occupied film, this film was all about it. All but production values. I almost never think the film needs special effects or big budgets, but with such high-end production as this, it has the same dirty quality as any other made for television movie. In addition to better cinematography, this film was almost perfect. <br /> <br />
