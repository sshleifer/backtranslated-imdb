This movie was a pretty funny comedy about Murphy's law covering home ownership and construction. If such a movie were to become undeniable today, the family would be inoperative. Given that it was set in the "simpler" forties, we get what is supposed to be a typical family of times. Grant, of course, perfectly combines comic and dramatic elements, and works with more than competently supported occupations highlighted by Loy and Douglas. Their shenanigans are for a solid ninety minutes of fun, 7/10.
