<br /> <br /> "Bleak House" has his hands down the finest adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel, which sometimes appeared on the screen. One of my favorite novels was extremely pleased with the Mini Series. The later, great Denholm Elliot was perfectly occupied because the noble John Jardyce and Diana Rigg were as perfect as the doomed Ladet Dedlock. The film captures the essence of the Dickens era and is extremely loyal to this book, which makes minor plotting that does not affect the story. despite all brilliant, moving and atmospheric films.
