After all, you do not go to Orson Welles to see a nice simple little conspiracy and relief of a happy star's picture after all. <br /> <br /> You can see the dramatically highlighted characters blocked in the conflict against the colorful and unusual settings, illuminated and scored imaginatively, photographed bravely and all the things were bothered by unexpected details of surprise that the wiser and saddest director would either avoid, or did not you think in the first place? As usual, as well as directing, Welles wrote a screenplay and also played a hero ??? a young Irish sailor who knocked the world to see his evil but kept his bright eyes in the good of others? Unfortunately, he took this trust in Rita Hayworth, whose great looks hid the gloomy past and the murderous inclinations for the future. She was married without love, against the impotent, crippled lawyer, acting like a dirty lizard brilliant Everett Sloane? <br /> <br /> There is a youthful romanticism that is the foundation of all, and this quality has come to a lively play at the "Shanghai Dam". Before it became inevitable, Welles escaped? to the final triangle shot in the mirror hall, which has become one of the classic scenes of the post-war cinema? <br /> <br /> Welles did not miss the chance in the film to contrast the words and actions with visual details that enriched the texture and increased the atmosphere? His camera looked like she almost played with Rita Hayworth when the sun played with her hair and long limbs while playing a young sailor on her web.
