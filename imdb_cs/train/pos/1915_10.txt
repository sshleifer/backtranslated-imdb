This show is amazing. I thought the two episodes where Paul died were so sad; Actually, I was crying. But the other performances were amazing; Kerry was my favorite character because she was in the "dark side". I also thought Bridget was funny because she was ubiquitous. I also thought the guy that played Kyle was really cute. I loved it when Kerry made sarcastic remarks about everything. The guy who played Rory was cute and Paul, who played John Ritter, was really fun. All this TV show is funny and I wish they could see it on TV. when they showed it on TV, I noticed it was always when it was. Next time, it will show that I'll watch it again and again.
