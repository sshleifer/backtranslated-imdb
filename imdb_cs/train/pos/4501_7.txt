This group of English professionals is delighted to watch. Supportive casting could form a series of their own. It is seen before the love of tiangle between the head of surgery, his wife and the new nice boy. Only the excellent acting skills of Frances Annis, Michaela Kitchen and sexy Robson Greene will pick it up from the rubbish category to a very nice "romp". The only bite is that it's hard to accept that eager Francesca Annis falls in love and truly marries Michael Kitchen, which I like, is hardly an international or even a British sexual symbol. You can easily understand why Robson Green would ignite her fire and apologize to "the door." The man who almost shows shows with great "quiet" performance is Owen's father David Bradley. Watch it in "The Way We Live Now," in a completely different performance to get an idea of ​​its scope. Daniela Nardini as a kitchen secretary, sometimes a sex toy, is hard to forget that she refuses the lady who makes the kitchen that she sometimes looked at her big body. Conor Mullen and Julian Rhind-Tutt, like Greenky buddies, as I said, could have their own series. They are good. The whole thing is very fun and I cordially recommend it and thank imdbman for leaving the paying customers in this fascinating place.
