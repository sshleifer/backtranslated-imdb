Although written by Stephen King, an overrated writer, if ever he was one, it's really quite a fun B-movie. Vampire, incest creatures who live in a candle-lit house and exhaust the life force of dolls, great cemetery sceneries, heroic cats and a very pretty virgin. The soundtrack even has Enyin's music, an idea I found pretty ... nice. I'm sure the King is disappointed with this little film, even if he has a bad dialogue and ideas, all of a real and boring king. (Although Sleepwalkers, when I understand correctly, there is a script without some romance or chatting behind it). Still touching sewage smells that show that he is not using ghost writers at all ...
