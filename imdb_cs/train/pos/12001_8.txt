I do not know what movie some of these people watched, but they had to see another "Joseph Smith: Restoration Prophet" than the one I saw. I think the film was both well done and inspirational. I think it is definitely worth watching. From the very beginning, it is obvious that he was very careful about making this film. The underlying scenery is wonderful. I think the film does a good job of introducing Joseph Smith to both man and the prophet. Joseph's spiritual experiences are displayed with taste and reverence. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend watching this movie.
