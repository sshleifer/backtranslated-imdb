it was my personal favorite when I was young, had everything that was great with 90 children's movies ... sweet dinosaurs, cute kids, eccentric villain and some great songs (and not a typical little mermaid / beauty and sand songs of the game, but those that are occasionally entertaining)! I've come across this movie again recently and I still love it like ever before! I recommend that everyone at every age see this movie and definitely think it should be introduced to younger generations! I'm sorry, not the most informative, I'm in a big rush ... just please, believe me. everyone who goes against this movie kills their inner child!
