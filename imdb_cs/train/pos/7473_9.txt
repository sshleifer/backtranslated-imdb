It is special that this version of OPEN EYES is more mature and finer. With the help of a back view, Crowe's script is much stricter and more detailed than Amenabar's original. The Spanish director should remember that he is thinking about the first story, but there is no doubt that Crowe has improved - if only slightly. Notice that you have no idea what led to OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know almost everything about leadership in VANILLA SKY. That's what I mean by 'improving'.
