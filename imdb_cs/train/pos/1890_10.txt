This is one of the films I've seen so many times that I can quote most of it. Some lines in this movie are just insurmountable. I especially like watching him sink and fall when he is drunk, go to the drunken restaurant drunk and part with a lot. I do not know how many times I've seen this sequence, but it's funny every time. From the moment Arthur gets to Susan's father's place on a piece with a lot, you'll still laugh a lot. I remember observing the outages that were related to the lot. I dropped as if I imagined it would be. Everyone was so laughing that it was difficult for them to shoot. Late Sir John Gielgud was a great addition to that. His behavior, his only lineage, and the way Arthur was treated were just as merry. It's always a funny moment when you hack him with his hat over his head or tell him it's a spoiled little ____. I can smile every time I listen to "I'll have a bath" and the lines that follow.
