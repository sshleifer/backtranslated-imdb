Gus Van Sant did some great movies. I'm really a fan. However, I can not help but feel that the edge of the brain Tom Robbins' book "Even Cowgirls Get Blues" is lost in translation on the big screen. Tom, Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are incredible visionaries and tower talents. In the end, though this did not work. <br /> <br /> It was not that the characters were not well developed or the plot and the content did not come alive. It's just that our ideas are much stronger when reading such a book. We are taken to another time and place, and sometimes we think it is the worst and / or the best and adds to the overall mountain track of the book, as it is precisely based on author's accuracy. Films, however, can leave one with less imagination and the emotion of a roller coaster to reduce the overall experience. That's what I think has happened. <br /> <br /> I suggest reading a book!
