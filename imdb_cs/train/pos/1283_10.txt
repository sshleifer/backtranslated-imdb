The film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are obsolete. The idea behind his artistic project is to reveal the funny culture in which we bathed. Of course, the film takes place in Los Angeles / Orange County. He challenges to build comics (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, hilarious Hollywood movies, and touches many other media. Eventually, he finds himself in the monuments of the weapon he started. The film is five years, and every day it rings with the truth. It's the best description of post-punk rage I've ever seen. It's also one of my 10 most popular films.
