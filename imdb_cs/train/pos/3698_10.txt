I had no idea what this movie is until I read about it in L.A. In general, I agree with reviews in LA Weekly and I decided to get a ticket for this film. star movie Molly Parker (from my favorite Deadwood TV show) and Lukas haas - which I think will be more in the near future. The film is fun, hearty, it features great acting and beautiful photography. I do not know if the film has a distribution, but I hope it will - or will - be soon. it is destined to be a real indie jewel. it even has the music of my favorite band of silver Jews! the only disappointment was that Molly Parker was not there for screening. even without her ... these were the best movies I've seen at the festival.
