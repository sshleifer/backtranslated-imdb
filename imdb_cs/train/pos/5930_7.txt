The monstrous mother-son-duo (Alice Krige and Brian Krause) exhausts the life force of the dolls and their latest goal is the rather lonely Tanya (Madchen Amick). However, these monsters are allergic to cat scratches ... I've never been a fan of dirty, overrated bestseller like King, Koontz or Barker, but this B-movie, written by Mr. Dungeon himself, is not really that bad. Yes, sometimes it is a juniper that is falling, but there are some surprisingly impressive touches: a good old-fashioned cemetery, a haunted soundtrack and a lighting scene, a gothic scene, a mirror showing the monstrous form of villains etc. Of course, the film is polluted by Mrs Dung's conversation with stupidity and ubiquity obsessions to desecrate fat people, which led to a totally unnecessary sub-plot of the teacher of violence, but among the manure there are roses.
