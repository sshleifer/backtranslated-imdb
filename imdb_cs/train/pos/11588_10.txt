This movie was great and I wanted to buy it. The boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young eagle. The boy must feed and care for the eagle until he is old enough to be sacrificed for the crops. the boy rescues the eagle from killing her and escaping from the trunk. The Eagle helps him feed by seizing a duck from a small pond that the boy has frightened. Later the boy shoots a deer that is claimed by a fat kid because their arrows have been marked very closely. Only until they check the thickness of the red lines determine who actually got the deer. But it was unfortunate because the other boys were even more cruel to him and eventually pursued him on the cliff, but when you think he falls from pure love to the eagle, he turns it into a golden eagle, the necklace as a reminder of who he was. somebody knows where i can buy this movie let me know. I have not seen it for more than 30 years, but I still remember the parts of film.deniselacey2000@yahoo.com
