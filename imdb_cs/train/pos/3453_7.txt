Although this film contains the first list of great actors, great special effects and a story full of surprises, it was not excluded for the distribution of the studio and went directly to the DVD. Perhaps it contains too much information about "anti-police force," or maybe too many action films released during overcrowding, but no matter how big screens have not taken the opportunity, luckily the new release concept on DVD allows us to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The theme is old: a news reporter reveals the inner circle of police officers who are damaged - in this case FRAT (First Response Assault and Tactical), a group of well-trained police officers designed to clean up the mythical city of Edison from a low crime scene, drugs, prostitution, etc. Working in secret of the temptation to pack confiscated goods and money has proven to be too opportunistic and now, 15 years after its inception, FRAT is responsible for murder, drug trafficking, terrorizing innocent people, etc. The lead dog is Lazer (Dylan McDermott, who makes a terrible real gangster!) and his partner Rafe Deed (LL Cool J, even more than usual, proving he can be a sensitive actor). Pollack reporter (Justin Timberlake) captures the wind of "bad mistakes," and reports his theory of fraud and corruption to his Ashford paper (always a gentle Morgan Freeman). Gradually, Polack convinces Ashford and Wallase (Kevin Spacey, also a consistently acting actor) to help Pollack in this investigative reporting. The closer Pollack gets to the truth, the more surprises and bad incidents happen and the story goes to the pall mall towards a series of unexpected results. Timberlake lacks charisma for leadership, especially in the company of such experienced actors. But LL Cool J, Freeman, Spacey and McDermott maintain a well-oiled film machine at the end. No, it's not a great movie, but it's one that lets you shift the edge of a hit from the newsstand. Grady Harp
