John Water's ("Pink Flamingos" ...) "Pecker" is the best movie I've ever seen. It gives the audience an unbelievable picture of life in Baltimore (I live in nearby Washington, DC), using Warhol colors, exaggerated movements and emotions. Pecker becomes bigger than his city is capable of managing, and is separated from his loved ones (including sexy Ricci) by his loving artistic manager. The image left me with a refreshing taste in my mouth - something like fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day - and though this taste was relatively flat and simplistic, it just made the whole thing deeper and more critical. It is a celebration of life, freedom and the right to wear weapons ... and everything else that this country represents. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
