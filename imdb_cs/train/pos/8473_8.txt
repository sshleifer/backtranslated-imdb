This beautifully nice and nice continuation of the successful "The Legend of Boggy Creek" is a sequel to the title. The stories extend into a sleepy, separate fishing community featuring the ominous Bigfoot creature called "Big Bay Ty," located deep in the unspoiled Boggy Creek swamps. Two Brothers Brothers and their older, more meaningful tomato sister (the sweet-rooted performance of the cute, pigtailed future "The Different Strokes", the sitcom star Dana Platov√°) are getting into a treacherous mud to check if the creations of the local legend could actually be real living beings. The trio lost hopelessly in a wild storm and furry, bearish, humongous, but the very gentle and gracious Sasquatch comes to the rescue of children. Tom Moore is an occasional, non-decorative direction to refer to this simple story in peace, carefree capturing the working details of a rural town in convincingly precise detail, drawing the most varied characters of the earth with great warmth and affection and fortunately developing sentiment in an organic, restrained, unforgiving way never degenerates into sticky-easy sponges. The adorable Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on "Gilligan Island") is taking the full-fledged portrait of a child-loving working-class girl, while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer joyful irascible support as a few quarrels of ol 'hayseed curly roots. Robert Bethard's capable solar cinematography portrays the forest environment in all its quiet, painfully clean and fragile, untouched civilization splendor. The score of Darrell Decku really fits in with the flickering synthesizer that intertwines the body and the cheerful banjo-pluckin 'country bluegrass into melodic sonic cooking. Besides, this picture guarantees a special praise, as she predicted that in the 1990's Bigfoot Vogue's baby star was fifteen years ahead of schedule.
