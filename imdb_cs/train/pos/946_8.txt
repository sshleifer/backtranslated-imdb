Since the Christmas celebration has evolved over the years, whether it focuses on religious or secular traditions, it is a time when people behave a little better. It was somehow around one Ebenezer Scrooge, a trader and money lender in the 19th century in London. As his nephew points to his uncle, he never holds Christmas, because Scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug. Humanity in Scrooge has been thrown away long ago, it's a tough case, much like its 20th century counterpart, Mr. Potter of Bedford Falls in New York. But as Charles Dickens narrated this story, redemption is not too late for us, and the lonely spirit and the three spirits visit Scrooge and show him how. Christmas Carolina is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that there is so much social commentary of the 19th century Britain as Oliver Twist. The characters in this movie are middle and lower class. Cratchites are a few steps above the street people in Oliver Twist, but they have to try to stay there. Still love and happiness radiate their home, not thanks to the boy who works by Bob Cratchit. Just like George Bailey, who had done a lot of good in his life and had to remember how much, Ebenezer Scrooge needed awakening in terms of the potential he still had for the old world. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart has almost taken over Scrooge in his live performances and shot. But George C. Scott captures the old fool into this movie pretty well. His stupidity, but with a trace of sadness that forces us to change. Scott has teamed up with a good tradition of people such as Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim, who both played Scrooge well. Among supporting roles, I'm David Warner as Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward as an eccentric and strict spirit of a Christmas gift. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, this is one of 32 versions of the Christmas card that has been archived and is one of the best.
