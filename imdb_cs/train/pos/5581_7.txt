This film was banned from American film houses in 1930 due to the nakedness of Hedy Lamarr (Eva Hermann), which caused problems among ladies in the 1930s but not for men. This story concerns a young woman named Eva Hermann, who married an older man and is moved across the threshold for a wedding night, and her husband never marries and worries about all sorts of very small things like shoes and killing errors. Eve leaves her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain her situation. On a hot summer day Eva takes her horse and decides to go swimming naked in a lake in the woods. Her horse runs out and runs after him and watches him by a young man who finds his clothes and returns them to Eve. These two people are very orientated and there is a romance that begins to bloom. There are many other interesting issues that arise when looking at this film to its end. Enjoy the great classic movie that was shot by Shocker in 1933. Enjoy it.
