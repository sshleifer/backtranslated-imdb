The low budget Brit pop melodrama focuses on the girl who wants to be a star, it happens once and then finds it all a little too much. A good voice and a sense of time and place can not hide the fact that we were all here before. Several scenes are a bit hysterical, and O'Connor's voice sounds much like a Mini Mouse! She disappeared out of sight shortly after filming this movie - so life can imitate art! You have to see if you want to see the punk version of Born star.
