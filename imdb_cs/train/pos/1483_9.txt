A sophisticated contemporary fable of stress that works to relax and ultimately unbind the promises of marriage. The main narrative is based on the homily spoken by a rural priest after the marriage vows of a young cosmopolitan couple from Milan. This describes the future course of marriage, which, in part, outweighs the stress of modern life. The "moral" story of this story lies in the fact that marriage has now been necessary in the past for family and friends to reach this relationship. This film was a relative obstacle to domestic Italian standards. It's a pity that this movie is not available on DVD or VHS.
