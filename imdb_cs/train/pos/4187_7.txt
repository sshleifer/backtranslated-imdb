That's a pretty good example of a movie noir. The setting is in the early fifties when the Communists attempted to steal the secret of arms from the US government. Richard Widmark is a magnificent pocket-maker with no barriers. He's doing quite a decent performance, but it's nothing. Interestingly, it was not just an anti-hero, but through most of the film, unlike the anti-hero. This is not quite normal. Jean Peters made such a performance as a golden-haired chauffeur. This beautiful actress, Thelma Ritter, shines like a dove. The conspiracy had its fair share of twists, shakes and hard talks. There is a combat scene near the end of the movie (in the metro station), which was quite harsh and exciting. I think fan noir (like me) will enjoy this movie. For viewers without noir it may seem a little dated and the whole thing of Commie is exaggerated.
