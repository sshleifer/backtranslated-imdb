a huge fan of Ramones. I like ramons, and I suppose if you hate them, then, besides being blessed Bush's supporter, maybe you do not like this classic. It's incredibly better than sappy john hughes teen movies and it's been 80 years. infinitely better than the American Pie that's afraid of us now. <br /> <br /> There are other great high school movies: Switchblade Sisters, Fast Times ..., Class '84, Three Eyes and High Cheese, yet grabbed (not possible) by Edge River. But RnRHS will always be my favorite because it's funniest and funniest and you can get up and dance with it. I love you, Riff Randell. <br /> <br /> 10/10
