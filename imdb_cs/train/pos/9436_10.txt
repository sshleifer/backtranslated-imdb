"Is it all up to you, Ed?" "Now you can play the game." The day my father left my mother took me to my new girlfriend for the opening day at Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. I was only fourteen years old. I was not entirely sure what I see, but I will never forget it, especially the scene with Ned Beatty. I'm watching her, thirty-six years later, still giving it to me. <br /> <br /> My father was a huge fan of Burt Reynolds, and that's why he stood in the queue for nearly an hour to watch what was to be an "action movie." I saw two films in front of the House: "Grand Prix" and "Song of Norway". Well it was not exactly Mario Andretti or The Brady Bunch. When I left the theater, I was shocked. But even in the very young age I appreciated the arts ... and when I saw again today, I am surprised that I am still standing after seeing this extremely disturbing but extremely well-done film. Suffice it to say that it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen-year-old who had not yet kissed his first girlfriend. I do not think my father took me for me, but it was very good for the baby. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I still feel utterly worrying, yet I still amazed the quality of the film. Burt Reynolds as an absolute miracle, as well as all the principles ... from Billy Redden as an inbred guitar amazement, Ronny Cox as a frightened insurer ... everybody is doing an admirable job. Audio quality is disordered, from screaming birds to ticking clocks. Photography, cinematography ... all the technical aspects of this remarkable film are the first. <br /> <br /> Moral questions raised from the assassination of sexual assailants to the consequences of the killing of human beings remain as deep as they did when the pioneering film was released. And the classic sequence of survival experiments in the wild after dealing with such unpredictable brutality are life-changing. These four men, urban men, suddenly confronted with a situation they had never realized, lifted the bar from action to horror. It's a classic that's sure. And the phrase "you have a nice mouth" was infinitely quoted, from Saturday Night Live to the notes on water-work cuffs, this film is undoubtedly a huge part of our social culture ... just like "Do My Day" or "I'll Return" . <br /> <br /> So what would you do if you found your friends who were sexually attacked by gunmen by mountain men away from your life in the city, cozy beds, wife and children? And if you took the action that Burt Reynolds was doing (and I would do the same), would you bury your body soon, or stand up for the test and take advantage of your chances? The bottom line is: Deliverance adds. You can take it to the bank. If this film does not get under the skin, you are not human. <br /> <br /> While you've seen it before, rent again and ask yourself the question above. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie remains the same: Ed can not kill deer ... then it changes. Life and unpredictable circumstances can change man. And I suppose it's the film Jon Voight is, like Ed, the best actor. And he remains one of the more talented actors in Hollywood history, from Midnight Cowboy to his highly underestimated performance as Franklin D. Roosevelt in Pearl Harbor, his acting lifting the film to a different level. Climbing the rocks at dusk, terrified and determined to do the right thing It must be seen that he believed them. I guarantee that your heart rate will increase to a new level. <br /> <br /> Fast-paced, tense, tense and tightly taped like a banjo string, it's a morale game that asks questions that remain. Times have changed, but our choices as human beings are not. <br /> <br /> Ten of the ten stars.
