In the 1970s, Charlton Heston starred in science fiction films of varying quality. "Soylent Green" is one of the better. Starring Robert Thorn, a detective in New York City in 2022. In this future, most foods are so expensive that everyone needs a product called Soylent Green. However, when Thorn discovers that this product is a terrible truth, he finds himself on the run. I think it's only natural that this film should look like a dated today. But it still brings interesting questions about what will happen to our agriculture. Also starring Leigh Taylor-Young, Chuck Connors, Brock Peters, Joseph Cotten and Edward G. Robinson (in their last role).
