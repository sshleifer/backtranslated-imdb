This movie surprised me. My friend told me this movie was "a cat". Boy, it was bad! This movie has a great family wish, without sex scenes, like other movies. Jake Gyllenhaal makes excellent work in Homer Hickam's shoes. Support is also great. <br /> <br /> Science, the coming of age, family quarrels, great train scene ... This movie has everything. The soundtrack is good, although the score is presented quite happily. The 50's let the music spear the film across the edge of grandeur. DVD is definitely worth it weighing in coal. The value of the play is great - I've seen it several times.
