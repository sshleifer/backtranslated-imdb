My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> I like this movie a lot. Compared to today's unattended movie (just action and special effect and nothing new about ideas), "Soylent Green" asks for something that does not exist anymore: Think. Well that would not be a big surprise the day when you eat the "cookies" that are created with the human body. With all that is happening on this planet and seeing how people are so indifferent to all, this kind of future is possible. Make sure this movie takes some time, but the idea behind the movie is real again. Rich in paradise, another in hell. Today it's lucky that it's television and idiots like "Reality Show". TV is a good toll toll. It is a shame that human intelligence has no progress as technology. From writing all the tracks. <br /> <br /> If you like a reality show, this movie is not for you. If you believe all politicians as well. If you do not like, ask yourself a question about it in the future, but never look at this movie.
