Alain Chabat is a gentle actor, writer and director, but perhaps a little misleading to take an "idea" for a story likely to have moved in the aisles when Aristophanes still taught that it was "me" before "e" C '. But as I said, Chabat is a fine actor, and he can make a spell when he needs it. I also gradually overcome the aversion to Charlotte Gainsbourg, who will also turn into perfect performance. If you absolutely insist on knowing, "conspiracy" is the one that concerned man in his 1940s and more than satisfaction. He does not sit well with his mother and five sisters, and to take them from behind, he makes a "deal" with a colleague's sister to represent - as fifteen thousand euros - as a new girlfriend that romance comes to make a wedding and then put it on, so get out of the hook. Of course they did, but there are some duels with Benedek and Beatrice on the way, and it all counts as painless for ninety minutes, and in the French box so good that the sequel does not have to be out.
