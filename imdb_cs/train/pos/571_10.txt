When I look at how the two brothers interact and come out of the whole movie, I personally like to live in a rural area as well as in a movie. I watched this movie countless times and had a book right next to my Bible. After watching the movie, I agree that it is one of the few movies that make a book of justice. I strongly recommend anyone who has the opportunity to go to Montana for fishing or outdoors to do so. That's gorgeous. I can not imagine anyone else who could play a role better than Brad Pitt. Take justice and watch one of the better movies in the modern film era. STRONGLY Recommend And as a guide for fishing trips both in Montana and Wyoming, do not try to learn to fly fish from movie scenes, because although it looks great on the movie you have no idea how many practice and skill fishing actually takes. Thank you for listening Watch this movie please if you want a long sad movie.
