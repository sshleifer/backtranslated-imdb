That's one of those movies you think about when you wake up tomorrow morning. It gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling and lets you smile on your face. Sure, we get to the typical stereotype characters and stories, but it does a trick: Fun. <Br /> <br /> Being from Sweden and living in the USA for some time, it's funny how we react. "A dead husband is about to kill him," "She (Gabriella) dies and then the heartbreaking end is bigger than life." We know how these things work, everything is finally being collected at the end. And yes. The characters were somewhat simple, they were so complicated that you did not think about it twice, nothing really was on your own imagination. The closest would probably be Siv, she asks herself if she really is in love with Daniel, but that's about it. But the movie is beautiful, based in rural Norrland, the music is absolutely amazing and the characters are nice. Michael Nyqvist is truly brilliant, with his crazy unique look and Frida Hallberg is charming and accessible. Maybe it's a bit nice. But most of the time you feel this movie, and that is the most important thing. You cry, laugh, hate and identify. I do not know about you, but it does not happen so often.
