I like Peter Sellers, most of the time. I have never seen it when this film was a British top. It does quite well, though you see in Inspector Clouseau's mix. It's not interesting until Goldie Hawn arrives. I never expected that the young Hawn would provide such a solid performance. Her timing was great, and her expressions were invaluable. The way he alternately shoots Sellers' downhill figure down and seduces him is beautiful to watch. Verbal sparring, as I rarely saw from the movie of that time. The last thirty minutes of the DOES movie looks like. It's worth it to have it just to see the first sixty. Hawn is naked for a couple of famous seconds. Enjoy it...
