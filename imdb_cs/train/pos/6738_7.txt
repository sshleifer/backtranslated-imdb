Where there is a pedestrian walkway, there is a fairly good film-noir crime drama and is shot in black and white and on-site as well. Copper accidentally kills a boy who is suspected of murder and protects himself, covers him and blames him from another person he does not like who has committed many crimes in the past. But to the end, he owns but not before he falls in love with a woman meets who is the lover of the person he killed ... Cast includes Dana Andrews (while the city is asleep, The Thief of the Demon), Gene Tierney (Laura, Ghost and Lady Muir), Gary Merrill (Mysterious Island), Karl Malden (The Streets of San Francisco), and Craig Stevens (The Deadly Mantis). Good parts of all. <br /> <br /> Where the pavement ends, it is worthwhile if you have a chance. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars of 5.
