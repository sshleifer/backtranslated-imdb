I love this movie. It's one of those that I can watch over and over again. This is a good act of a good cast that does not really try to be obsessed. <br /> <br /> The assumption that a new widow's housewife who turns to sell the pots to meet could be created an Americanized turd movie or action thriller. Either the movie would be completely destroyed. The film is played as Ealing Comedy with an amazing honest factor. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching just for a scene with two old ladies and a box of corn chips ... (it's not a spoiler!)
