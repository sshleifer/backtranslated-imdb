WOW! Co - a - film !!!!!!!!!!! I am not a fan of contemporary Italian directors at all. I usually do not like dramas. I'm not a fan of Will Smith super, even though he thinks he's a very good actor ...... but this movie! It's such a great movie with such an original script and in such a good direction and so good acting ... wow ... that's amazing. This film captured my attention for minutes, and I did not even like "happiness" (perhaps also because I did not like the behavior of Will's son, who is a very bad actor, while children usually look like all the natural born actors, I also saw yesterday at night in "The Day the Earth stopped" and confirmed my feeling that Jaden could not act). I do not want to write spoilers and I'm not talking about the story, but I can say that this film talks about love, death and other feelings I do not like in movies ... but THIS FILM is such a great movie. If you have a minimal heart, you will not regret watching it
