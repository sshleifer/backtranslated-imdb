This is my favorite classic. It was shot west west of Philadelphia, PA, when I was 13, in 1957 and released the following year. Then, in 1970, I found myself in the same region as a Newcomer state soldier. I always enjoyed viewing different places where scenes were shot. I knew the owner of the Downingtown Diner was good, and he had a front road sign that told all passers-by motorists that it was "a home of the stain". The theater scene was in Phoenixville, near Valley Forge Park and still still playing movies!
