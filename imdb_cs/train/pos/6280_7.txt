If you like cars, you will love this movie! <br /> <br /> There are some outstanding actors in the movie, especially Vinnie Jones, with its typical no senseless attitude and hardcase appearance.The others are not bad either. <br /> <br /> There are only two minor drawbacks to this movie. First, a poor conspiracy, but people do not look at this movie. Secondly, celebrating the magnificent theft of cars (automobile crimes). However, if people really think they can steal Ferrari and get along with them, then look at them well, I hope you have a good time in jail! When I first read that Nicolas Cage was to act as the lead, for the first time I thought "... sweet," but then I thought, "... naaaa ceai!" but finally, after watching the movie I realized, "yes, he sucked them!" Just joking that he plays the part very well. I will end this unusual review by saying, "If the premature extinction of the criminal had somehow enlightened the general cinema that was seen in the cruel form under the glossy veneer of the criminal life and inspired them to change their paths, then that death carries their own the nobility and the highest glory should be so happy You can say "bad punishment." I say, "Poor us." Angelina Jolie Voight looks quite nice!
