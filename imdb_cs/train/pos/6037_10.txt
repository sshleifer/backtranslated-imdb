What a great British movie screaming good laugh and sexy Gary Stretch too and oh, plenty of bikes and beautiful walled landscapes. Members of our club will appear at the ARROWHEAD Bike Club and the Trike Social Club Extras! Hurray!! <br /> <br /> There are really cheerful pieces, good acting, good idea. They met with director Jon Ivay at the Wareham show, Dorset. A great man, on the ground and good laughter. This movie must be supported, just like all the great British movies! <br /> <br /> So go and see if possible, have a website with the cinemas that show it, so find one of you! <Br /> <br /> I can not wait to get a DVD. Some of our cyclists have seen this movie twice or three times and could not get it. Amanda
