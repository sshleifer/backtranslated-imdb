Ghost Train is a gentle and entertaining film, typical of the better British comedy coolers of the 1930s and 1940s. The attraction of comedian Arthur Askey is not as fun as it once was, but it can be overcome by seeing him as a period or curiosity. For low cost military production Ghost Train is atmospheric, efficient and provides some real tension. Great fun for the dark (and yes, stormy) night. Lighten, remove the hat critic and enjoy.
