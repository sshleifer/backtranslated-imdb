I know it's rough and I know it's not a PC at all, but it's so funny. If you can prove that this has been since the early 1980s and carries all the stereotypes of time - and the movie still makes almost laugh - it's really a good comedy. Going with the tradition of what comedies are for thousands of years, the subject of this movie is exagerated. If you can pause your political correctness for an hour and a half, just make everyone laugh before you look at it. <br /> <br /> Would anyone want to put it on DVD, it's so hard to find on VHS anymore.
