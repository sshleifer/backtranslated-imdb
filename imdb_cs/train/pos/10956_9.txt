For those who think it's just humor and immaturity, you're actually helpless. While the show has its share of jokes, it also contains many satirical materials and tries to talk about social problems, racial barriers, clich√©s, stereotypes, etc. Just read some of the material a bit more than you want. <br /> <br /> What I like is that not everything is a punchline. For those who are waiting for a wit as Friends (I LOVE friends fyzi), you will not find it here. Instead, Sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve his humor, which is more realistic. We do not want to walk around this world and have humorous punchlines for everything he said, which is in most comedies. Instead, the Sarah Silverman program is more realistic in this sense. <br /> <br /> So do not take it as a soulless humor, because it's a lot more than that.
