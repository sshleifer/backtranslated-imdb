He deserves his prestigious Hollywood nomination, a fun little jewel with lots of pizzas and surprises. Extremely funny scenes include the merry shooting (and re-shooting) of the first world scene scene with Australian comedian Clyde Cook as an optimistic non-com and unlucky McDoakes as Boyer / Colman messenger? everything under Ralph Sanford's enchanting eye is beautifully angry with Anguish; the lost McDoakes led and re-directed the equally confused Jack Carson; Chandler's assistant was greeted by the opportunity McDoakes had sent: "I'll be a director!" <br /> <br /> Ace comedian O'Hanlon has a double role, playing McDoakes and playing McDoakes himself! Particularly, Richard L. Bare, who plays in one or more of the articles in the series, refused this opportunity. In real life, Bare is a young, six foot Rock Hudson looks, but here is made by a veteran actor (more than 500 films!) Jack Mower.
