I saw this movie when I saw it on Broadway. I like a Broadway musical and I love a movie. I watched the film as if it were not connected with the Broadway show. I'm a passionate reader and I've seen what happens to most books when they turn into movies, so I've developed philosophy really soon. Suppose the movie will be based on a book (or a musical in this case), but that while the story line may be similar, it will not be the same, it will be different, so watch it what it is. <Br /> <br /> I was dancing 12 years before I had to choose. I was a good dancer (he collected a chorus of work in local productions as a child etc.) But I was not excited. But I was excited as a rider. I told my dancing instructor and my coach (which I spent several months a year in his farm outside the state) that I had to decide when I turned 14. I needed to move from the dance two hours four days a week and ride 3 hours daily 7 days a week .. and devoted to one or the other. So I love dancers and I love this movie and a lot of other ballet and dance films. I just decided to watch this movie for what it is, it's a great movie about raw emotions and human interaction. It is the power of expectation and the heart when you work really hard to get something you want and you just will not get it. I love the movie. I like the Broadway musical.
