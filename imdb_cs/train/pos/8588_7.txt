Perhaps this is not the best movie of the year 2006, but it was just a movie that was to be excited and thoughtful. Sentinel is a good movie thriller that resembles or even borrows some elements from other thriller film films such as the In The Line Fire and the Manchurian Candidate. The basic plot of this film is similar to other films like this: The plot to kill the President of the United States. Michael Douglas plays as a secret service agent, Pete Garrison, who was involved in the surgery to find out later that he was framed. Kiefer Sutherland plays as a rival named David Breckinridge and Eva Longoria as Jill Marin, who is the newcomer of the agent who will be led by Agent Breckinridge and Academy Award winner Kim Basinger as first lady Sarah Ballentine. One improvement for this film could be more action because it's some sources considered just like an action movie like Thriller film but the good thing about this film is instead of just assassination plotting to kill the US president, it also concerns the mole (traitor) in secret service that leads the president in the wrong direction.
