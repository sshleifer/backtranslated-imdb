Julie Waters is great and Adrian Pasdar is revealing in a very warm, very real and extremely entertaining view of the complications caused by sexual dysphoria and transvestism in the life of a young executive director. At the heart of this movie is the very true truth that you have to accept yourself before you can hope others will accept you.
