For the first time, I saw the movie when it landed on the American cable a year after it came out. I blew my little head, I was only 16, and it was the first new wave of music I heard because I was a strictly folk, classical guy who grew up. Music has enchanted me as well as the amazing looks and charismatic vocal performance of Hazel O'Connor and the hard but soft manager Cockney Phil Daniels stole my heart. But I think Jonathan Pryce's exhausted saxophonist was my favorite. He was so helpless in the band and he was so harmless and poor, just begging for compassion. Favorite scenes, power off light and a love scene on the train. Okay, so the movie is not Rose! But it was really excellent for his limited budget and for his performance of Britain in the early 1980s, which exploded with rebellious youth and was looking for a way out of the queue below. I went to Britain just a few years later and found that the film was very reflective of the atmosphere I found when I was there. If you have a chance, look at it. It's a great movie with some amazing performances and music will blow you off. <br /> <br />
