When Harry Callahan got up in years, the inevitable story of an old man with a chip on his shoulder had to come to play. Callahan, who seemed fragile sometimes and on the spot, was still unwavering.

While the film did not do that, it was still a great addition to the series, although it was a bit out of place in the time of silly fashion trends and New Wave music.
