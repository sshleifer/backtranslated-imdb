Spoilers the following: I caught the book "Evil Angels" when she first came out when she did not know the case. Just to make a break here and to the Turkish people, I was a long way off before I began to question Chamberlain's guilt. The author, of course, intended the reader to understand why the public agreed on the conclusions they had made. John Bryson narrated the story just as the jury (and raised print) of the arterial sprays, the actelone plates, James Cameron's assurance that the collar had been cut off by shears that the child could not be exhausted from her clothes with buttons still doing, bloody hand print, etc., quite convincingly. After all, these were experts in their fields, who testified for no obvious reason, and the fact that the evidence was totally wrong was not at all obvious. It was also highly technical evidence, hard for the layman to understand. On this point, beyond some testimonies in the trials, barely anyone heard of the ding that invaded man; people did not believe it was possible. The public was suspected of the Seventh-day Adventists who seemed to be a culture of origin, and all sorts of wild conviction about them contributed to the guilt. It would not be devotees, selfless lawyers who worked tirelessly to investigate and disagree with the testimony of the statement, and when they find the azariace clothes later, it would not be enough to get Lindy out of jail. For that reason, the book shook me, and I was reluctant to conclude from the guilt of someone (except of course with the exception of OJ). I was thrilled that a film would be shot and I do not think it could be better. I've always liked Sam, with whom I have been able to fully identify myself, and Meryl was perfect as ever. Beautiful photo, scary music. I think it's not just a very good but very important film. It is a shame that she did not get more publicity at the time she was released.
