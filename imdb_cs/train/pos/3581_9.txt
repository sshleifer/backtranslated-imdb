I saw this film back in the eighties and almost forgot it when I noticed it was on TV again and watched it. I remembered that I liked this little sleep when I first saw him, and I still enjoyed it at the second glance. All actors, especially Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Wilfred Brimley, Frederic Forrest, and Jason Presson (as a twelve-year-old boy who feels responsible for the accidental shooting of his older brother's death) are excellent. The film has a real feeling - the understated, quiet and deeply moving story of the family suffering painfully. Dialogue is sparse, but it says, and verbal behavior is excellent. Just as a simpler rural version of ordinary people without a psychiatrist, but equally impressive family dynamics. The stone boy deserves the time and the emotional energy that looks at it.
