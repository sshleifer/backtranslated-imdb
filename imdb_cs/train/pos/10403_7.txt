It's the Oriental fantasy of "Thousands and One Arab Night", lots of incredible adventures, fantastic witchcraft, and magician. The painter's visionary Jaffar (magnificently played by Conrad Veidt) with powerful magical powers traps Prince Ahamad of Baghdad (an appealing John Justin) who loses his throne and then escapes thanks to the small thief Abu (sympathetic Sabu). They come to Basora where Ahamad and the Princess fall in love (beautiful June Duprez). But the prince and the thief are Jaffar scary, Ahamd is blind and Abu becomes a dog. The story accumulates a few fantastic ingredients, such as star transformation, a flying mechanic, a magical bow, a flying carpet and, of course, a colossal genie (beyond Rex Ingram) that gives the three wishes of Sabu, the magical eye, the figure of the Kali goddess with several hands. This remarkable painting ranks among one of the best fantastic movies of all time. Produced by Alexander Korda in London, Fima and directed definitively by Ludwig Berger, Michael Powell and Tim Whelan with the awesome screenplay of Lajos Biro and Miles Malleson, also dialogists writer and actor as a Sultan Fund for Mechanical Games. The outbreak of World War II caused a paralyzing shoot, then the three brothers and coworkers of the Cordy traveled around the United States and continued filming mainly in Grand Cannon Colorado. The outstanding visual and flash Technicolor cinematography, set-up and FX produced three Oscars: William Cameron Menzies and Vincent Korda's Production Design, George Perinal Cinematography, and Special Effects by Osmond Borradaile are dated today and there is an urgent need for remastering because the colors are worn out. In addition, she was nominated for evocative and oriental musical score Mikl√≥s Rozsa. This live story with huge doses of imagination will appeal to fantastic fans and film lovers
