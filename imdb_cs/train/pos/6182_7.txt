This murderous secret with musical numbers is long in the atmosphere and character, but rather short of tension and credibility. Based on Broadway's performance, Earl Carroll and others, it combines the intricate plot with the backstage atmosphere (the murder investigation takes place on the opening night at the theater where the music review takes place). <br /> <br /> The cast is impressive and diverse: the dwarf Victor McLaglen as a police officer who conducts the investigation and never listens to a showgirl that is in place; Jack Oakie (pre-war Jack Lemmon or Jack Lemmon as a post-war Jack Oakie?) As an annoyed director who must coordinate the show and the chaos behind the scenes; always cozy Jessie Ralph as a cloakroom with deep, dark secrets; Dorothy Stickney, who has a close end to a stunning, detailed monologue, is like a shivering servant lovingly in love with a male lead; Carl Brisson, a Danish star, like the very male lead, fights against classic "cocktails for two" not once, but twice; Kitty Carlisle, who operatively adds "Where are they coming and where they go" and other Johnston-Coslow songs; the famous Gertrude Michael, who soon split from us as a world-famous actress whose love for Brisson is denied; usually ridiculous Toby Wing, who is at least the center of laughter - gets into a joke. When the plot complications get out, there is always an interesting artist or fun and melodic musical number that drives the audience's attention. The most famous sequence of the film is "Marahuana" led by Michaels, but in addition to its controversial history, it is really one of the few musical offers. All the songs are introduced as if they could actually enter the standard room for the stage prospect, unlike the Busby Berkeley-style fantasy setting.
