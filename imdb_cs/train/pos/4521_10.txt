Julie Waters is always awesome, but Adrian Pasdar is a positive revelation in this horror comic play about transvestite that can not suppress his obsession and the changes he's going through when he finds them. He relentlessly avoids a vulgar, ugly simple joke for a real joke and a true insight and has an absolute ball when he does. Very nice, low, comfortable comedy
