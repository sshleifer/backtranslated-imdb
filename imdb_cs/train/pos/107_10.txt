Lars Von Triers Europa is an extremely good movie. As? Von Trier has a very stylized way of telling a story, at least with Europe. For me, the whole movie was an experience, even though I saw it on a small TV screen. Even with all the tricks, in my opinion, this film is the most complete REAL and movable part of the cinema, then most of the films on the list of 250 are the best. I also think this is perhaps the most frightening, most gothic and complete film. Well, good others are good, but this is my favorite. The final scene is one of the most difficult scenes ever.
