I'm obsessed! The story is amazing and the show is very addictive, but I like it. I'm in Season 2, Drive 5, and I tell you that I'm now too attached to the characters. If something bad happens to them, it will seriously affect my voice for the show. And Michael is on my list now. Kidding ... I'm so happy to see it's in Season 3 because I was afraid to go to Drive 6 and I thought it would end. I can not wait to see the rest. Thanks to the director / producers and the actors lost ... I like to watch TV again. Before I lost, I walked through every channel that went to bed sad because of my disappointment on TV, but I have to say Lost is my kind of fun!
