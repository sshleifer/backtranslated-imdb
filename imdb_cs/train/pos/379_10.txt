1985 was a good year for movies - maybe even great - but the one missing on gong has gone a long way to convincing fans that Oscar is a bit more than a hood adornment for good party members. <br /> <br /> 11 nominations and not just a title: such was the contempt of an academy for one of their greatest directors; and the one who had to wait another eight years before the prejudices were preceded by a statuary before he allowed them to give him 7 for Schindler's charter, which is probably not so good (and I'm half Polish). <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, Schindler was classical. And I do not knock out "Out of Africa" ​​(which won that year); but it was in my mind a class behind this: an epic tale of suffering and hope that brought me to tears-and I'm not a big rat. Perhaps it was music (excellent) or cinematography (a lot), but rather simply acting: Whoopi, who has shown us to be much more than just a comedy; Danny Glover, about which I have never heard before; and of course Oprah. <br /> <br /> The rest is history; but at that time: who knew it?
