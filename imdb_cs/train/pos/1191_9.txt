Robert Taylor as a buffalo buffalo hunter Charlie Gilson is the main character of this film. In the beginning, I thought Charlie would end up redeeming himself like John Wayne in The Searchers or James Stewart in Naked Spur. But as the film continues, Gilson still makes more atrocities until you realize that there is no hope for him. Stewart Granger is Sandy McKenzie, who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that buffalo will soon be gone and he becomes disgusted by killing. Gilson is a natural killer who does not distinguish between animals or humans. Debra Paget as an Indian girl is a surprising nature, given that censorship was of course at the time. He is in complete resignation with Gilson even though he hates him. The last scene of frozen Gilson is unforgettable.
