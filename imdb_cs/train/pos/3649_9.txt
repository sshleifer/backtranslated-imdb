I've seen a bunch of television films in my time as a student, most of which is the normal loss of time that American TV is throwing away. But he was well carved and drawn and at the end had a very nice turn. When I saw Richard Dean Anderson in MacGyver and Stargate, I was surprised by his excellent performance rather than the amount of A-B expressions he usually gives. It was a pleasant surprise to see Daphne Zunigu for quite a long time, dating back to The Fly II. It is also nice to see Robert Guillaume in the lead role. I can not say I was taken seriously by Jane Leeves after her Benny Hill days, but she managed to manage her role well. Everyone is a highly recommended movie.
