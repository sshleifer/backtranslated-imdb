Let me begin by being a widower at a young age. I was devastated because he was not ill - he died unexpectedly essentially coronary - his carotids exploded - died behind us. It was a lot of speculation on the part of the police, because he fell on him and began to form his head. I was suspected of murder until the autopsy returned. <br /> <br /> My children were as traumatized as I am, so I'm in love with a good father like him. I had three young children, no education, no financial support. I took it very, very hard. <br /> <br /> Over the course of two years, my in-laws attacked me orally, physically, emotionally and spiritually, I do not love children, I masquerade and show people what they want to see, not show them my pain during the holidays. No one happened to me and my choice if I were sitting on a holiday, of course, apart from the grief I saw that advised me to follow my heart and soul. My in-laws did not do it! I changed my relationship with FOREVER and never returned to vacation. This is just one example of how my grief has been disrespected! My own (new) husband saw me fall apart to talk about the trauma when I participated in my soul. I collapse, I can not breathe, hyperventilate, and in general I have disappeared for a few days if I even tried to convey hidden pain. <br /> <br /> Now about this movie ... <br /> <br /> Today my soul was upset, my heart broken. My fears and pain reappeared from the real demons that this film poses; how somebody mourns compared to how others and demons inside us expect. Adam Sandler has perfectly portrayed the terrible pain you face, overcome and above all work at your own time! This film has exhausted all the pain I have been struggling over the years. You see, if something damages your soul so deeply, so deeply that all the words that come from your mouth at the moment of thinking can not be dealt with without wanting you to be dead and going through dead life. <br /> <br /> The Bible has Scripture, Romans 8:26, that I held that when my mouth and soul do not know what to pray that the Holy Spirit of God carries this pain to the feet of God - - I do not have to speak. Sandler did it in a perfect way! <br /> <br /> There is a scene where he was summoned to court for mental health actions, and he came back to stand in front of his in-laws --- (known to me) --- and he tells them the stunning truth that he is himself that he can not go. It is a deeply powerful and powerful performance. I started crazy, and I found it hard to get out of the ward to get out of the theater and feel my feet too weak to do so. My son was with me and saw it first hand, my exact moves when I tried to keep it all together; a lesson for him, my youngest one, who hardly remembers his father. It was 13 years, but the movie brought me back to the moment when I lost my in-laws forever when they demanded a mask on my emotions and my surrender to their desires instead of my respect for my own. <br /> <br /> I write it so that if you are a griever, you are ready for this film, but you recommend it highly in Sandler's 1000 Observatory. <br /> <br /> If you are not yet a fan, use the lesson from his movie and just listen and accept the possibilities of people in their grief and let them find peace in their own time! Sometimes the soul can not say words to tell us our pain. <br /> <br /> Go see this movie with the tissues and not without preparing to get it!
