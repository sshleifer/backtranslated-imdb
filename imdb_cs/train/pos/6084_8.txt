I was satisfied with the reunion of renowned players. The story lies in the fact that you stand for something, even if you are in personal danger. At a time when violence and pain are often at the forefront of the film, this film focuses on an old good cop. Although similar similarities have been made repeatedly, these guys pull it out well. Kick back and enjoy yourself. Dennehy is the master of the film.
