Well, I gave this movie 7. It was better than "Thirdspace," but not as good as "In the beginning" when it comes to B5 movies. I really think the TV series has done a much better job with special effects and a characteristic display. Let's hope the producers and actors get another Crusade series up to B5 standards.
