This is a good adaptation of Austen's novel. Good, but not brilliant. Cinematography is ingenious and crosses the border, but it surely avoids making it look like boring TV soap in costumes because the whole story is a dialogue. <br /> <br /> The meeting is competent. Mrs. Paltrow is separate as her character requires, but the required distance from other characters is accompanied by much less appropriate separation from her own actions. In other words, she does not seem to care enough about the results of her matches. Some of the supported actors are guilty of over-performing - very in style that is appreciated on stage but on the spot in the movies. Personally, I had problems with accepting Alan Cumming as Mr. Elton - without his own mistakes, except that in The High Life he left the impression of a homosexual carriage - it is hard to accept that he plays a serious role. The actor's distinction is experienced by Toni Collette, who can radiate heat, and Jeremy Northam, who stands at the right level.
