Christmas together came before my time, but I was brought up on John Denver and songs from this special music were always my family Christmas music. For years, we had a cracking tape made from a record that meant it was Christmas. A few years ago I finally watched the video on Ebay, so when I listened to the music after 21 years, I saw John and Muppets in action for myself. If you ever have a chance, it's a lot of fun - great music, heart warming and cheese. It is also interesting to see the 70th version of Muppets and compare them with their newer versions today. I believe that Denver has really done some heat because it does such a show - I think artists normally do not compromise their pictures by singing with Muppets, but I'm glad it did. Even if you can not watch the video, the soundtrack is worth it. It has some favorite traditional favorites, but also original melodies from Denver.
