I first saw this movie as a young boy and I recently bought it on DVD. James Stewart brings great depth to the role of Chip Hardesty, a hardworking and specialized FBI agent. His life in the office is in contradiction with his family life, which is not all pink. His wife (the excellent portrait of Vera Miles) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of her work and even gets separated for some time; Chip's best friend and collaborator Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton) is killed in prosecution; Chip's son, Mike, is using the navy during the Second World War. Through it all the family continues with bravery and dignity. The events are very exciting and the semi-documentary style of the movie works effectively. And Max Steiner's music says everything; loyalty, bravery and integrity. This country owes large bonds to FBI men and women and yes, J. Edgar Hoover. If Mr Hoover's vigilance was observed, we could be spared 9/11, the increase in crimes against children and many of the venal politicians that we had to reject.
