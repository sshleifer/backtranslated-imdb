"Ranma Â½" is my favorite anime by Rumiko Takahashi. This woman really knows how to have a good story, it's not just a comedy but also an action anime. The main character of the story is Ranma Saotome, who is also an expert in martial arts. is involved in Akane for the arrangement of both fathers who are great friends and trained together for many years. <br /> <br /> Akane is the younger and most violent nurse Tendo: Kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and Nabiki is in the middle and loves to win the money no matter what. <br /> <br /> Ranma and Akane fight all the time, especially because they are both very bad and when she finds out Ranma becomes a girl when she gets cold water, just as his father becomes a panda, they start to discover lots of new characters and situations. They also discover the reason for the transformation: while fighting, Ranma and his father fell into a cursed river, but not only had that kind of fate ... <br /> <br /> If you were looking at '' Ranma 1/2 '' and I would love to recommended '' Inuyasha '' and '' Maison Ikkoku '', two other good creations from Rummy's hands.
