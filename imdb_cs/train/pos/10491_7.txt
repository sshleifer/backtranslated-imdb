A gorgeous gentle comic gem, until the last five minutes, which detonated into the run of British television farce. The last five minutes cost me 2 points in my rating. Despite this great conspiracy and stylish scarcity, it is worth watching the status of acting and the unique setting of Cornwall. Many great little pieces, such as the tense eternity we all go through, we are waiting for bank approval after an official has frozen a credit card ... has increased when we are not - quite certain that the card is not matched.
