Okay, so it's a few weeks late, but it's here. It is mostly because of the statements of various negative nature. Starting with technology. When Star Trek: TOS ran, the special effect technology was extremely low tec and more than that, the crew had little money to do any correct fake ups. At the 35th anniversary of the TOS season, the Star Trek crew became an expert in the economy. Eventually they decided to leave the TOS look completely and turn TNG et Everything. So what if they decide that the carriers will not be golden glitter or that Phase Guns will look closer to Star Trek II? As for the first contacts with the Klingon Empire, it was assumed, based on Kirk and Riker's comments, that the Earth met the Klingon in 2200. Nothing was firmly established. The business gives us the most promising spot of exploration we've seen in a while. That's what Voyager COULD was. No series needs to evolve without some distrust, but be grateful that Star Trek has so little. So, stop grabbing and enjoy yourself.
