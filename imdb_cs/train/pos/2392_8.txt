Beats Barney, you can not get the songs out of my head ... must ... stop singing ........ Doodlebops songs. ....... TEÄŽ. <br /> <br /> I have 10 lines of text, so I have to go on ..... What if they call all Canadian things like OOOUT Aboooot. Whiskey Canadians ..... Jazmine is too rhyming, must be Dutch. <br /> <br /> Knocking Knocks Who's There, Dee Dee, Super Hottie <br /> <br /> Bus driver Bob can not dance, take the lesson from Rooney
