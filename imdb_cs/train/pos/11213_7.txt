This second film is just as interesting as the previous one, with the difference that there is no tension. We know what he will do and what will happen before he even marks the screen. Pleasure comes only from the way various tricks are done and their succession. We know that the car will be dynamite to lose a bicycle that the car will crash just to talk about the car. And that will happen. Details and details are for you to discover them in the movie. The fact that he can be stunned by a silly woman is obvious and has to come, but we know he already saw it and knows he was dragged into it. And how will he get it? That's what you need to find out for yourself. And do not worry it will get a major trader, but how's the next story. The speedboat can not match our lush beaver on the river. We also know when he will be wounded. They did not know what the fireproof jackets were in those days. It is true that recently it has been found that some GIs do not have such equipment in Iraq. But what is the meaning of such a movie? This urgent insistence on human traffickers and this blindness that does not see it as a ban that causes the problem. But the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value that could be in the path of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil. Why simply do not legalize these goods to be properly monitored and monitored? When something is not illegal or pushed out of the way, the less fun to use is to do it. <br /> <br /> Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
