Polanski returns to the themes of loneliness and insanity he explored for such a huge effect in Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby at The Tenant. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is a trademark of Polanski - dark, embarrassed, nervous - but there is something that is unpleasant on this film and I'm not sure whether it's intentional or not. Sven Nykvist, who was responsible for some of Bergman's most beautiful films, does not have justice. Since his name was one of the things that really attracted me to this film, I was a bit disappointed that the film is really impressive cinematography. The only thing that really lets film down is acting. Polanski is certainly not a bad actor, but he seems to have a bit more to chew with the difficult role of Trelkovsky. Some of the supporting cast are great, especially Melvyn Douglas as a landlord, and Shelley Winters as a concierge, but others are weak and miskast. It is also difficult to overcome the fact that all these presumed Parisians have American accents. <br /> <br /> Quite unexpectedly, there are some gentle moments in the movie in a dark comedy. Everyone who saw The Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polanski is definitely a good comedian actor. However, there are times when it is dangerously approaching parody itself. Trelkovsky's sudden (and somewhat inexplicable) "transformation" is much more likely to cause laughter than eyebrows, which aggravates what was to be a strong moment in his psycho-dramatic way. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a nice and exciting experience if it's a little too exaggerating for your own good. There is a handful of exceptionally cool moments and still uncomfortable and predictable atmosphere, but this film, although very good, does not record the brand as successfully as it could. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, at the end of the day, "okay" Polanski's film is still better than most other "good" movies. Definitely worth watching, do not expect them to be blown away.
