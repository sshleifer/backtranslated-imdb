I like the movie a lot, but it's a fact that you can not understand it if you are not from the former Yugoslavia. Most actors are now dead and these were the best actors in the former Yugoslavia. I appreciate that this movie is now on Divx and I can have it in my collection. Macedonia. Serbia. Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia. Slovenia. It was all from the former Yugoslavia, melting the flasks of the Balkan peoples. It could be a blind country if Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other nationalists did not poison the human mind with their bad thoughts.
