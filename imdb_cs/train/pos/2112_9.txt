In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan (as Klára Nováková) becomes a clerk in the gift shop; there he quarrels with a collaborator of James Stewart (like Alfred Kralik). They both can not get in because everyone has fallen in love with an invisible pen. Watching Ernst Lubitsche pointing these stars inevitable is predictably satisfying. <br /> <br /> Even better is a partial conspiracy involving business owner Frank Morgan (like Hugo Matuschek) who suspects that his wife has a matter. To receive a private detective, Mr. Morgan confirms that his wife at the age of 22 has sex with one of his younger employees. Morgan, painfully realizing she "just did not want to get up with me," and supporting characters are what keeps this movie from the old one. Shop around the corner (1/12/40) Ernst Lubitsch ~ James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut
