The "Second Beginning," as the name explains, shows us the beginning of the end of the human race. Long before the matrix existed, this short anime written by Wachowski shows us the world that could stand against us in the near future, set at the turn of the 21st century, the second Renaissance throws itself into problems in common with human behavior; greed, power, control, vanity, etc. The use of robots or artificial intelligence as slaves or servants is common among sci-fi / fantasy stories. The second renaissance is not excluded for this concept, but instead of a simple human distribution. The machine explains this story of the struggle that machines carry, the struggle for admission in a world dominated by humans. Where matrix movies show a human perspective, these short animations tell both sides of the story. The second renaissance part 1 + 2 answers many questions from the original Matrix movie, such as the war broke out, how the sky was obscured, which led to the use of people as batteries, and also introduces us to a machine town called 01, which may be important for the forthcoming Matrix Revolutions. <br /> <br /> I will not let too much of a story because I do not want to destroy the audience's experience, but I recommend it to anyone interested in the world of matrix or just any interest in Japanese animation (anime). <br /> <br /> 9/10.
