I watched this movie in joy. This is perhaps one of the best movies of all time. It has timeless value, you get so much of it is amazing. There are parts that move, funny and just great. All aspects are in place, the story is perfect, every detail is 100% original, even small Irish finesse are covered. <br /> <br /> Using low and high shots gives two great views of Cristy (beware). <br /> <br /> The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is incredible. I have never seen an actor doing it. It's really awesome. And it's so great to watch, the flow so good, it's probably the closest thing you can get on real life experiences. I love it. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen them, you should see it. You have no doubt that there is something for everyone.
