I just watched this film in my GCSE history class. it was thrilling and was a great glance at what happened to Steve Biko at the time of apartheid law. How can anyone say that this film is the busiest or darkest two and a half hours of my life, I do not know, because it started from the beginning to the end. it was great how Denzel Washington portrayed him and showed how he was fighting the apartheid law and gaining the same rights for blacks. In one part, Steve Biko tells the policeman that we are as weak and human as you are, it is to show them that he and all other black people in South Africa do not differ from white. Donald Woods inspired me because the fortress for what he believed and completely did not believe in apartheid. He and Steve Biko have created a very strong friendship that shook southern Africa and continued to awaken the world. I really liked this movie and I strongly recommend it to people. helped to see that racism is not right and that everyone is the same, their fate should not be determined by the color of one's skin. n
