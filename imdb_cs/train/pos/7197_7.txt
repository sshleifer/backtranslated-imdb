Zorro had several films, some even in Europe, such as Alain Delon. This is also played by outstanding actors such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but for me the best always was Reed Hadley. This series gives you the opportunity to take a look at the interesting West, where you discover at the end of his real villain, Don del Oro. The series also has good performances of B movie actors such as Ed Cobb, ex-Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King, and Hadley's very good performance as Zorro. He was quick, smart, well-liked whip and sword, and his voice was best for all Zorro.
