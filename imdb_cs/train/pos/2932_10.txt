I have seen my fair share of comedy and film standby, but this one is so original, so fresh, it will think of why you have always walked straight through the video rental. Murphy has some pretty funny jokes, but that's just too fun. If only every movie could be so entertaining. it should be called "107 minutes of the most incredible comedy" Murphy is a comic genius in this movie and will tell you "that's the guy who's dr. doulittle!" They talk about ice cream, mothers with boots, aunt with a mustache, racism, and all the others you could think of and those you could not. Please, if you ever saw a comedy in your life, that's all if all the movies could be Delirious.
