No, this is no tale of Alice, my friends! This Wonderland Wonderland is based on a real story about Wonderland's haunted murders that occurred in the 1980s in California. At the heart of this bloodshed he was not alone "Johnny Wad" himself. Yes, John Holmes! Daddy ding-dong used other shotguns than his infamous 13-inch dairy machine. Besides being a legendary adult film actor, Holmes was as hard as a drug addict who had become friends with various Hollywood addicts. Val Kilmer was occasionally magnificent like Holmes, but for one Holmes figure it did not work. The film has supporters: Josh Lucas and Dylan McDermott as Hollywood riffraffs, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow as women in Holmes' life and Eric Bogosian as a horrific Tinsletown businessman. These characters play an integral part, directly or indirectly, in the wounds of "Wonderland". From this supporting group was Josh Lucas, who was most ferocious and impressive as the zealous Ron Launius. Lucas gradually escalates to a prominent Hollywood player with such charismatic turns in "A Beautiful Mind" and "Sweet Home Alabama." Director James Cox has sometimes turned out to be a little co-excited by displaying a huge number of over-exploding scenes, as well as the famous organ organ. Holmes was finally liberated from the "Wonderland" murders. He died of complications of AIDS. "Wonderland" will think about what really happened in that bloody night, and if Holmes really put his gun on it. Oops! Wrong Holmes movie! OK! That's enough, before I get penislized, I mean penalized. Bye Holmies! *** Average
