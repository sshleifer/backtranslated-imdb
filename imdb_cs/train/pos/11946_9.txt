*** 1/2 Scarlett Johansson, Woody Allen, Hugh Jackman, Ian McShane, Romola Garia. Director Woody Allen. Immediately after working with Johansson on "Match Point," they both returned for "Scoop" Corky, a zany and fun comic ride. When a student reporter (Johansson) discovers a new hill from a dead reporter (McShane) when he enters the materializer of a wicked wizard (Allen). The blade is from the new Tarot Card killer in London, which can be a luxury by Peter Lyman (Jackman); while Sondra and Sid play a detective Sondra that falls in love with a handsome killer. Allen finally hit a mark, not as good as Match Point, but certainly more fun. I laughed much more than I expected, one of the years must be seen
