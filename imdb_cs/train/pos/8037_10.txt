"One shot, one killing, no exceptions." You have to find out if you are a navy or a sniper. two big thumbs up! Great story, great camera work, good track, action, details and more. Quite close to the real thing. But it's not a movie that would fall apart and pick up editing errors. it's sitting and having a good 99 minutes. The conspiracy has a certain depth, but this movie does not really mean you think. It's about how to enjoy the sniper style of life and action. Sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good watching, but the first is still the best overall movie. Tom Berenger does a great job, plays his character and shows the hidden side of the sniper's life. to deal with all death. You must see for sniper fans.
