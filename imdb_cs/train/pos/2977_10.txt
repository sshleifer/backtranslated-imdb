There are so many words I would like to use to describe this movie, but can not it really do? This movie is a movie you can see if you just want to sit, laugh, cry and then smoke. I'm serious. Do not watch this movie if you are easily offended by nausea, sex, nudity, homosexuality ... and everything else connected with nature. Being a woman, and it may not even be a factor, I can watch this movie over and over again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant. Along with all other debates, I think Baseketball is the winner of the prize. Now I laugh, just thinking about the stupidity they're making in the movie. Watch a film!! That's all I want to say. It's hard for me to leave this comment because I'm one of those people like Ozzy Osbourne, who has a damn word in almost every line that's out of his mouth when he talks. So it's professional. The best movie. Heck yeah!
