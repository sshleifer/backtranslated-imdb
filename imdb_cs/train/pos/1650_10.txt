Excellent series, masterfully controlled and managed, but unloved (told me) by Mr Deighton and appealed for a single presentation. Now it is only possible to see them in private collections and through the British Film Institute at special request. Very unfortunate, as Ian Holm's nuanced depiction of the exhausted but determined Bernard Samson is excellent; one of his best performances. Support for the cast, including the young Amanda Donohoe and Hugh Fraser, are excellent. When Mel Martin played a conflict and treacherous wife and Michael Degen as a Mercenary Werner, the story positively accompanies the tragic and fatal personal consequences of a great game.
