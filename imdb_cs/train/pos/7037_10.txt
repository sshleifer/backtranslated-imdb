It's a great political satire. No wonder why it was largely ignored in the US: it expose our murderous foreign policy to what it really is. Another good film of this era, Rendition, has also been totally rejected simply because it has accurately shown that the US is a war machine that targets torture, killing and hurting civilians in search of world domination. A clever plot, good acting, some great stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei somebody?) And some gigs of merry should make this movie hit. Unfortunately, Americans do not like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are complicit in a mass murder.
