Okay, here is my personal list of top Nicktoon concerts like today: <br /> <br /> 1. All Adults / SpongeBob SquarePants <br /> <br /> 2. My life as a teenage robot <br /> <br / > 3. Invader Zim <br /> <br /> 4. CATSCRATCH / Rugrats <br /> <br /> Do you notice the words only in capital letters? That is, it's a Nick show that I'm going to talk about. <br /> <br /> "Catscratch" is basically simple but a great animated comedy about three rich cats - Mr Blik, Gordon and Waffles - into special and truly surreal situations, from trying to connect with human Kimbaley's sleep behind root beer to save the planet from slugging slug. This is one Nick's show that sooner or later you will simply experience your funny dice! The theme song is catchy and unforgettable. Music actors - including Wayne Knight of the Seinfield series - bring characters to fresh life with very special characters. Stories are pleasant (episodes of fans would be "King of All Root Beer" and "Gordon's Lucky Claw"). And humor is happening in some sort of Jim demons. <br /> <br /> So at the end, "Catscratch" is one of the Nicktoons series, like "Invader Zim" and "MLAATR", which is becoming very, very popular all over the world in just three seasons or less.
