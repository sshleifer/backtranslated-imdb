It's one powerful movie. The first time I saw it, the Scottish accents made it hard to understand a lot, and it destroyed watching. I gave up, but then I got a DVD, I used English subtitles when I needed them, and I really got into this movie when I found out how good it was. It's great. The widescreen image makes it magnificent in parts, with some amazing rough scenery, and the story reminded me of Braveheart, the story of good and evil. Here's Liam Neeson (good) vs. Tim Roth (Evil). They both do their job well. Several actors face contempt as Roth. Man, you really want to beat that guy in his arrogant, irritating cat. (It's so unpleasant and abhorrent that sick critics love their character more than anyone else). Neeson is a man and a solid hero because Gibson was in Braveheart. Jessica Lange is as strong as a woman. The film draws you and gets you into full engagement, so you're ready to have an emotional experience.
