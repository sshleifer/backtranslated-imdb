This movie will do the right thing. As a former USAF cadet, I can tell you that this movie has everything. Full processing of the application. Waiting for the word. The joy of admission. He is bothered by going through the course. The sorrow of watching friends (maybe the best) is washed out. Anxiety about paying the final price - the death of students flying students. Glory Promote. Always flying, flying, flying. Many are called, but little is selected. We did what we would eagerly pay for.
