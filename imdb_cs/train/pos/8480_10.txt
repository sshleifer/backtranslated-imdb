Thanks to Warner's archive, I can see this mammoth, colorful show that fits everything except a kitchen sink. (Van is present.) This film gives the screen time to all people who were at the time of the Warners deal. If some artists look unknown, it's because they were big on quiet days and most of them disappeared with the popularity of the talkie. There are really remarkable artists from the era of vaudeville as well. You will be most impressed by Winnie Lightner, who carries two numbers. Also there is that French star, Irene Bordoni who croons love song in a sexy way. Perhaps one of the world's greatest successes is the two-layer Technicolor "Chinese Fantasy", which was restored for this release. She is really beautiful and stars Myrny Loy and Nick Lucas. Eventually there is a massive final of "Lady Luck", which lasts for nearly a quarter of an hour. This is a really epic episode of early mischief. Every fan of the old movie will love it.
