it's a weekend that I watched this fun movie. and I really like it. all children are cute, reminded of my childhood with that stupid thought. it's a really funny movie for a group of families at night weekends that could make a lot of memories and laughs. Kid's humor always works. nice acting as well. a simple story, but great shooting. a nice job to find a child's way. when it comes to children's film, I think of "12 and holding". another this year, but a different aspect from the child world, which is real and cruel. amazing work. H2EFW focuses on the happy childhood that every child and family need. p.s. Twitch, I think, is the voice of Nemo from "Finding Nemo."
