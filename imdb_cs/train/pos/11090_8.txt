Successful self-married merchant Harry Mitchell (an excellent fist performance by Roy Scheider) has an adulteress with young stripper Cini (gorgeous Kelly Preston). Harry is blackjacked by a trio of lots of little hoodies - dirty porn theater manager Raimy (gorgeously slim John Glover), antsy leap joint owner Leo (well-played Robert Trebor), and crazy pimp Bobby Shy (a very intense Clarence Williams III) - who recorded their relationship with Cini. When Harry refuses to pay, the hood kills Cini and looks like Harry did it. This again ignites the dangerous battle of joke and wills between Harry and the hoods. Director John Frankenheimer, who adopted a heavy script based on Elmer Leonard's thriller's romantic novel, professionally maintains a steady pace, brings a lot of grip on tension and effectively creates a convincingly disordered atmosphere. The guides are all equally excellent, with excellent Ann-Margret backing turns like Harry's bitterly neglected wife Barbara, Vanity as harsh prostitute Doreen and Lonny Chapman as Harry's loyal business partner, Jim O'Boyle. A hardly known conspiracy keeps viewers on their fingers. Badly profane dialogue, glossy cinematography by Jost Vacan, blinking Gary Chang, a sharply amoral tone and an exhaustive conclusion are just as much money. As an additional bonus, both Vanity and Preston take their clothes. A very strong and satisfactory small number that is worth to opt out.
