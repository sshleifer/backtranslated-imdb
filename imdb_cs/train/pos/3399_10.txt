It was Eddie Robinson's 101st film and his last film, and he died of cancer nine days after filming. Everything that makes his key scene in the movie much worse. Although some styles of hair and clothing are a little dated (also remember that the video game is in the movie), but the subject movie is almost timeless. Heston said he wanted to shoot the film for a while because he really believed in the danger of over-population. Several things make this movie a classic. The story is solid. Acting is a top-notch, especially the interplay between Heston and Robinson, with fine performances as Cotten and Peters. <br /> <br /> Music is absolutely perfect. The column of Beethoven, Grieg, and Tchaikovsky combined with pastoral visual elements creates for some truly moving scenes. It was ice cream for the movie. <br /> <br /> And the theme (or "point") of the movie is significant. Yes, it's a movie about excessive population, but more importantly, it's a warning story of what might seem to Man's Earth Man. It's in the subtext that you find the real message of the movie. Watch out for what Sol says about the "old days" of the past (which is our presence), and note how Thorn is incapable of understanding what Sol says. This film is one of my top sci-fi movies of all time.
