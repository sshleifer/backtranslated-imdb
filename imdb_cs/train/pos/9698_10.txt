I have seen this film numerous times and for my life, I can not understand why some people compare it to BABE. This film is not about the secret life of all the animals that can secretly talk. Instead, it is a parrot who learns to talk to help his owner, a little girl with a serious coquettish, overcome her speech barrier, just to say good-bye to her heart. Then a great journey begins. Paulie Parrot is trying to find his one great girlfriend Marie. On the way, he meets several beautiful people and numerous unpleasant people. She falls in love with a parrot girl and loses her. He gets a crime into life, and then he's caught by a bad scientist who wants to abuse him. He writes his story to sympathetic Janitor in a laboratory who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved Mary. <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub shines like a kind Janitor who has an open mind and big heart and who decides to help little Paulie despite the risks. Jay Mohr plays a parrot voice and one of the most powerful characters he encounters. <br /> <br /> There is a little suggestive language, but this movie is suitable for most children and even more so if parents attach fun and observation. It's a funny, clever, epic story of animal-adventure and finally a great love story about the bird and his girlfriend. Looking for Mary ends with an unexpected surprise for most people who do not know much about parrots. Children who have seen wild parrots of green parrots in Los Angeles and Pasadena will benefit in particular from making this film and understanding that birds, especially parrots, are not single-breasted pets. Every child everywhere sees that pets are deeply attached to themselves and that the love and fidelity of a dog or parrot is a gift to be valued. <br /> <br /> So do not BABE here, more incredible ways with twist. <br /> <br /> Enjoy and try not to break through the sad parts.
