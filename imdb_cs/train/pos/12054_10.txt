I first saw this film in Britain in December 1989 when it was broadcast to Central TV. I still have a videotape even though I wear it (many friends and family have borrowed it over the years, and it has also cooled it!). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I remember coming back home at night, grabbing Christmas screaming, turning off the lights and watching what was being promoted as a "Christmas Story of the Spirit." Even now I remember some scenes that are still sending the hair on my neck standing at the end ... I've seen some comments about the movie that say it's not this and not ... I think these people are afraid by Friday, and the like, stem and slash, which are ridiculous. This is the "traditional" ghost story; there is no big budget action or special effects ... no curses, no blood, no free sex scenes, no chain saws or guns etc ... So how refreshing !!!! It's atmospheric. If you like a cool horror, a well-written, well-done and really scary atmosphere, it's a movie for you. I like the original horror; just last night I saw the original Haunting and that's a great movie. Again very atmospheric - and so is the woman in black. The end of the movie differs from the book, but it is still very good. I recommend it. Try it ... you will * like it if you like traditional ghost stories ... So ... turn off the lights, raise the fire, lock the door, grab the drink ... and enjoy ...:).
