Is it hard to rate such movies because you are doing it for production or just fun? I noticed this film in 1988/89 or so when I was a boy and I'm sorry to say that she's started a long life fascination with ninjas. The conspiracy is quite terrible, and acting is horrible, of course, but in this movie there are some secrets that surround the ninja, which is a pretty good atmosphere. Combat scenes are important, while "small" sparces are really good. I have to say that it was better when I was a boy, but now I can see the obvious points of incredible nonsense in the film, but as a "sit with a few beers" a movie about martial arts, I can not miss it, it is much better than the "Ninja" the waste that was launched in the 1980s with hundreds of boys in a black suit, but really a good fight scene. An interesting note is Dusty Nelson, the writer and director of Sakury Killers, who made another Bonaire-based ninja film called "White Phantom". I have no idea if it should be a sequel to Sakury Killers, "but the Sakura Clan is once again the main feature, including the same logo a similar story, just this time, including a white ninja. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So if you are a martial arts fan, then give it a blast kill a few hours!
