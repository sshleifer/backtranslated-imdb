Although I really enjoyed the last "serious" performance of Jim Carrey ("The Truman Show," "The Man on the Moon"), I always thought his true genius lies in a physical comedy. This does not mean he's a fantastic, talented actor: he does not seem to like academics at the academy, he never had a (really deserved) nomination or prize. Well, every "institution" that nominates 11 Oscars as "Titanic" should not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> "The Grinch" is the sweetest, best-looking, best-performing, nicer year of "The Nightmare Before Christmas". Both films seem to be very similar, with their highly styled set and the premise that someone steals Christmas. The two main factors seem to be villains (one at a higher level than the other), both have a strong moral lesson and both are really nice. So when you realize that Jack Skellington is a doll and Grinch is a human being. But a human being that is so incredibly expressive, so fluent in his movements, so cartoon-like, so unrealistic that he never gets into the path of the film. He can be cheerful, he can be a sad soul, he can get angry. He lives in a three-dimensional world where three-dimensional people live. He jokes, laughs, weeps and finally saves Christmas. I loved this movie to pieces and could not wait to come out on DVD. This is one of the films that really enjoy 10, 20 years. Timeless as they come.
