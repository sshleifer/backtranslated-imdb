It's a little worrying to have a character named Gig Young ... in the movie, played by Gig Young. But this movie is where Gig got his name and also a good career boost by playing small parts under a different name. I'm going against most of the other comments and I say that I really enjoyed this movie, mainly due to the live performance of Barbara Stanwyck as Fiona. She was funny, angry, vulnerable, caring and feisty like the oldest of the three daughters whose mother had died on Lusitania, and whose father was later killed during Woar's War I. As a "man" in the house, Fiona had stood a long struggle against the satisfaction of Father's will , which would allow Donald Trump, on behalf of Charles Barclay, to get a family home. But Fiona keeps a secret why he hates Barclay. Geraldina Fitzgerald is a mid-level coquettish sister who is married to an Englishman but longs for a friend of her youngest sister (Gig Young). If you're a Stanwyck fan, it's not a miss.
