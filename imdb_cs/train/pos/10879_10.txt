I wanted to see the cut from the day I heard about it, which was the past year. Anyway, I saw today, and when the movie started, I thought it was starting a week but it improved after 10 minutes. I thought the movie was pretty good. but what I did not like was how the murderer was created, I was thinking just before I leased that it would probably suck up like Urban legends: the final cut, I almost died. mostly everything in the final cut UL was needed to improve. CUT is 100 times better than UL: final cut. The best part of the CUT is murderous and deadly scenes. The killer kicks MO F *** ING ASS. <br /> <br /> I give a cut of 8 out of 10
