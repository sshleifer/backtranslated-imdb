Unlike those who hate Christianity, the 700 Club provides real answers and inspiration. It also provides reliable news, logical comments, and other opinions than ABC, CBS, NBC, and PBS are considered to be the best. Unlike other programs that provide social and faithful comments, those behind Club 700 provide help to those in need, such as feeding with hunger with the Operational Blessing, providing medical assistance to those who live in poor communities and give hope to those who need hope. This is not hateful at all. If the club 700 is insulting, I recommend you reach the remote control and turn the channel on your TV. I do the same when I find CNN newsletters or programs that I find interesting or offensive. What I find to be offensive is the way the ABC family inserts a warning that the views of Club 700 do not reflect ABC's views.
