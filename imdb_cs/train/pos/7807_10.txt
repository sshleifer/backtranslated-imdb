The performance of each actor and actress (in the film) is perfectly NATURAL, which is what should be acting actor; and over-the-job skill is so greatly done on all the details I've never been tired of seeing it over and over again. However, I am quite surprised that this film is not included in some of the directors and directors that bring me Attenborough's credits: Are they proud to claim that they have made such an excellent and long-lasting film audience? I hope to get some answers to my puzzles from one (maybe one of the "insider" films).
