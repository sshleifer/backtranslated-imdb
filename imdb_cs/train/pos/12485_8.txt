I just watched this movie and I have to say I was very impressed. It's very scary and has many moments to get you out of the seat! I had to smoke several "emergency" cigarettes to calm my nerves! If I had to criticize, I would say that even if there was something, there were too many jumping moments. It got to the point where each new scene culminated in a jump and it gradually lost a fleeting effect because you are something new that comes. Although it contains virtually every clich√© in the genre of spirits, they were all done so well that they kept scary fear. She had elements of The Shining, The Sixth Sense and The Changeling (especially the soundtrack reminded me of The Changeling). I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for old old fashion!
