I like this presentation - I read Bleak House and I know it's so hard to imagine the whole book as it should be, and even others like Little Dorrit - I have to admit they made a very good show with the staged Nicholas Nickelby. I love Diane Rigg and see the pain of Lady Dedlock, even despite the expected arrogance of the aristocracy. I'm sorry, I think it's the best Lady Dedlock ... I'm not sure who could make better Jarndyce, but I'm fine with Mr. Elliott. It is not easy to present these long Dickens books - Oliver Twist would be easier - it is long and if you do not care about all legal situations, it can be terrible or boring. I think this presentation is fun enough not to be boring. I just loved Mr. Smallweed - it can be fun. There is always a child - Here is where your heart breaks ... I think we should be able to judge ourselves ... I must say I loved the show. Maybe when I read the book again, as I usually do, after seeing the movie I may be more critical. Meanwhile - I think it's a good presentation.
