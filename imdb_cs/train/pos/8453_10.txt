I could write a large enough commentary on any of the characters in Gundam Wing, each of whom could have their own conflicts in series. Instead, we get eight great leaders who will take us over 49 golden episodes of anime bliss. It contains a dialogue that you can move in the head of the moon ... years, and then come back and derive a new meaning from the masterpiece in writing scripts (although it has a typical Anime character that there is a difference between subtitles and English oak). It has a lot of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your views. Relationships between cold, incompetent men and loving female characters are a separate aspect of this series. The relationship between Heer and Rela and Milliard and Noin is a joy to watch. The apparent rejection of the male is supported by the internal confusion that makes love (a word never mentioned in the series) of women that are necessary for them in their harsh military environment. Women are haunted by the aspects of men we rarely see if we ever see, which makes the man's leader even more mysterious. Heero needs all 49 episodes to show some care, but he gets there, and when he does, it's a big payoff. <br /> <br /> And then there's a giant robot fighting. Fun to watch amazing sequences as good as any Hollywood epic battle scene. Any less capable person would see a huge robot fighting like a silly cartoon feature for kids, as it turned out when I try to recommend this series to my friends, but she is wrong. Many of the giant robots fight in Gundam Wing and contain a heavy dose of pathos, usually for young rebels who fight for what they believe against oppressive society, thus obliterating their beliefs. Constant shifts in tone and emphasis over each episode makes Gundam Wing impossible to be boring, it's a compelling, thought-provoking study of the potential of the human mind and body.
