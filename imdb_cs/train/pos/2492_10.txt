this is one of the most amazing performances I've ever seen. it's really refreshing to watch and I've been in the stitch many times. I think there is also a social awareness factor that is quite interesting. if they were white girls, would they get the same reaction? maybe it would, would not it? characters do not know any limits (check my lyrics) and do not exclude someone from their twisted sense of fun! There are so many funny sketches. my favorite is a bob builder one. it's so stupid that it's genius. if you like twisted black comedy, then it's for you. if you like to keep the look, it's probably not.3 Neblond is another cheerful British BBC comedy that appeared on television! It's such a fun show and the characters unleashed to the unsuspecting public are loudly funny! It would be impossible to keep a straight face to follow the crazy characters and reactions of the public! This series easily adds excellent comedies that are produced!
