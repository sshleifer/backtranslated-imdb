James Stewart starred in a classic Western tale of vengeance, which is linked to the fate of other Winchester Rifle stars. Stewart is, of course, insignificant by adding some cold, hard obsession to his usual slow cowboy. The story follows the fate of the Winchester rifle and its owners after he was won in the competition by our hero and stolen by the man who hunts. We meet a number of players, weapons, Indian traders and bank robbers as we follow the rifle route through Indian battles, bank robbery, etc. Support cast are solid with Dan Durya acting as Waco Johnny Dean alive-artillery with a gesture trigger finger. Like trivia, it should be noted that Rock Hudson as an Indian boss has a very early look. End Showdown is a classic and tense combat rifle that fought on a long circuit around the rock protuberance. Throw in some good old western action, fist fighting, shootings, and horses on horses that are doing for Western adventure. 8/10
