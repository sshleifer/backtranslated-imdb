Goldeneye will always go down as one of the most legendary games in the history of VG. There is no doubt about that. But this game, though quite different, might be the current Bond champion of his time. This was not a bond game based on material from another medium. It was completely new; scripted game. Who even had his own song! (it would not be without him, haha!). The game was great, and if you're a fan of bonds or movies, you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Unlike some games or most games, cast members have portrayed their characters themselves, unlike fictitious creations for the game. This gives more cinematic feeling. With a very interesting story you feel like you are in the game as well as in the movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy everything from start to finish. Even after the defeat of the game is still a lot of work. With the rating and unlock system to be achieved, as well as its multiplayer missions, this is an exceptional game. Despite being pretty old, in the years of the video game. It's still a good game that you can pick up and play whenever you feel the need to get a bit more Bond in your life. Even now I just think about it, I have a theme song in my head. Such a great time and well-written story. The story comes to life on the screen, almost as if the actors were in front of you, and it is as entertaining as the game itself. Excellent, in true form. Which can only be quite amazing, absolutely amazing. <br /> <br /> I have to play this game right now. If you have not played yet, you will not lose!
