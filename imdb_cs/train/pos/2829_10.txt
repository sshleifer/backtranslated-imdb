Undoubtedly, Private Lesson II is the biggest film I've ever seen. Japanese import (badly) translated into English, its joy to watch. It does not make much sense, but it does not matter. It's the biggest comedy around without being deliberately entertaining. The movie is rare and unavailable on the video, but I caught it a few late, late at night on a paid handbag. My uploaded copy was watched by tens and tens of times when I slowly, personally, introduced this film to the world. Joanna Pacula plays teacher / lover Ken, our hero. (It seems to have just worked for her control.) Ken plays Goro Inagaki, a Japanese pop group SMAP that gives him everything and has great hair. Stacy Edwards also starred in "The Men's Society", and she is probably happy to find her next film work. <br /> <br /> You need at least three insights into it, the conspiracy is. With repeated viewing, you can enjoy elements such as an abnormal number of Ken vases in your house (at least 50), or that Ken has a shirt with embroidered corn molds in the film finale. <br /> <br /> The film is predictable but highly sensitive. My friends and I are rebuilding the whole scene. Yes, it sounds like we are defeated by the defeat, and we are ... but we are defeated by the defeats who saw the "private lesson II". Be one of the ten people in the world who have seen this movie. Thank you for it.
