First of all, this is simply the most amusing movie I've ever seen. It contains a perfectly timed slapstick, sexual humor and a smartly thoughtful stand. But it goes deeper than this. Soul Opposite is an original love story (something we do not often see) that gave me the hope that there is love that two people who love can work through their adversity. and that such a comic life (something I believe we all have) could be accepted by people who really care. Chris Meloni gives such a convincing performance as Barry Singer to win the Oscar. The movie is greatly written and I hope we will see more films from all those involved in the future.
