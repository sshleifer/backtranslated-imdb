The clutter of genres, but it's largely based on Stephen Chow's genre mashup because it's inspiration. There is a magical kung-fu, college romance, sports, gangster action and some crying melodrama. Production is superb and speed is fast, so it's easy to overcome many of the flaws in this movie. <br /> <br /> The baby is left next to the basketball court. The homeless guy brings him to the Shaolin monastery, which is in the middle of the city, along with a special kungfu manual that no one has home but can not read. An old monk teaches a boy, but it expires when he tries to handle a special technique in the manual. The school is taken over by a fake master of a kungfu, assisted by four sages. The new commander is crazy about a 20-year-old boy who does not pretend to be hit by a bad blow and throws him off at night. The boy is found by throwing garbage into the basket from an incredible distance from the man who takes him to the gangster club to play the arrows. This leads to a great fight, the boy's exclusion from the monastery, and the decision of the man to transform the boy into a basketball dream. <br /> <br /> And this is happening in the first 20 minutes, most of which happen in at least 10 minutes. Apart from the extreme storyline story, the first problem is how little we know the main character until he gets to the film. A man who uses a boy is more clearly defined when the first third is terminated. There is no new land on the plot except the crazy action peak of the film. I'm sure you can easily imagine how the poor monks are coming to an end. Effects, shooting, and stunts are all the most important and compensated for the spotless conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Stephen Chow has a much better control of writing writings and comedies, and this movie will live in the shadows, but that's not a good reason to ignore. It's quite fun even with the end of the scatter-shot. Recommended.
