This series is "something different". Sometimes European series are less accurate than those in the US, but this time the authors have hit the right target and created a blend that works smoothly. Edel & Starck is great, he has everything: great plot, intelligent, humorous, always well supplied lines, amazing theatrical timing shown by all the stars and beautiful shots of Berlin, one of the most interesting cities in the world. It is fun to see how things work in the field of justice in countries other than the US and once they "feel" the old European way of life. Kudos to all the cast and crew for a well-done comedy that will be needed in the future. Viewing the series in German is great.
