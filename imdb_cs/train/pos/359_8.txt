I can not believe I'm seeing this movie right now - I think maybe I thought it was another film about the slaves being wrong, and for the same reason I'm avoiding the Roots - as I have seen Schindler's document - they do not want to be "amused" by other people's pain, it does not matter how authentic or informative it is to be. So I think the main thing I noticed about Color Fial was that it was not about black people who are white. Black people were perfectly able to rape their own daughters-or gave them away to treat their "husbands" as slaves. It was painful to watch, but they all eventually redeemed and acting was phenomenal! I could not believe that the character of Oprah played at the age of 35! And I love Whoopi to start - it was amazing. I'm so glad I felt miserable yesterday afternoon and Showtime ran The Color Purple.
