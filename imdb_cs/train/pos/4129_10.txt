It's a competition for cooking, Americanized. It will not be a Japanese version. <br /> <br /> The show is great. I can take care of cooking much more, but this show is just fun when I watch ... From the intensity the chef gives to the chairman's menu. A really good way to spend some time watching TV. <br /> <br /> You can criticize the show for having Judge Marc Ecko ... But ... Meh. It's pretty fun to watch and generally the winner deserves a prize. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah and I'm bitter John Besh is not the new Iron Chef ... <br /> <br /> Ala Cuisine!
