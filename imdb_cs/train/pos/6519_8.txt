This movie has great stars in its previous years: Ingor Stevens never looked nicer; Yul Brynner was very convincing Jean LaFitte, confronted with his piracy and longing to maintain neutrality with the United States. Charlton Heston did a pretty good job like Andrew Jackson, but some moments were a bit stomon. It's really a good hint for students to learn that part of our history A shows that all the happy endings do not include the lovers who come together - sometimes it's a happier end that they are leaving and they find partners with similar backgrounds that better will understand them in the long run. I have seen it every year for at least twice for 16 years; and although it's not the best movie I've ever seen, I love it every time!
