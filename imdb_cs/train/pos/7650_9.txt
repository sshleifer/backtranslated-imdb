Wow, I loved this movie. He did not have to have the funding and advertising that got the latest Hollywood blockbuster, but he packs twice the emotional punch. The story revolves around this one of Utah's family, and it's a connection between the people in the family who deliver the film with a stroke. Leadership (Giovanni Ribisi) plays your part very well, at no time lets you believe he is acting all his feelings. He is his brother (Elias Koteas), who stole it for me. When they were all in the scenarios together, they bounded each other and gave a fantastic performance. Great actress, great movie.
