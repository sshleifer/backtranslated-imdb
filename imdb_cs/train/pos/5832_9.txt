Since I've seen this movie as a child, I've never been watching for more than thirty years. From the opening scenes at the corner of the factory, to the engine running in the backseat of the car, Ollie responding to the phone and accidentally pulling out the window of Stan, I think it was their best film from the last day. They then moved to the 20th century Fox, and while these films were not horrible, they lacked the comedic timing of this film. Jimmy Finnlayson, their long film time, at his last performance with boys, turned out to be a super doctor! Quote: "I said goat's milk" his answer to Stan asks how you milk the spirit! Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin will appear! I would say that in all my favorite L & H comedies.
