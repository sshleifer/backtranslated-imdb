A lot and lots of information you can handle, and if you've seen Zizka, you know his pace. Also, if you have not seen most movies or at least some other films from the same directors listed in this document, you will be a bit lost. <br /> <br /> And the movie list is long. The director includes Hitchcock (Psycho, Vertigo, Birds), Lynch (Lost Highway, Mullholland Falls, Wild Heart, Blue Velvet), Tarkovsky (Stalker, Solaris) and Conversation (Coppola) segway films like Star Wars: Espisode III, Matrix ... but I suspect these are baits. Surely, Zizek is never boring, but if you do not buy psychoanalysts (or if you have in mind) then you will not be bored. <br /> <br /> But you should not, like settings, clips, the way the movies break through with these clips, Zizka's points are never boring.
