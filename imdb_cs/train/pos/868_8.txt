What is very French in this film is the time it takes to create two leading figures. This may require a bit of patience, especially because it is neither "attractive" in the "typical Hollywood" concept. However, as soon as a "murder" occurs, the film quickly starts, perhaps sometimes too fast. But it's a real mountain bike ride, and if you do not look too closely, it's quite credible. The sort of movie you know about Hollywood would be disappointing.
