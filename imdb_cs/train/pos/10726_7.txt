To my surprise, I liked "Spacecamp", I remember seeing it about 13 years ago, and recently I hired her again. I was quite impressed. Of course, the special effects in today's space movies, such as Armageddon and Deep Impact, are much better than those in the SpaceCamp. This movie, however, had a story - a very stereotypical story of the eighties where you could hear it before you heard it. But that's what I liked-they're making movies, so it was a refreshing change. It was interesting to see Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Leo Thomson in early roles, with Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw to add the fabric to a light and fluffy plot. He absolutely loved the robot named Jinx, he was very cute, but unfortunately he had more emotions than some of the main characters. The film was almost inspirational in its own way, and it was interesting to note that it was shot at the NASA Spacecamp in Alabama (I think).
