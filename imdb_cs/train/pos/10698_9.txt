A little funny movie. It is absolutely incredible, incredible, impossible. But it's fun as an introverted masochist can be totally addicted and charming, even hypnotized by a girl she barely knows but who has managed to get into her fantasies. Of course, it's a torture of stupid shops that you can get on the internet. You can not believe ten percent of what you said, and never ever accept to bind your hands in some other way to something or something, or some organization you do not know personally. Most of their "stores" are in one way or another that deceives you and attacks you. But here the chap worthy to be the victims of such gangsters, because he is not just naive, he is absurdly stupid. But then the movie becomes funny because it ends up with the victim of a crooked business with the upper hand and ends playing the same game with its victimizer and winning. One thinks he's sure too. Security at airports in England is not exactly what it should be, but I think there is no better way anywhere else in the world, and even now that they tighten up all rules and regulations, it's just fun to go into their practices and systematically foil them. Then they have their revenge by losing your luggage, the real plague in modern airports, and not expecting to get a fair compensation. Or even entertain a bottle opener or can opener because it can be dangerous. I see that I cut through the side of the plane with a can opener. Funny, right?
