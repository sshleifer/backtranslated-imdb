The thing that makes this movie so terrifying is that it portrays Andrea and Calvin as (relatively) normal boys. These are definitely not people who want to become professional makers because they find themselves in front of the camera, they forget scripting lines, etc. They do just a video as a diary to show "survivors" how normal their lives are. Their parents just think that guys are filming a family home video. When investigating further attacks by children at their school, Andre and Calvin learn what they should not do and inform (in the stupid "The Old House") any potential "Andres and Calvin" who could watch this video on how to make bombs. weapons and do not get caught before Zero Day.
