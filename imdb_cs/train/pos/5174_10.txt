I swear that I can watch every movie on my weekend of my life and I never feel bad about it! Every aspect of human emotions is so magically captured by the acting, script, direction and overall feel of this film. It's been a long time since I saw a movie that actually strangled me with laughter, echoing from sorrow and feeling every imaginable feeling coming in this great job! We need MORE FILMS like this !!! Mike Binder: Are you listening?
