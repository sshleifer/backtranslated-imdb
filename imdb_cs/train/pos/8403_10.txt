I found it very intellectual and artistic in all directions! I felt the script handed over all the things I feel physically and emotionally when I came back from work and watched it. it is a tribute to cinema in the highest form and format. <br /> <br /> Saint Guacamole! as I wish that those days would reappear. I tried to lay a bubble window on my car (honda civic 1984), but the vacuum plate with muffin did not solve it. also in my civic, sexual position are limited and the waterbed is not supported, as it is reminiscent of "van". "van" is on the top side to divide gaiety and can even replace porn if you look at private scenes. <br /> <br /> I very much anticipate that Sam Grossman (the director) has reached his opus. <br /> <br /> Rating john: **** 1/2 Sam: *****
