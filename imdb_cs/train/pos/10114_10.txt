"Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr." is a definitive documentary about the life of a man who brought us such films as "Glen or Glenda", "The Bride of the Monster" and, of course, "Plan 9 from the Universe". This excellent film far exceeds where other documents, such as "Look Back in Angora" and "Plan 9 Companion", have failed. He rounded off with his surviving companion, many of whom had died since filming, and frankly studying Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in the fact that looking back to the darker corner of Hollywood, sentimental in the treatment of the director (up to scary music), this document is absolutely necessary for anyone who loves the director who has fallen into his day. The two hours of the film are lovingly and retrospectively linking Ed's life and premature death for the viewer. He was best watched at 3 o'clock in the morning when he wore an angora sweater.
