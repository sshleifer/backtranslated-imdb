This movie is great and I would recommend it to rent it for everyone who owns a local video store. Or even better, you can buy it because it's likely you'll watch it over and over again. I remember watching this movie as a kid and it was great. But after seeing it yesterday, I thought it was amazing. A good mix of comedy (though not as great as "Mr. Magoo" - another of my favorites) and action. It deserves ten, and I hope they will soon drive (their fingers will cross). If you are babysitting or you have to take care of young children, I would recommend renting this movie because it will be fun for hours.
