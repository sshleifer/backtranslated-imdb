This documentary follows the lives of Big and Little Edie Beale, mother and daughter, who lived as varieties in their family estate in East Hampton, NY, from the mid-1950s to the late 1970s. At a time when filmmakers find it, the castle crashes, and women, one 78 and the other 56, share a confined room. Elder Edie Beale is Aunt Jackie Kennedy Onassis and the younger is her first cousin. The women were originally expelled from the house because of its dilapidated condition, but Jackie sent them money for repairs to live there. Sometimes this film may seem exploitative, because even a woman seems to be the best of mental health, but at other times the film is hard to turn away. "Little" Edie blames her mother for her current condition and her mother remembers that Edie will never be the success he thinks he is. "Little" Edie often appears to have been captured in the past, focusing on the choices she made several decades ago, and loving to show pictures of youth where she was clearly a beautiful debutant. Her mother seems to have abandoned her fate to live for the rest of her life in terrible conditions. There are some signs of a charming life, as women once led, from photographs showing a happy family, to a large portrait of the older Edie next to the bed. From what we see from the house, most of the rooms in it are empty, the walls crumble and fall apart, and "little" Edie leaves the food in the attic for the raccoons that are feasting. And of course, there are plenty of cats. <br /> <br /> This document is incredibly sad in the heart. While neither of the women with their life seems to be particularly depressing in their lives, the pain of the pain they live in is terribly horrible. It's not clear if there's even running water in the house and you feel like they're essentially abandoned by their family. However, as a documentary, it is a wonder that I am watching and highly recommended.
