Two years later ... Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are in the near future near rock stars, but they still need more work in their instruments. In the future, Bill & Ted is in a public popular act, but then an evil man (Joss Ackland) is killed by Bill & Ted by sending cyborg views to destroy them. Cyborg people are sent to the past and actually kill the real Bill & Ted. Now both boys are spirits and must travel through heaven and hell to save themselves and their future. Director Peter Hewitt (Tom and Huck, Debtors) has made a clever sequel with amazing visual effects. More fun and fun than the original. William Sadler (The Shawshank Redemption) steals a show like The Grim Reaper. The DVD has a good anamorphic transmission with a widescreen (1.85: 1) and fine Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The DVD has a theater trailer and a fun scene. This sequel was the Box Office hit as the original, but it's also (believe it or not), which is one of the best sequels (in your view). George Carlin briefly returns to the role of the original. Pam Grier also appears in a small role. It's a nice fantasy comedy. (**** / *****).
