Huge black and white night cinema, and a lot of this, highlights this allegedly true biography of the 1950s Kansas murder, in which the whole family was destroyed by two men. The story was written by Truman Capote, so at the end of the film you get a very liberal message against the death penalty, which is absurd to know the facts of the case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play two atheists losers who have a twisted outlook on life and who unnecessarily kill this nice family. <br /> <br /> Despite the unpleasant tendency at the end, it's a boring story from the beginning, and cinema is still fascinating. Well-known photographer Conrad Hall has done a fantastic job. I want to have more modern movies in black and white. Check out the DVD. <br /> <br /> Blake, Wilson, John Forsythe, Jeff Corey and the whole supporting actress are excellent here. My third appearance of this movie came at the beginning of April 2005, shortly after Blake, in real life, was pronounced innocent in the process of murdering his wife. One can not help, but then he looks at Blake and the film is different.
