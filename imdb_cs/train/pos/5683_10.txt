Simply saying that you have a movie about John Holmes is a guarantee that a few people will win the screen, but writer / director James Cox adds much more. "Rashamon" from a clumsy Hollywood ensemble, the film divides the murders in June 1981 by Wonderland through various angles (and film stores), but mostly through John Holmes's coke-shaped extraterrestrial brain. In a movie full of bad guys, Holmes is either the deadliest, the craziest, or both. Several versions of the story appear and merge, because Cox flashes jumps and circular title cards in the middle of effects and emotions. Dialogue is quick and naturalistic, and never circles fake. While the film takes place two years after Holmes dropped out of porn and a truly sinister drug abuse, Kilmer relentlessly radiates sexuality so intense that it can be measured in inches. This sexuality at the edges creates a feeling of premonition that hangs almost as strongly as the violence in the middle of the movie. These murders are doubtful throughout the film, although they are never clearly shown, even at the top, though their violence tirelessly fills the whole picture, and much blood is scattered across the walls and the pictures of the crime. Again Val Kilmer, as Holmes shows, can act better than others. Glittering, ringing, braving or begging, Kilmer is constantly in character and character is a constantly fascinating car wreck. Outstanding performances alongside Kilmer certainly include Ted Levine as head of the police investigator and Lisa Kudrow as Holmes's estranged wife. The trio of Holmes criminals appears to be one of Josh Lucas's frighteningly high energies, the ever-interesting Timothy Blake Nelson, and the absolutely unrecognizable Dylan McDermott in a key role as a girlfriend in another murder. Cox suggests that no matter how much we learn about Wonderland, the worse version is always possible, but when we look at the anxiety that surrounds them, it is much more fascinating than understanding the truth.
