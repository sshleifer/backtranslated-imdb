I saw this movie on Thursday night after he had a really boring day. I had no expectations, the ones I had were rather negative. I'm the only movie I've ever seen in Jimmy's American version of Taxi with Queen Latifah (?) ... you do not ask why! But seriously .. this movie is so cute! Drew Barrymore is always sweet, but I almost fell in love with Fallon's character. Why can not I meet such a cute madman. :) Such movies are excellent. Simple, sweet and necessary. Sunday on Thursday. I'm not a fan of sports, but it's about American baseball movies that fascinate me. Probably not having the sport here in Norway. <br /> <br /> (My first comment at all.) Haha
