I'm sorry I have no idea what Hollywood is doing. We're going to give us movies like Batman Begins. Oh, by the way, I think Hollywood could cover the narrative in Batman, but please do not kill us what we really want to see with Batman and Superman. I really hated this trailer because it left me more. I was looking around to see when it came out. It was like a terrible practical joke. A graphic where the story line seemed to be solid and had all the great shots of a great movie. Unfortunately it will not happen now. It's great work for the producers, the director and all the actors, but I hate you for doing it to me. You left me to want more.
