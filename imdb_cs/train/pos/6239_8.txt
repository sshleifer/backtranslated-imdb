The tempo is very quiet ...... so you have to relax ....... breathe ... exhale before you see it ...... <br /> <br /> First you think ... but nothing is wrong and you are a little angry over it .. and that's a problem because of its mood of the movie and really nice social realistic pictures that are pretty in this movie ...... ..... a lot of people will be telling your disgusting ...... but it's not so bad ... I think its more used for marketing .... and tores some really funny moments ... and 60 old woman gets rid of ..... I guarantee her most dangerous striptease in film history ...... her movie that is real .. I think that word ...... right in the face ... .... and it does it a little scary.no computer manipulating here ..... his real life ... and as we all know, movies can win over reality when it comes to doing sick things ...... .... so it's much worse in the real world .. ..... If you survive the movie, you can start looking at your neighbors and think ... maybe they're like people in the movie ... I bet there's a lot of them out there ...... sick ... crazy people living with nice the facade ........ after shooting the movie I feel its more interesting to look at my neighbors ........ <br /> <br /> But maybe you should not see this movie on its first day .... .....
