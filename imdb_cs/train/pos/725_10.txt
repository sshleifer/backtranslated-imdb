Miss Togar's Fascist Chief (Mary Woron, who is taught by professional photographer Dean Cundy, as if ten feet tall) has a plan to change her tall square. Complications that attack this target in beautiful rock'n'roll Riff Randell (PJ Soles, who lights the screen - also has a hot spot), who is a obsessed fan of punk band THE RAMONES. Pal Kate Rambeau (Dey Young whose big glasses and nerd roles can not hide his amazing beauty) joins forces with Riff to end the supposed crisis of killing rock'n'roll, which is Togar's mission. /> <br /> Vincent Van Patten has a cheerful role as Tom Roberts, a success in everything but getting in place. Kate is crazy about Tom, just to pull his head out of the sand and see. Clint Howard steals the film almost (sincerely, who can discourage this film from Soles?) Like Eaglebauer, a "vendor" who can get almost everything. His office is in the boy's toilet! Paul Bartel is also cheerful as a music teacher who becomes Riff's ally when enjoying the RAMONES concert. <br /> <br /> Bad college that deviates from all normality rules ... and I loved it. It's like someone just says, "We'll have fun for 1.5 hours." The film is really anarchy ... and the ruthless chaos that loves RAMONY with all the heart (although they are heroic actors, they have the opportunity to get a new audience with this film). the end quite summarizes the film as a whole. Riff and her classmates take high school and start a massive party. To be honest, I did not want the party to end! In any case, it's not conventional, we just lose this madness. Together with the great rock sound that features some of the finest songs, THE RAMONES, this film will allow the audience to take time in life when the war did not manage headlines and people only had time. Those were those days.
