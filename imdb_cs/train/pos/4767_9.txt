I do not know how this show is like OC. <br /> <br /> First, the OC focuses on teenagers and their parents trying to live their lives. North Shore is about hotel staff who are trying to run the hotel and have a social life at the same time. Secondly, OC is held in California. North Shore takes place in Hawaii. And why would Fox make a show just like one of his other shows on the same network? I think it's a great show with good actors for the most part. He has a good story and plot. I like events that happen and how people care and care about them. The latest episode was surprising how the story was solved. It was not predictable like most stories on most concerts. <br /> <br /> I hope Fox will keep him in the air.
