As an adult, I really enjoyed it. I looked at it with my two granddaughters, and a 3Â½ year old was fascinated and a 15-month old giggle in the mouse. Music is fun and the animation is amazing. This sequel does what Return to Neverland did not achieve. Good tracking of the Cinderella story; but what happens to Drusilla? Another sequel? I hope!
