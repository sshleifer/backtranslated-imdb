I remember seeing this movie years ago, I think, BBC2. I'd love to see it again - does anyone know how to get a copy? As I remember, it was a particularly powerful film, especially the scene that stands out is a horse on which gas masks are placed. Besides, I can not recall too much about the story - so I want to see it again! I have a dragged web, but I can not find a copy, which is unusual from my experience - maybe there is no DVD or VHS on this market. I would like to appreciate any help anyone can give me. Thank you so much in advance for your help. Yours sincerely, Albany234@googlemail.com
