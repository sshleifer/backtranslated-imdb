Phantom Lady (1944) Dir: Robert Siodmak <br /> <br /> Production: Universal Pictures <br /> <br /> Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis), after an unpleasant struggle and split with his wife, tries to drown his pain in the local irrigation hole. There he spies a woman in a similar emotional state and is looking for some companions, asking her to show in the club to get both of their minds out of their troubles. She agrees, but only on the condition that they will have names for themselves. Sure, when Scott returns home, he finds the police and waits for him to ask him. His wife was murdered. Where were you at eight o'clock this evening, is Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) asking? But Scott has an alibi, right? Only a woman does not know the name. And the bartender remembers Scott, but not a woman. Not even cab driver. Not even the drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) at the club. Even a dancer in a club that Scott was clearly catching when looking at a woman (both had the same hat) would not recognize someone. Something is happening, but notwithstanding that Scott is powerless to defend himself in court, and is sentenced to death for murdering his wife (the worst "proof" in Hollywood's history). It is left to his loyal secretary, Kansas (Ella Raines), to which later sympathetic Burgess inspector joined to find that a real killer was executed before Scott was executed. Phantom Lady is built on topics that work almost urgently in Woolric. For example, a schizophrenic antagonist is also seen in Black Angel and The Leopard Man. In addition, a character appears to become mentally upset by the death of a sweetheart or husband, as found in Rendezvous in Black and The Bride Wore Black. This may leave the viewer feeling as though he was treading on well-worn soil. But in the right hand, feverish cries, justified dialogues, narrative discrepancies, all are beside. Fortunately, the Phantom Lady was guided by healthy hands. This is Siodmak's first noir. He would continue to distinguish himself as one of, if not, the most prominent practitioner (The Killers, Criss Cross). Here he is randomly paired with cameraman Woody Bredell (they will meet again for Christmas and The Killers). The camera has some great stories. One shot is depicted by the deteriorating mental state of the figure when sitting in front of a three-way mirror, indicating more personalities. The same character who is an artist has a self-portrait of Van Gogh with a bandaged ear hanging on the wall in his apartment. But what Siodmak and Bredell actually do at Phantom Lady practically creates a noir view. Released very early in 1944, it is here; (when Kansas visits Scott in prison), disparate light shafts, etc. It's an amazing picture to look at. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Franchot Tone aside, cast, as well as the subject and relative ignorance of the director (and probably the budget), suggests film ambitions B. I thought Tone was a little brown. Alan Curtis (High Sierra) is not too much, and in fact, it looks pretty little in several scenes. Ella Raines is mostly good (and quite beautiful). Her "Sexual Scene" with Elisha Cook Jr. is so delirious that he must be seen to have believed it. Another extraordinary scene is when Kansas goes for a bartender to ask him. This is equal to persecution as he persistently pursues the streets and stops at the metro station. Some real good tension there. <br /> <br /> *** of 4
