I loved this movie. The first time I saw it when I was 20 years old (which was only four years ago) and I enjoyed it so much that I gave my own copy a second day. The comedy plays everyone involved. I always have to recover and recollect the scene where Mr. Tsanders explains why he found water at 6 ft in one area and 227 feet in another. See also the father of Jason Robards, who plays Mr. Retch. There was talent in the family.
