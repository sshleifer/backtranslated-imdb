Sure, Star Wars (the movie I've seen at least fifty times) takes everyone else into special effects, but this movie has everything else! <br /> <br /> It has horror (non-graphic), romance, robots, humorous contempt, intelligence, (surprisingly good) special effects and drama. I saw this movie a few years ago in a revival with the newly hit print and I was surprised how well this day. I thought the old 40-year-old electronics looked hockey, but somehow they looked futuristic and modern. Ann Francis here (mostly) a short skirt and bare feet with a girl's innocence that is hard to beat is still getting up from me. <br /> <br /> Krelova monster, which appeared in the beams of rays, still scared me. <br /> <br /> Of course we all know that the "Big Bird of the Galaxy" from this movie probably modeled much of the "Star Trek". No one has yet to beat Robby Robot in terms of personality <br /> <br /> (Sorry, R2D2 and C3PO). Overall, this film is a standard that all other sci-fi movies will have to measure up to! Honorable recognition for the terrible electronic score that kept us all on pins and needles.
