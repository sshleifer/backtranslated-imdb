It may not be a memorable classic, but it is a touching novel with an important subject that emphasizes the importance of literacy in modern society and a devastating career and life implications for any unfortunate person who does not have this vital skill. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Iris, the widow who meets her fellow worker in her factory work, an illiterate cafe named Stanley. Iris finds Stanley unable to read, and after losing his job, he tells him to read the lessons at home in the kitchen. Of course, as you might expect, both of them, although initially involved in a wake-up call, develop mutual feelings ... Jane Fonda plays competently Iris, a woman with her own problems, dealing with two teenage children (one pregnant), unemployed sister and her abuser husband. However, Robert DeNiro is of course great in his cute portrayal of intelligent and inventive but illiterate, Stanley, bringing dignity to a role that commands respect. These are not your typical charming young pairs of yuppie, as it is generally depicted on screen novels, but a common working class, a middle-aged couple with lots of down to the ground fights. <br /> <br /> I will not end but it is a beautiful, hearty romance and a personal look at the worrying problem of adult illiteracy, though from a fictional point of view.
