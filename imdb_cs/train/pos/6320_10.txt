The main reason I wanted to see this movie was because of a beautiful cast. The ton of their favorite actors in one movie is amazing when it's not actually seen. But this movie caught me. It was not what I expected. It's been a moment I've seen, but I remember I could not stop laughing !!! And it was not just the cast that made me do it. The script was surprisingly written. Every time you expected something to happen, it did not happen. There were so many twists and turns, but it fits the whole tone of the movie instead of making it difficult. Cinematography, along with the set, was absolutely beautiful. I really can not say anything wrong about this movie! Speak, I should have Andrew Davoli a little more time on the screen!
