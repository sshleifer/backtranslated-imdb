A great movie, plenty of laughter and action for any audience. Since the last person he sent to this film has taken on himself to call Woody Allen to be an incestuous and uncompetitive film, here I am. /> <br /> The film follows the improbable duo of Johansson and Allen as they watch the peak given to them by the spirit of the recently deceased English reporter. Their search takes them into the murderer's home and eventually ends up in a somewhat tragic ending. But do not let him conspire you, the movie is really cheerful and the acting is excellent. It seems that when directors reach a certain age, they really have things right. Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollack seem to be doing some of the most imaginative work of their respective careers. Also, from watching a movie in a pact theater, you can only say that people really love Woody Allen and are ready for him to really come back. The second one on the screen illuminated. There's something about that man, and he really shines in Scoop. <br /> <br /> Look at it, it's worth a trip.
