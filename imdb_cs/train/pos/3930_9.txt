It is remarkable that for young Ms. Lincoln's supportive players, Ford plays less familiar than actor. It not only enhances his film focus on the central character of Lincoln, but also provides viewers with a refreshing look at Lincoln as a man of his place and time, a man entangled, as each of us inexorably, in questions and sentiments of his time and looking for a way to solve them. It's not so much what Lincoln's words and actions are about, but the faces, the supporters' reactions, that Ford tells the story of shaping young Lincoln's worldview, the sense of place in society, and the spirits and how people responded to Mr. Lincoln's words and deeds, and gave him confidence to the man he thought deserved respect and attention. Try it: instead of concentrating on Henry Fonda, Mr. Lincoln 'will shift its focus to supportive characters - expecting you to be nicely rewarded with a deeper award from Lincoln and Ford. I like to suspect that Ford's narrative through the support of supporting characters at Lincoln Fund may appeal to David Lean as he directed Omar Sharif in "Doctor Zivag", in which they are the character-supporting reaction to Zhivago, which in fact tells Zhivag.
