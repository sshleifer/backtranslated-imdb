The origins of bear care and their cousins. If you've seen the original movie, you'll find an inconsistency. Cousins ​​are brought up with the care of bears rather than later. However, I have no problems with it, I prefer to consider films as separate interpretations. Children are adorable and it's fun to watch how they play and grow. My favorite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a bewildering creator. I could feel with those three kids, because I was never good at sports either. Cree Summer is as cool as Christy. The songs are sweet and unforgettable. If you have an open heart, you love toys or enjoy the original, you do not miss it. 9/10
