The World in War is one of the best records of World War Two. 24 episodes cover war and how it was in the countries that deal with it. The first episode tells us how Hitler came to power and how he managed to build one of the most powerful armies in the world. They also fucus on military actions taken during the war, and the Holocaust. One of the strongest and best documents ever heard. You all have to look at it. Perfection! <br /> <br />
