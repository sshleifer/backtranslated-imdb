Clair Denis again visits her theme of the stolen fathers, men who watch their own bliss determinedly, no matter how emotion they feel for their family, but while Nénette and Boni from the previous film live in the Marseilles world, our exploration of Louis Trebor in The Intruder takes us from a remote location along the Franco-Swiss border to half the world, to Korea and Tahiti. The film begins again in the midst, where Louis, in his sixties, cope with the sick heart while trying to maintain a high level of health. We learn that Louis is not alien violence because his cabin is a place for smuggling and shooting with regular occurrence. Louis sleeps with a big knife under a pillow with rifles nearby. Denis is in no hurry to move the action, and we have to patiently build our understanding of Ludwig from his day-to-day activities and the few people he faces along the border, including the son of Sidney (Grégoire Colin, almost unrecognizable with long hair and a wisp kiss) , who rejects him as a "madman" who is portrayed as a devoted father of two. There are many short scenes that, although seemingly unrelated, create an impression of Ludwig and its surroundings. Mrs. Godard's friend is exciting here. The control metaphor is Louis's heart transplant, for which he goes to Korea and then to Tahiti to seek another son who has not been found, and where the new heart of Louis rejects him, just as Sidney refused the old one. We are accustomed to the short scenes in the film Denise, which are unexplained: Nénette Giant Boni feeding spoon; the drive to shoot Boni's father, and then the shortest picture of Boni with a shotgun in his head; the scene of Ludwig in a morgue with a corpse with a scar transplant, but the body of Sidney. The result of the last two is the rejection, real or introduced by the father, killing something that is undefined in the son.
