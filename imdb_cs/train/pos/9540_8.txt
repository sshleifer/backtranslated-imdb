Most of the feedback I've heard about the Meatball Machine was pretty decent. The couple even says he thinks he's "sucked in". Well, those people I'm saying get f @ kkin imagination and go f @ ck yourself. This was very fun. <br /> <br /> The story begins with this mechanical bug, which attacks and in some way transforms its guests into these Gwar-costumes of sight, deathbots called Necroborgs. Finally, you'll learn that these mechanical bugs will put on you a small parasite, which is then able to control your actions due to the hot involvement of the nervous system. Unfortunately, for two lonely young adults trying to find love, they encounter a mechanical mistake, and before you know, there will be transformations and the blood will dissipate. Is there a way to stop the transformation? A possible way to stop a mechanical error? Why Necroborgs are fighting each other? Are two desperate singles who express one another's feelings and make it nasty? The only way to find out. <br /> <br /> I'm going to the Meatball Machine. I was a little cautious due to the mixed reactions, but it turned out to be a big surprise. Several unanswered questions, sometimes mediocre and slightly confused, are the only weak points I can think of. The anime feels that parasites become small characters themselves and even with a low budget, this film strikes the right brand much more than it is lacking. With a constantly evolving story that is so interesting to ask questions in the mix with cool makeup effects and blood, it's one fans of fans bizarro / horor / Tetsuo / scatter fans should look. 8 out 10
