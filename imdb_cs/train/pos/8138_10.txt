CB4 was terrible, but Cundieff might have given a better idea. Just like Spinal Tap, the movie is smart from the beginning. Surprised everyone who saw it back in the mid-1990s. Performances are played with laughter, but not as cartoons, just like the Marx brothers. These guys are real and a little different. They react to situations as if someone could. Well, we can not throw bouts when our performance hats late for a concert, or pull out weapons and beat exec recording company, but you get a picture. N (n *** as) W (s) H (hats) gets enough serious to hook you, and then you are addicted. borrow at all costs, even if you are not really in rap music, it still lets you feel loud. Comparing it with CB4 is like a Star Wars comparison between George Lucas and Gil Gerards 'Buck Rogers' I think you see my point
