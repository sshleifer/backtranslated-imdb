This is by far the most entertaining short film of two comic geniuses. From the moment they get in, until Hardy falls off the roof, it laughs hysterically. I very much think that every fan of Laurel and Hardy should see this short. I also recommend all spirits. If you're looking for a laugh, check out this movie and you'll be glad.
