All right, first ignore the last person's review. They admit they are asleep, so it's no wonder they do not understand what's going on !!! As a thriller / horror, this film is not too bad, it is certainly very attentive. From the opening scenes you will get a general idea of ​​exactly what will be the cause of all the foolishness that follows and come to an end, proving that everything was clear. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, it was sometimes quite scary and like the old movies it was simple. Great to watch late at night! I give him a generous 7 of 10.
