Waiting Womans Ward from a large hospitalized hospital with all the joy and grief is the place where LIFE begins. This almost forgotten drama is fine little soaps, full comedies and tragedies that are tied to the lives of maternal staff and patients. The sincerity with which the subject is being processed shows the state of the precode film. <br /> <br /> Wonderful Aline MacMahon, as a sympathetic nurse, is a quiet center of the film, the rocks around which all the streams flow. She is able to cope with any crisis or emergency, she is the best mother, sometimes the last, friend. The surrounding MacMahon is a fabulous prize: Loretta Young as a convicted murderer released from prison for so long to give birth; Eric Linden as her horrified young husband; brass Glenda Farrell as a slut who hates children; sweet Clara Blandick as a very mature mother for her sixth cultivation; Preston Foster & Hale Hamilton as Thinking, Sympathetic Doctors, and Frank McHugh as a comically furious father. <br /> <br /> The film recognizes Bobs Watson as a little one who wants to see a stork; Paul Fix as a nervous husband who promises to act like a "little soldier"; Gilbert Roland as an uproar Italian husband and Elizabeth Patterson as the wife of a doctor who is interested in receiving Farrell's son - all that was insignificant. There are some absurdities in the plot - some of the mothers are, of course, too old; Farrell becomes apparently drunk in Ward, but none of his staff seems to have forgotten; a seemingly psychotic patient is able to wander by the will - but it really only increases the special value of the fun of the film and keeps things to become too serious.
