On this page I see a lot of people wanting AG to come out on DVD. Well, I bought it on DVD. (Out of bounds, no less!) While it's great to have this amazing DVD box show, I'm angry with the fact that they added very little in the way of "extra" (commentator to Shaun Cassidy's Pilot Episode) and the episodes are displayed in the same order. as they were distributed on television. Missing episodes that have never been shown before running on the Sci Fi channel are in the box but are stuck on the final DVD. If you purchase a DVD set, you get the real order in which it will be displayed and you will be happier. (You'll have to replace the DVD to and from your player to see them alright, but you'll be glad you did.) <br /> <br />
