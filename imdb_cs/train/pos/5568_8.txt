A typical story about Cheech and Chong's reality, which contains drugs, vocals, more drugs, cars and driving, even more drugs, Pee Wee, aliens, gasoline, laundry, comedy, surprisingly more drugs and SPACE COKE !! It's not as coherent or as likely as smoke, but it's still incredibly fun without being as strange as Nice dreams. There are some classic scenes, including the introductory scene, where they get some gas for their car and work. Also interesting is the song Cheech (Mexican-Americans) and Chong's subsequent song. Another notable scene is the Welfare Office scene with Jones (human noise), police academy and old laughter. Overall, this is a great sequel to the "Up in Smoke" category and is quite attentive when it's sober or not. <br /> <br />
