Third and, in my opinion, the best of the Blackadder series. <br /> <br /> The only downside is that there is no Lord Percy, who was the most entertaining character of the previous series, but Prince Regent Hugh Laurie is a properly crazy laugh line. <br /> <br /> As a package, this is thanks to convincing props, high-quality carving sarcasm and small bits of jokers, "macbeth" actors who stand and the boy's impression of happy Prince Georges, and the missing words from the diary Dr. Johnson. Several comedies were so good that they are fun, fine little attention or lines appear fine, but it's usually a scream.
