Unbelievable little English movie for many reasons. At first, it's a rare sight of Laurence Olivier in a light comedy. While his performance is not at the standard level, he would be one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, he is absolutely credible as a foul attorney. Historically, this film is very interesting, both because of where and when it was shot. Since he was English, he did not have a large budget of Hollywood movies of the same time and often shows it, but more interesting is the fact that he shot this film just before the war and shows England that would soon disappear. When we look at it today, we think that in terms of modern morality and the fact that this film and its closest American counterpart "It Happened One Night" were in their days as risqu√© as "Fatal Instinct" in our time. But after watching and using this film for the first time I can not help, but feel sorrow when I look at it today. With half the filming of the film before 1950, rescuing the remaining films is a difficult choice, and unfortunately movies such as this one are often handed over to save the movies we consider to be important. The shifting of colors, the lack of contrast and the generally poor quality of printing that is most often seen are heartbreaking. This movie along with "Happened One Night" is perfect for shrouding with love one under the blanket for a cool cool evening and a watch or even better why not a double feature.
