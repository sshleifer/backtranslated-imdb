This is one of my favorite Govinda films of all time and the best film of 1994. David Dhawan does a great job of directing this film, making it funny and adding family drama. Govinda is as great as Raja Babu and gives great performance. Karishma Kapoor is an actress I hate, this movie is a little less unpleasant, but it still gets poisoned in some scenes. Kader Khan is an acting actor and still gives great performance. Aroona Irani is amazing as a mother and gives excellent performance. Shakti Kapoor is brilliant like Nanda. This film has comedy, action, family drama and romance full of fun.
