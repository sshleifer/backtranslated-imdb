What a fun, sexy movie! They will not do it anymore. 4 sexy au pairs arrive in London and have all possible sexual accidents. The tone is strangely innocuous, because considerable nudity arises from false situations rather than the obvious sexual desire by the characters. Only after the actresses have lost their clothes, male characters become uncontrollable. Richard O 'Sullivan literally gets' Randi' (sic). The film certainly pretends to be the origin of softcore features as lying in the nudity cuties and naturist films of the old school. My special interest in "Au Pair Girls" is that I am a huge fan of Gabrielle Drake. If an actress sometimes looked better naked (she is slim, but amazingly curved) or dressed, come to it (I loved her from the original UFO run - who else could take a purple wig!), I will eat my hat.
