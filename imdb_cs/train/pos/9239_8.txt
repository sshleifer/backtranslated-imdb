As I said in my commentary on the first part: These two films are better than most fiction scientists admit. The script in the second film is not that it moves because we do not see the destruction of human civilization, but the consequences of thousands of refugees fled into small space cans protected only by one powerful spacecraft. But when Battlestar Pegasus appears, the story gets warm and transfers the battle back to Cylon Planets. Okay, he has a little Mad Max, because everything they fight for is fuel for their spacecraft to ride on to find a distant Earth, but it works for me. It's a thrilling fun with sci-fi performances of fine actors and decent special effects (though they are repeating at least :-)). I'd like to continue with Starbuck and Apollo on the board. Instead, we got a second sequel without names that proved that this story worked earlier, especially because the characters were so well chosen ... So, for the 1980s, but for a couple of inches films since 1978.
