I sincerely hope that at least the first season of Cosby will be released on DVD sometime. An episode with an eccentric genius brother, Hilton, George (played by late Roscoe Lee Browne), is classical fun. It reflects classical soulship and love among brothers whose lives evolved in different ways, but both ended up happy. <br /> <br /> Cosby and Mrs. Rashad have greatly captured the chemistry they shared on The Cosby Show for many years, putting them in the role of a higher middle class and showing the size of the artists they can take. <br /> <br /> A list of comedy dynamics ... Madeline Kahn, Phylicia Rashad and Mr. Cosby ... a classic genius!
