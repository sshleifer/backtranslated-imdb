It's a rare opportunity to see the movie again. "Amati Girls" is such a movie. In the old theaters I would stay for another show. Was this story autobiographical for a writer / director? It has an aura of reality. <br /> <br /> All cast stars represent their characters credibly and tenderly. Who would not want Mercedes Ruehl as an older sister? I like her work from "For Roseanna". With most films, one pauses the faith because we know it's the work of actors, producers, directors, sound technicians, etc. It was hard to stop such a belief in The Amati Girls. One feels such a part of this family! How I wanted to come to defend Dolores when her family suppresses her emotional life. And she wanted to encourage Lee Grant when she criticized hair color Cloris Leachman. Humor around the world is not a belly of laughter with humor, but instead it has a good feeling that suits much more than pratfalls and such. The love that is shown in this family of cinemas must be imitated and preserved. <br /> <br /> It's no coincidence that the family, Amati, translated from Italian means "beloved."
