Well, there are plenty of ways to spoil the political thriller. They are usually derived or too ambitious, often having a conspiracy that is totally paranoid and unbelievable. But the Town Hall does not do either of the above. The plot is cleverly created, the story is credible. As for the characters, I would say that this film is a solid average. No character seems to be in place and Al Pacino is as brilliant as ever. His portrayal of the charismatic mayor of NYC is excellent and again proves that Al Pacino is today the absolute top of American actors.
