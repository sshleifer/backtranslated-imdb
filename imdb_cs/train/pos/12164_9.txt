In the year of demanding torture, such as the film "Synecdoche, New York", born out of Charlie Kaufman's self-esteem, there is a film that is hard to follow, but it is about three times more important. "Frownland" is the work of love crew, actor and creator, who are filming friends for years. He follows a person who can not communicate through his truly authentic, real Brooklyn world. The people you see are a step beyond the stylization of the mumblecore movement. They are real people, painfully imprisoned in their own neurons, reluctant to change, incompetent. The real world is their own series of delusions and because it is a film about people who are so deeply silent, it is very difficult to watch. These are 16-mm films without proper light, money or other factors that would make the movie "soothing" but its honesty can not be underestimated, a fact that would cause the room to be full of people, Linklater to awarded him the prize, as in SXSW. It reminds films like "Naked" or the best of "mumblecore". It's a movie that is not for everyone but the one that invites you to look at and grow what you think.
