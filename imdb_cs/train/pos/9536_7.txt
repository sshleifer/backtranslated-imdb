An unfavorable and graphically horrifying Japanese film about little creatures that people take over and transform them into non-zombie-type machines that bounce off and bounce back so the winner can eat the loser. In the middle of it, a lot of lovers will be surprised. <br /> <br /> Technically great horror comedy (?) is only for those with strong acorns because blood and body parts fly. Good taste prevents me from describing what's going on here, but she just says it's pretty scary. If you like such things in the shape of a few steps over lean content by all means, look at this movie. I personally am not just looking forward to these films just for something other than how bad and twisted can be done. Here I was so concerned that I can design it to people I know who like really horrible movies. It's also a movie with enough detail in the details I want to see again because I know what's going on - finally, I'll discover - I want to go back and see what I did not do. These films have a rare internal logic. Of those who like blood and cut limbs, 10 of them are more than 10, there is zero or more accurate running and hiding a warning for everyone else.
