This movie is great! This movie is beautiful! Finally, a film that portrays Muslims as PEOPLE, there are no stereotypes here. This film is driven by a story, actor, and above all his subject, cultural affirmation and discovery. They may look like cliches, but they are not, at least not in this movie. The view of the great mosque in Mecca is utterly immense, and the audience gets a look at the side of the Muslim world, which rarely manifests itself in the West. Here people care, support, devote, tolerant and devoted to each other. What is the welcome and delayed departure from the usual negative portraits of the Arabs. Excellent movie.
