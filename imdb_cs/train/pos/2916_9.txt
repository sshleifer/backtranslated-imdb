Of all the movies I've seen, and that's most of them, it's by far the best in terms of mainly American naval airbrushes (Blimps) during WW II. Yes, there are other good movies that are related to LTA, but most of them use special effects more than any real-time images. This male navy has far more real-time footage from aircraft, etc. It's true that it's a lot of conversation, but that's what makes Hollywood more interesting movies even today. P.S. I spent 10 years (out of 20) and I had more than 5,000 hours in all naval airships of all types from 1949 to 1959.
