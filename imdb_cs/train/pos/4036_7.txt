Good luck to find this movie even watching - it's not yet allowed on a tape or DVD. In the early 1970s, I saw that I was released, it was so lucky I got it over the effort to preserve the American Cinematheque, and it still has some tangible moments that I've been thirty years old. <br /> <br /> No reason to repeat Rwint's exact comments here. As an incoming director, soon after the success of Five Easy Pieces, Jack N is said to have done the best for low budgets and is definitely looking for a wand and a meander that could use some new cutting. But it's also an unforgettable icon for it's time: all very intense sports clashes in high school, student movements, sexual revolutions, and more. <br /> <br /> Why do you see this movie? In some scenes, it was probably an occasional distributor: a shabby male sleep in the shower after play; Karen Black's tapping scene in the car takes you a little out of the guard - but it's the first use of a word I've never seen before in the movie; and informal and unexpected use of nudity as a whole. It's probably another that I missed. See the beautiful surprise of young Cindy Williams in one of her first films; thin David Ogend Stiers; Mike Warren was fresh from UCLA powder blue uniform and was preparing for a dark blue TV uniform; Robert Towne - actor; and a lot of people just play alone. <br /> <br /> Now: Any connection between Harry Gittes' surnames, Robert Town and a character in Chinatown and Two Jakes? <br /> <br /> It gets "7" based on Karen Black. You'll see why.
