I admit that, before I looked, it creates great hope because some friends mention it (and they are not perverse!), How it must be seen. And this must be seen! Just do not expect to see anything. Freudian psychoanalysts are interesting in many parts of the film, but there is too much perversion and eventually will not stay. <br /> Some of the good things are the Kieslow blue analysis, most of David Lynch, some of Hitchcock's, and maybe a few others that I missed (I just remembered ... Dogville), and I usually do not miss things if they are too obvious or loose in the air. In addition to repeating, which is too long, the documentary is entertaining in the sense that it notices some of the perversions that subdued our subconscious, and therefore commercial success has been studied by most thrillers and used as the basis for this theory. I really enjoyed the energetic tone of narration and the effort of Mr. Zizka to revive Freud's theory, which was too despondent, especially in North America. Again it is over the top and I believe it will not be a waste of time because I believe most people have a dark recognition for death and blood.
