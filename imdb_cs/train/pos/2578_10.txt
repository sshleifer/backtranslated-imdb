Superman and Mole Men are pretty much the most difficult adventures of Superman. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to Silsby, home to the world's deepest oil well. While there some radioactive pier men come through a oil well and explore the city. Jeff Corey and many other people in the city are trying to destroy the invading men. Can Superman change people in a timely manner to save the mole? Can Superman warn people in time of the radioactive dangers of men? In my opinion, Superman and Mole Men are a very intelligent, well-written and well-engineered film. Even if we see Superman flying only briefly, it still makes super superman adventures. It has to be seen for everyone. <br /> <br />
