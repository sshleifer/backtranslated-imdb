This movie was classical. I have to say that this film captured the best of the working man who learns from his mistakes. if we could all come together and learn how everyone in this movie did. It has been an important part to show how a family is an important part of life, and how pride can cause the loss of something important in life if we can not find "BIG THROAT" and harvesters are pride.
