After reading a very short comment "No bad" I could not comment. This movie is much better than simply bad. The game is stellar, even from the children in the cast who do not play cute or anything else, but they are just like the friends of my son. The film is smart and expects it to be an audience. Two-point flash story stories are imaginative and contribute to the story rather than act as a stack of time. I watched this film with my children, and then I watched myself again a few days later. If you have children and are ill until the death of movies that inspire diabetic coma with their syrupy sweetness, then look at "Hole". My six-year-old enjoyed it just like my 11-year-old and my husband and I enjoyed it just like you two. How many movies can you tell?
