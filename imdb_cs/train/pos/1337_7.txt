......... and get Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. Do not get me wrong, this movie is much less explicit (or not) than a pretty woman, but it was a new theme for Bollywood. The subject was accepted but it's far from Jism, Murder, and Julie. To tell you the truth, the subject is presented in a very pure way. But the plot has its own clich√©. The beginning of the film is presented with "movies". There are several very small holes. The movie will appear as soon as Rani has an abortion, where you feel you are watching something other than a typical movie. Otherwise, the entire family sequence felt exaggerated at the beginning. The effect could not be better. Salman Khan sometimes impresses, and sometimes he lets you down. Here he made one of the best performances. Besides, his role is written so well that you applaud each time you solve the problem. Rani Mukherjee was reasonable. Throughout the movie you feel the most of her character, but she is overshadowed by Preity Zintou. Preity Zinta is the perfect picture. Of the three, she gives every run for her money. It is surprising how she can be as convincing when she is innocent. And believe me, Madhubal is far from your next girl. This role is one of the reasons I appreciate it high. Supportive casts are like the family you see in HAHK, where they have no meaning for the plot, yet I found them acceptable here. The songs are nice. The title song is my favorite with Dil Tera Mera Dil (Hearts). Mehndi Mehndi (Henna) and Dekhne Walon No (See the world outlook) are two songs that perfectly fit the movie. Preity's cabaret number, Diwani Diwani (Crazy), could be truncated, while No. 1 Punjabi ran into boring, although it had good dances. Otherwise, the film is worth watching.
