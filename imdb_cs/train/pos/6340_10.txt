First explain what makes a great movie for me. The excitement that they do not know what's next will be the movie when I watch it for the first time (case and point: Twister). There are other things that go into a big first look like good humor (John Candy in Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors), a good plot with good resolution (Madeline and Matilda), imaginative narratives (all Star Wars episodes - George Lucas is THE MAN) and good music (again all Star Wars episodes, Wizard of Oz, Sound of Music). What made me watch the film at least six times in the theater and buy a DVD or VHS cassette? Characters. That's what I told Cindy Lou Who and The Grinch. Outstanding Performance by Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. The rest of the cast was very good, especially Jeffery Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski and Josh Ryan Evans. But every scene with Cindy and The Grinch-together is great and very fun and / or hearty. Cindy Lou is my favorite character in this movie and the most convincing reason why the movie is better than a cartoon. Grinch has a strong plot, good conflicts, and a very good topic (I can not start because I do not want to spoil it). Jim Carrey was very entertaining as The Grinch - especially when he touched Cindy. And music! Wow! Excellent music by James Horner. I loved his choice of instruments and compositions. Good work Jim Carrey - I did not know you could sing. Taylor Momsen! Who! Your voice is a good reason for the film to be visible at least once. On your solo - Where are you Christmas - is your voice really as tall as it sounds? Does it sound like F #? This is an obscene range for the seven-year-old (obscene means the best). Good work. This is the best performance of a child I've ever heard in the movie (Taylor beat Von Trapp Children - no little performance!). And now to the actors. Jim Carrey was great, funny, and surprisingly very sensitive (it actually turned out in scenes with Taylor Momsen). Taylor Momsen's unclear expressions (one of the secrets of good acting performance) are very strong - really becomes Cindy Lou Who. And when he makes a dialogue, he is even stronger. <br /> <br /> ********************************* danger: warning: spoiler ***** **************** *************************** ******* ******************************************** <br /> <br /> : an expression when he first sees The Grinch. This is a classic quotation ("You Are," then filled in by Grinch "da da da GRINCH", after which it spreads into a screen and then rescues The Grinch.) "Thanks for saving my quotation and the subsequent reaction The Grinch was also very good. My favorite part of the movie is when Cindy invites The Grinch as Holiday Cheermeister, who is two excellent actors in their best interaction, and Taylor Momsen is fully in this place with Jim Carrey and I sincerely hope that Taylor Momsen sees in many other films will take place throughout the movie (except legs and feet).
