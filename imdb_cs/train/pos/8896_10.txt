Can anyone help find out the name and artist of the song that was played at least in the middle of the movie. I do not remember what the scene is playing. The words in the song are ballad. Some of the texts go like "It's a way to tell you something wrong." It's a way to say it in the song. "" It's a way to untie you. "Please help me with this question, thank you so much! I'm looking for the Internet for days, I can not get this song out of my way so it will be a challenge to find someone who can help me with this matter." He looked at the scene when he played.
