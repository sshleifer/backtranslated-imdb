In many of his films (Citizen Kane, Confidential Report, Touch of evil), Orson Welles has given him the role of frightened men. In the "Dam of Shanghai," it's the only time I see she's holding the role of the victim. The role of the culprit that Rita Hayworth gave to her, I think it's because he fell in love with her. That's why it's an interesting movie. But I think this story is excellent. Direction is brilliant, as usual with Welles: two scenes are particularly brilliant: one in the aquarium and one in the mirror. This movie is great. (10/10)
