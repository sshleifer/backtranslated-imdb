I married a Japanese woman 14 years ago. We're still together. <br /> <br /> However, it was never that easy in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Life in the army has been drawn for many years for action, drama and comedy with this point. Fights to death. Mixed relationships gave her a new reason for coverage. Today it's an old hat, but then ...? When you get married to Asia, it means that you either owe someone something or you were anger. This touched both options together with the third one. Maybe it's love? Brando did his usual good job. Garner did a better job than usual. It's good, but it turned out how good it can be. Umecki-chan had a debut in a helluva, and when I think she had a statue, she really did not find it. It was a role that no one who was not overseas would not recognize and the novelty was a korkorkou. Red was the best in this movie. Bank for it. And the Japanese lifestyle was also displayed in admirable light. <br /> <br /> Classic.
