Thre is not the only Scorsese movie I'd put on my favorite movie list. But this is the best thing I've ever seen around my DVD player in about five years. Scorsese's patient clarification of favorite movie moments and how Hollywood works is incredibly gracious, quiet and intelligent. <br /> <br /> There are 3 DVDs. It will have to be British production, because everything about American corporate culture would hurt silent, methodical, no fancy and focused approach to the content that is dealt with here. And American production would require it to say that he likes only movies that were a favorite favorite. I wish everyone took a page of love for the movies. You should love movies that you do for personal, idiosyncratic and specific reasons. Not only for me "more" vote for The Godfather, etc. People have no idea what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies. If so, movies will be more interesting than they are. Scorsese knows what ideas are being explored, making him a convincing and engaging speaker on the subject. I really appreciate his distinctive, generous conversations over the last decade. Scorsese is the worst when he is excited to show you a dark movie than to teach you something about the history of the film. And I wish he pulled those three hair out of those nose. It is very disturbing.
