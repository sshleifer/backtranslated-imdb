After losing Emma for her performance as Mama Rose in the television version of GYPSY, Bette won Emmy the following year for BETTE MIDLER: DIVA LAS VEGAS, a live concert special made for HBO from Las Vegas. Midler, who has performed on stage since 1970, proves he's still one of the liveliest live artists in the industry. From her initial figure, her classic "Friends", where she descended from the wings on a beautiful runaway cloud, Bette commanding a podium style and a rap style charisma called "I Look Good," then proves he has a joke, like a few other artists in in this field, as they blend in with different musical selections. Part of the show, which approves burlesque, takes a bit too long, but she has managed to incorporate her old jokes by Sophie Tucker into goodness (though she really forgets one joke in the middle of a narrative, but her ad-libbing until she forgets it's hysterical). Bette also treats us with the "Rose Turn" from GYPSY and the title melody from her shattering film THE ROSE as well as the filthy plug for her hit film THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. She brings the house down to the end with "Stay With Me, a Child" from ROSE and her only hit # 1 record, "Wind Under My Wings" from BEACHES. It's a brilliant evening of musical comedy fun and for Midler fans, it's a must.
