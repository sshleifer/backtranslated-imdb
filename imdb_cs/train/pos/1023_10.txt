This show has been my escape from reality over the past ten years. Unfortunately, I will miss it. Although Atlantis filled the hole a bit. <br /> <br /> The last episode of SG1 (on TV) was beautifully finished. Robert wrote something that felt close to reality. As if trying to explain what was on the scene. (Everyone who works closely for so long is bound up and down, but over the years they have turned into a family). I thought it was a great way to go through someone else's criticism. SG1 was something special, and it took me over and over and over and over again. Fabulous characters, stories, directors, writers. Since episode one, I have been addicted. The mix of events, science, drama and especially comedy worked so well that it made me want more. <br /> <br /> There are no real words that would fully express what this show means to me. I can only thank those who have kept the show so fresh and entertaining for many years. It inspired me to do many things that I thought was impossible. I look forward to the movies next year and I really hope there will be a lot of them. I never want the show to die. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?
