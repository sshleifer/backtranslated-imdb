Highly recommended! <br /> <br /> A well-written and entertaining film that everyone will appeal to everyone with a sense of humor !!!. Give it, it's good to see an independent British film more than hold your own against great studies! It is definitely worth adding to any movie collection. There are scenes in this movie, which I'm sure many people will be able to relate to. You will laugh out loud at the antics and enjoy the great soundtrack. I especially enjoyed the Orb version of Vietnam by Jimmy Cliff and The Tower of London from Freebird. <br /> <br /> Continue on ............ you will not be disappointed.
