Wow I loved this movie! This is a normal life in a small village. About hypocrisy and honesty, love and surrender. Great! These are things that everyone meets in life. You have to do things with passion. But some people will not appreciate your passion and try to stop you. There are people who find others' opinions and what "neighbors think of" more important than watching their hearts. Do not let someone shoot you in the fulfillment of your dreams and passions. I loved the fact that the actors were all really normal people, it could be my family. No great beauty, but all the people you love in the movie.
