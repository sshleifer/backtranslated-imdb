GIRL FROM MISSOURI arrives in New York because she knows exactly what she wants to get something solid when she marries a millionaire - without losing her virginity. With her discarded good looks, she quickly catches the eye of a playboy son of a tycoon, but by remaining faithful to her virtues, will she also discover true love? Jean Harlow is performing in this great little comedy. With her platinum hair and beautiful attributes she is dazzling. But her beauty should not conceal the fact that she was also a very good actress. She rightly took her place at the very top of the Hollywood Pantheon. The excellent cast gives Harlow a soft support: Lionel Barrymore as a greedy old mogul, wise of Harlow's paths; handsome Franchot Tone as his son, interested in love; Pregnant Patsy Kelly, stealing her scenes as Harlow's helper; love Alan Mowbray, as a well-controlled English master; Elder Clara Blandick as Barrymore Feisty's Secretary; hearty Hale Hamilton as a rich man with an eye for ladies; muscular Nat Pendleton as a lifeguard who caught Kelly's cocktail eye; and Lewis Stone, unforgettable in a small role as a bankrupt entrepreneur. It should be noted that this film arose soon after the introduction of the Hollywood production code. The comparison with the RED-HEADED WOMAN, made two years ago, would be fascinating - in which Harlow's character follows the same goals but uses very different means.
