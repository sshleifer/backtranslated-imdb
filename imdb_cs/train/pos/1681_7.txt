The "Scorpio's Case" has all the elements necessary to create an effective giallo movie. The story is a standard giallo. When one dies in a plane crash, his wife (Ida Galli) collects a $ 1 million life insurance contract. The widow leads to Greece for paycheck, but a number of murder killings follow. There are a lot of suspects, including the tenacious investigator (George Hilton) from the insurance agency and the widow's lover. Director Martino will keep the story of the move at a rapid pace while the viewer tries to guess the killer's identity. Anita Strindberg (also memorable in "Your Vice-President is a locked room, and I have the key" and "Who saw her die?") He is a hero hero. It's one of Martin's best movies.
