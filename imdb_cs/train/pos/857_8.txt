Greetings again from the darkness. The highly anticipated, twisted comedy from writer / director Richard Shepard is out for Pierce Brosnan's actor. The guy Bond is gone. This new person is completely different! Read that Shepard thought Brosnan was too good a kid for this plum roll, but Brosnan appears to be a perfect Julian Noble, "Facilitator" ... and it's nothing but nice! Do not underestimate the humor of this. If you go, expect bands and views of all types of sex, killing, religion, sports, business, and everything you might consider politically incorrect. Brosnan has an excellent script to the next level with his amazing gestures and physical moves. Even sitting on a hotel bed (with or without sombrero) is a joy to see. Greg Kinnear is a direct guy to Brosnan's comic and has a lot of depth and comic timing to make this partnership clicked. I hope that Davis has a small, but gentle, supportive role as Kinnear's wife (what's her "Bean"?), Who gets a little excited about having a mediator in her living room. <br /> <br /> The visual settings and settings are perfect - including battles with bullfighting, racing and suburban Denver. And how often do we get The Killers and Xavier Cugat on the same soundtrack? This is certainly not for everyone, but if your sense of humor is a little out of the center and you are enjoying a risky film, it could be for you.
