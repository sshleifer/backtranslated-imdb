This film is a small sunshine in a dark season. Celebs the quality best described as ordinary old friendships. Morgan Freeman plays the character as Freeman himself - a successful actor is pushing 70. He traveled to a small, rather dirty grocery store that intended to explore the part he could play as a manager of such a place. He will soon hurt employees and customers, especially beautiful, if he is a top-ranked, young woman (Paz Vega) who presides over 10 items or less. 10 items or less have a big statement to make and not pretend to do it. He watches Freeman and Vega as they become friendly, and how the older man offers his advice in exchange for home travel - the Gofer film businessman who should pick him up will never show up and Freeman forgot his own phone number can not ask for help. I had a small case of blues on the gray Sunday afternoon in New York and this movie cured me.
