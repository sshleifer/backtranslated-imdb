It's just a great, fun, beautiful movie. Capturing the true essence of decades and people and telling a beautiful love story of two sister-and-two sailors. Although this film can only be in black and white, it definitely does not count today in modern days. The main purpose of the film is timeless. This movie features great acting, beautiful songs and dance figures, and excellent design work and movie footage. Watch the fleet is also comic, there are fun moments, moments that make you laugh, but also other moments when acting just gets into that sort of thing. It's amazing how this movie can be set in a decade, as it can affect today. If you want to see something great, check it out.
