I became a "shower" in the foreign film section of my local department store and several times I went through it because it looked like cover or comedy from the cover. Then I made a lucky copy for a purchase at an economical price and I'm happy for my luck. The "shower" is a story of three (3) men, fathers and two (2) adult sons, each of whom cope with changes in life, as the world around them continues to change in modern China. As with many "foreign" films, Chinese culture itself is one of the most exciting aspects of this film. In addition to the fascinating features of the local Chinese color that tells the story of the story, it is difficult, yet sweet, relationships between men and the only woman involved in the story to be built behind the village spa house. The story of the family ranges from estrangement to understanding, and it made me happy to hear these people. There are numerous small characters, customers in the spa, and their individual conflicts and friendships. "Shower" is a movie that leaves a smile and touches its warmth and humanity.
