I come to Pinjar from a completely different environment than most other reviewers who sent out here. I'm a fairly new film in Bollywood movies and I was born and raised in the USA. So I do not have a broad basis for comparing Pinjar with other Indian movies. Fortunately, no comparison is needed. <br /> <br /> Pinjar stands alone as nothing but a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> In one line I can tell you that Pinjar is one of the most important movies from any studio anytime, anywhere. The mass appeal could be * the Indian equivalent of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" if it was adequately promoted in the United States. This could be a very good movie that gave Bollywood an American map. The American film public has a long-lasting love affair with "Gone With the Wind", and while Pinjar does not borrow from the plot, there are similar forms. The smallest of them is 183-minute run (according to US standards). Compared to the broken backdrop of the division of India and Pakistan between 1947 and 1948, the human drama of a young woman was impressed by circumstances and struck into problems that did not have a hand in creating. Get into an unsustainable position, she can not only survive, but also grow - and even bloom. If the story lacks any way, it's in the exposition. Purova's (protagonist's growth) as a man would be better illustrated - at least for Western audiences who are not familiar with Indian culture - if her character's "back story" developed more in the early part of the film. But it would stretch a 3-hour film for 3½ hours or maybe even more. Since not one minute of the film is unnecessary and none of what would make it impossible to edit could have been shortened due to time. Better that the audience needs to fill in some of the previous events, rather than omit some of what's left. <br /> <br /> I could use a lot of words to describe Pinjar: "painful", "disturbing", "convincing", immediately comes to mind "heart". But "uplifting" may be like all of them. Any story that shows the discomfort of the human spirit from worst chances must be considered as such. And Puro's triumph-though perhaps not immediately apparent to those around her-is no less inspiring. For a strong story I can not recommend this film enough. <br /> <br /> The portrait of Púro Urmila Matondkara is equally inspiring. All often overlooked in the midst of younger, more recent actresses, Urmila has the unique ability to deliver a wholly credible character in any role it plays. It does not just act on Puro's role, it breathes life into character. The selection of Manoj Bajpai as Rashid was inspired. Manages something that is too few Indian film heroes: softness. Its control of expression and nuance is crucial for this role. He brings more threats to the beginning of the movie with his piercing look than all the swords-coupled warriors. <br /> <br /> If you see only one Bollywood movie in your life, make it Pinjar.
