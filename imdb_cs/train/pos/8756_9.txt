I recorded this film by accident on the cable in the middle and had to rent it to see that it was all and I'm glad I did it. I was filmed instantly and cared for the girls. Naive high school graduates, best friends since childhood, undergo college trips and are admitted to a horse named Nick who is getting them into serious trouble. They are used as a scapegoat in a heroin smuggler circle. Involved in guardianship, girls learn how to deal with their imprisonment while trying to find their way to their troubles. Everything that is trying to help itself is inadequate when the Thai criminal justice system shows shortcomings, and girls end up with more problems and lose the trust of their American lawyer, Yankee Hanka. Hank tries to try and defend her after she feels betrayed by Alice (Claire Dane). However, Thai Native Hanka's wife smells rats in case and does another job of investigating the legs and finds that the girls were actually victims. The end of the film when Alice makes a selfless act to save Darlene (Beckinsale) tears me. I really liked this film and I would recommend it.
