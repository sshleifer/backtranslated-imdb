The story is about Jet Li, who has to fight against his old friends. But there is one problem, friends are superfighters. The movie is full of blood, super action and the best stuntman forever. And Lau Ching-Wan is a great co-author. Of course the film has a typical HK-Fun. But I like it! In Germany, the "black mask" is obscure.
