I just saw "Valentine," and I have to say it was the best movie slasher I've ever seen. Unlike the last 90's of the horror, this film is more concerned with being mysterious than it is with itself. For those who hate "Scream," there is no link to "horror rules" in this movie (even though the movie rules of old slashers apply here). <br /> <br /> This is the perfect blend of the 80s and 90s. You'll get style, cinematography and good acting performances of 90th movies and crawling-slasher madness of the eighties. I think 2001 will finally offer horror fans the type of films they wanted. This is definitely a step in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Denise Richards performs as a funny figure here. You can say she likes her role, and it's coming out. I loved her in this movie.
