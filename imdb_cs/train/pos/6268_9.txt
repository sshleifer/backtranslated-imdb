Carter Wong plays a noble hero on his way to healing books that lead him to the ultimate vengeance! Motion is good in this movie and there are plenty of combat scenes to preserve the movie. Flying guillotines look bad and the main villain has no problems with their use. Though the story is not strong, the action is fun and draws you to the very end (which I felt could be a sequel). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
