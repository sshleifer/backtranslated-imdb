I saw the movie a few days ago. This movie is so great that I feel that if you want something really bad that you've always dreamed of - you can have it. This shows a great wish that has become fruitful happiness and sadness, hopelessness and failure. But if you are strong enough and your heart truly belongs to something you love, you can do something and be happy.
