Along with "Aparadektoi, the best Greek comedy series!" Written by Lefteris Papapetrou and Antonis Aggelopoulos are magnificently directed by Soso, Alekos, Flora, Achilleas, Grandpa Aristide, Machi, Johnnie, Corrina and Michalis! a butcher living in the district near Athens city center, married to Soso, one day he meets Flora, his old dating, now married to Achileas, and lives with his father-in-law and his manager Mach. also has a son named Johnny, who appears at the end of the first season and the other, the rest of the main character are Michalis, Alekos's assistant in butcher and bisexual, and Corrina, Achilleas's lost sister, who appeared as the best prostitute in all of Athens. Soso's attempt to kill Alec because he cheats him, but everything else that's going on is not less important. A brilliant script with excellent conspiracy, poisonous quotes, aw esome performances and great overhead. The original idea and especially the shooting was something that was done on Greek television, for the first time on a line of Greek TV, for example scenes shot underwater! Seriously, you will never love it!
