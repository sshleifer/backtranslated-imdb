You would be forgiven for the Finnish director from Helsinki not being good at driving an American horror film (especially the one inside an American prison) - you will see that you can do it wrong! The production was made in the 1980s and the film was created with a budget more suited to a modern television advertising campaign (something I think someone would really notice today that practically everyone gets used to $ 100 million + action film budgets, industrial mind!) is the first significant production of Mr. Harlin and - at least what is now considered to be a star cast. I still think that most of the Nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole is more related to Stellan Stargaard's scenario (not to mention Bergman's over-overhead efforts) - at least for all viewers. proves that there is not the right film talent outside the US and Hollywood to watch the film in a tense state. Try to watch this movie, even if you are not a horror baf, IMO is definitely worth it!
