I looked at this show as a child and I loved her! I saw it when it came to Toonami YEARS ago .... Sheesh, it sounded so old! I had to be 13 or 14 when it came ... But anyway, she had a great conspicuous line, and I'm one of the girls girls who looked at Sailormoon (and ADORED) and I really liked it. Animation was not the best ... Totally fun in some parts, in fact, and voice acting was extraordinarily lame at the beginning, but it was all good watches and I found myself sucking it day by day. <br /> Samurai Troopers / Ronin Warriors is a classic and is one of my favorites. Go Ryo !!!!
