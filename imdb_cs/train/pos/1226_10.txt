They shot a film on a long island where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were also in this movie. There seems to be a party scene where everyone drinks a beer (that they call me dyed water, tastes disgusting, and it's always hard to swallow, especially in sleep scenes). Still, none of us has ever heard of the film being launched anywhere in any form. It never happened in the theaters (of course), and if I knew it, it was never published on the video and I'm sure it was not released on DVD. Still, it seems that some people have seen it, though it is probably very few. So there must be something. I'd like to buy it for my brother, but it's not worth it anywhere. Does anyone know anything about when / where / how can this movie be purchased? And what format will it be?
