"Great Farewell" introduces us to the first adventure of the holodeck, in this case Captain Picard, the private investigator of Dixon Hill. These episodes form a standard sample, repeated on TNG, as well as on DS 9 and Voyager. After entering the holodeck, something goes wrong and the characters have to deal with the program under other circumstances than playing the game (represented by the failure of the Holopas security program). <br /> <br /> This concept is used to extend Star Trek and enable any kind of genre mix. Picard's Dixon Hill stories are examples of 19th-century crime and their screening is referred to as Film Noir, which often has a stereotypical anti-hero leader (see, for example, Chandler's Marlowe or Polanski's "Chinatown" stories). Star Trek never focuses on the story (usually it's a simple "how we get out" scenario), but it allows actors to tell their characters. Those holographic "games" are commonly used to recreate and reflect the private interests of crew members. That's why the technical aspect is always neglected, and from this point of view, the stories are never healthy (but Star Trek has ever had technical, scientific significance, I mean, apart from some utopian terms?). <br /> <br /> "Great farewell" shows the relaxed Patrick Stewart, McFadden, who really did not look better in the Star Trek episode (at least the early ones) and the Data also has great scenes (although it's hard to believe that pulling the lamp plug from the wall would actually surprise him because he conducted research in this period and his habits). Wesley continues to transform the peaceful Trekkies into potential killers (why did not they come to Holodeck camp and let the gangsters finish it?) But it's all fun ...
