First of all, I'm not Justin Timberlake fangirl obsessed with it looks good, I'm not really a huge fan of Justin, but I liked this movie. I'm working on a video when I saw the movie with a huge cast that I never heard that I had to see what it was about. I did not find that Justin was doing so badly, it was probably the worst of the group, but it's quite an impressive band because Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott are two names that did not even make the first list of credits. The story is basic, the journalist discovers corrupt cops, but I find it well done. L L The Cool J character was clearly contradictory, but I honestly did not know what he would do in the end. Morgan Freeman is, as always, a wise mentor who does so well, and like Kevin SPacey I was a bit there. HIs character did not have much substance, but it's Kevin Spacey, he can not do anything wrong. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, I thought Dylan McDermott gave the best performance as a murderous cop. Really credible and truly in character, he scared me a few times. I was really expecting a lot of cheese to be honest. Bad phrases, unjustified action sequences, such things, but it was surprisingly well done and I did not find any of it. Each filming made sense, it was not a clich√©, it was really solid. Overall, amazing cast, a decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to jump me. I do not know why she did not appear in the theaters, it was better than the waste I saw on the big screen. I think it's worth seeing.
