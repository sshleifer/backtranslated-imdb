I will be honest with you ... I like this movie. It's a great zombie that's full of action, original ideas, good acting, but it's also full of bad zombie effects. Part IV, "After Death," is also good. I would recommend this movie to fans of horror everywhere. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> For more recommendations, please see the other comments I've posted by clicking on my name above this comment section.
