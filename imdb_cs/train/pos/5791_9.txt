This must be one of my favorite episodes of the Twilight Zone, especially for displaying two lonely souls in a post-apocalyptic environment. Coastal shops and difficult streets are secret in such a way that the Twilight Zone works best. <br /> <br /> While the parable can be a little bit hard under today's dramatic standards, it's excellent - by setting up a statement that is relevant to human experience as well as geopolitics in a way that is timeless. The whole drama lies solely on the shoulders of Mr Bronson and Mrs Montgomery, who do not disappoint. (May both rest in peace) <br /> <br /> True Classic.
