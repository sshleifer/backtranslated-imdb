Old Jane's fairytale story looks very popular these days. I've lost the number of versions that were running around. It is probably the reason that her "routines" are our "routines" even in this late term. This TV mini-series gives him a pleasant story suitable for the novel. The shrill, perceptive Emma is a pretty "modern" girl when you think about it, though the atmosphere of Jane Austen's world may seem artificial today. If you do not seem EMMA, I'm just saying that Emma herself-enough gets it. Watch it for you to find out how. The acting actors belong to ladies: Kate, Prunella, Lucy and Samantha. They could have almost a psychic connection with old Jane!
