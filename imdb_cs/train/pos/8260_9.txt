The French and the Germans certainly have a long history that they do not like it. It is interesting to note that in 1931 there was a chamber translation comedy Kamerdaschaft or Comradeship. Just a few years later Hitler besieges Germany and begins plans to take over the world, and France is a victim of his ambition. But these are moments of balance compared to the future. A group of miners on the border is trying to move to France to get to work. They open and later in the nightclub from their French neighbors. Then there is a disaster in French mines and well-written and written scenes, a group of German miners deciding to come to rescue. A simple story is not? Pabst was a silent film poet and I'm not sure if this is his first soundtrack or not, but his poetry is there to appear. He is not disturbed, but brings a harsh realism to suffering. It is even the memory of the Second World War, which points to the story of this story. Probably based on a real event, the film makes the event proud with nearness and dignity. Smetimes, that's what the movie must be.
