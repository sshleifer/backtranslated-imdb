First of all, I would like to point out that the people criticizing this film have made some sharp mistakes. Everything under 6/10 is quite clear. <br /> <br /> Creep is an absolutely fantastic movie with amazing movie effects. Actors are highly believable, storytelling, and horror and graphic content are very disturbing. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of mystery in this movie. Many questions arise when viewers are exposed to a strange and wild creature that makes a location in tunnels with dark rats. How was Craig created and what happened to him? Fantastic film with great cold factor. A movie with so many unanswered questions and a film to be appreciated along with others like 28 days later, Bunker, Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch. We look forward to another of these fantastic movies!
