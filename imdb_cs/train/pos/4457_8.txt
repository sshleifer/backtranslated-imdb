Yes, this is one of the great musical films I've grown up with as great auspicious as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention Kathryn Grayson's small and famous voice. Music and dance are excellent. I understand that Frank took lessons from Kelly; and there is Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse, which is totally unique for the whole time. Betty Garrett plays a service station that falls in love with Sinatra. It's one of Hollywood's big underrated stars. I saw it again on A & E television and I still had it in my old videotapes. Never tired of these old musicals. What happened to Hollywood?
