Richard Noah's exquisite comic farce by Paul Mazursky is played by Jack Noah, a rather successful actor, who is at the scene of filming in a fictitious Latin American banana republic of Parador, run by a fascist Alfonso Sims, who unfortunately suffered a heart attack after having too many local cocktails! Raul Julia plays a Hungarian police chief who forces reluctant Noah to act as a Just Death dictator who has noticed remarkable similarity to Noah. Sonia Braga plays the dictator's graceful lady who gives Noah a few lessons on how to "act" as a dictator, Jonathan Winter literally rounds off the occupation as a CIA man in Parador as a hammock dealer.
