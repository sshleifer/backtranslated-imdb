This is really more drama and it is very gloomy ... I remember some emotionally intense voices of the Spiritual. Pitt plays his perhaps the most northern film ever with a surprising talent. Who started as a hopeless but harmless "white waste", the husband became a violent, disturbing alcoholic with a confused mind. During some of the last phases in the film, it was hard to keep watching - it was unpredictable and scary. This proves very good writing and acting. The whole movie is full of bizarre, sensational scenes that will keep my breath no less than once and I do not think action scenes. I mean dialog scenes so brilliantly created that I actually furious and grieve after what I saw. It was like watching the rhinoceros and the lion in the cage, watching how they got to death. Again, I was very impressed with the screenwriter (s); whoever it is impossible: mixed oil and water. I also enjoyed the performance of Juliette Lewis. It is so rare that this talented young actress these days will appear that if she does, it is such a joy. Some of her moments in this movie have led me to tears. I'm serious. The emotions that this girl can wake up in your head are incredible, and I can remember clearly that I have been pampered several times. Soon I feel like I was cheating on the quality craft that the filmmakers were showing just giving the "CALIFORNII" rating ***. But the dark feelings they make are too strong and depressing to raise them. I believe everyone should see this movie. I really do it.
