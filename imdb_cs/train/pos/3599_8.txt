This film is a real jewel. The arc of the plot is defined in the first 3 minutes, the characters are sympathetically and clearly drawn, their motives are completely believable. Dialogue is fresh and oh so real. The situations are unique and not clich√© or hackneyed. Until the climax. Then it is as if the film was a little bit out of track and a bit hokey and incredible. But I do not want to discourage people from watching this movie. The first three quarters are truly remarkable. I gave him eight. There are some notable performances here. Watch this movie.
