I looked at the film "On Thin Ice" on television in India. I have to say that the film was really well done and actually sent me chill to the spine .. the basic story is thinking about what makes some addicted decide to go where others remain addicted ... but I felt that Diane Keaton was in her best ... scenes where she likes it, and she starts to go home for cocaine ... it was best ... Both boys are good and Lynda Boyd also showed her good actress ... The script is well done as well cinematography and direction .. and casting <br /> <br /> Must have to watch the movie ... for everyone
