This film has never appeared on TCM and has discovered this story about Poland and a small town that has had to suffer Nazi occupation of local cities as well as many other European cities such as Norway. World War I ended, and people in this city still suffered from lost soldiers and wounded men who always create war. Alexander Knox (Wilhelm Gimm) "Gorky Park" returns from the war with his lost leg and was a former school teacher in the city. He was raised as a German and was not very satisfied with the Polish people, and they did not even accept him. When Hitler's party became powerful, Wilhelm Grimm wanted to become a Nazi to return and punish this small Polish city for their treatment of him, which was all in his mind. Marsha Hunt (Marja Pacierkowski), "Chloe's Prayer," played an excellent role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with Whilhelm Gimm. There are many flashes and some real truths about how the Nazis destroyed human families and their whole lives. This picture shows cattle with Jewish people heading to Nazi gas chambers. If you have not seen this movie, and as a subject, give it some time; this movie is very interesting for the 1944 film and you will not forget the story too quickly.
