I noticed that the NEW AMBITIONS and RETURNS OF BACK are TOP 10, but this is not even in the TOP 100. This movie has a bad reputation for the Ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie: <br /> <br /> - Rescue Han Solo of Jabba: This clerk will launch Han Solo in debt that was founded when we first met with the figure in NEW HOPE. The Emperor was eventually revealed: Well, it may not work well, because the ancestors are out there, but it was the first time we saw the Emperor as children. <br /> <br /> - Speeder Bike Chase: Well, that was the moment of special effects. But it was certainly one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the movies! 3-Piece Climax: 1) Battle of Endor (led by Han and Leia) 2) Lukas confronts his father & Fall of the Emperor 3) Destruction of the Second Death of the Star (Land Moment) <br /> <br />- End of the Celebration with our Heroes: As I said, this movie gets a lot of crap due to the Ewoks, but I think it's good that when the whole galaxy celebrates FALL OF THE EMPIRE, our heroes have their own private side in the woods. Overall, it was a great final chapter for our heroes and the appropriate end of the story STAR WARS.
