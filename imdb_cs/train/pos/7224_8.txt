When DEATHTRAP was released for the first time, the poster that appeared on the cover of this DVD offered a graphic form of Rubik's Cube. It's a good shot: originally written for the scene Ira Levin, who wrote such memorable works as ROSEMARY'S BABY and STEPFORD WIVES, was one of the most famous twists in Broadway and under the guidance of Sidney Lumet she screened very well on the screen. <br /> <br /> DEATHTRAP is one of those movies that is very difficult to discuss, because it does in some detail gives away the plot for which it is famous. But the initial premise is incredibly clever: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is the famous author of mysterious games, but nowadays he seems to have lost touch. After a particularly brutal opening night, an old student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sends a screenplay for the play he wrote. It's called "Deathtrap," and Sidney recognizes it as a hit. Just such a hit that would revive his career ... really, a hit for which to die. And when Clifford visits to discuss the game, events suddenly start to rotate in the most unexpected way. Just like Anthony Shaffer's SLEUTH, DEATHTRAP is really a story more home-on-stage than a screen-to get the full power he needs instant power that lively performance offers. Still, under the guidance of director Sidney Lumet, the screen shows more than an impressive presentation. Much of this is due to cast, which is remarkably delicate. Michael Caine performs really well, Dyan Cannon is funny and cute as Sidney's relentlessly anxious wife, and Christopher Reeve gives what could be the best performance in his crazy short acting career. If you can not see it in first-rate theatrical production, it will be more than just when it appears. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
