OK, this movie begins as a Lifetime Cheese movie and does not improve almost well through the movie. The script is full of "cheese" and "fluff", and the cast is not largely focused. For the first half of the film, the girl has gone to my nerves. I do not think it's one of the best actor works. The only reason I bought the movie is that he was on sale and had Ellen Burstyn in it. It's amazing, but it's not even one of her best concerts. The story is based on real events and helps film. In fact, I did not like the movie at all and I was disgusted when I saw the cameras on the passenger's balloon, I think ... let it go where it is to go and end it! But everything is forgiven when it reaches its goal and the story is coming. If it does not make a tear in the eye, nothing will! It's cheese and predictable, but it also makes you feel good.
