Artimisie was late last night. At first I did not think I wanted to, but when I saw that I still did not feel asleep and would not do anything else, I continued my observation and felt interested in young Artimisia, virgin, pure and passionate. Her romance with older Tassimi has caused sensible feelings. Although the film is based on a very romantic level, not reality, I loved it much more than a regular biography or costume drama. Great game, great cameras, great music and lyrics. I loved it and I want more! :-)
