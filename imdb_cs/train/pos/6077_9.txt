I do not pretend to be the authority of actors who played Othello, but I have never witnessed the performance of the game, on the film or on the stage where Othello was portrayed with more humanity and authenticity. <br /> <br /> According to biographical notes, Fishburne has never been an actor. Perhaps it explains why his acting, in this beautifully adapted movie, is so credible and powerful. Instead of chewing scenery in an approved way for such powerful roles, Fishburne's portrait is more focussed on Othello's love for his wife and his deep sadness for her presumed betrayal rather than violence and vengeance. In a word, performance is undervalued and much more impressive is Fishburne's extremely intelligent interpretation than it would otherwise be. All acting is great, and (short) speeches are gaining light from their grace. (Even Shakesspeare, after all, can be improved, now and again - and if it's betrayal, make the most of it!
