The last WWE PPV in 2006 turned out to be a hit with fans, but for one reason was a ladder match to be only Paul London and Brian Kendrick against William Regal and Dave Taylor. But thanks to the recent blind PPV that was celebrated in December, WWE knew she had to do something for the fans to talk again, which proved useful when they introduced MNM and The Hardy Boyz to the mix and announced that the match would be that the match was brutal and one of the best ladder matches I've ever seen, but Joey Mercury's face was a complete mess. Johnny Nitro did not even look at his partner, but he continued as if nothing had happened, and Taylor and Regal did nothing during the match, except for people with several ladders. Eventually London and Kendrick kept the titles. Elsewhere in the show, Kane defeated MVP in a decent hell battle when he hit the MVP's brown costume. Chris Benoit in Chavo Guerrero in a decent match, Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to keep the WWE Cruiserweight title in a solid effort. But the main event was a complete mess, King Booker merged with Finlay to accept John Price and Batista. The action was dirty and no one bothered Batista for his partner. Overall results: Kane beat MVP in hell. Paul London and Brian Kendrick keep the WWE Mark team titles against The Hardy Boyz, MNM and David Taylor and William Regal in a ladder match. Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero to keep the American title in a decent match. <br /> <br /> Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to keep the Cruiserweight Championship. <br /> <br /> Boogeyman defeated The Miz in a terrible match. Undertaker defeated Mr. Kennedy in the last match. <br /> <br /> John Price and Batista defeated King Booker and Finlay in a tough match. <br /> <br /> Overall Score - B
