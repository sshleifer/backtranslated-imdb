This film is really relevant even today, given the threat of bio-terrorism and the threats of superbugs, the West Nile virus and SARS. Like a thriller, the tension is rather intense. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more than helpful in their roles. Home scenes between Widmark and his wife provide a pleasant interlod to the main conspiracy. The actor in this movie, most left behind, is Jack Palance. Its sharply defined features and seemingly flawless exterior still radiate the path to revealing a peculiar and cruel person under the surface. Chase's scene through packs is impressive today. Recommended, 7/10.
