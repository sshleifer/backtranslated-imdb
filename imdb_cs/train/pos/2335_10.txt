That's what t.v. it should be. And Pushing Daisies meets these expectations. Beautifully crafted and well-designed show, Pushing Daisies is one of the few shows that takes place on the most important days that have integrity, is good for the whole family, and raises your imagination. This is not a normal action, gender, money, or murder angles for every other show on t.v. It's a show that makes you think and laugh, but even if the basic act seems to be impossible, the concepts are real to us all. You want something you can not have, hoping someone will want us to escape from your past and look for a family, even in the most unlikely places, etc. ... I realize ABC has basically canceled this great show in this moment and is likely to replace it with a show outside the boundaries of integrity. I suppose everything goes back to the money ... it's bad that there are no other shows on ABC that would feel good after watching.
