This film is a perfect example of a film that divides people into two groups. Those who get the joke and those who do not. People are mostly attacking what they do not understand. This film has a comic style and a charm that has not been unparalleled since then. It's a great comedy ... and great romance. It's a perfect movie. Perfect movie for someone who wants a good laugh. And if your opinion is too tight, perhaps this movie is not for you, and you may need advice. It's an injustice that Paramount has been keeping this movie on the shelf since the early 1980s because she never saw the daylight on DVD. Still, they think the Urban version of "The Honeymooners" is a good idea. It seems strange to me that my two favorite romantic comedies have never been released on DVD. The other is Gene Wilder's "Biggest Lover of the World" that Fox has been sitting since the early 1980s. Still, "From Justin To Kelly" is in almost every video store in the country. There is no justice in the world. Perhaps those who have taken the time to enjoy this will like "from Justin to Kelly", I'm sure one is connected enough to get "got". Sometimes with age people lose a sense of humor ... Or sometimes they simply disappear and find comic satisfaction in repeating "Full House".
