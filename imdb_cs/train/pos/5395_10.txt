I remember watching this movie, thinking so interesting. I really wanted to know what was going to happen. I was amazed at how much it could take in 8 minutes. We start in the schoolyard. . Two friends discuss skipping the class. Kid B says to Kid And "We do not want to go to class today." And Kid A refuses, they say they might miss something really important. So boy B jumps and boy goes to class. When he gets there, the teacher tells him that today they will learn the only and most important lesson they are ever learning. They wanted to learn the meaning of life. He gives each brochure, and when he gets to boy A, he runs out and tells the boy next to him to share it. The boy can not be shared, so Kid A is looking for a teacher. When she finally finds her, she gets a shocking revelation of what the real meaning of life is. I suggest that everyone watch it. It will take only 8 minutes of your life, but the message is so important that it can help you all your life.
