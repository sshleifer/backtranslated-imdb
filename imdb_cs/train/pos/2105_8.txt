Meeting in World Depression Era Prague is the story of an ambitious business clerk who falls in love with a mysterious woman with whom she has exchanged romantic letters just to find that a mysterious woman is none other than a selling girl in his business who seems to be constantly defending with colleagues. Add a little twist (the owner is convinced that his favorite employee - Stewart - has a relationship with the owner's wife), so Stewart briefly "fired" along with the admission that the selling girl "likes" to Stewart all the time, a happy ending is inevitable. Although the VERY date (references to poverty and -woman and two children to consider) are overused, along with the hint that many small items of pleasure such as a music cigar box are out of reach for the enjoyment of ordinary people), this movie is much more efficient (and more credible) than re-make "You've Got Mail" in the nineties. In re-make play by Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the real chances of chain-events are so incredible that the viewer's intelligence is grossly insulted. The "shop around the corner" is innocent to go through the memorial lane to a less complicated, less hectic and romantic era and a place known as the utopia of a writer. Lovers of classic romantic comedies will look forward to this picture!
