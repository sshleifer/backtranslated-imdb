It's too bad, many people did not understand it and another episode. But do not worry! <br /> <br /> This episode is divided into two parts. <br /> <br /> The first part is Tony's "dream" in his coma. The second part is what happens in real life. Now what people do not understand is that Tony's dream is more than just a dream. in this episode is about his preparation for his death. It loses its own identity and eventually even forsakes itself, thus disconnecting all its ties to this world. You will notice what I say on the medical scene, where Tony says he has lost a briefcase that contains "his life." The creators have really done an excellent job of interpreting that they have their own thoughts about what happens when you die. <br /> <br /> If you understand the whole story, you will find this and another episode a unique thing of great spiritual significance. <br /> <br /> Just like any soprano episode, acting and filming are excellent. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not understand was the role of monks. I'll watch it until I have it. Anyway, the episode really touched me, and I do not think anyone else could see better what is happening in an almost deadly experience. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt about 10/10.
