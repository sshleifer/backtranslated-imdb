Facts: Stargate SG-1 is a sci-fi Cheese TV series. <br /> <br /> There are no escaping facts. How much do you try to justify or explain that the Stargate SG-1 remains a science fiction TV series. <br /> <br /> The SG-1 Stargate is borrowing and stealing ideas. Special FXs are not as impressive as they could be, and action will not blow you out of the chair. Or this is a couch. But, and that's where I really think the Stargate SG-1 deserves all the credit it can get for each episode or stolen thought. I think you can rely on at least one cheesy sci-fi movie that is actually worse than an hour of television episode. In fact, some episodes might actually be 90 minutes long and even better than most movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> And keeping this quality throughout the show and continuing to deliver and step up is what the Stargate SG-1 is special to. <br /> <br /> I am very picky with my choices. I'm watching at most one or two TV series and I'm holding pretty high standards that made me even more surprised when I found myself in an angle. So for those who have so far decided to bark Stargate SG-1 another blind sci-fi show, no. Stay with him and see what I'm talking about.
