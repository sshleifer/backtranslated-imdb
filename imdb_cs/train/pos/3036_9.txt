The name just says everything. I watched the film with my father when he went out and served in Korea, he was very admired for him. The disappointment in this film lies in the fact that it focuses only on a short period of human life - it is interesting that a man's whole life would make such an epic biopic that it is stunning to imagine the cost of production. <br /> Some posters outweigh the wrong characteristics of a man, which are cheap shots. The theme of the film "Obligation, Honor, Land" is not just the words that bother the lips of a high-ranking officer - it's a deep declaration of one's complete devotion to his country. <br /> <br /> It is ironic that Peck was a liberal that he gained a better understanding of this man. He does a great job that shows that the fearless general is struggling with the human side of man.
