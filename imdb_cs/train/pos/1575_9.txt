Van trotta film rosenstrasse is the best movie I've seen for years. I really do not care about movies with historical background, but with that I won my interest in this time! The only unpleasant thing about the film was the scenes in New York, and the impression it was "to try to be as American as possible" ... which I think has been totally unsuccessful. the scenes in my back really got into my heart. German actress Katja riemann deserved awards. is one of the most spectacular actresses I've ever seen. I will watch more of her films in the future. great luck for me that I'm native German speaking =) and just for a year in us so once I'm back, I'll buy some riemann dvd. <br /> <br /> so everyone out there who has not seen this movie yet: WATCH IT !!! I think it would be too long to be able to describe what it all is, yet it is difficult to explain all the flashes of the locks and time switches, but you just notice that you will be curious !!!!!!!
