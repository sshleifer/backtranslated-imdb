I've watched almost all the anime Gundam / Mech that appeared in the US, and that's just the best story. The way his spins are rotating and rotating is bored. Gundam Wing is a series that focuses mainly on politics and war. The series follows a group of five five 15-year-old boys who were trained to pilot the state-of-the-art mobile suits known as Gundams. Gundam pilots were trained to fight a strong uprising known as Oz. As things begin to warm up between the GM and the Gundam pilots, new political groups will be created and the old ones will be scattered. Old conflicts will end and new ones will emerge. To achieve peace, Gundam pilots have to face the events that take place in their world and end all the fighting. But to what extent are people willing to go to achieve their goal. I recommend this anime to anyone looking for a show that has a deep plot.
