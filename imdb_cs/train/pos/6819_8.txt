I found time at the top as a fun and encouraging experience. Playing, though not generally brilliant, was totally acceptable and sometimes very good. As a film that obviously focuses on a younger demographic, it is definitely one of the best works in the genre (Sci-Fi for Kids). Under normal circumstances, I would like to say that Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia are producing the best movies and television shows for children and "Time At The Top" does nothing to dismiss this theory! I do not think continuity and great dealings are important for young people. Good plot and imaginative script are more important to them. Both are in abundance in this film. Special effects are good without worsening the story or closing viewers on their own imagination. In this film, it would be very easy to exert an excessive load on SFX, but would completely destroy all of his "Raison D'etre". <br /> <br /> Setting up and working with the camera are very high in this movie and complement the fine wardrobe and historical accuracy. Overall, this film is very satisfying and I recommend it to all viewers who see the world through the eyes of children or those who are trying to do it, just like me! Now I have to read the original book as soon as possible.
