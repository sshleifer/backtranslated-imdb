This film was not only one of John Ford's personal favorites, but also among the regular directors Sergei M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Taverniere, one of his major admirers. The irony is that I got to myself with a recent set of 2-Disc Criterion after leaving a few years ago some original language projections on Italian TV and several times on TV when I was in Hollywood! <br /> <br /> The film was the first of nine cooperating Fords with Henry Fund and is also a vital example of the popular Fordans of America. The beautifully crafted and fairly poetic work, the sequence (and eventual disclosure) of the courtroom in its second half still stiffened, in addition to giving Donald Meeck for becoming a prosecuting lawyer. <br /> Fonda, of course, is perfectly occupied as a bashful, inexperienced but strict and humanist lawyer who was meant to become president; Fonda would continue to introduce other fictional politicians on the film - most notably in 1964 by Franklin J. Schaffner THE BEST MAN (1964) and SIDNEY LUMET FAIL-SAFE (1964) - and it is surprising to learn that he was reluctant at the time to take the role of Lincoln, because in his opinion it was "like playing God"! <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that Ford had previously packed Abraham Lincoln (tangentially) into SHARK ISLAND Prison (1936), a great but perhaps notorious gem, which fortunately has just been released as a specialized DVD DVD from the real Standard of Criteria United Kingdom, label Eureka "Masters Of Cinema". In addition, I have two more Abraham Lincoln films in my collection of DVDs that I do not have yet to watch, and both were directed by DW Griffith - Nation's Birth (1915) and ABRAHAM LINCOLN (1930) - and I had not just gotten a bunch of films that I had before never seen, I would like to take them on the basis of my very satisfying watching experience with YOUNG MR. LINCOLN.
