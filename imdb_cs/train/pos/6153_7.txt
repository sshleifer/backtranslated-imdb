The obvious parallels between the enchanting fantasies of Walt Disney Bedknobs and Broomsticks and C. Lewis Chronicles of Narnia are quite obvious. There is more chance than to compare Bedknobs and Broomsticks than with Mary Poppins, although much of the same creative talent went into two Disney movies. Like the Chronicles of Narnia, it includes some English children leaving London during the blitz and comes to live in the country. And these kids have to deal with the world of magic. But unlike C. Lewis, Rawlins children have magic to attack their world and help defeat the people who accumulate in it. No retreat into the fantasy of the kingdom as the Pevensie children. <br /> <br /> No heavy philosophy here by Walt Disney, except that maybe it's not good to mess up with witches, even apprentices like Angela Lansbury who learn their charms like David Tomlinson. Mrs. Lansbury did not become one of the most profitable artists. He wore his own magic mark that even boys with special effects in Disney could not end up. And they won Oscar for the Magic Kingdom in this department for this film. Two artists have farewell to films in Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Tessie O'Shea played her last role in this film, but in the United Kingdom, she was one of the most popular artists in the music hall. And this actor, magnificent actor Reginald Owen as a general retirement, who leads an old home fence in war and in news, attracts film audiences around the world. Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman, who wrote a score for Mary Poppins, wrote good and useful. The Unbelievers Age was nominated for an Oscar, but lost the theme of The Shaft. Personally, though, I like David Tomlinson's homage to the most colorful London streets, Portabello Road. Bedknobs and Broomsticks are a fine fantasy film that still keeps well after nearly forty years. Imagine how it will be with computer-generated graphics.
