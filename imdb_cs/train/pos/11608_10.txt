It's a great movie. From reading other reviews, I can see that I'm not the only one who has lost tears. Tamilyn Tomita acted with such skill and conviction, made her ultimate cordial and unforgettable. In the hands of the younger actress, her last scene would look tough and furious. No one would ever think that this film was made on a tight, limited budget. Cinematography is wonderful and there are a number of great actors. The script is so wonderful that I see why everyone wanted to be in it. If you look at the long, long list of credits at the end, you will see that half of Hawaii has entered to make this film a good reason. The soundtrack (available on CD) is absolutely beautiful and adjusts the mood in the whole movie. My only complaint is that I almost did not want the movie to end.
