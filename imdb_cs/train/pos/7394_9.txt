This Chinese film made me feel so much alike with members of culture that I do not belong to and far from. In an almost Buddhist approach, the film helps people relate to each character and the happiness of doing simple routine things. All actors are brilliant and Xu Hzu radiates kindness and wisdom, but also vulnerable and medium. Er Min, a retarded brother, shows us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal, and that wisdom comes to the most bold people in this universe. Another China, it is far from Chinese realism, but it has a lot of humanity and realism of another kind. Get it. You will not be disappointed.
