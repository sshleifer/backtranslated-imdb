Back when the musicals were not showcases for choreographers, we had beautiful movies like this one. <br /> <br /> Being a big fan of both Wodehouse and Fred Astaire, I was delighted to finally see this movie. Not quite a mixture of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but close enough. Some of the American wondrous humor, the blues not funny doubt, are confronted with the British sense of humor Wodehouse. But in general, American style banter makes American characters look really more like cardboard cartoons. Some ingenious productions for dance figures, including a magnificent fairground with swinging floors and funhouse mirrors, more than to do with the lack of Busby Berkley over the top dance number. It seems to be much more realistic if you ever imagine that people start singing and dancing as realistic. The lack of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore does not hurt the film, instead allow different character dynamics to appear. It's also nice not to have a wry crackle, a terrible affectionate interest. Instead, we have a gentle interest in love, much more in line with the young aristocratic women Wodehouses.
