I love Occult Horror and the great British Hammer Studios that released one of the greatest films "The Devil Rides Out" (1968) proved to be more than capable in this area of ​​Horror. This occult episode of Hammer's short television series "Hammer House of Horror" (1980), "Guardian of Abyss", is a really scary entry into the series. Director Don Sharp, who previously enriched Hammer with "The Kiss of the Vampire" (1963) and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk" (1966) and the director of the two films "Fu Machu" with Christopher Lee, is undoubtedly one of the well- among the directors of HHH and also here. Michael (Ray Lonnen) dealer's antique store hits mysterious old glass glass. Hidden glass has become the object of the cult of worship of the devil who wants to use it for his Satan rites. While hiding a beautiful young girl named Allison (Rosalyn Landor) to be sacrificed with a cult, Michael gets into deep trouble with the cult and their sinister leader (John Carson) ... Although it is not one of my absolute favorite episodes, "Hammer House of Horror, "it's very scary and atmospheric. The plot has several interesting twists and remains exciting and weird throughout the film. Ray Lonnen is doing good leadership, young Rosalyin Landor is convincing as an innocent beauty and John Carson is really scary as the leader of Satanists. Overall, "Guardian of Abyss" is another interesting and scary story of HHH and my fellow Hammer fans should not miss.
