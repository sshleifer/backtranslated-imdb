I love this show! Every time I look at an episode, I repeat this line and remind myself how good it is to the show. I am a huge sci-fi fan and this show has reason to be the most important scientific (fictitious?) Show in film / television history. In this exhibition, there are many theories about the universe that I can start religion. His amazing season after the season is getting better and better. <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of MacGyver since I was 5 (19 years old) and it's ironic to me that my two favorite TV shows all time star Richard Dean Anderson. It's also interesting how each character is virtually the other. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the movie Stargate, I immediately liked it and considered it one of the most popular science fiction films. The TV show would be aroused by the fact that I was really excited but I did not get on the show until the fifth season is almost over. Although I was disappointed to hear that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted to do movie trilogy, the studio had chosen a series instead. <br /> <br /> He tells me that it worked out well. Maybe it's even better. This show is amazing and I hope we never die. Atlantis will come here!
