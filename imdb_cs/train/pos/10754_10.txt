I was a bit skeptical if I had to watch this when it was first shown on CBS. I was one of the many people who were in NYC the day I went to school at Hunter College. I did not want to see all the turmoil and bloodshed again, but like many, I was curious to see what it was all about. They heard tears as they watched this document. All my memories came back and only intense pictures were incredible. I bought the DVD for the anniversary and I watched it several times. How these guys were able to capture this record was incredible. If you have not seen this document, do a favor and look at it. It's obviously depressing and bringing tears to the eyes, but it's an incredible documentary about this darkest hour in this country.
