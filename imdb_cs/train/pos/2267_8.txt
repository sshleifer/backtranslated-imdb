I have not read a novel or anything else by Kurt Vonnegt, but now I want to start. This captures you from the first slide and does not allow the end of the loan to begin. You are enjoying places you do not expect, it is interesting. Stimulation is straightforward, it does not take too long and it does a perfect job of balancing unexpected shortcuts and allowing the viewer to process what we have seen. This is well understood and well thought out. I have never seen a movie that I feel like I can compare it with. It's intense and exciting, just as fun and sad. The actor is excellent, Nolte is shining, Goodman again proves he does not have to laugh, and Lee and Arkin are magical. I could go on, really ... no role is treated with less than stellar performance. Editing and cinematography are amazing and all the visuals are great, with a few unforgettable and amazing. I'm going to go to other films that director Keith Gordon, as well as two others apparently related to this, through the author of the books. There is one scene of sexuality and this is a very disturbing and disturbing content. I recommend it to anyone who can appreciate it; it is not pleasant. 8/10
