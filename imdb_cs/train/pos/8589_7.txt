I'll be honest, I finally checked this movie not because of the stars - although they were reasonably watchful and convincing, especially the three main - or even a convincing story of a violation of the presidential secret service (something you've been informed through DVD extras from this show has never happened . If that's true, it's remarkable!). I got it because it was controlled and no one other than Detective Meldrick Lewis has the choice! Well, well, Clark Johnson, one of my favorites from "Murder: Life on the Street" and a veteran (mostly) television director. I would say he does as well as possible with a project that is observable but totally average despite the possibilities. Veteran and Ace Secret Agent Pete Garrison (Michael Douglass) needs to know who is blackmailing him and killing his friend, focusing and throwing the Air Force One helicopter and going to Prez. (David Rasche, does anyone remember "Sledgehammer"?). His affair with the first lady (Kim Basinger, apparently one of the most important first ladies we have ever had, fictional or real) certainly does not help his position. They both have to make a real mole and avoid a dog like hunting for his former best friend and coworker and boss (Kiefer Sutherland, nearly as completely in the "24" mode). Throw in some of the other key service agents (Martin Donovan and Foxy, somewhat hard to buy as Eva Longorria's concert) and shadowy foreign characters, and you have a fairly standard political thriller that does not aim as high as to fake and achieve what you want enormous. <br /> <br /> The summary line is about how best to describe how this show is played without spoilers. In addition, the DVD seemed more striking and interesting than the movie, although the film itself was fun enough for most (including me) to be interested.
