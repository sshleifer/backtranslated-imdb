I was very happy to see this movie when it first came out in theaters, but I did not get it. So she finally hit the shelves and I picked it up. When I did not know exactly what to expect, I disposed of the dvd in the player, settled for evening murder and squeezed the game. What followed was one of the most engaging films I've seen in the last few years. Some spoils * This is the Wonderland murder story that led to the strongest parts of LA and directly to the greatest pornographic early 70s, John Holmes (Val Kilmer). <br /> <br /> I was addicted from the beginning and the feeling of the film kept me all the way to a very bloody end. I was surprised to find that the film is less focused on actual murders, and rather on events that occurred before and after the investigation. In addition to a few bones at the beginning and a real show of murders towards the end, the film was more or less attractive to show great dialogue and great acting. Val Kilmer sells me as a narcotics porn star and even "beautiful, but that's it" Bosworth was delighted to watch (and just because he looked, he thinks you) <br /> <br /> I personally felt the best aspect of the movie was , as I have already mentioned, the lack of direct display of murders. It was shown in a very dark atmosphere, so you could not see the brutal transformation given by the sleeping four. Besides, the sound effects of those murders were more than enough to suppress my appetite. Fired with lead pipes, nothing more is needed. <br /> <br /> My only problem was Carrie Fisher's short face. Her portrait of an overly religious figure was, in my opinion, a bit of a clich√© of her appearance. Perhaps the person was part of the story, maybe not, but I was not sold, and for some reason Fisher seemed a bit too "akward" in his portrait. Overall, it was a great movie It's worth it, though once! <br /> <br /> *** 8/10 ***
