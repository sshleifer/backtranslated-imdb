Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are amazing. I saw Kilmer at the Door, but his interpretation of John Holmes is excellent. Nothing compared to Boogie Nights, which was relatively slow. Wonderland is a movie that can show you a terrible crime story from the point of view of a man who is simply devoted to drug crime and not afraid of what ever happens. At the same time, the character of John Holmes shows a very clever cheater who can walk through the worst and worst situations almost undamaged. The film deserves to be watched more than once. The 1970s are sensual and full of drugs is amazing.
