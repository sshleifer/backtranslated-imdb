This movie has many strengths. He has one of the best horror casts outside the Lugosi-Karloff-Chaney circle: Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye, plus the lead man Melvyn Douglas. He has all the right ingredients: bats, a castle with a lot of stone staircases, a mad scientist, burghers waving torches and vampire lovers, type Igor, a beautiful girl, even a Goofyr Burgomeister. Soft-focus camera work is moody and imaginative. There is even some good comic relief nicely distributed throughout the screenplay. But it's not really a monster movie because there is nothing supernatural going on in "Kleinschloss" ("Little Castle"). This plot is revolving around a generic crazy scientist (played very well by Atwill), who values ​​his work far more than human lives. <br /> <br /> It's not top-quality material, some awkward dialogue for Dwight Frye. But it's worth seeing if you love early b / w horror images.
