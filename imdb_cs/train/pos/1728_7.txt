The wooden horse was one of the first "big" wandering stories from the Second World War, telling the true story of Eric Williams and others in their escape from Stalag-Luft III in October 1943. I enjoyed this film on VHS from Amazon in England and we take over from the PAL format in the US. I read a book when I was in college after seeing part of the film in the early sixties on television. The Taunt drama Peter and John trying to escape from Germany during the war is much more realistic than a piece of cliffs depicted in the Great Escape. This movie is a lost treasure that should be more accessible to the American audience.
