I really liked it. I'm firmly convinced that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are the comedic geniuses of our time. They have the obvious ability to add this level of absurdity to pop culture and make it a distracting but realistic way ... if it makes sense. That's what makes South Park so fun. Once you have surpassed the fact that it is probably the most craziest and ambiguous cartoon at all, you see in each episode a message that is being transmitted. This is evident in BASEketball. Although it is directed by David Zucker and is totally outraged, he has a sincere message about corporate America and the shame that is the main league sport. I'm also a fan of sports, so I find this movie cheerful at times because it's so true in the bizarre way people hate to love. Open prologue is great ... tears of laughter I always see how players start Riverdance! Some people do not like this movie because it's just not every cup of tea ... but like South Park, once you look around the absurdity ... it really has a true message that is transmitted by a literal comic genius. I gave 8 out of 10 stars.
