Shuffled in a windshield car, someone plays someone else's newest song, someone else did not respond, by voice-over. I'm just wondering how it came. There were too many scenes in this movie that I thought about how the camera appeared there. If the scenes are filmed where the Warhols played at BJM order, then it is the inexcusable exploitation to the maximum, if not, then it was the total production, making it inconvenient if it was the purpose? Throughout the movie, I wondered how this happened. Taken in nominal value, a nice portrait of the genius (tortured) genius that we all think.
