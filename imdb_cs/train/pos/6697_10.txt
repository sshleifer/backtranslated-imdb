I recall that I first watched Sabrina when she came to UK TV on ITV1 when I was 13/14. I am 24 now and still love her the same way I did when I first watched her. I get a little stick from some of my friends because I'm still watching the "baby show" but I do not care! lol Caroline Rhea as "Hilda" is my personal favorite character and later Morgan also became another of my favorite characters. I remember having spent so much time observing the various special events that Sabrina gave to Nickeleoden UK TV station. I like Mellisse Joan-Hart, she was great in "Clarrisse explains everything" but much better in it. I was gutted when they decided to finish! I hope it will soon be released on DVD in the UK - I will be the first in the line! lol x
