"Midnight Cowboy" was rated X with its original release in 1969. There are some scenes you can understand a little bit about. The movie about Joe Buck (Jon Voight) coming from Texas to New York to become a guest is sometimes a bit worrying. He dressed like a cowboy, trying to live as a guest, making money out of love. It does not work as planned. After the guy Rico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) first pulled a trick on him and stole some money, they became friends. They live in an empty and very dirty apartment. Then Ratso gets worse and Joe has to try to make some money. The movie was probably rated X as the main subject, but we see some strange things on the way. Edits in this movie are great. We see the dream sequences from Joe and Ratso interrupted by the real world in a nice and sometimes fun way. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and supporting actors give great performances. Especially Hoffman brings some great famous lines. John Barry will score and sound great. All this makes this great movie, which has won Oscar for the best picture for good reason.
