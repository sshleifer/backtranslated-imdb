D.W. Griffith could make a film that he wanted after the tremendous financial success of "Birth of the Nation"; he decided that by this date he would be the most technically ambitious film, "intolerance." He risked such innovations in film assemblage and form and resulted in a familiar wreck of financial trains. Buster Keaton do not take that risk with "Three Ages," a parody of "intolerance." This is his first feature film Keaton (he only acted in The Saphead). He had a rescue plan to divide three episodes in this film into three separate shorts that Griffith did with "intolerance." Keaton did not have to. Chaplin has already done with feature-length comedies, so if Keaton risked it, it was totally counted. Chaplin has already made the parody of another movie with "Burlesque on Carmen" (1915). Keaton seems to be talking about this movie as well. The wrestling scene in the episode of ancient Rome refers to a sword match that will change to match matches in Chaplin. The comic distance from the scene of the two scenes is the same. Additionally, Chaplin's film mimicked DeMille's "Carmen" shiny style, and Chaplin's movie seemed to be a homage to this film. In his parody, Keaton does not attempt radical editing, narrative structure, or monumental nature, but it seems to be a respect for "intolerance." At least, the stories are not as clear as in other Intolerance movies, such as Dreyer's "Letters from Satan's Book" (1921) and Fritz Lang's Destiny (Der MÃ¼de Tod, 1921). There is some slight jumping back and forth between episodes. Where Keaton took the risk, it is in his physical, daring comedy. This is Keaton inadvertently unable to jump across buildings in a modern episode. He was convinced he would change the scene before attempting to jump again. And it was not just Keaton who risked; An anachron baseball gag, for example, was relatively dangerous. So, otherwise, Keaton, like Griffith, risked a big movie. And I think they both succeeded.
