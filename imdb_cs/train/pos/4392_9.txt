I really liked it. Toby Maguire gives a great performance like Jake. He has to be one of the best actors I've ever seen. And I was surprised that there were so many humorous features throughout the movie. It was also very good, even though I had never seen him before. The film captures your characters and really asks you what's going to happen among all. I did not know what to expect from Jewel's performance, but I think she was doing well. Lots of exciting scenes. A good ride. I'm absolutely a Maguire fan. Check out the rules for apple juice. One of the Best Ever Times.
