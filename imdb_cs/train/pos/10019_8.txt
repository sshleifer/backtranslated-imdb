As for films, I can be pretty picky and I'm complaining about anything and everything that's going wrong. While each film has its own mistakes, The Night Listener had an extremely small number. If you read the last review (it was hard because half was written in caps and did not contain any up-to-date information about the movie), maybe you were convinced that this movie was not too well done. Unfortunately, if you've read more than 3 lines in the same review, you've found that the poster has scorn: he does not like the fact that the director is gay (or that the production team smokes crack ... apparently). <br /> <br /> So despite the fact that I've never reviewed the review before, I thought that this film deserves one on the basis of his merits, not the sexual orientation of his director. First we will find a quick checklist: 1. A large plot? Absolutely. I'm not going to divide it, but this plot is very convincing, and certainly not what could be expected from ads. This is a thriller, not a horror, and it should be like that. The story will really surprise you, even because it is true (and the conspiracy remained true to true events). <br /> <br /> 2. Wonderful acting? Yes Yes. Robin Williams has long since escaped from cast comedy strings and has since flourished in serious roles that many people would have written about ten years ago. He again reaches a high profile in his role in The Night Listener, playing a radio host who is increasingly concerned and involved in the case ... well, I'll let you in for yourself. <br /> <br /> 3. Excellent direction? Definitely. Now, unlike the second poster I've mentioned, she actually knows something about the direction. I've been in school for three years. Of course, I really do not think it makes licking the difference (the only thing that matters if you like the direction), but I thought I should reaffirm that I was basing my views here on something so important, relevant ... for example: not the director's sexual orientation (or the alleged drug habits of the production team, LOL). </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> Patrick Stettner's line was moody and dark and left angles and lighting to help create the so-called feelings of "tension and relaxation" rather than dirty, fast camera work and fast slices that we are so often exposed to today. Some people really can show you a story through their camera, while others feel like they should make a story with the camera. I very much appreciate the fact that someone has the courage to use the camera just the way it is to be used, which is the eye we all see. Lighting, cinematography and editing? Great all around. I have written so much and I could continue on these last three things for the next ten paragraphs, so I just pack it. In short, check out this movie. Do not listen to people who have other motives to dispose of them, especially if they are so stupid that they unconsciously reveal this motif of a 1/4 journey through their post. Enjoy a performance! -Ben
