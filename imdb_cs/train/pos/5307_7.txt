"Pecker" is a young, unknown photographer from Baltimore, who becomes a great star in the public, the media and the local art scene. His pictures show the dirty reality of all-day life as well as dirty linen or human excrement. It is a typical theme of independent comedies based on John Waters Baltimore that show the strange aspects of the American way of life between the fashion of political correctness and the conservative backlasas by examining the environment of the middle society in their hometown. <br /> <br /> Edward Furlong of "Terminator 2" plays Pecker, supported by Christina Ricchi, photographer Cindy Sherman, legend Patricia Hearst, and longtime actress Watero Mink Stole. Although it sometimes becomes a big flaw and is not able to compete with the rapid and furious funny attacks of brilliant "serial moms" on the water, there are still some good laughs and some unforgettable scenes as a former addict who became vegetarian smells of vegetable peas. "Pecker" is a great comedy about the arrogance of artistic scene, media hype, middle-class sexual fear and strange ways to become a pop star without realizing it. We recommend!
