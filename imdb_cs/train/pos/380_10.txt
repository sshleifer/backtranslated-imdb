Steven Spielberg, who has been away since his escape in the early 1980s, has been directed by Whoopi Goldberg in Alice Walker's adaptation "The Color Purple," about the desperate existence of an African-American woman in the 1930s. Watching Goldberg by Celie is incredible that she is the same woman who played in movies like the "Sister Act". This is a movie that could easily be - not, it would BE - part of the black curriculum and women's study curriculum. There is one scene that can be the most amazing editing task that ever appeared on the screen (you will know it when you see it). I can not believe that it has not been the only Oscar; this may be Spielberg's second best film behind the "Schindler List" (maybe even with him). Also played by Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard E. Pugh, Akosua Busia and Laurence Fishburne.
