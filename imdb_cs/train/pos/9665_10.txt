Bette Midler is indescribable at this concert. She gives her everything every time she's on stage. Whether we laugh at her jokes and anger or when we look at the fears of one of her huge ballads, Bette Midler moves her audience. If you can not see it live (which is the best way to see Bette) then it's the best thing to do. An interesting thing is how incredible her voice has changed and strengthened over the years but has never lost its power. Her more "voice-correct" version of "Stay With Me" never loses anything in the spirit of ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS. Here is purer and more heartfelt than ever. I will appreciate this concert for a very long time.
