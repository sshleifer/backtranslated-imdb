"The '70s Show" is definitely the most entertaining show currently on TV. I started watching her about two and a half years ago, and once I saw it, I can say it was a great show. I like all the characters, but my favorites are Fez and Kelso. Leo was also an amazing character when he was there, I really hope he will come back because he's cheerful. It's classic when Fez goes "the bitch!" And when Kelso yells "burn it!" It always makes me laugh. Both are great characters and always have a laugh. Jackie's hot is just another reason to watch the show; she started to look really good, but damn well, somewhere around the 5-6 season just got really hot. I've seen most episodes more than once, sometimes like ten times, and still cheerful. This is one of the few shows that I can watch again and again and still laugh like I did for the first time. Cast is classic; almost everyone is funny, with many shows there are only a few entertaining characters. It will be sad to see this concert at the end of next year, but it will be a fairy tale as one of the best concerts ever.
