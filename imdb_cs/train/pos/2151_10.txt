Funny. Sad. Charming. These are all the words that sang my head as I watched this beautiful and simple film. It's rare that the movie really moves me, but "Shall We Dance?" he managed to save it with grace. Fine humor, mixed with occasional soft agony, has simply made it one of the best experiences of my film watching history. He left me with a quiet sense of joy, but with a little sense of sadness. <br /> <br /> And dance, oh yes, dance. Even if you are not a lover of art, or you can not lay one foot before the other, the steps that are shown here will exhale you and you will be able to log in to the class as quickly as possible. It was totally charming, even those parts that show that Sugiyama (heavily portrayed by Koji Yakus) stepped up the steps when he first learned to dance was a beautiful funny, childlike way. Still, this film was not about dancing but about the subtlety of human behavior and feelings. We are witnesses of a shy person who learns to express their suppressed feelings through dance, a beautiful dance instructor who re-discovers her love for art and the personal growth of each member of a wonderful supportive cast. Beauty. Pain. Emotion. All love and little agony of life are here, expressed by the subtle feeling of fine Japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional power and grace of culture. <br /> <br />
