If you like animated movies, this movie will please. My wife likes animals and animal movies, especially as a parrot in this movie. It's focused on kids, but I laughed most of the humor. The French fashion character laughed and added balance to the script. This is a Disney movie with his sappy, happy, family apeal, but he likes to leave the theater with a positive fealing.
