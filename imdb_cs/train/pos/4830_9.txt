Despite some reviews that are clearly Luke-warm, I have come across a stunning story, and although some critics describe a love story like Mills and Boon, what? It is good to see a warm, moving story of true love in these cynical times. Many of the audience were waiting and secretly tapping their eyes. You really believe that young Victoria and Albert passionately love each other, even if for political reasons it was an agreed marriage. I felt Sir John Conroy, who desperately dominated the young queen, may have played too much like a pantomime villain. As it is said, in fact, she is the real father of Victoria (due to her relationship with the Duchess of Kent's mother), it would be interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is absolutely convincing as a young princess trapped in a suffocating palace with courtiers and politicians to manipulate her. She brilliantly portrays the strength of character and dedication that eventually made Victoria the great Queen of England, who had flourished under her long government as never before. I believe mouth-to-mouth recommendations will be a great success for this most enjoyable and beautiful-looking movie.
