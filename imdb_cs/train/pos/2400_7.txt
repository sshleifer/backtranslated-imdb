I see what my ancestors saw in young Bette Davis. She is great in this almost crazy political comedy, which in fact plays Warren Williams as a political operator who is always on the edge of nutrition. Vivienne Osborne is great as its former, and I found her. Williams' character is not at all sympathetic and not even decent. Guy Kibbee is one of the best in what he does. As a candidate, he pulled out of his sleep on a political convention and was nominated as a governor to prevent the nominee being nominated, so that all this mess is linked to the political war within the Party called the Progressive Party. If you have a political mind, you will probably see a party other than the one you are associated with, reflected in the fictitious "Progressive Side" of Williams and Kibbe. I could draw exact parallels, but we are not here for that. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie for those of us who love those old comedies. If you've ever watched any of the old Wheeler & Woolsey titles, you find Frank McHugh, like Williams's right hand, look and behave a lot like Bert Wheeler. I deceived myself. <br /> <br /> Yes, both my wife and I recommend this.
