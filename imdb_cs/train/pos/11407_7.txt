updated on January 1, 2006 Parsifal is one of my favorites favorite Wagner's operas or musical dramas to be more accurate (Meistersinger is second.), although it's hard to imagine it as "the top of every pop." Libretto, as is customary, is the piety of religion, paganism, eroticism, and perhaps even homo-eroticism, and its length may seem to make the audience hear the dry colors. <br /> <br /> Wagner, who is a famous anti-Semite (Klingsor may be one of his spare Jewish villains.) naturally entrusted the unconverted premiere (not because RW is trying!) Hermann Levi, who was his favorite conductor! (Go to the picture!) Kundry, the most confused gal and other likely Jewish substitute, is vile or good-natured depending on the scene. Since many videos of the Parsifal versions seem like a barn On the other hand, this film of the opera is compared to the breath of fresh air. Hans-Jürgen Syberberg, the director, brought him a lot of imagination, but it's hard to know why he did some of his choices. For example: notorious dual Parsifals (of every sex!), Puppets, Death Mask-Wagner's set and various dolls and symbols such as the Nazi swastika in one of the traveling scenes. (If I remember, "real" Engelbert Humperdinck wrote real music to skip scene changes.) Although Wagner himself died too early to be a true Nazi, many of his offspring (just like his second wife Cosima.) Were at least partners, including their Wolfgang Wagner's grandson, who still leads Bayreuth at an advanced age. In fact, Wolfgang's son, Gottfried Wagner, in total opposition to his father, tried to make a frank agreement with his grandfather. Syberberg also seems politically incongruous from what I read. In 1977 he made a hit film about Hitler: "Hitler: ein Film aus Deutschland" (sometimes called "our Hitler" in English). Because it lasted for 8 hours and was not widely distributed, most people do not see it (including myself.). <br /> <br /> Armin Jordan, conductor of the audio CD on which this film is based, plays Amfortas (sung by Wolfgang Schön) Edith Clever (Yvonne Minton) plays Kundry, Michael Kutter and Karin Krick play dual Parsifals (both sing Reiner Goldberg !!) and Robert Lloyd and Aage Haugland play and sing Gurnemanz and Klingsor. <br /> <br /> Although the operas have been going on for a long time and all (except Kundry?) have been described as significantly aging between Acts 2 and 3, no one looks older than the opera. (The Grail's Magic? In this opera is the Gral Cup from which Jesus drank in the Last Supper and not Mary Magdalen as recently, a thought I consider to be absurd!) <br /> <br /> Conducting and singing are quite decent and DVD seems to have improved the sound, if not the picture, to a large extent. (Yes, I agree that "Kna" is better, even on the second, stereo version, but it is probably superior to all the recorded versions.) <br /> <br /> It's not Parsifal for all Wagnerites but I think, that it works quite well as a filmed opera.
