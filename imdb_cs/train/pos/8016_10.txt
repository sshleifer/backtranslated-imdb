Do not think of these films as another child's film - the whole family can look forward to. It's a weird mix of film, because it seems to have a movie, but at least it makes sense at the end (unlike modern movies!) It gives you all the elements of the film (decent plot, good characters - that is the star Muppets, which is a list The most striking is the fact that it can be a mountain track of emotions, some sad, a little hearty, some funny and serious - that's all it makes for a nice family film that everyone can watch Celebrity in the movie are really the top stars of the day, but there's only one star of the movie and no one dares to exhaust Miss Piggy !!!!
