* * - SPOILERS - !! * <br /> <br /> Before I start, let me say that I had both the benefits of seeing this movie on the big screen and seeing the "Authorized versions" of this film transformed by Stephen King himself in 1997. Both benefits have allowed me to appreciate this version of "The Shining", even more. <br /> <br /> Also, let me read Mr. King's book "The Shining" on many occasions over the years and while I love the book and I'm a huge fan of his work, Stanley Kubrick's story about this story is far more convincing. .. and SCARY. <br /> <br /> Kubrick really knows how to convey the horror of the psyche directly to the movie. In the direction of film And the writing of the script itself won the title "Magus" out of the question. Genius Kubrick is like magic. The film world lost a great director when he died in 1999. Among his other outstanding credits include: Eyes Wide Shut, 1999; Full metal jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; A Clockwork Orange, 1971; 2001: Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and many others. Torrences (Jack, Wendy's wife and Danny, their son) live in the Overlook Hotel for the Winter; Jack was hired as an administrator. Its job is to supervise the hotel's maintenance in a few months of heavy snow until the spring when the show opens its doors again. It seems there are many rich and crazy tourists who are gathering in the Colorado Mountains on a snowy vacation. <br /> <br /> The hotel was an impressive architecture and production. She borrowed the atmosphere by having a dark, yet "welcoming" atmosphere. Furniture and furnishings were all seasons (late 1970s - early 80s), and the filmography of the country approaching the hotel in the opening scene is excellent. It not only allows you to enjoy access to the overview, but also solves in your mind how is a deserted and isolated hotel from the rest of the world. The introduction of Wendy and Danny's character was a brilliant stroke. You get the whole story of their past, Danny's "imaginary friend," Tony, and the story of Jack's alcoholism has all gone to this nice, neat start-up scene. There is no need for the past past to be split from more than two hours of film; Kubrick obviously saw it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The day of the end. Again, a scenic mountain trip to the hotel (this time with the family in a stroke), the interaction between Jack and Danny was cheerful and at the same time radiating a very worrying exchange. <br /> <br /> The opening tour of the overlook is quite breathtaking, although "staff" is moving out, you have the chance to see the majestic fireplace, the high ceilings of the cathedral and the expensive furnishings, dormant and crown molding in architecture. "They did a good job, pink and gold are my favorite colors." (Wendy Torrence) Even the "staff wing" is well designed and beautifully built. <br /> <br /> The maze was a magnificent touch, reminiscent of a labyrinth in which the Minotaur was in Creteian Guardian. When Jack Nicholson stands on a labyrinth scale and looks to the middle when he sees Wendy and Danny, it's a magical moment; the one who tells you right now is in the house of heavy energy; there is something seriously wrong, it is already beginning. "I did not want to go there until I had an hour to find a way out." (The Hotel Manager) <br /> <br /> Scatman Cruthers, like Dick Halloran, was original and open in his performance. His smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful. You could really believe that you were there in the hotel, going after a walk in the kitchen with Wendy and Doc. His explanation of Danny's "lighting" was very good, just like his interview with the child about Tony and the hotel. It was believable and sincere. Cutting and reigning the hotel itself, the mountains that stretch behind, the cold air swirling around, the mist emerging from the warm roof of the snowy hotel, adds to the atmosphere of the film. It also means that he speaks like this; the turning point in the movie. <br /> <br /> Shelley Duvall's portrait of Wendy Torrence was a masterpiece. (So, what if Olive Oyl ?, it just shows its amazing variety!) Frankly speaking, before I saw the big screen movie in 1980, I said, "What? Olive Oyl? * Lol * (Popeye was also released in 1980.) But I took it back as soon as the movie started is brilliant. In this Fiend's view it's her best performance, to this day (though I loved her in Steve Martin's "Roxanne," 1987) br /> Once Kubrick founded the pearl bits of information you must have, the viewer, Torren's past, Danny's broken arms, Tony, the history of the hotel itself, the fact that Danny is not a "mental" but rather a clairvoyant and general arrangement of the hotel, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < which Danny d He was scary and scary, and showed Danny how and where he was killed, quite graphically and materially. Kubrick's Tony was written as a spiritual spirit, as a spiritual guide, obtained as a result of his arm being almost shaken by his own father's body. He was ... "the little boy who lives in my mouth." He would eventually show Danny's finger and physically talk through Danny to talk to Danny. No, as in the book, I realize where Tony intended Stephen King to be Danny's project as an older boy and trying to save his father. Kubrick missed the little break and somewhat more terrifying when Tony "took ... Danny ... behind." The idea of ​​Danny's older self-expression back to her younger self is not ... terrifying. The "Woman in the Shower" scene, written by Lia Beldan (who I do not find another credit for doing something before or since), as a younger woman and Billie Gibson (who also suffers from a lack of credit for works before or off) and thoroughly disgusting. It was dramatic and frightening. Grumpy and terrifying. When Nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing body under her hands; the appearance of mere terror on his face was so complete and real. Jack quickly embarked on his trek from the "jones" of the alcoholic to the well-trained mentally ill person. The degradation of the mental state of his character is carefully and thoroughly documented by Kubrick. Jack's immediate friendship with Lloyd Bartender (as the only alcoholics, possibly mental patients and drug addicts) portrays his urgent need for the atmosphere Lloyd will use; namely alcohol ... "The dog hair that bites me." (Jack Torrence) Jack's case is a bourbon on the rocks without Jack. "Orders from the house." (Lloyd the Barmen) A nice word game. When Wendy finds out, Jack's "screenplay" is nothing more than a page on the same page that is written over and over, even in 8 or 9 different creative styles. ... when he asks from the shadows, "How do you like it?" and Wendy swirls and screams with a baseball bat in her hand ... she's so harsh. It's a place where you realize how bad it is. It is very scary, dramatic and provides a strong presence. This, along with Danny's vision at the hotel lobby filled with blood, set between the Jack and Wendy scene and the confrontational end of the scene, may perhaps be the most powerful scene in the movie. <br /> <br /> Scene "REDRUM". Wow. What I say? What mother would not be completely horrified by her awakening to find her young, rogue son standing over them with a huge knife and talking in a very small voice and repeatedly shouting "REDRUM"? Even if it did not make sense, it would be as frightening as the 7th level of HELL. It was something that everyone could (remember) (ed). When we talk about unforgettable scenes ... Nicholson's ultimate attack on his family with his ax was perhaps one of the most awesome scenes in film history. His ad-libbed line, "Heeeeere is Johnny!" was a stroke of gloss and one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror. It also goes into the history of horror. <br /> <br /> End ...? Kubrick's end was perfection. I felt that it ended beautifully. No smirk, no phrasing, no tearful idiotic end for this film. Only embodied perfection. That's all I'm going to say about the end. Who is interested in what was taken? See what Kubrick put in. Rent it, watch it, BUY IT. It's a classic in a horror genre and for good reason. That it is me * ... Take this movie and sit it in the Stephen King collection and take the version of the "Authorized" child section. There it belongs. This film captures 9.98 z.
