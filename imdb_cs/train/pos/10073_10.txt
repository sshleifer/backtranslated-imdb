One of the great things about many wonderful Chinese movies can be found in video stores, if you are lucky, they are very accurate depictions of real, true stories. Farewell, my concubine, emperor and murderer and this movie are perfect examples. Movie makers take a real story and work hard to create a movie without endangering reality for dramatic or commercial convenience - the Hollywood brand and, above all, Disney movies. In this story we follow the later years of the famous local street artist called the king of talc for his mastery of Sichuan Change Art. Together with the loss of his only son many years ago, he sought to find a male heir who could perform his rare and dying art in a society that forbids women to do such work. Master Wang is sold by his son a slave trader. Everything is good as he is glad to prepare for his art to pass. But the son eventually becomes a girl. From there, the story became very interesting, with a good introduction of Master Liang from Sichuan Opera - a regional opera style related to the Beijing opera. Fans of my farewell My end should look closely at Mr. Lian's performance of a man playing a female role in Chinese opera. It can help them understand that the players of these female roles are probably not homosexuals or castratists, but people who are so psychologically conditioned that they are totally unaware of their own sexuality.
