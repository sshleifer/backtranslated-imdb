I really like what I have seen from this cartoon. Sure, animation is not the best, but honestly, I'd rather see this type of more cartoon style quickly and cheaply than the old type of style that was done quickly and cheaply (which has become more and more often - it's just a style that looks good when it's a lot of time and effort has been put into it). It's nothing wrong with square lines and small black dots - in fact, I think it's really cute. As a child, I never thought the Scooby-Doo design was particularly adorable, but I think I'd like to know better. Shaggy has always been my favorite character and believed it or not, but I have the greatest potential for a certain depth. Sure, the show does not focus on the original theme of "Mystery-solving", but it was just a tired old formula anyway. Do not get me wrong - I'm sure there are writers who would be able to bring much more interest to the traditional efforts of Mystery Inc. (which was missing late), but at that time the show is a fun standard deviation. Shaggy and Scooby are still fun, but they're not just comic reliefs. They are still cowardly, but eventually have the opportunity to use what seems to be (shock!) Intelligence. They are the same old all who go after a meal like never before, but now it seems that with their inheritance, Uncle Albert begins to look at their lives. In the past, I found most of the original jokes of Scooby-Doo to be pure cheese and unintentionally cheerful at best, but this show really does exercise the capacity for real humor. Likewise, I never like Casey Kasem like Shaggy, so the new actor does not make me angry just like other people. (I still think Billy West was the best) <br /> <br /> Overall, although it was not a great cartoon in the history of cartoons, it's still a success among other Scooby incarnations.
