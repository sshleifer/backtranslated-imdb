The most important thing about this film is Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor, as well as Christy Brown, a Guinean artist and fighter who overcame all the possibilities despite his physical fitness. As a person working with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance was shocking convincing. The enormous support received by Christy from his family, low-income working class workers, encouraged him to make impossible, and this image related to this support, but the book did not know, but the dialogues were written wisely to capture Christy Brown's witty, arrogant personality. I recommend this film to everyone, especially the classic lovers of the film.
