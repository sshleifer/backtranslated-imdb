This story, located in Wellington, in the suburbs of New Zealand (Tawa - the home of Tawa College), is the first feature of McCarten. The current New Zealand flavor Via Satellite is in a very cheerful, mature, family context. At the same time, he can evoke intense emotions of sadness and despair. One of the most fun and humorous films of the year - you should not miss it!
