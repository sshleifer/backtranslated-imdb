I recorded this movie late at night on the cable and I was pleasantly surprised. I can only imagine the reason why this film was not better known because the topic is very worrying. But if you can deal with the topic of sexual abuse, it is a very effective, exciting and very interesting film. Richard Gere and Claire Daines are very good at it. And although the subject is not for the weak heart, the film does not go out of the way to be brutal (for example 8mm). I highly recommend anyone who likes serial killer movies and type tensions.
