I watched movies in my area on yahoo and saw a movie that was not advertised. I looked closer and noticed that there were Peter Falk and Paul Reiser. When I once watched "Mad About You," I was not a fan of Paul Reiser. But I'm a big fan of Peter Falk. So we had a chance with our husband. We both got into this story. Beautiful scenery, cordial behavior, and a sense of family and moral values ​​that are rare in today's movies and today's world. Not that it was just a stomach, but a real life situation from real people like humans. I even have to say that Paul Reiser was excellent, though, I still do not look at "Mad About You". I do not know where this movie left. I heard it was released in limited relaxation. It should be shared with the world. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. M.
