Seasonal finals sent mixed news, feelings of joy and feelings of lies and deceit. Roseanne tells all her audience that the whole season was a lie because her husband, Dan, died. She also admits that the family has never won a lottery and what season 9 was a lie just as she wanted or wanted to be. I'm still confused when she said Becky ended up with David and Darlene and Mark, because Becky and Mark admit they're pregnant. So I believe it's the way it wanted, but it was not. So the seasonal finale was good, but it sent mixed feelings. I will always be a show fan. :)
