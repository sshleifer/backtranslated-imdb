This movie is one of the most provocative films of Jesus I've ever seen. He does not try to tell the whole story, but only to interpret the interpretation of the last day of Jesus Christ. He is darkly funny, playful and faithful to the elements of Jewish tradition and modern biblical interpretation. Judas is much more common than other images, not the dark and sinister evil we sometimes imagine, but the grossly wrong person, terribly misguided in his zeal. Jesus Chris Saranden is playful and serious, faithful and determined - very human and divine. The final dialogue is thoughtfully executed and serves as a kind of little conversation that can be made by two powerful men when they have just committed atrocities. I would like to watch this film again and recommend it to others.
