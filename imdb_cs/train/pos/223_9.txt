in one of the best games by Neil Simon. The gruesome, skinny ex-Vaudeville stars starring Walter Matthau and George Burns are joining special television comedies. The problem is that they have been SEEN for more than a decade. Full of teeth, one flake and inside showbiz jokes, this story flies along with the constant flow of humor. Good work also includes Richard Benjamin as a harried nephew, Rosetta LeNoire as a nurse, and Howard Hesseman as the commercial director of a television station. Steve Allen and Phyllis Diller look like themselves. Interesting: The opening set includes 1929 Hollywood Revue footage by Marie Dressler, Bessie Love, Polly Moran, Cliff Edwards, Charles King, Gus Edwards and singer Brox Sisters.
