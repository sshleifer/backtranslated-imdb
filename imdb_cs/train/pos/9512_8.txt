This is a movie that may want to see you again. I especially liked how it ended. I did not see the end, but when the laws were not blown for the first time, she suspected that they would come back again. The story has taken on and could have been more psychological, but I understand the story needed to capture the viewer and the action was necessary. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that Michael Jr. he can be so motionless when his younger brother and mother are dragged away. But I can realize that the scene of the game could not really take our attention there because it had a bigger story to tell. Some have complained about Hanks as a gangster. I think this is not justified. If his character was somewhat heavier, he would not care if his son pulled the trigger or not. <br /> <br /> Eight stars for this. Although it was released in 2002, I saw it for the first time yesterday on DVD.
