Predkódový stunned with Stanwyck, who plays the crazy girl who sleeps to the top. These pre-code movements really let it all go with what's left in fantasy. Stanwyck is excellent as Lilly, the daughter of the owner / father of speakeasy, who sold more than the booze to his patrons (johns). After the old man dies (well!) Barb goes to a big city for better things. She uses her female attributes to sleep her way to the top. John Wayne makes a poor "cameo" and proves that actors act better with age and coach. I loved prank and strong lines among the actors. I highly recommend this movie to all film enthusiasts and watch Stanwyck, who is great and beautiful as Lilly.
