Now I've always been a fan of Full Moon puppet work. But I have to say Robot Jox is one of the better projects. Yes, you heard me. The story works amazingly, the atmosphere really works and the actors do their first job. Gary Graham, who really performs on television at shows such as the Alien Nation Series and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE, shows that he can be an action star who kicks his ass and takes the name. The effects of stop motion could be a bit better. The color was bad, they looked plastic to me instead of the metal they were supposed to be. But that's a smaller complaint compared to the whole thing that's Robot Jox, if you like Gary Graham or other Full Moon movies then you'll enjoy this movie. 9 stars outside 10.
