I know, I know: it's childish. But I like this type of movie. A bird that has suffered many "misfortunes" and still has not lost its faith in humankind and its sense of humor. The peculiarity of this film is the fact that the main character is Paulie - a parrot - and is not used to support any human actor. I also like the story: Paulie says his lifestyle is clean in the place where he hit the bottom. (By the way, Jay Mohr's voice sounds almost like Joe Pesci!). And Cheech Marin, of course, that man is humor to me. Since I've seen "Up in Smoke," I appreciated his naive way of doing it, making a simple situation cheerful ... I can not help.
