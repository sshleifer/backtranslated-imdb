Who would have thought such a dark little movie could be so scary and touching? I am really amazed. It's a shame that people have not seen him yet. I loved, as always, Hans Zimmer's score. And what directorial debut Bernard Rose! I wonder if I should call it a horror movie. It could simply be said that it is also fantasy or drama. Well, no matter how I love the interpretation potential she has. Everything and everyone in the dreams of Anne (played by Charlotte Burke) represents a real conflict in her life ... the house itself, the tree, Mark, the beacon, etc. There are many details like those that make the movie so good for repeated viewing. I hope to come across another small film that is full of emotions and psychological significance.
