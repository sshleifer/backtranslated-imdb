Ok I'll be honest when I first saw a trailer on the program, I thought it was an advertisement for some sunscreen product. With all the people who walk to the beach. Despite that, I decided to watch it, I thought it would be a new show I could laugh at. But I was really impressed. From the first 10 seconds of the program, I was addicted to why she lay in the trees, why she crashed, etc. Atd. <br /> <br /> It is not everyday that a show that combines intelligence, humor, action, and tension appears. But the "lost" all manages it. With great occupancy and crew, beautiful places and fairly decent special effects, the lost "captures everyone who engages in it and must be seen for anyone who is sick of cheese sitcoms and dirty reality TV. <br /> <br / > Lost on Tuesday 10th on Channel 4 (UK) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 = O
