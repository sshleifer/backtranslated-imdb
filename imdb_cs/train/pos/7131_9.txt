The movie made for television is a great movie. This is probably the best and most popular role of BAFTA winning John Thaw (Kavanagh QC and Morse Inspector). Tom Oakley (Thaw), a widowed man, lived in the village himself for a while since his wife and son died, and was now disembarked with an evacuee called Willaim Beech (Nick Robinson). When he becomes acquainted with this child, he begins to develop friendship. Until Willam's mum (Annabelle Apsion) tells him. After Tom worries that William will not touch, he will go to London to find him. Eventually Willaim gets his home with a loving family (or daddy). During World War II, it's a great movie. He was nominated for the BAFTA Lew Grade Award and won the National Television Award for the most popular drama. John Thaw was number three on the 50 largest star televisions. Very good!
