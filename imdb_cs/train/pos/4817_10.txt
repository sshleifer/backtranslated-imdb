Young Victoria is a beautiful film and she has introduced Queen Victoria in a different light that everyone thinks about her. The film wipes "the impression of being incredible Queen Victoria" and shows she is a cheerful young woman. Because I love history, especially Victorian history, you can imagine your reaction when I first saw it propagated, I was so excited and counting the days until it came to the cinemas. I was a little worried that it would not be historically accurate, but it was and I loved it. I discovered new facts about Queen Victoria, who she did not know before, and I was very interested. The Queen of Victoria, in many light, was one of our highest monarchs, and this film is painted by a true personality and her life. She was treated so badly by her maternal adviser Sir John Conroy because she wanted Britain to have a regent. That was what inspired Victoria to be a fantastic queen who was! The romance between her and Albert was so deep, and it was very well done by Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend who were both brilliant! Young Victoria is the heart to feel a love story, but also a great look into much of British history ... I love it !!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... no doubt!
