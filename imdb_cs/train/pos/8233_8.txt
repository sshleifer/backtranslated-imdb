Fido is the story of much better zombies who were trained to serve the human race. But they all collapse when young Timmy Zombie Fido rides his neighbor. Since then there has been a disaster (well, perhaps not a disaster, but to a certain extent also chaos). Most people treat their zombies fairly and one such character sleeps with their zombies (a very entertaining part of the film, if not very worrying). And we find a loving Fido what he can do. This is a very fun and unique movie, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the least violent zombie films (no negativity in this statement). I highly recommend it to people who are looking for something fun and something else. I rate it 8/10. R rated for zombie-related violence
