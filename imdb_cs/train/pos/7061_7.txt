Of course, the original is better, but it's not as bad as everyone says! Yes, it's made up of 3 stories, but hey, so what ?! I thought it was good to be honest. I loved how Anastasia changed a bit when she fell in love, showing what love could do. Stories were not so bad. <br /> <br /> I liked Cinderella better in this too. In the original I have nothing against her voice, but I just think it sounds better, nicer. I also liked her personalities, she had more of a spine, yet she was still kind. So I'll give Cinderella II: Dreams Come True 7/10.
