Such a black company was before the outbreak of the epidemic, gangsta rap and AIDS that affected the ghetto in the 1980s. Dignified, heavily working families that they tried to get, and all the traumas and tribulations they faced. Black America was a different group of people in the 1970s. Still full of hope and flying at the civil rights movement in the 1960s, the time was hard, but it is still worth fighting. Keep your head above the water and show the wave when you can. This demonstration showed how the Black Society tried to cooperate as people and families before they started prey to each other and everyone else to survive the horrors of the ghetto. It is the heart of breaking to see what black ghettos are and how they are now.
