I thought it was a very good movie. It was nice that we saw a little more in the movie about two sisters who knew each of them liked the same boy before he was killed. I'm sure that if the film was shot in this way, it would be a very different ending, so this movement became such a good film. It turns out that no matter what happens in your life with your siblings, you can always get over it and that if there are two sisters that deal with a boy (the same boy) that work through pain and hurt makes things look better and to work more easily between the two. It's nice to see love stories that have something terrible in someone's life, which can only happen after it's over. I really enjoyed watching this movie and it still happens when it comes. It seems to me that I look at it every time it comes. It would be nice to have Part 2 for this movie, perhaps she should have an older sister who would come and leave her child, it really would mean that the story has since died, so it would keep it even if it is dead.
