I have to admit that I was one of the skeptics who had prematurely judged this show for relatively some information about her. I decided it would be a cheap spin-off run by Ronald D. Moore, who has a retin-wand. <br /> <br /> I was wrong! <br /> <br /> The pilot leaves an excellent impression on the audience. Accessibility is amazing! Of course, experienced BSG veterans find themselves in a submarine that focuses on the development of the Cylons before the First War. (58 years before the events of the BSG Pilot Project). The pilot also allows newcomers to present their ideas and ideas in the first part of the episode. <br /> <br /> Do not think "Caprica" ​​is not BSG. We are presented with a submerged brain dram, affected by provocative, courageous and controversial thoughts. <br /> <br /> Casting keeps BSG standards; Stoltz and Morales are simply stunning. Morales's portrait of Joseph Adama, inspired by William's portrait of Olmos, gives a gorgeous view of hero's father William. Stoltz's interpretation of dr. Graystone raises a lot of thoughts and questions. If the quality of the pilots is some indication of what's coming, RDM and the creative team team will continue their BSG TV programming link with another master-created television piece.
