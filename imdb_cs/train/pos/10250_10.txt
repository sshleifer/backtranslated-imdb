Guinea Pig: Devil's experiment is undoubtedly a ***** star at first glance, it's a raw realistic scary and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature. This movie gets to the point you can think of what point? The goal is to satisfy fans of extreme violence and gore. This film has some gore, more or less just an agonizing woman with violence. There are really only 3 scenes that could be considered gore. I'll tell you one thing, even though Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment is Hostile as Sesame Street. If you thought the Hostile was a crazy brutal distracting torture film, then you did not see half of what you saw Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment. Gore 0-10 Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment (Uncut) ***** (7)
