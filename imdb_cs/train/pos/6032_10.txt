Antonioni actually showed some "cojones" when he made this film. He went to America to work on the basis of a contract of the most complete study (MGM) and made the most beautiful portrait of the American society I've ever seen. When he first saw LA, it is the most accurate representation of a crowded, overheated and impersonal city. If Antonioni met with Bill Hicks ... The subsequent funeral in the studio is understandable after such a huge investment and a profound return. Sadly, people do not see this movie anymore, because I think Antonioni has proved right. Here he predicts the end of the hippie / civil rights movement in America's politics. Everyone is much more interested in what's coming into his pockets and the ever-expanding living space into the inhospitable (yet beautiful) desert and beyond. How I'd like to see the interest in this movie re-lit and rich DVD release. I ask people to watch Zabriskie Point with an open mind and an open heart. We have a truly unique film that commented on the turning point in the history of the most powerful nation on our planet, and we have forgotten it. An unexpected gem.
