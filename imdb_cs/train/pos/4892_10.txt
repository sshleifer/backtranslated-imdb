It was an amazingly clever and fun movie that I would never bother watching many, many times. Casting was magnificent when compared to youngsters with older characters. There are those who really appreciate the good actors and the intelligent story. As for Judi Dench, she is beautiful and a gift for any production she's playing. I've always realized I can see Judi Dench in all her performances. She is an outstanding actress and a joy to see how every change of her character comes to life. I can only be grateful to see such an excellent picture for most of the films that were recently lacking good characters, good scripts and good acting. A film of the public needs heroes, not deviant mannequins, who lack ingenuity and talent. How beautiful to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I want this movie to be awarded the awards it deserves. Thank you again for great entertainment. I congratulate the writer, the director, the producer and all who have done such a great job.
