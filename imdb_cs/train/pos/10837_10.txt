Like an aging rocker, this film mentions Heep and Quo - my two favorite bands at all - but with incredible casts (all) - and a fantastic story - I just like this creative genius. I can not recommend more - and Mick Jones has added so much (Alien Leader and Principal Composer along with the greatest rock singer at all - Lou Gramm) - I watched this great work more than ten times - Bill Nighy - What a Voice - and Jimmy Nail - exhausted - then Astrid ... and Karen ..... what else could try the older rocker! 10/10 - bloody brilliant.
