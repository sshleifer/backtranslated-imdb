Wow, this movie was absolutely great. I really do not know why everybody says he has a slow pace. I thought the pace was perfect. The film is that Michael Sullivan plays Tom Hanks with perfection, which is a kind of hit / assassin for John Rooney (Paul Newman). He does not like this work, but it does because Rooney pays for his house and financially helps him. He had nothing, and Mr. Rooney gave him everything. But his children do not realize it's his job, and when he's a witness to murder, he's in a clumsy position. And when atrocities occur, he leaves with his son and is determined to take revenge. They take away slaves and much more, and they make a bond. They are a perfect team. Hanks does a great job as always, just like Jude Law, playing his spooky role to perfection. This track is highly recommended because it shows a beautiful story and shows how the 1930s were.
