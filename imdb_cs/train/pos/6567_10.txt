Most people (36) have given this movie 10, and those who do not have it are too critical or perhaps expect something else. This is one of my most popular 80s films, growing up for you and having it all. I just got it on DVD and 20 years later it still does not disappoint, it has a lot of action, drama, romance and even comedy. Add great car chases, automatic shotguns and lots of things to blow out and have fun, the edge of the seat experience! You'll even be buzzing or whistling the main theme of the song a few days after you see it. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie with your wife / gf and both enjoy it. A prerequisite is a book of hero, like Doc. Savage, actually existing and helping people fight evil to write a story, is almost alive. Actor Jake Speed ​​is also director, producer and author of many movies. In this movie, Jake Speed ​​is type of adventurer Indiana Jones, usually using his head to get out of sticky situations, but sometimes he will resort to brutal strength (yay !, and utter stupidity of luck too!). Watch out for his one "James Bond" hi-tech gear, the ultimate SUV road warrior looks out of the sky. The heroine is a very beautiful young love interest from the early Jim Carey vampire movie "Once Bitten" and here she is a bit older and still discarded even compared to her teenage blonde little sister. Thieves are "really bad" men, and they are the worst low-threshold villains to love hatred. The end is simply perfect and can stand alone or invite the sequel, sadly never done - but you can only imagine what will happen next! <br /> <br /> You have to see this movie just because it will entertain you and entertain you and it is worth the ticket.
