The popular radio story Gabriel Nikdo (Robin Williams, scraggy and speaking in silent, hypnotic tones) will meet and friends with a fourteen-year-old boy from Wisconsin named Pete Logand (Rory Culkin) who wrote a book detailing his sexual abuse of his parents. The tip has the pinnacle of AIDS, and Gabriel still made it because his partner Jess (Bobby Cannavale, good) happens to have survived HIV. <br /> <br /> He also gets to know Pete's caregiver, called Donna (Toni Collette, brilliant!) and when Gabriel decides he wants to meet two people and act in Wisconsin, he discovers some secrets that were not (naturally) ready to find. Based on the real events that became Armistep Maupin (who wrote the script with Terry Anderson) and directed by Patrick Stetner, this film moves much faster (90 minutes, perhaps a few minutes longer) than you might think that the film the genre will run. This is good in keeping the action and the action clean and clean. It's bad because it leaves different holes in the schedule and does not create any holes of plot or story. I do not want to go into any great detail except to say that if you are not familiar with Mr. Maupin's work or his personal story, you feel a little out of the loop. Yet, William's performances (I would like to hear more about his narrative, personally), Collette, Cannavale, Culkin and much of the supported cast (waitress at Collete's Donna frequents does a great job with what little part she is!) Are top- The mood that originated here, namely the cold, lonely dark exteriors of Wisconsin and New York, give this story amazing frameworks. They can have ends that are not particularly good, but it's still a convincing story to keep.
