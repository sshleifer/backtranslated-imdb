While the title "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" comes from the Irish proverb, the film acts as a Greek tragedy. It starts with a ruthless robbery, and it continues in a spiral out of control as the two brothers try to escape from the mess they get into. Cast is well assembled with Philip Seymour Hoffman & Ethan Hawke playing the above-mentioned brothers. Significant support is Albert Finney as father and Marisa Tomei as the wife of one brother and a second mistress. In addition to these actors, acting is not negligible. The story is convincing and is with a degree of consciousness. The narrative structure preserves interest by providing different views and frequent time shifts. It is said that the unpredictability of the film is somewhat subdued, because at first it appears that this story is a tragedy. Overall, it's a pretty impressive debut for writer Kelly Masterson. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet is well-controlled, but I have a bigger impression that he's been driving for over eighty years. I was less impressed by Carter Burwell, but that's not the main distraction. In the end, the film turns out to be convincing, and while the story and the presentation may have superficial similarities to other films, this remains a unique experience.
