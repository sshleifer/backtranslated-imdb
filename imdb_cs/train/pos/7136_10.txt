I saw the movie before I read Michelle Magorian's book and I enjoyed both of them. The film, more than a book, has attracted me to tears on several occasions. This film touches the deepest places of the human soul and never leaves. I encourage so many people to watch this masterpiece as soon as possible and as soon as possible. I give her ten stars.
