I recently caught this little piece of film on the cable. I was surprised, though, that I should wait for it from the team that deals with this film. Henry Bromwell drove this film with a hand and shows it. One always wonders about the secret life of hit hunters. One does not have to go too far to realize that they are probably his own neighbors, social well-known or even friends; they do not differ from us, at least on the surface. In this story, Grandfather, is a contemptuous figure who does not hesitate to remove someone at the right price. He has no interference in teaching the rope to his own son and even to his grandson! Alex, is a man who is in confusion. He knows what he has done in the past, and suddenly realizes the consequences of his actions. He must see someone who can help him find peace with himself. On the way to Dr. Parks tries to find an absolutism even if he does not find it. On the contrary, there is a dramatic turn when Alex learns who else to kill. <br /> <br /> Alex, famously portrayed by William H. Macy, will charm us. Not only is he a fantastic actor but believes he is the man. One of the best things in the movie is late John Ritter. He's as convincing as Dr. Parks, the man who reveals the secret. Donald Sutherland, as a grandfather, is perfect. He's a natural actor in everything he does. Neve Campbell surprised Sarah's pivotal role. Shows the ability and reach that are incredible. Tracey Ullman is Martha, a suffering wife, and she will not do much. Also, Barbara Bain, in a rare appearance, is a grandmother from hell. David Dorfman, is the joy of the film. It shows maturity for his years. <br /> <br />
