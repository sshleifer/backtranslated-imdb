You do not have to confuse the British black comedy of the same name that came out in 1994. But this deep grave is a deserving addition to the 80s of the last century. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy goes = 4 girls from the Sorority Monastery are planning a spring vacation in Florida, but the plans are suspended when one of them testifies to the fact that a man has murdered a local woman and when he realizes he was seen, let's say it will become a deadly game of cats and mice and things get worse when it turns out to be a local sheriff. The flat tomb is, in my opinion, one of the more enjoyable slashers that came out in the 80s, especially late in the 1980s, when the slasters were a bit down, it was one of the few that did not, and this film should be more famous , it's a shame that it's not. it's one movie that really forsakes stereotypes (just try guessing who's going to be the last girl - I'm totally wrong). Basic stuff is all good, and it's one of those movies you probably hope everyone gets away, which of course they do not have. That's along with the smoothness of the first half-hour glasses of the film (in a good way) with some glimpses of real anger (the second murder causes a real bout) and some unexpected tangle (although it's not a high budget thriller I did not expect it to be a brown scene where the woman is strangled own bra (accompanied by hysterical religious radio broadcasting) in a movie from the late 1980s. <br /> <br /> One or two bad things about this movie, and it's not bad just a little, just like a subgroup with two teenage boys who nowhere to go and the end that was stupid and plus the deputies of the inability to follow the logic.In SHALLOW GRAVE there is no sharp tool but at least in my opinion it's a searchable movie. a nice and valuable slasher with outstanding performance from all four major girls and psycho sheriff.
