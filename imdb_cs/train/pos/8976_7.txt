Starlift is a nice and interesting proposal for all of the star music that each studio fired during the Second World War. When you discover stars such as Gary Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon MacRae and Randolph Scott, and others like Gershwin Brothers, Cole Porter, Jule Styne, and Sammy Cahn, who deliver music, it's an easy movie. And the plot is not even in the way. The conspiracy includes two Air Force soldiers, Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerthy, who are trying to meet Warner Brothers star Janice, and use as a face the fact that they both come from Youngstown, Ohio and Hagerthy's Dentist, the Dentist of the Truth and the Half cities. The schema works too well because Louell Parsons will soon put it as an entry in its column. Yes, Louely is in the movie too. She must love Warner Brothers or Jack Warner to give her more than other students because she also used this studio to promote her Hollywood radio program for the whole day. But the rest of the story has also touched upon real life endeavors. Ruth Roman also plays herself to make her studio and other show shows on soldiers and women's airplanes go to Korea. Some of the names I mentioned, and others sing and play at the Travis Air Force Base show where a lot of this film was shot. One special number was shot for talent Phil Harris, sing / tell Balance Stranger, I Texas Ranger helped and helped Virginie Gibson, Frank Lovejoy and Gary Cooper. Yup, Cooper looked as if he had the old time to make fun of his image. This is the oldest of the clich√©s when you say it's not like that, but they really do not because you do not have a studio system that has all these talents under contract. That's one thing about the demise of an old studio system that we can mourn.
