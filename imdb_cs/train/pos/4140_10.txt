What an amazingly fun and original show. The Homecoming Queen's Got A Gun is simply perfect. Add Amy Hill, who plays a lesbian who has always argued with her partner and business partner (Asian Restaurant-WOK-DON "T RUN). During this show I was more laughing than any other I've ever seen (including Newhart - my favorite shows) If you love movies like Naked Gun and Airplane - you will love this series !! One of the best moments of the show is Cindy Williams playing alone, Tammy finds a picture of Cindy Williams in her coat, pictured by Cindy Williams makes an unbearable bowling act - upside down, it's awesome to see an actress like Cindy Williams who can play as such as an opera like many surprising twists during a short run. I just hope it will be released once on a DVD with special many bonus special features. The best series I've ever seen !!
