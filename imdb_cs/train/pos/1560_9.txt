This is a meeting, a team and a great episode of justice. Clark, from hesitation to resolve, made an important leap from a restless teenager who was afraid of a controlled fate to Superman, who, like Green Arrow, postpones his emotions from his few loved ones, ready to save the entire planet. It's not just an exciting story about teamwork, loyalty and friendship; it's also about deciding what's more important in life, about lessons for Clark. I do not want the series to end, but I hope that the subsequent episodes will rigorously hold on to what the judge shows without any "rewinding" that stretches, and this will end up with Smallville - and the wonderful start of Superman. <br /> <br /> In this episode, however, we should see more contrast between Lex and the team. Nine stars should give enough credit.
