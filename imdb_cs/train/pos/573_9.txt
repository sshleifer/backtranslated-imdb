I've always enjoyed movies that portray life as it is. Life has sometimes boring patches, no real plot, and not necessarily a happy ending. River Run Through It is the perfect name for this movie (and Norman Maclean's novel). Life comes and flows like a river, and it has harsh spots, but it's a wonderful trip. Robert Redford brings a lot to the film. His narrative has a friendly feeling that fits perfectly into the picture. As a director he is restrained and calm and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes. As for acting, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work surprisingly like brothers. I do not know how to describe the performances of Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn, with the difference that they really feel real. "River runs through it" is a wonderful movie. <br /> <br />
