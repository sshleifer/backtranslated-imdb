I went to this film when he did not know about it and really enjoyed it. There was a lack of authenticity and credibility - some of the things the characters said and done were totally bizarre, and a lot of scripts looked like it was ad-libbed (maybe that's typical for Woody Allen, forgive your ignorance), but the whole audience in the theater he laughed. It was not just the jokes in the movie anyway, but the whole movie itself. The meeting reminded me that Seinfeld is acting where he is trying not to smile at his own jokes - they are furious, but if you do not take the film too seriously, you can really appreciate the humor of ACTORs, not CHARAKTERS. If you are looking for a random film and you like Woody Allen, I would definitely recommend it!
