I thought the movie was pretty good for a film made for television, and it contained so much action and humor. I have found that the value of entertainment is worth watching and will look again at it or on a similar show. I am disappointed that Sean was not credited to IMDb here. I see the opportunity for an action series based on this concept or a sequel to Sean, who again plays for even higher "cash" bets because his life will be the same as he does. <br /> <br /> I felt that Sean played very well and reminded me of an actor named Matthew Ashford who plays Jack Deveraux in the days of our life - Soap opera.
