On the California Presidential Day, between midnight and 1 am, spying Victor Rovner sends a message from Kuala Lumpur to the US. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, federal agent Jack Bauer returned to his family and has trouble at home with his teenage daughter, Kimberly, who accuses her mother Teri of pulling Jack out of the house. Teri and Jack decide to have a serious conversation with Kim and find out that the girl ran home. When trying to solve his domestic problem, Jack is summoned by his counter-terrorist unit to colleague Nina Myers for a meeting with his boss, Richard Walsh, who reveals the threat to the life of Senator David Palmer, who leads the president, and they have to find shooters. Later, Walsh has a private conversation with Jack and says there's a conspiracy in the agency against David Palmer, and he tells Jack to find conspirators. When the airplane explodes over the Mojave Desert, Jack has another problem. Earlier episode "24" is the promising start of the successful series introduced by Jack Bauer. This is the first time I watched this show and I admit I liked what I saw: a complex and dramatic story with more and more realistic characters. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect as a family man and a reliable agent who is in charge of three difficult missions at the same time: Find a killer to protect an important policy; find a traitor in his agency; and find his teenage daughter who gets into trouble while trying to save his marriage.
