Domino is a great movie. This is a young woman named Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley), who becomes a reward for her boredom with her lifestyle. It connects with its two hunters (Mickey Rourke & Edgar Ramirez) and begins an adventure. The script is good. Very down to the ground and realistic with the tone of the movie. The only problem I've had with this movie is that it focuses on the various things they do instead of the character of Domino. Even with Kiera Knightley, she gives a wild performance. She shows the right amount of anger and determination in this performance. Mickey Rourke watches his performance Oscar-Worthy in Sin City's other performance. Edgar Ramirez does not do anything except to speak Spanish once in a while looking at Kiera. Delroy Lindoi gives good support. Mo'Nique was alone, although she surprised me on one particular scene. Lucy Liu has a great chemistry with Kiera Knightley in scenes with her. But the best thing about film is the direction. Tony Scott's fast style really brings the film to life. Cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen. It takes a regular film and uses acid. Every black is blacker, white is brighter and has a green glow. Action scenes are exciting. <br /> <br /> TOTAL: If you like Sin City & Man on Fire, you'll like Domino.
