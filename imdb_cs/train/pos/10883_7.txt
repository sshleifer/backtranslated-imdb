This is surprisingly an above average slasher, it's nice and well-made, with some decent gore! All the characters are decent and the story is quite funny and Molly Ringwald played the disordered bitch very well. I bought it at a pawn for $ 1 and it was surprising, and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget, plus I loved the mask the killer had because it was a little scary. The final was really great, because I liked how they beat the killer and the end, while the predictable was also very fun, plus all the characters except Ringwald were surprisingly quite decent! It's fairly made and written, and I thought it was sometimes quite creative and original, plus some of the deadly scenes were very impressive. This killer did not move and I loved him, and fans of Slashera (like me) should really enjoy this movie, plus the opening was really pious to shoot them too! This is a surprisingly above average slasher, it's nice and well done, with some decent gore and I say it's worth it! Direction is good. Kimble Rendall is doing good! work here with a fixed camera, using spooky settings, good angles and keeping the movie at a fast pace. The game is solid! Molly Ringwald plays the female extremely well and I had problems with her, after all she was supposed to be a heroine, turned out to be better at the end, but not too much, I'm surprised she decided to make this film, but she did a great job! Frank Roberts is fantastic as a killer, threatening, scary, and has one hell of a mask, and this guy did not move, it was fantastic! Kylie Minogue plays the bitch very well in a small role. Jessica Napier is cute and is great as a second heroine. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall, it is worth watching! *** of 5
