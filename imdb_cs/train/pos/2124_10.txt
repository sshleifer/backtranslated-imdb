It is a truly classic film in its story, acting and film presentation. Amazing actors are full of film, Miss Sullivan and Jimmy Stewart are the main characters. In real life she was very admired and loved by Jimmy, and she really gave him his first acting roles and helped him feel more relaxed when he appeared on stage. The "chemius" between the two was always obvious and so warm and pleasant to look. She was so beautiful, a young woman, and she was so sweet in personality imagination. The story of these two young people, and finally they finally joined together, is magical to watch and pure magical fun. Ideas about heart warming are also given by other supportive actors in this amazing story / film. All right to Miss Sullivan I will make the perfect tenth at this Golden Age Cinema Classic, which has a special attraction for all generations. It must be seen for all!
