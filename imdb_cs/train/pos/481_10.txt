This is one of the unusual cases when the film and the novel on which it is based are both great. Perhaps this is because Gorris takes Nabokov's initial ideas and gives them another explanation. The ultimate result is a look at Luzhin, which fits him more than on Nabokov. The only thing he does not like in the film is Valentin's influence on the fate of Luzhin. It can not be imagined that Nabokov created a man like Valentinov and gave him so much influence on the arguments of the novel.
