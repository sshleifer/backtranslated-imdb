Peter Jackson's version (s) are generally better films from an objective point of view. That being said, they are not my favorite screen versions of Lord of the Rings and let me explain why. <br /> <br /> First of all, acting on the screen is just too common and did not conceal with Jackson's LOTR. The entire cast is too far from the mill. "You say the stupid cartoon characters of Ralph Bakshi are better actors than real people?" he could ask. Well, they are not really stupid (with the exception of Hobbits, later around them) and certainly pack more personalities than Jackson's party - even with a much more limited time of dialogue. And that's because of Bakshi LOTR's superior behavior. Take, for example, Aragorn. In this version, his voice is deep and charismatic, full of authority (Aragorn's lord) and shrugged smash (Aragorn ranger). This is due to the great voice of John Hurt. Compare this to Vigg Mortensen's relatively high sound without a soul and the fight quickly becomes uneven: Hurt beats Mortensen hands down. <br /> <br /> Then there's Gandalf. Probably the most dominant (and most popular) character in the whole saga. In this version of Bakshi, Gandalf (William Squire) is a real wizard. And I do not think he shoots the screws from his fingers (it's not), but his presence is just charming. It is mystical, powerful, and can easily switch from a gentle old man to a haunted man. Add to his appearance: Tall, old like an old oak, long beard like his body, sharp eyes, a witch's nose and, of course, a classic wizard's hat. Perfect Gandalf, just like in books. Ian McKellen's Gandalf in his second hand is just too boring. It looks too human, it sounds too human, it's too human, it does not have a hat, or it has no sword. Yes, sword. In this Bakshi version, Gandalf scores a couple of bloody orcs killing with the sword (as in the books). And you are stylish slow killing. Gandalf is not much we can get. And it should be noted that when I am sad to say, great Christopher Lee did not bring Saruman to the living. Fraser Kerr in this movie did it, even with a very limited time on screen and lines. Before we completely move to the visual aspects of the film, we must mention that voice acting and the general performance of Orcs are also superior to Jackson's pretentious bad guys. Bakshi orcs are struggling with enemies (or each other) constantly with growls, screams, and a nasty tongue. They are more credible than monsters, and they are more faithful to me. Finally, black riders - or Nazgul. These final bad guys are in this spooky ghost - not just some drivers are wearing black. And he speaks with a pronounced voice that enchants their sacrifice. My favorite scene in the movie is when Nazgul chases Frodo by the river. While Peter Jackson could do nothing but show the riders who simply chase the party, Bakshi throws a scary dream with some cold slow scenes and a thundering sky. But I like this movie more than Jackson's, the other are, even if technically, even better. And that's because some key visuals. As you know, Bakshi LOTR contains a mix of animated characters (all hobbits and main cast) and real actors covered in color. I do not really have a problem with using this real human animation, but they just do not look good with traditional cartoon characters. This is particularly true for people (Rohan riders, folk pubs, etc.). Orcs are another matter because they look very different from other characters. Orcs, while people playing with animation, look much more like Jacksons. They have brown-green skin, glossy red eyes, flat face and pointed teeth. <br /> <br /> The greatest shot in this visual film, the howerver, is the Hobbits. While I prefer almost every person in the Bakshi version compared to Jackson, the other has obviously better hobbits, in fact they are perfect. With Bakshim you get some irritating and somewhat badly drawn Disney humanoid beans. And you're forced to spend a lot of movie time with them, so be warned. Again, the vocal acting is fine, but the actors' mouths can not save the "immersion damage" that this little lasajka caused. Well, like this I never liked the half. <br /> <br /> General bugs in the Bakshi script are well known. Limited play time (limited budget) and lots of missing scenes. So while this film covers almost half of the story, it does not do much in detail compared to Jackson's version. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In summary, LOTR version of Ralph Bakshi is superior: <br /> <br /> - Outdoor atmosphere (feels like Middle-Earth) -General voice acting -music Win a fantastic score of Konto and Rosenman) -Gandalf -Aragorn (One of the best roles of John Hurtt) -King Theoden -Orcs -The black-rider -Elrond (He's not some hippie fairies in this!) <br /> <br /> While the Jackson version is better: <br / > <br /> - because it covers the whole story -Global visuals and special effects -Gollum / Smeagol -Balrog -Hobbits <br /> <br /> The Lord of Ralph Bakshi, even with his known shortcomings, is one of the best animated films , which have been filmed and captured the atmosphere of Tolkien's fantastic world very well, if not perfectly. I'll give him a score of 8 Â½ out of 10.
