The creature of well-being in America should be released on another network, or at least given the chance to have a full episode run. Unfortunately, it was not. Because the American audience (seemingly) takes the mosquito's attention when it comes to humor that does not lie in revealed diatribe, or is interested in scatological functions (both sound and smell), such a show will be little and far between. One of the main problems was that, no matter how great it was, it was for a clear audience who knew what to expect but was seen by audiences and rooms that had no idea what they were watching. Which is sad, but not unexpected. I would love to see at least three other seasons of this show, even if it was made for a direct DVD release. Material and interactions between beings were rich in subtext, and other conversations are waiting to be under the surface. But because of political correctness such conversations take place only in my mind.
