If you've been through the 1960s, this movie can sometimes be painful and sometimes quite joyous. It's all, but a small print on the boards of ancultural culture prevalent at the time. They are the roots of the social revolution that is still playing: "Do not say too soon for the wheel to turn, for the time it's changing." While the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of LSD and its dissemination at the time, it has played a huge role in the development of intelligence, influencing engineers, scientists, and helping with the hyper-development of computer activities. Greetings to filmmakers from those who were there - you've captured the years better than I've ever seen.
