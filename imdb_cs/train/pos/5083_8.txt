In the hands of less influential actors than Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, this film could become silly and terrible. But with these two experienced thespian guys who made their way, I found "Silent Fury" the most interesting and enjoyable little mystery. When their marriage is interrupted by a stranger who claims that Colbert is already married and that he is the best at this wedding, it is possible to realize that there is a conspiracy in the work. As Colbert, Ryan and her attorney have decided to refute a claim to a stranger before the wedding, they are at every step met with other evidence that probably reinforces the claim that she is indeed already a saint. Although it's not too hard to figure out who's the main "baddie", it's a lot of fun because the intensity and pace of the story is increasing. Overall, it's a good, solid, mysterious movie with outstanding performances by two leading actors and a subtle support cast that often includes underestimated Paul Kelly.
