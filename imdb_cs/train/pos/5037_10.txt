It would be a matter of ‚Üê Non contributing creativity amendment on Image I do not remember seeing any ads or ads for this, which might be the reason why it was not so good at the box office. However, Frailty is an excellent and truly original horror movie. I can put it in the top ten horror films on my list. The film begins with snapshots of photos and news articles that tell us about the murder, which is called "God's Hand". And then the man enters the police station and tells the chief officer that he knows the killer is his brother. Two of them went together to go to the place where the victims were buried, which could help solve the case. During this journey one begins to tell his brother's story and we will return at the time when the events began. Fenton and Adam are two young brothers living with their strict and religious father, who one day claims to have received a divine message from God asking him to kill demons who appear to be ordinary human beings. He will receive from God a list of the demons' names to be destroyed and ask his sons to help him carry out this divine mission. This is an absolutely awesome and exciting movie that will keep your seat on the edge. Tensions are running high, innocent people (or demons?) Killing and religious experiences are being questioned. It does not have very little clever twists at the end. If you like this genre, I highly recommend Frailty for you. He owns DVD and is one of my favorite horror thrillers.
