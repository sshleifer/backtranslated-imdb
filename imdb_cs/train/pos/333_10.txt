In its sincerity, this series is just as classic (like television), what is the original poem of world literature. Far from being badly exploitable, it is a beautiful and respectful rendition of one of the defining texts of Western culture. <br /> <br /> I was moved by the situation of Odysseus and his followers; which touched the drama of the fall of Troy (which she felt but did not see); interested in the way the gods played with the fate of mortals. (We should mention that the gods here are not ridiculous CGI creatures that fall on their ankle wings, or badly cast fashion models in bikinis, as in Homer's work they work through mortal agents or rarely are represented by classical sculpture). It's a shame that it's not available on DVD, especially due to the huge Odyssey inferior and cheesy adaptations that can be found in a video rental shop.
