For me, nothing is more pleasant than the one that is going on, letting you guess how the whole thing will end. And that's exactly what's happening in DEATHRAP, based on the cool play Ira Levin ("Rosemary's Baby"). And in it, MICHAEL CAINE and CHRISTOPHER REEVE make the kind of stunt that Caine and Laurence Olivier have pulled away in SLEUTH - with almost as many skills and so many puzzles as they ever existed in that incredibly clever game. But because it means to scare you, to surprise you and to get rid of the results, it's hard to write a plot about the plot. Let's say what we know at the beginning is all you have to know about the movie. MICHAEL CAINE is a mad jealous playwright whose last play has been unfortunately disappointed. When the young aspiring writer CHRISTOPHER REEVE sends the manuscript of his play, Caine realizes that he can solve all his problems and get his reputation back. From this moment on, it is a matter of entertainment and audience games, while the story of Ira Levin unfolds and manages to conceal Agatha Christie for the number of twists. Caine and Reeve have fun, each brings some dynamic tension to the story and some humorous touches that come from the scenario that overlaps the humorous path. <br /> <br /> Summary: It's worth seeing - but no one is happy with the end.
