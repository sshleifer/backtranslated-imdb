Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams stars in this action / thriller written and directed by the tension commander, Wes Craven, himself. The whole movie starts with some of the troubles in The Lux Atlantic, a hotel in Miami. The problem is addressed by Hotel Director Lisa Reisert. Then it goes to the airport and that's where all the problems start. He meets Jackson Rippner, who does not want to be named Jack for the name of Jack Ripper if you know him and I think. Then they get into the plane and they're pretty crazy, Rippner and Reisert are sitting next to each other. For a further half hour, Lisa is terrorized, terrified and frightened by Rippner. I will not do anything. Then we go on where Jack is chasing Lisa at the airport. Then Lisa returns to her house to find out if her father is alright, and it's crazy enough that Rippner is already. There are almost twelve minutes of violence and intense intensity throughout this scene. Overall, about 25 minutes of intense intervention will appear at the end. <br /> <br /> The film was not just intense, but it was a great plot for him. As I said, I will not do anything, because it is so shocking and exciting and a little disturbing / scary. And the acting of every individual character in the movie, even those that have no lines at all, were all perfect. It was unbelievable. Everything in this movie was amazing! Effect, music, effects, make-up, directing, editing, writing, everything was great! Wes Craven is definitely the Master of Truancy. The red eye is definitely a must, and it is definitely worth the money. You could watch this movie over and over again and never get bored. <br /> <br /> Red Eye I have to say that it's better than 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Original MPAA rating: PG-13: Some intense sequences of violence and language <br /> <br /> My ratings MPAA: PG-13: Some very intense sequences of violence and language <br /> < My Canadian Rating: 14A: Violence, Scary Scenes, Disturbing Content
