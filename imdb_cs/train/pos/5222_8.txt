After Chicago, I was beginning to lose all respect for Richards Gere, and then The Flock appeared. There's just a nice smile and some facial gestures in the store can get you, but he showed me that he finally got his craft and can deal with the best of them. Clare Danes was also great as his "trainee / substitute". Some have suggested that violence is too futile, but I can not see it. Nothing I saw was lost from the power of this film. I was really shocked that I did not hear he was released in the theaters and hit Blockbuster. A truly exceptional film with the right combination of action, tension, excitement and social consciousness. How good as 7? Well, maybe. And you'll see better than Gere before anyone gets out of Pitt.
