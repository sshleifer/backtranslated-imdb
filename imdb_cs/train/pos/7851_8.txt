Cameraman's Revenge is an unusual short not because of the subject (adultery) or because he is animated (Winsor McCay introduced Little Nemo to the movie by this time), but because it depicts mistakes telling the story! Ladislaw Starewicz originally wanted to make real mistakes in battles, but he could not get them to the camera because of the hot light they suffered, making him dead and starting to use stop-motion techniques to manipulate the movement to his satisfaction. This short one does a good job of giving human qualities to little beings, such as riding a motorcycle, painting, shooting, kissing and dancing. Starewicz would also make Frogland (1922) and Maskot (1933), but his first notable work would be this. If you are interested in this and other short songs listed, check that the local library lends DVD Cameraman't Revenge and other fantastic stories from Image Entertainment.
