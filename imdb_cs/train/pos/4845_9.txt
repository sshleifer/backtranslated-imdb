Hello, Playmates. I recently watched this film for the first time, and it's also my first experience with Arthur Askey, I must admit that I was very impressed with this film. As a fan of black and white films in general, the pimlico waist, the lavender hill of the crowd, and Tommy Trinder (who is apparently a distant relative), this film appealed in that it provided good old-fashioned British humor. I noticed that there were some who criticized Askey's performance, but in my opinion the test of time is a great example of 40-year-old comic acting, and if something is added to the image by creating characters that are more than mere stereotypes that seem, that he dominates movies. If you came to this film, you would recommend taking it, the shame that these movies are not usually shown on Sunday afternoons. I'm also glad I had the opportunity to watch another piece of work by Arnold Ridley (Private Godfrey in the Dad Army). thank you
