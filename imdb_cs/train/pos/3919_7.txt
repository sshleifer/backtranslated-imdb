While Carmen from Bizet sings, middle-aged choreographer Antonio Antonio (Antonio Gades) brings sexy Carmen (Laura del Sol) to play a leading role. Antonio falls in love with Carmen, an independent and seductive woman incapable of receiving sacred love. When Carmen has a relationship with another dancer, Antonio enjoys his jealousy as D. José in the original opera, taking fiction with reality. "Carmen" is another great movie of Carlosa Saura trilogy dedicated to Flamenco dance. The dramatic love story evolves with the lives of artists linked to the characters they are testing, and many times it is not entirely clear whether reality (with dancers) or fiction (games) is happening. Paco de Lucia is another attraction of this original version of the famous Bizet Opera, based on the novel Prosper Mérimée. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Carmen"
