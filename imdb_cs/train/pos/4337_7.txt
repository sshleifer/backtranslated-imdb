I am disappointed that Reiser (who wrote the film) felt that he needed to use so much shame for no reason. Maybe it's his idea of ​​"adult" movies, lots of ugly words with healthy humor? I thought it better about him, and I thought less about him about this movie. <br /> <br /> Falca's acting and some moments of humor, as well as some possibly important themes, have made me to> <br /> It could be a good movie for adult kids to watch and laugh at their of their own people and their weakness. But the lack of attention to the audience's families seriously damages what could be a family film but fails. You certainly do not want to spend money, though it could be a free watch on television.
