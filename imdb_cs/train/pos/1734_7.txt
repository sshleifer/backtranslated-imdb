I first saw this movie for the first time and I liked it. Her dance was very entertaining. Somewhere I read that she got a role in this movie because she knew how to dance. The landscape was great. Yvonne is such a talented and beautiful woman. We laughed at silly kissing scenes, but that's great old movies! I grew up with her on The Munsters and I enjoy watching her in her earlier films. Maybe not everyone is the best there, but it's still worth watching to see her act and sing. I slowly buy all of her movies and watch them when I accept them. I have a great collection of her memorabilia.
