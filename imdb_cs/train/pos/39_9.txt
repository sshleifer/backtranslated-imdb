This is probably one of Sheba's first sewing hours with Stooges. (This excludes his much earlier vaudeville years with the team). But the comedy timing of the trio is the best. In addition to intense slapstick scenes, there are other more subtle but equally funny scenes. Watch Larry when Shemp asks him to look at the camera for the shot. Or look at the real object that invokes the Moa exclamation mark: "Oh ... a highly polished mahogany!" Emil Sitka is at his most embarrassed confused. A goon can look scary, but it's a bit funny. He seems frustrated and confused with Stooges because they are "normal" people in other shorts. It's an episode for Shemp fans. It will not disappoint.
