Was'nt really bad for Raw's first PPV of 006. But the end really was really shocking for all the participants and those who were looking at home. <br /> <br /> First match - RIC FLAIR VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR THE WWE INTERCONTINENTAL MASTER Not a bad opener, these two can seriously give a great combination if they have more time to match matches. Flair won the DQ after Edge celebrates him with his MITB briefcase. 3/10 SECOND MATCH TRAS STRATUS VS. MICKIE JAMES FOR WWE WOMEN'S MAJSTRY Not badly noticed that this is the first time these audiences met in a circle together. Mickie is a modified Chick Kick, but Trish cocks and heats his own Chick Kick to win his title. 3/10 THREE MATCH TRIPLE H VS. BIG SHOW This match was really good. The whole game HHH focuses on the wounded hand of the Big Show, but the Big Show is still fighting. Later, HHH is able to remove the Big Show & Nails Pedigree for the win. 5/10 FOURTH MATCH - SHELTON BENJAMIN W / MAMA VS. VISCERA {It was a bonus game} Not so bad, it was okay. After Viscera fell behind the judge, Benjamin's mother got her purse (which had bricks in it) and killed Viscer's head three times. Viscera got up just to get Benjamin into the fight against the big man. 4/10 <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH-JERRY 'THE KING' LAWLER VS. GREGORY HELMS Boring, slow and careless. Both men did not really strive for a very good effort. Jerry Lawler wins after winning his fist. 2/10 <br /> <br /> SIXTH MATCH- TORRIE Wilson VS. VICTORIA VS. ASHLEY VS. MARIA VS. CANDICE MICHELLE IN FIRST EUROPE WOMEN RACE MATCH It was very fun for me. Ashley {I think} eliminates Candice the last time to win the first Gauntlet feminine match. 5/10 seventh match - JOHN CENA VS. CHRIS MASTERS VS. CARLITO VS. SHAWN MICHAELS VS. KANE VS. KURT ANGLE W / DAIVARI IN THE WREST CHAMPIONSHIP CHAMPIONSHIP CHAMPIONSHIP It was a great elimination chamber match. Nothing, however, would have been top in the last year of the Elimination Chamber. The last three are Masters, Price & Carlito. Carlito turned to Masters and came to him to remove him. In a matter of seconds, the price for Carlito gets to win the Elimination Chamber and retain the WWE title. But his night was not over. 7/10 After the match Vince McMahon congratulates him for his victory. Vince McMahon says his night is not over yet, and says Edge in his Money In The Bank reserves the opportunity to call for a title. Edge comes out with Lit, gives the case to Vince and waits off in the ring because Price has yet another match to come tonight. <br /> <br /> OTHER MATCH- JOHN PRICE VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR THE WWW CHAMPIONSHIP {The prize that is open during the boxing match} immediately edged Edge, then Edge then blows Spear on Price, goes over the cover and in its shock the price runs out. Edge nails another spear & covers for the shocking three to count as he defeated Price & won the WWE championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 So last year's New Year's Revolution was better than this year, but it was still fine. The EK wrestling was also a good and shocking Edge winning at his MITB occasion is definitely the most shocking for the PPV show. Overall: I'll give it 7/10 & C
