During the Second World War, Bedknobs and Broomsticks are a fun adventure for children, played by Angela Lansbury as a witch apprentice who has thwarted the Nazi invasion with three evacuees and a "witchcraft professor." <br /> <br /> Brilliantly inventive, with lots of laughter, this film will delight kids of all ages with big characters, exciting story and catchy tunes. Lansbury is perfect because Eglantine, a not-perfect witch who takes three kids to a full-day adventure, and her three young stars (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart and Ian Weighill) are just as impressive as Cockney rascals who help fight the enemy Hun . Special effects are somewhat dated, but let's say the kids do not care about these things if they enjoy it. And they have fun. With some of the impressive scenes that blend great live performance and animation with great effect and true movie glamor than a hundred Harry Potter, it would be hard to enjoy this beautiful region of movie getaway. In fact, just a rather exhausted musical number set in Portobello Road greatly perfects the movie, but with so many others you can enjoy, it can easily be forgiven. Moreover, every movie that features British television legend Bruce Forsyth as "Flash" Harry's style spiv is guaranteed by me a good rating.
