Together with Darkwing Duck, it is unjustly canceled. Disney is down from Tarzan and we need a show to get Disney back on the track. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were perfect for the voices of Louis and Baloo (sounds good?) The motif theme theme is also catchy. Of all the villains who are all great on the basis of their own merits, Tony Jay stands out as Shere Kahn. Louis and Baloo, in fact, sound very much like voice overlays in the Jungle books, which is not a bad thing at all. In fact, it's quite inspirational! The animation was in place, and the screenplay had a lot of consciousness that had been badly lacking in animation for years. READ THIS DISPLAY BACK! 9/10. Bethany Cox
