This movie had a great set of adult actors along with the cast of juvenile actors who will be in the movies for long if there is any justice. Directions and adjustments were great. I could look at the book from which it was adapted, it had to be great. (I liked it.) Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight and Tim Blake Nelson were a blast to watch! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis were not seen enough, but they were entertaining when they were on the screen. The children in the camp could not have been better. (as I said, I liked it)
