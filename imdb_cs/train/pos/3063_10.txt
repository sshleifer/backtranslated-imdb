The first director (Bromell) gathered a small but powerful acting performance to look at the middle-aged world, a depressing, humiliating man and his father-to-father struggle. This film in less than 90 minutes represents an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature. David Dorfman, as the 6-year-old son of William H. Macy, is the most refreshing little actor I've seen in a while. Macy is brilliant in the part she almost seems to be written as the only torture herself trying to break the reins of her father and his business. It's great to see Donald Sutherland and here he is beautiful as annoying father Mac. The films of the alternate soundtrack are worth to hear that the director explains how he chose to cast, place and shoot the film. The basic Dolby 2 channel sound is reasonable and well recorded for this movie. Cinematography creates a mood along with a very gentle musical background. Any movie fan or observer of human nature will enjoy, especially if he is a fan of contradiction.
