This two-story was excellent - the best since the series returned. Certain pieces of the story were speeded up from previous films, but what they do not do TV shows today. What we got was the launch of a good science fiction story. A great big (really scary) monster imprisoned at the base of a deep pit, some excellent extraterrestrials at The Ood - the best "new" alien, animated series, came up with a set of essentially compassionate and credible human figures of a couple of unnamed "exhaustible" fashion), some great philosophical themes (love, loyalty, faith, etc.) and some special drawers. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute of it.
