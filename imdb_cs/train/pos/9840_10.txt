Limerick was born again: <br /> <br /> If you could get back from the dead <br /> <br /> And live in the girl's head <br /> <br /> Revenge he would get <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The guy who is now in bed with his wife has met. <br /> <br /> For me, Born Again is a very understated, classic episode that forms part of what sets X files for me before I start watching it. I saw a couple of segments before the show first appeared, and I was too young to watch her like The Jersey Devil, but I especially remember watching this episode as an eleven-year-old and was totally exhausted by the scene where the guy gets bus to death and then hypnosis with a little girl. I tell you I can not sleep for weeks! For this reason, this episode has a special aura of what kind of craze I have grown since. It's enough enough to look at some obvious shortcomings in the plot, why the girl had to wait until it's 9 years before her older spirit of life has really begun to avenge. Or what she did just accidentally sit on the bus in the middle of the night. You think her parents would be concerned. And maybe we just will not really see this part of the story. And it was with telekinesis? In addition to adding a really cool factor to Carrie's already horrifying story, it was not good for him. But even with minor flaws, it's a classic episode in my opinion and has no reason not to like me. 10 out of 10.
