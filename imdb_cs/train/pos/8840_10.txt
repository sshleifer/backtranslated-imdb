Watching the Devil is considered to be one of my best experiences in the cinema. I was interested in my mixed reaction to the film - and for me, extremes of opinion suggest that the film touched something that embraced or refused a general audience. It's one of the films that stayed with me, and I think about it and think about it. Surely the DVD would illuminate some of the themes and film elements? These include: Sidney Lumet's return film, a time-shifting technique depicted in a story, an excellent combination of Lumet and Masterson, and why it works so well, masterly direction, the relatively rare, sharp Hollywood movies give male characters and their mostly doomed men to become an open-book checkbook for her feminine, still unsubstantiated but still resonant performance by Marisa Tome and, of course, an excellent Hoffman with that central monologue about the sum of his parts - for me the heart of the film. <br /> <br /> Balls! Certainly a masterpiece. So imagine your disappointment when you look at the eagerly awaited DVD - but you will find no comment, no backstage, no interviews, no more. Hey - distributors - resolve it!
