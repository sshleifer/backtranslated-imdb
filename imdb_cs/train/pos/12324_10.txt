This movie is incredible. Thanks to great characters, especially the old fencing, which can fly in the shape of a fiery ball and jump over the trees, this film tells the classic story of the battle between good and evil forces. The final settlement is particularly breathtaking and the music score is a bit cool. <br /> <br /> Very, very recommendable.Not for the smallest kids though.This deserves 10.
