This is a direct film, so it should be obvious that he will not compete with the first Lion King, but he said it was absolutely good. My children loved it, but it is given, they love everything that is a cartoon. The big shock was that I liked it in some parts (even joke jokes) laughing loudly, the first movie was a lot of creative ties and even some jokes you had to be older to understand (but without it , to be as risky as in Shrek ("do you think something is compensating?").) A special comment about the fool joke, I was surprised, the jokes were just the sounds of sounds (actually there were no sounds / pictures, the links were actually somewhat gentle) , they actually had settings / punchline / etc and were almost in good taste. I want my kids to think it's more humor than going to the bathroom and this movie is all right in these respects. What else? The music was so, not as creative as in the first or second film, but a lot of fun for the kids. No painful tortious moments, which was my blessing. Some action, but nothing spooky (NIMH's secret has given my children nightmares, not sure that the G rating is suitable for him ...) Overall, I would say that this is a great movie for children of all ages that is 100% safe, (I'm trying to be too sensitive, but I had to jump and turn off TV in several movies that were less boyfriend-like than expected) -but you have no room at this point. I would say you could still stick around, you might find that you like it too :)
