My choice for the greatest movie ever used to be Laughton's "Night of the Hunter", which remains excellent in my canon. But maybe it was replaced by "The Shower," which is the most artistic Taoist film I've ever seen. The way care for others is the flow of water, and the way in which water can be inspired, and comfort, cleaning, and the like is the essence of Dao. It can be assumed that the NOFTH and showers are similar and that Lillian Gish in the first represents the purest form of Christianity because the spa operators are the purest form of Taoism. I would not oppose such an interpretation. Both films are the visual pleasure of integrating ideas and images. Yet, the shower presents such an unstylized view of the sacredness of everyday life that I am nodding her. I respect both of them.
