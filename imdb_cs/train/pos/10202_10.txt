Personally, I liked this film and I am concerned about the ratings that some people gave it. It's a comic book and it's animated now that you do not like comic books or animations, of course you will not like the movie, so why did you watch and bother it for me? Although you are a fan of interesting, strong characters and heroic (sexy) women who spear back and save the world (hell), you will love this movie. I thought the story really dragged me and it was a great movie. Pretty anime-esque or more like some American movies after this new trend of adult animation. Just like Titan A.E. you will meet the vibrant Punisher action. Finally, I highly recommend this movie to a comedy fan and a super hero to a fan or someone with a sufficiently open mind looking for a fun movie.
