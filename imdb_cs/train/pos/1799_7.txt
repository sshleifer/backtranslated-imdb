I am 14 years old and I love this cartoon. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise are doing a great couple. This movie is really funny and I love songs. My favorite songs are "You can not keep a good dog down" and a song about sharing, I think it's called "What's mine is yours." It was the last film with Judith Barsi, who played Anne-Marie's voice. My favorite character is Charlie, but I think her voice is so fun to hear. Although some scenes I've actually found scary, I still have a hard time watching the scene with Charlie's dream and Carface scare me out of it. Other characters like King Gator I found really funny. The end was adorable and he was really sad, who screamed a little. I give this movie 7/10.
