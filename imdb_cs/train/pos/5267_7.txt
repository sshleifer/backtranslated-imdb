Apparently Ruggero Deodato found out at first that his story would not work if he got too close to him, so he decided to choose it. The result is a movie that can be considered an absurd epic sword and witchcraft or as a very fun comedy! And I think I'll go the second way. Short gore moments are well done, Paul Brothers openly laughs at the material (even luck on one scene!) And there is also a charming, temperamental, adventurous performance by Eva La Rue as a girl who designates along with "boys". In addition, where else can you see the inside of a dragon illuminated as a disco? (***)
