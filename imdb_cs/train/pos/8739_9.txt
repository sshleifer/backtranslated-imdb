This is the movie FUNNY. It has all the usual Disney components (music, a wide range of characters, story, attraction), coupled with excellent animation and outstanding voice talent of lesser-known actors such as Antz and Egyptian Prize. /> <br /> The characters work really well and have strong love and humor is focused on a broad level that overcomes generational barriers. The film is also presented in an excellent cinemascope format that contributes to the cinema experience. <br /> <br /> Call me a fool, but I've seen the movie three times and I'm thinking more friends to see this weekend. Many skeptics saw this film on my recommendation and were not disappointed. I work in a multiplex and I can honestly say that no one ever came out of this movie without a feeling of satisfaction. Check it out and do not be put off because it's animated. You'll definitely enjoy this movie and make sure you stay at the end of credits! Shouts and shots are the most amazing part of the movie that is full of laughter.
