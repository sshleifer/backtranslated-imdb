Rachel Griffiths writes and directs this award-winning short film. A stunning story about how to deal with grief and remember those we loved and lost. Though, just 15 minutes, Griffiths can capture so much emotion and truth in the film in a short time. Bud Tingwell gives a moving performance like Will, a widower trying to cope with the death of her wife. Will is confronted with the harsh reality of loneliness and helplessness when he takes care of Rutin's cow, Tulip. The movie depicts the sadness and responsibility that they feel for those they love and lose. Good cinematography, great direction and excellent acting. It will bring tears to all those who have lost their loved one and survived.
