The gorgeous production of Techicolor tells an unusual story of romance between a woman of strong religious beliefs and a trapist monk who left the monastery and violated promises. The film opens in a monastery in Europe where a former student - a lonely beauty in black, called Domini (Marlene Dietrich) prays. She is recommended by the mother's superior to go to the desert and "find herself" and lose her grief over her father who recently died. In the train car on the way to the Sahara, he is facing a very, very troubled man (Charles Boyer) - our former monk. It's early in the hotel near a palm oasis oasis where she'll see our mysterious wandering man again when he's leaning on what to do when he meets a very seductive dancing girl. Domini becomes friends with him, even though he does not know anything about his past - romance soon to follow. This movie is sentimental, melodramatic and different (in a way almost indefinite and even a bit campy) - I found it fun and funny. Photography in this area is really interesting - it is full of extreme facial detail and beautiful color shots of caravans of horses that cross the desert, silhouettes built against sunset. Marlene Dietrich gives a pretty done, though restrained performance here and looks beautiful. Charles Boyer - usually not one of my favorites - is actually pretty good at it, I think his part suits him and he looks pretty young and handsome as well. Basil Rathbone is fine, except for very little work. Another great Max Steiner's orchestral score helps keep a dramatic track - all in all, a very nice movie.
