A very good dramatic comedy about a dramaturgist who is trying to find out how to keep his head above water after the exhaustion of ideas. You can not say much about this movie without telling it. I can say that there was little, apparently, when you are watching the picture. Everyone has their own program. A nice surprise at the end - after all the other surprises. Well written with good performances by all.
