This film is definitely one of my favorite films. Interaction between decent and morally strong characters is a response to chivalry and honest code among thieves and cops. He is interested in topics such as duty, guilt, word, manipulation and trust as few films and unfortunately nothing I can remember from the deaths of the police in the late seventies. The sequence is delicious to the point, so it does nothing and leads the viewer into a masterful plot of right and wrong without having any eye of an attractive and spectacular scene that is often needed in smaller specimens of the genre to awaken the audience. No such scenes are present or needed. The argument is honorable sand for the spectator; An important asset in a genre that too often fills audience fraud. No, this is not Miss Marble ... Congratulations on the music is fine Film, which looks and saves every minute, not just to see.
