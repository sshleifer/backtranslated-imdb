This movie is very funny and every criticism is based on personal preferences - not the quality of the films. Other than the usual excessive roughness in some of Murphy's scenes, the film is a great medium for its humor type. It contains some very good special effects and exciting action scenes. <br /> <br /> As a search engine for lost children, Murphy's character begins to look for the missing girl who leads him the way he thinks he's "chose" - to protect the Golden Child. A young boy is born as enlightened, designed to save the world from evil forces but whose life is in danger, if not for Murphy's help and his beautiful, mysterious and mystical help / guide / protector. /> <br /> There are also moments of philosophical lessons that invite members of the audience who are interested in thinking about deep thoughts. One such scene is where the Golden Child, which Murphy's character demands for protection, is tested by the monks of the mountain temple. The elderly monk presents a tray of decorative necklaces from which a child can choose and the child is tested at his choice. This is a fantasy / comedy based on the idea that they are both good and bad forces in our world that most people do not fully know. When we accept this assumption of conspiracy, we have to impress our everyday reality and prepare for the land and the walls to collapse and to uncover the realm of evil that awaits us to destroy. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie with a good plot, fine acting and a mostly decent dialogue combining a serious theme with a healthy balance of martial arts fighting and Eddie Murphy's humor.
