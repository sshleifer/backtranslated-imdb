I had a good time viewing this picture and was beautifully surprised by his more erudite features. First, the film is undeniably cheaply made with cardboard sets, limited settings and creative scientific props. He is in the ranks of the very poor (two strippers), barely professional (Herb Evers as the leading man), Gothic excitement (Leslie Daniels as assistant Kurt) in first place with Virginius Leith in the title role as headless victim alive against her will for science and her fianc√©. However, scripting is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for the movie of this film. Problems about the role science and medicine have in our lives and what their boundaries should be. This film is a thought film in many ways. However, do not be too deceived by your real intention. This is a fearless story about a man obsessed with his medical science, wishing to combine the head of his dead girlfriend with a perfect body, creating a perfect woman for men with the best of both body and soul. Another very clear aspect of the film is saxophonic music, which resonates heavily every time a doctor plays the city of beautiful women.
