In the conception of a gorgeous film exploring the tensions that occur in family life in the idyllic setting of Galiano Island off the coast of British Columbia, Lotus Eaters gets rid of the fact that it has been wrapped as a film made for television, thereby diminishing by adding chirping music over potentially strong scenes, as if preparing to stop advertising. Bad, really.
