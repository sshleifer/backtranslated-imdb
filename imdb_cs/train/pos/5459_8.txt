BABY FACE is a fast, wise, cracked, conscious smile that takes only an hour and 15 minutes, but what is a smart 75 minutes <br /> <br />! That the story that covers so many terrain could be said for so short a time that most of today's filmmakers are ashamed. Today's screenwriters should study the BABY FACE economy and reduce the overweight that will amaze so many of their films. <br /> <br /> The story is not nonsense. An amoral woman rises to wealth first under, <br /> <br /> then across the bodies of the men who fall in love with madness. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Make sure the redemption is a happy end <br /> <br /> but it's not hard to see where the writers want to go, so enjoy what's in there and use your imagination for the rest. Stanwyck is amazing as George Brent and Douglass Dumbvrille as an unfortunate idea. It's not a great movie, it's a nice movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have never seen BABY FACE, take it for the next time you put it on the cable or rent a cassette. It is worth the effort ..
