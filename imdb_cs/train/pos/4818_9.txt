I always have some distrust of looking at UK movies because I usually find inspirational and boring scenarios (such as Vanity Fair or The Other Boleyn Girl), but with great production design, landscapes and gross British accents, thanks which films offer an artistic value they do not really have. Fortunately, the excellent The Young Victoria film does not fit into this situation and deserves an enthusiastic recommendation due to its fascinating story, an outstanding performance by Emily Blunt, Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent, and costumes and places that unexpectedly make the movie a very rich view. And I say "unexpectedly" because I usually do not like these aspects. <br /> <br /> The "Victorian era" was (in my humble opinion) one of the key points of contemporary civilization, not only in terms of social but also scientific, artistic and cultural. I honestly did not know much about the origin of that time, and maybe that's why I enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic events that have prepared the landing of modern times so much. I also liked the way Queen Victoria was like a young and intelligent monarch whose decision was not always good, but at least inspired by good intentions. I also found that the description of romance between Victoria and Prince Albert is very interesting because he is equally interested in the combination of intellect as well as in the emotions it raises. The only failure I've found in this movie is that screenwriter Julian Fellowes used some of the clichÃ©s of romantic cinema on a love story, something that he feels a bit off in his screenplay. /> <br /> I really liked The Young Victoria and I really am very surprised with her. I hope that more films for the season will follow an example of this film: costumes and landscapes should work as a support for an interesting story rather than a substitute.
