I have read reviews about Kerching on IMDb and frankly, I have not seen any positive reviews yet. Actually, I like Kerching. Kerching is a teenage boy named Taj Lewis to make $ 1,000,000 for his mother and builds a website called rudeboy. Websites offer a lot of interesting things if only Taj and his two friends - Danny and Seymour can stop Taj from being exposed. I think this show is quite funny and she likes to watch her. The acting is O.K., but it certainly may be better, the characters are funny, especially Danny Spooner, Taj's boyfriend, his stupidity is what makes him funny. and Taich's next friend, Seymour. Carlton, the owner of the caf√©, also called "The Chill". We never saw him, we just heard him. Thay's younger brother Omar and his older sister Missy are also entertaining. And best friend Missy Kareesh. Taj is nearly exposed. Just like comedy, drama in Kerching as a love life and loss of beloved makes this program great.
