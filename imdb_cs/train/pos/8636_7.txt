A so-so thriller starring Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis joining David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on a road trip to the west. The last couple examines the notorious murders for the forthcoming book; Pitt is a serial killer on lam (ignorant Dave) and Juliette is his poor, not all-out-companion. It's a good acting and the story moves, but Pitt is not like a scary killer, though it's one of his better earlier roles. Best is Michelle Forbes, who always shines, whether in his roles in "Murder: Life on the Street" or in a short series of "Wonderland." Vote: 6
