Most of the war films made in the US during the Second World War were very entertaining, but they suffered serious shortcomings in realism, because they were produced rather for promoting propaganda to pick up ghosts at home than anything else. I do not hit these films, because many of them are still very observable. However, because they often fail to be realistic, they are prevented from being really great movies. A perfect example was John Garfield's Air Force movie - in which the B-17 almost draws half the Japanese air force! However, Pride Of The Marines is a welcome departure - to record high marks for displaying the true story accurately. When I first saw this movie, I thought it was not a true story because it seemed too unlikely to be true. However, after further investigation, I found that it was really true of the amazing story of the two men who did so much to win the Medal of Honor. This is one case where real life seems to be too incredible to be true!
