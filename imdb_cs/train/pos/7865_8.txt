Page 3 is a great movie. The story is so refreshing and interesting. Not once in the whole movie I was in the universe. Konkana Sen did a good job in the movie, although I think someone with more charm or enthusiasm would be better, but she did a great job. All supporting actors were also very good and the film helped. Boman Irani has done a great job. One thing that stands out in this movie STORY is great and very realistic that it is not around the bushes, it is much more straightforward when it sends out its message. I think he should shoot more movies as if it should be, I'm sorry I'm looking at the same movies with candy, they're still getting hard to digest. Everyone should watch, it's a great movie. -Just my 2 cents :)
