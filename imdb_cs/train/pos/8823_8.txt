A good movie. He says a boyish fantastic story telling us how we are caught in social situations and what extreme measures we have to take to behave differently. Or at least the feeling that you have to break every rule if you break one. If you wanted to express love for someone you do not know, how would you do without creating an urgent social situation? It is also about fascism deciding on the cultural life of others about which culture is thrown into a throat. What gives Disney or FOX or suicide bomber the right to decide what is our choice. You can not have your morning coffee alone. Do we have to listen to NRJ's cries, see silly tabloids and street advertising before we even had our morning coffee?
