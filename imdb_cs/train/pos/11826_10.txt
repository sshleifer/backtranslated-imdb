I never took part in the midnight feature of the movie before "Dick Tracy" came out. I still have a "T-shirt" I had to wear to get somewhere, like this shirt, "Dick Tracy" got stuck out of here. <br /> <br /> If you saw the movie, sharp images, bright primary colors and strong characters were undoubtedly engraved into the brain. It's a wonder I'm watching. As a director / star / co-author / producer, Beatty knows what works in the movie, showing it here, taking a familiar American icon and recreating it for the whole new era. Still in the thirties, "Tracy" has some timeless quality as all good movies. I've lost track of how many times I've been watching "Tracy," and I still catch something new whenever I do. Others are all top-of-mind, Pacino's Big Boy Caprice recalls that he can make a comedy with the best of them), even Madonna's Breathless Mahoney is committed to acting in the right environment (GASP!). <br /> <br /> But there are still topics that touch on the need for a family, maintaining loyalty to oneself, good versus evil, and even looking at Machiavellian themes. Special for comic film, but hey, it works. Overall, "Dick Tracy" is a classic for herself. Compared to other films of this decade, it makes a strong statement. It's a good, strong film that does not depend on blood, violence, shame or nudity to make sense. <br /> <br /> There are some lessons to learn here. <br /> <br /> 10 stars. Great Scott!
