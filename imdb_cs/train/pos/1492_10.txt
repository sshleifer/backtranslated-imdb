Mukhsin is a beautiful film about the first love story. Everyone has probably one, and that's her story writer-director Yasmin Ahmad with a boy called Mukhsin. We know her films are semi-autobiographical, have scenes drawn on her personal experiences, and it's actually sharing and translating those emotions into a big screen, whose movies always radiate heartfelt sincerity and sincerity. Mukhsin is no different and probably the most reliable and reliable artillery work (although I have to add, as a personal bias, that Sepet still has a special place in my heart). Our favorite family is back - Pak Atan, Mak Inom, Orked and Kak Yam, although this time we return when Orked is 10 years old. The characters are younger from the films we've been traveling with, from Rabun to Gubru and here, Sharifah Amani sisters Sharifah Aryana and Sharifah Aleya take over the role of Orked and Mak Inom, respectively, which may have meant their excellent chemistry together on the screen, that they do not play sibling roles. The only constant seems to be Kak Yam, played Adibah Noor, and even Pak Atan has hair on his head! Through Mukshin, we come into the circle of characters and the world that Yasmin introduced us. We came to know and understand the family a little more, set up on the days when they still live in their campus (returned back in Rabun), where Orked attends Chinese school and packs a serious combination of strokes (and you are interested in the energy explosion in Gubra, , she had her since her youth!). Permanent enthusiastic and dull child of the family, preferring to play with boys in games, rather than an involuntary "massacre" with girls, and favorite trips include going with family for football matches. <br /> <br /> The arrival of a boy named Mukhsin (Mohd Syafie Naswip) in the village ensures that Orked can enjoy himself to sleep and do things - he walks through the villages, climbs trees, kites flying. And as what needs to be explored, crossing this line between friendship and romance, both beautiful emotions. Mukhsin has his irritated moments that animate the story and cause laughter, because some incidents would have happened to ourselves and sometimes served as a return to our own childhood memory. In short, those scenes shouted "fun"! We observe life in a typical campus, where some neighbors are very kind, while others, nasal parks, and wise men who spread bad gossip from envy. There are two other family dynamics seen, one of the immediate neighbor and the other of Mukhsin's own, both of which serve as adequate subplots, and contrast with Orked's. <br /> <br /> As always, Yasmin movies are filled with excellent music and for Mukhsin has something strange, the song "Hujan" written by her father, as well as "No Me Quitte Pas" appropriately used in the film Because of Yasmin's films are currently centered on the same characters, the beauty is that you can watch them as stand-alone or when they are watched and fit together, doing a surprising family drama that deals with separate themes and universal affairs such as interracial romance, love and forgiveness. Fans will surely see many references in Mukhsin back to earlier films, while the new audience will surely be curious to find some whys and the importance of repeating characters or events, like the hairy boy who steals views of Orked. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> I thought that as a story of childhood, remembered from memory, there are details that will surely be omitted. And gently, I felt that Mukhsin exhibited it perfectly, with less detailed details and focus on what can be remembered in the significant episodes between the two. Another highly recommended movie and a rare movie that I feel is suitable for all ages - bring your baby to your brother or sister!
