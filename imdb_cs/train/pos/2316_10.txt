I watched this movie randomly, wondering on a TV trailer. I like to discover such movies, tiny, gentle stories about ordinary people. Even when the end is tragic, "Man on the Moon" has several funny moments, especially at the first characterization of Dani, with her innocent and pure love of court. It's a beautiful, moving, love story with three highlights: Reese Witherspoon's performance, which has kept her promises in the world of cinemas, the fabulous cinematography of "old lion" Freddie Francis, and the fantastic score of James Newton Howard, who really is the soul of the movie. His motifs (which earned an Oscar nomination) are so intimate and lyrical that they seem to have translated the script into music.
