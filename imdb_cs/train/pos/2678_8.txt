Hey, I can not say I've seen all the movies of Jesse (Jesus) Franco, and it sure seems to be a lot of them, but it's one of the better (and louder) of the lot I've seen. I think it's very likely he was alright in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and everything I've done lately is a little strange and it takes a lot for me. Anyway, it's like one big blind dream, where it seems that its parts meet in different places. This woman is an actress, or something, performing at a theater in Berlin where acts of "fake" torture are taking place for a positive audience (?!) And this dream seems to be dreaming. Capturing what is real and what is not in this movie is probably a real thing in a sharp focus and things are not about a dream. It seems to exist in the deja vu state. I will not say it makes much sense, but it is quite weird and weird and fun. Berlin's images look like a lonely and haunted place, so it adds to the atmosphere. But the end is extremely sudden, the movie ends and the tape blackened, I do not think you need to tell you that it's over. My copy comes from the Euro-Trash collection in Anchor Bay and I say, give me more Euro-baskets, I can not get so much bullshit. But it's good bullshit.
