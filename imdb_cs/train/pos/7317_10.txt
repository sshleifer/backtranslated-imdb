It was a movie I've heard of all my life growing up, but never seen before. It's a really good reputation. I knew about Michael Myers, she saw the mask and saw the ads for all the sequels that followed. But I grew up over the decades when Jason and Freddy were deadly in horror, and they never really thought about what was going on in Halloween. Boy as I cheated with cheap knock off. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a really scary movie. Now, according to today's standards, it's not so graphic and visceral, but this film brings on all other levels most of the horror films today do not reach. The atmosphere created by John Carpenter is so scary, and the fact that it is located in a picturesque, middle-west city is proof of its abilities. Light effects are totally horrific and "Shape" seems to appear and disappear in shadow according to will. A simple but brutally effective musical score just increases the tension. The performances of all players are well done, with special nods by Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Mrs. Curtis is so good Laurie Strode because she is so kind and vulnerable. It's all the more scary when Michael Michael chases her because the director and the audience have invested so much in her, we want him to survive and run away. Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Loomis as a person on a mission, and it works well. It adds a sense of urgency to the situation in which the city finds itself, because it knows what evil is going down in the streets. <br /> <br /> Overall, Halloween is not only a great horror movie but also a great movie. Works at many levels and attracts audiences and never leaves. This should be standard viewing for anyone who wants to experience a really scary movie. And for even more terrible time, try to watch it alone with the lights turned off. Do not be surprised if you think you see the Shape hidden in the shadows!
