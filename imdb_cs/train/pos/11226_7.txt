Star Trek Hidden Frontier will surprise you in many ways. First of all, it's a fan-made series that is only available on the web, and it offers friends and neighbors who have computer programs and home video cameras and sewing machines, as Mickey & Judy once did, on show. It's definitely friends and neighbors, you can say it. Are many of these people not the most beautiful people you've ever seen, or the youngest or the thinnest? some of them hit their lines as if they were going to marble? some of them have strong accents, or they probably do not speak well first, so it's virtually impossible to understand the only one word they say. Yet you must admit that everything that friends and neighbors have brought together is really fun to watch. Yes, some of the dialogs are hokey. Yes, it's a bit weird (though a bit cold) when I look at two Starfleet men of kisses (although some of those kissing scenes seem to go on.) Yes, you shake a little when they clearly cite ST: TOS, TNG, other shows and movies, or when you hear the Galaxy Quest theme played at the beginning and end of each show. Good. We can get it. Why? Graphics are the first. Better than almost everything you saw. And sometimes, a show or two really stand out the story-wise? some of them are really real slz-jerkers. <br /> <br /> The concealed border is entirely a guilty pleasure in every sense of the word? but you have to give people who are involved in the credit where the credit is due. It takes a lot of effort to get that kind of production. People, files, costumes, graphics? it's a huge effort in many parts of people. We follow, we will go back and thank them.
