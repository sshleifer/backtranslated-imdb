It's a real shame that this spin-off television series inspired by the outstanding television images "The Night Stalker" and "The Night Strangler" lasted only one season and twenty episodes because at best this program offered a winning and very entertaining mix of sharp cynical (I have to love unconventional and original creatures in "The Spanish Moss Murders", "The Sentry" and "The Sentry" and "Horror in the Heights," plus you do not have to go wrong with such difficult experiments as zombies, vampires, werewolves and witches) (legendary motorcycle icon) William Smith has a rare chance to deal with the heroic leadership of "The Eater Eater, while other episodes feature great actors such as Keenan Wyn John Finger, John Dehner, Severn Darden and William Daniels in juicy roles), effective moments of true tension (especially the "Moss Murders Murders" was really painful), and the best one Darren McGavin seemed to be innocent, aggressive and exciting , but in principle a decent, courageous, and sincere little time reporter from Chicago, Illinois Carl Kolchak. <br /> <br /> Kolchak was the protagonist of all the 1970s, a smart and fast guy with a strong nose for a tasty hill and an unhappy affection to get into all sorts of trouble. Besides, sometimes humble Kolƒçak was nothing but superhuman; he usually either stumbled or stumbled upon escaping from a deadly threat, yet he had a certain inner strength and courage that allowed him to save human race over and over from all sorts of deadly enemy enemies. Kolkak was surrounded by a handful of pleasant secondary characters: Simon Oakland was perfect as Carl's chronically ill boss Tony Vincenzo, Jack Grinnage as furious by Ron Updyke for the ideal comic foil, Ruth McDevitt was simply gorgeous as sweet Miss Emily Cowles, and Carol Ann Susi was also a lot of fun as an eager newbie moniker Monique Marmelstein (who unfortunately disappeared after appearing only in three episodes). It was shown that the show suffers from faint make-up and special effects (the lycantrope in "The Werewolf" is unfortunately reminded of Yorkshire Terrier!) And the last episodes boasted with some ridiculously stupid monsters (Chopper motorcycle, Cathy Lee Crosby as Helen of Troy in the movie "The Killer Killer"), but even the second exhibition is redeemed by the trademark of the program with insignificant sardonic jokes and McGavin's unrestrained vitality and a remarkably outdated presence.
