Good action shows but nothing new. This was high in the mountains, showing some pretty scenery, and so on. One person is wearing a group of mercenaries, the leader is flying and he kicks his ass. It could be said that "Rambo goes to the rocky mountains" it was a pat. One very effective scene was in the first place a movie that made me horrified. It's not a bad picture, but the same ol 'same ol'.
