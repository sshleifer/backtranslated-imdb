Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy play in this "modern" musical, which performs MacDonald's comedy skills. The musical of the Surreal 1940s seems to be doing the 1940s fun, though they are in the current fashion. Costumes and eye-opening kits (yes B & W) add surreal, hazy quality to the whole movie. Several good songs revive the movie, with the number "Twinkle in Your Eye", which is the most significant, including the jitterbug entertainment number between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes. Also in the huge cast are Edward Everett Horton, Reginal Owen, Mona Maris, Douglas Dumbrille and Anne Jeffreys. It was also seen in the expanded parts of the bits are Esther Dale, Almira Sessions, Grace Hayle, Gertrude Hoffman, Rafael Ottiano, Odette Myrtile, Cecil Cunningham and many others. Very fun and nice to see the wonderful MacDonald in his jitterbug / vamp routines. She could do it all.
