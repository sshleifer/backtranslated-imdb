This particularity by Roman Polanski clearly shows where his interests were at the time he did. Polanski himself plays a shy man who rents a Paris apartment where the former tenant has committed suicide. She becomes obsessed with discovering what has led her to dress and transform events as they could develop. The film is disturbing and has the atmosphere of spooky fear Polanski stands out for, but too much is coming as a revival of "Rosemary's Child" and "The Resurrection," two more better Polanski films that deal with frightening events but with reflection ... I do not have much to read about in the film, I must believe that it was Polanksi's reaction to the feelings of persecution that he felt was marked as a sexual perverse and expelled from America. I do not make my own judgment anyway, but it is hard to deny the evidence about it in the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
