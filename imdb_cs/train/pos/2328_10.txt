Perfect movies are rare. Even my favorite films tend to have mistakes - the back window looks a bit scenic sometimes, the character of Chris Elliot in Groundhog Day does not work, the musical score in the best flight of our lives is too deep, the beginning of the Cabiria night is too slow - but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish. The script is great, the acting is excellent all around (though Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are amazing, all the cast shines), inspiring overhead and shooting, and music scores touching without (like some Miramax scores that are too manipulative). Every moment of sadness really moves, every light moment makes me laugh. This is really one of the best movies I've ever seen and I wish there were more films. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that Reese Witherspoon got to the star after this movie, but I'm sorry that her recent movies are much more abducting and stupid than this serious film that concerns real people, real feelings and real problems. Brilliant! You must see.
