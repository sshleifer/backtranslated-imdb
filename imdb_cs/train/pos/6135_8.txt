Bedknobs & Broomsticks is another of Disney's masterpieces. It was filmed with animation sequences and actresses and actresses who joined with animations. (A similar concept was used in Mary Poppins when children and Mary disappear into the work of the sidewalk.) I focus mainly on this film through the eyes of the baby because I have not seen it for years. At the time, it was one of my favorite films. It was magical and mystical, and the last scene (the conflict starting with the ghostly armor that went into the battle) was my favorite. There was also a lot of stop-animation used with spells (ie people turn into rabbits), which can be a little dated and stupid now. (I also think the movie is starting slowly.) The child's eyes are a fun movie that is easy for kids to get to the children's places. It's an imaginative film that is sadly for the most part forgotten today.
