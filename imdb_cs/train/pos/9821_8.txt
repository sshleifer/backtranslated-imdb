I saw this movie on True Movies (which I automatically skeptical), but in fact - it was good. Why? Not because of the amazing conspiracy plot or the delightful dialogue (which is scarce), but because, in fact, despite what people say, I thought the movie is accurate in that it's a display of teenagers dealing with pregnancy. Dawson Brook, they are not charming, cool, humorous figures that, through hopeless recollection, go back through sexuality. They are children and behave like children. <br /> <br /> They are dull, unpleasant and unpleasantly confused about everything. Yes, it could be a coincidence and they could be just bad actors, but I do not think. Dermot Mulroney gives (when he does not try to be cool) a very credible performance and I loved him for it. Patricia Arquette is cheeky and annoying, but she was pregnant and teenagers? The combination of these two substances is not exactly lavender on your pillows. The plot was very predictable, but what? I trusted them, their stress and their incompetence - their bold, but slightly misleading attempts to get them closer. I think the characters that someone else would do would be really annoying and incredible, but they were not. It reflects the surreality of the situation in which they are sitting in the classroom and going to the campus with the child. I felt for her because of it, I felt angry at him that I was a child and that I blamed her. I felt it all. <br /> <br /> I finally loved it and recommended it. <br /> <br /> Watch the scene where Dermot Mulroney runs from disastrous counseling - career performance.
