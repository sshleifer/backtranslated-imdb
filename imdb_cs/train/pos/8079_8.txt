A few reviews, so I thought I would add one. <br /> <br /> DO NOT USE OTHER REVIEWS! It was a great movie. RKS is one of the few Indian directors who can actually put together a really good film. AB and Akshay gave another example of great how bhoomics is doing, which was a little unexpected, but it was great to watch. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that there was not much hype around the issue. <br /> <br /> Or filmfare / other nominee prizes, considering how good the movie was. <br /> <br /> Better then Khakee I thought and I thought that Khakkee was also a good movie. It's a pretty long movie, but it's definitely worth it, and when you look at it, it definitely looks long. Cant wait for another movie RKS and other AB, Akshay movie they always look good together ... eg waqt. <br /> <br /> Bhoomika also behaved well in the film, and it would be good if she continued in the same way in the future.
