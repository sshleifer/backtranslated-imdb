When Alan Rudolf's "Breakfast of Champion" slips into theaters with a little fanfare and great enthusiasm, I think until 1996, when "Night Mother" Keith Gordon came out. Now that everyone talks about Kurt Vonnegut's "trouble-free," it's surprising to have two excellent cinematographic treatments (the second was "Slaughter House Five"). "Mother Night" is definitely one of the most underestimated films of the decade and I do not understand why. It's amazing! There is almost entirely faithful Vonnegut's book (without being compressed or too literary) and adds to it a poetry that is purely kinematic. How many film edits of some author's work can it say? Does Vonnegut even bring a portrait to the end of the movie and can you ask for a better confirmation? Not only is it a beautiful movie, it is a beautifully played, written and director film and it is one of my best five American films for the nineties. It's a sad, inspired, incredible masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected. I would like to frankly encourage someone to see Mother of the Night - and she will not even know Vonnegut's acquaintance to fully realize it (sometimes doing "Slaughter House Five"). It's a powerful, influential cinema.
