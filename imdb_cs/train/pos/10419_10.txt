I have to agree with MR. Caruso Jr Lanza was the best voice God had to offer if he could only find the courage to go for a broken break from Hollywood and head to the opera that could be American Caruso, everyone says he might be, but in any case he's a fantastic introduction to art, it has no bones about it, and if it is the way it will be. look at the film and see why Mr. Lanza is still debating in my house. Someone says that Pavarotti is saying MARIO LANZA. As for the movie itself, when it will be on DVD, it must have been restored and the VHS is not good enough, but this should also be the only Lanza movie on DVD, others are badly boring.
