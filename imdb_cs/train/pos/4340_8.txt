I like this movie, maybe because I did not see any reviews etc. It was wonderful and a little "romp". I do not know why it did not do more splash than that. As for the story, I can deal with some aspects of the character of Paul Reis and I could see my father in Falc's character. I had to remember a lot of past times when I was a child and I also listened to my grandparents. If you like movies like Grumpy Old Men or On Golden Pond, it's your movie. "Sleep" in my opinion and one of those feelings of good stories. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser had many great word blows, but nothing was exaggerated. I think it's at least 8 or maybe higher.
