I remember seeing this one when I was seven or eight. I had to find those characters because I left an impression in my mind that lasted long after the movie ended. And finally, now it's sad, well ... for a 7-8 year old baby. I had the opportunity to see this movie again recently and found that the plot was too easy. character, two-dimensional ... I think it's the movie that you can only with the innocence of a small child ... Damn ... I recommend this to all parents for young children ... (I saw it in my original French version, so I can not say whether the translation is good or not.)
