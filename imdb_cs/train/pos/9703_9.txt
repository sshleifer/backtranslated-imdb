One of the best comedy series ever released in Britain. Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are amazing actors and artists who think he's home with drama as well as comedy. With the support of their partner for writing Jeremy Dyson, they have a series of the most memorable characters in recent years. Little Britain gets rid of insignificance as a bad imitation of their thoughts. Consistently original and pioneering I'm sure so many people hate these series because they love them, but I'm also pretty sure nobody can have a LOG opinion. I've still seen a feature film, but I've heard good things and bad things, so I reserve a court. The original radio series from which LOG came in were as innovative as TV series. I do not know if the TV series came to the United States, but I would be fascinated when I found out how the American audience found strange English humor
