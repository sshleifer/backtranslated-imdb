It was said that Deanna Durbin invented teenage. This first film was one of the best. A humorous story introduced a beautiful 14-year-old Deanna, a small beauty with a beautiful voice, like "Miss Fixita" in a divorced family. You can find other IMDb records to summarize the plot, but quickly Deanna and her two older sisters are planning to go to America from Switzerland to prevent their father from marrying her again. With excellent support for casting especially Barbara Read and Nan Gray as sisters, good direction and editing, the movie succeeds in both the biased and the following views. Of the three songs Deanna is only "Il Bacio" from the classical repertoire, but when she sings her on the scene of the police, there is a place in the history of the film. At least it was for this spectator who was sad at age 15 to live with both Dean and classical music. One of the many nice touches that appear on the THREE SMART GIRLS is a brief look at the drunk who reached out to finally see Deanna as the cops bounce! One unfortunate result of the success of this film was that the followers of Durbin's vehicles became locked into the Miss Fixit theme, which quickly became obsolete. Deanna has never done it. Her character as an actress is more controversial than her charisma, of course. It seems to me that, like many other film personalities, "naturalness" will replace the histrionic ability she lacked. The film worked well for 21 feature films.
