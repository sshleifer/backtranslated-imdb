Okay, right, I saw the previews of this movie and I thought what the producers think? Hutton, Jolie and the Spirit? How could a monotonous actor likely compete with Jolie's natural power on the screen? But surprisingly, they both had such chemistry that showed intensive care without a kiss. Even David's humor matched Jol√≠k's spark and fire. As for Hutton, he played psycho very well, in contrast to David's quiet delivery of life-threatening situations. Overall, I was very interested in typing and character development. I gave her 8 stars.
