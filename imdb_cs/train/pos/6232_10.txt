One of the best films Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers. Great Irving Berlin music. Solid support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks and Astrid Allwyn. Amazing songs include "Let Yourself Go", "Let's Face the Music" and "Putting All My Eggs in One Basket." The last song will feature Astaire playing a jazz piano and then a cute dance with Rogers. Rogers also sings "Let Go" with Grable among backup singers. Harriet Nelson (then Hilliard) sings two nice songs and plays Rogers's mousy sister. "Get Thee Behind Me" is a song that keeps you on for days. She also sings "Where are you?" Fast and fast, this item in the Astaire-Rogers line is one of the better ones. The classic and amazing beautiful finale "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of the most famous of them. Rogers wears one of the big dresses in the history of the movie ... a glittering stitched figure that rotates around his legs when he's dancing (weighted hem) and is also easy to see. Just gorgeous. This is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters re-created in the Pennies from Heaven. Randolph Scott looks a special occasion as Astaire's friend, but he also appeared in their Robert with Irene Dunne. Fortunately, they are not trying to sing or dance. It seems that Grable and Ball would have a bigger part in 1936, but they have several scenes and have little influence. Allwyn has a bigger role, but she's fine. Rogers has one of the best solo numbers in the series "Let It Yourself Go" ... Jazz and Bum, it's a great song. /> <br /> Fun all the way, although I got tired after being punished by "We joined the Navy".
