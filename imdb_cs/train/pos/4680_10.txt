Terror film with a slightly slow start - give him a chance to start cooking. The story builds on interest and complexity. Characters and action underestimate expectations and clich√©s at all the right moments. Excellent locations in New York - huge, real - are a fantastic antidote to the business imperatives of "Sex in the City" - in fact, the entire film is an antidote to HBO / Hollywood in New York, sex and relationships. It is a precious film that treats the characters so sincerely and compassionately. MILOVAL TO! Great cast with notable performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson and her love interest (I forgot his name!).
