"Luzhin's Defense" is a movie worthwhile at no time. it's an embarrassing, intense movie, and I've kept my whole attention. John Turturro is absolutely amazing in the performance of a gentle eccentric chess grandmaster, and Emily Watson is magically binding as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected Russian family. Chroma between Watson and Turturrem on the screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story. Overall, this film is one of the best insights into Chess Grandmaster's life, and Turturro and Watson add to the film the whole non-mainstream non-clich√© feeling. Most people come out of the theatrical thinking and feeling that has somewhat touched this great look at the most unlikely stories of love.
