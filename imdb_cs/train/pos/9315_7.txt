Prominent lawyer Walter Pidgeon takes the pro bono murder, won the liberation, and finds out that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not only guilty, but part of the blackmailing ring that had reached the city's tallest stops. She is troubled by her own complicity, conducting an investigation, encountering the identity of an "unknown man" who runs the syndicate and murdering him. Ironically, he engages when Braselle is accused of this second murder, and Pidgeon has to defend him by pointing to the existence of another "unknown man" - alone. Although a slightly smaller urban song and long rhetoric, the Unknown Man belongs to the noir cycle of less style or structure than his recognition of the ubiquitous corruption of US urban politics that emerged in the postwar years.
