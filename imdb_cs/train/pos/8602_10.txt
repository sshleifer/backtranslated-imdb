One said when it comes to Nathaniel Hawthorne that his failures were more interesting than his achievements. I believe the same comment could fit into McDonald-Eddy's paintings. And especially this. <br /> <br /> It seems to have many features of an unsuccessful movie: is it a kitsch, a script for censorship, sounds inconsistent? Still, this film also gets some good points: Good Rodgers-Map ("I married an angel", "Tira tira tira la"), a good actress with E. E. Horton and Reginald Owen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you do not like it, you can not forget it. This strange movie in fact leaves a very strong, hazy impression, and it is very likely that you will remember days, maybe weeks. Why? In the 1930s and early 1940s movies did not have the same meaning as today: the goal, as a dream, is to avert the public to forget about the difficult reality. Of all the dream films that were made, at that time it is especially strong. <br /> <br /> In short, a better way to appreciate this movie is to watch it without thinking whether it's good or bad. Watch it as if you were watching the dream.
