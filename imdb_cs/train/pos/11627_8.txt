Lisa is a hotel manager or owner and gets on a flight to Miami. She ends up sitting next to a murderer named Jackson who tells her she has to leave the family room or her father dies. The reason he has to switch the room is because Jackson wants to explode. It's a great movie with tension because Lisa is trying to find several ways to avoid this idea that Jackson founded. The whole story is great and I thought they could spend the summer on the plane. It could have more airplanes, but the whole movie was quite good. I loved the end because it was heart-stopping. I did not know what was going on, and I was surprised. For me, this film has just begun.
