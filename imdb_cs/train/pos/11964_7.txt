This afternoon I went to the cinema and expected Scoop to cheat him. The film was happily overcome by expectation, at least a little. It's nothing heavy, nothing deep - and nowhere else than any real Allen's work - but it's also just as enjoyable as a light comedy. It's something so simple and sweet. "Cute" was the word I heard from people in the audience when they went after the show. He does not feel like Allen decides to create a masterpiece here, he feels he wants to make a little comedy and have fun with it. Compared to almost everything Hollywood produces, Allen tends to be enchanted. Even fluffy stuff. Nowadays, it's just refreshing to go into a movie created by a real human being.
