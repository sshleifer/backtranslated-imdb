Mirage (1990) is a very rare horror / chiller since 1990, released here in the UK on the label "New World Video". It is a desert horror movie about a group of young friends who are party at the weekend just to be killed one by one by the unknown power that drives a horrible black car !!! This movie has some scary scenes and some gore here and there, but I have to say that acting was so feeble, even at low budgets! But the movie was noticeably addictive and I liked it, and I never slept or did not turn on, which is always a good sign! I almost gave this movie 6/10, but when he saw the couple building a pair, he had some good moments of gore and tension, had some good nakedness and the fact that the blonde in the main female role was also hottie! I'll give it 7/10.
