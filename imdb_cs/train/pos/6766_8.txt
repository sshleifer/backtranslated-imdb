Perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of the criminal police films is Otto Preminger's "Where the Paths End", from the really great script Ben Hecht based on Frank Rosenberg's Night Scream ... <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is Sincere and Hard a policeman in New York who always has trouble with his superiors because he likes his methods of a strong arm just like he's annoying criminals ... When someone struck his joints hurt ... And the man he wants to hit is a smooth villain (Gary Merrill), which shows the title. "Why are you always trying to push me into the trough?" Andrews asks. "I have so much right on the sidewalk like you." Dana Andrew's obsession and neurosis are implanted into his hidden and painful discovery that he is the son of a thief ... His deep hatred for the criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them, and the persecution of justice became a private vendetta ... < <br /> <br /> According to the twist of irony unique to the film itself, Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney "Laura" are united again and Andrews is a few years later threatened by the same detective but is no longer romantic, dirty with his work, cheap cheaters. This time goes too far, and accidentally kills the suspect ... Killing is random, the victim worthless, yet it is a crime that knows he can break him or send him to prison ... Using his knowledge of the police process, he covers his role in crime, creating false traces and trying to involve the gang leader, but can not avoid investigating the case ... Double voltage what is bigger the thing to its conclusion without being involved in the murder is beautifully preserved and the final solution is logical, satisfying and in no way a compromise ... The film is one of the best detective films of the fifties, with curious moral values, also one of the best Preminger ... Preminger uses a powerful storyline technique, projected by the demanding camera angles and special bizarre experiences, its tension in realism ...
