I voted for this film 8 due to some minor childish flaws. In addition, this film is one of my favorite films! It's a little fun. Shooting scenes are ridiculous and I think Gackt (who wrote the book) takes a bit too much of his "Matrix obsession" into it. Their enemies are just standing ... waiting for them to be shot. But this movie is touching and always screaming. She has a lot of great humor, so it makes me laugh. Gackt is a great actor I have to say ... he shows so many emotions. This was Hyde for the first time and he did all right. His role corresponds to him. Wang Lee Hom is absolutely great. All the cast is what I would say perfect for this movie. DO NOT START! You will write it!
