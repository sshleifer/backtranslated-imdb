people claim they are humorous, but they have to significantly reduce their postproduction. I have Harry as a professor at ucsd, and frankly it's one of the best classes I've ever had, it's more fun than what happened when Harry was filming he's so animated. I originally watched the "joy of life" for another class where Harry made a voice in the movie and started watching this movie after I started the class. Harry originally did some powerful work, and he really is real in creating the moments that move you, especially when you have to re-edit things until you are at that moment, but something you see in this movie.
