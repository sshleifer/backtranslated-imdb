Well, I just found out that it was a more disgusting and shocking show than "Little Britain" and I like it! The League of Lords is a sick British comedy about the worst, crazier and disgusting little town in the UK. This place made by Dibles and Craggy Island (from "The Vicar of Dibley" and "Father Ted") seem normal! The format of the show is more like LITTLE Britain, except that it's all about the burghers of this hell city. Both shows represent the same skittles over and over again, and some of course inspired "Little Britain" (especially to sort skit). However, the exhibition differs, because although it is gross as "Little Britain" (therefore there is no show for children), the show has a sick and sadistic quality that distinguishes it from all these shows. Especially animal abuse and serial killing are recurring themes throughout the show. Now, if you have not guessed, it's not a show for kids, slightly offended or normal people, and that's probably the reason why I'm glad to get it. However, you really need very dense skin and love to terrible to enjoy it on max Funny and incredibly unjust belief - you have to see that you believe it.
