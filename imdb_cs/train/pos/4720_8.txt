Beautiful movie, especially if you love horses, World War II films and austere Hungarian platforms. The story of courage, compassion, and fidelity over generations. Riding is spectacular, just like the main character's horses in his own training. I buy this movie and watch it again. This is a family film and I recommend it very much. Good movie "Family Nite". Although there are some violent scenes, it was the Nazi occupation of Hungary. The parents were very interesting as they stood up, even in the face of a certain death from a Nazi officer who had his personal reasons for hunting Brady. A terribly beautiful movie.
