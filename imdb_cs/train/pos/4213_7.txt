Director Samuel Fuller creates a great visual arrangement: the cockpit handkerchief unconsciously picks up a microfilm from a woman's handbag; turned out to be a Communist courier, and is now being watched by a cop with a policeman. The Noir Formula film is its glory - before the ingredients become clich√©s - including the waterfront location, floats, saxophones on the soundtrack and one hell of a top combat game. Performances from Richard Widmark and Jean Peters are directly on the target, and the intelligent sharp screenplay is quite varied. Fabulous Thelma Ritter earned an Oscar nomination for his role as a "professional stool". Exciting, atmospheric, tough as nails. *** z ****
