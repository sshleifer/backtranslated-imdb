I admit that I have no idea what to expect before I look at this highly stylized piece. It could have been a cure for a zombie virus or a common cold for everything I knew. It began with large visuals, small snippets to capture your attention and cause your imagination to be wild. During that, I quickly learned what was going on. The nice little story of the neo noir I felt was not a passport for a few minutes of my time. The small footprints that viewers give viewers through visual views at the beginning give them a sense of success when they share the plot together. Along with a nice twist at the end of his cool package altogether. Score, though bad, gave the film almost a sense of music. It seemed to me a little late without adding anything to the next story. Some performances were too dramatic, but perfectly suited to the feeling of the whole. I'm leaving very happy. Within a short time I got a lot of information, but thanks to great editing and voice work, he did not feel rushed or pushed. Good work!
