When the first came, my father brought home - we were surprised - it was so different from what we had seen before. Last night I searched for a specific movie and I found again 'The Mind's Eye'. Box breaks and I'm surprised the tape is still working! Although it's not a good graphics Finding Nemo, it's still very good. They should sell it again - it's a landmark for computer animation. Highly recommended!
