This is really a great movie! I remember seeing it for the first time when I was really young and I watched her all the time once a week ... Shadow was my favorite character in the movie. Homeward Bound is really funny and it's really great to train animals to do all that stuff. The parts of the movie are sad (like when Sassy, ​​a cat, falls down the waterfall and when Shadow falls into a hole at the end.) I saw the second Homeward Bound, but I must say it's not as good as First. Shadow is smart, Sassy is, well, Sassy, ​​and Chance is a funny idiot. I recommend this film to everyone who likes comedy or talking animals. This is one of my ten most popular movies!
