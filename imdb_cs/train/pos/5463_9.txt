Very smooth, very pre-Hays code, and still very nasty. I would highly recommend seeing this movie, even if you are not a Stynwyck fan. It's funny, it's sexy, it's working hard - and it loves what it gets! Barbara Stynwyck is fantastic as a dozen smooth man who rises in the world, perfectly portrayed by the bank's building. John Wayne (in a suit!) She plays one of her first conquests. <br /> <br /> The last three minutes are disappointing, but the sets, the lines, the clothes all add to a heck of a vertical vertical climbing film in a horizontal position.
