Sarah Silverman is a totally manic Zooey Deschanel and I think I'm in love. Yeah, if you loved Jesus is Magic, you'll love it. If not, what's wrong with you? Kudos to the comedic channel to put it in my face. My life is finally meaningful and "your smell smells like a bitch" is my kind of humor. I'm a happy guy. The first episode was hysterical and hungry for the next week. It's like Grease meets South Park. Totally outrageous. Sarah Silverman is someone I could watch while reading the phone book. Her delivery is accurate and oh so funny. He will never jump. Think about it, it's not her choice of material. which is an exceptionally good thing by the way, because that's the way she decided to deliver it. Thank you, Sarah Silverman! Thank you, the comedy channel!
