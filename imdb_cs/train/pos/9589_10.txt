Growing up in NYC in the club scene of the late 80s and early 90s, I can personally say that this is one of the most important documents that covered at this time. No Madonna accepted the idea of ​​Voguing, but from there she managed to do it! Instead of persecuting each other's violence or fake cat fights, voguing allowed people to "fight" within the limits of all things that did not touch themselves (which would mean automatic disqualification). The vision of these exceptionally talented / well-organized "outings" in the clubs was nothing unbelievable, and all the great names of the day are here ... Pepper La Beija, Paris Duprée, Xtragavaganza etc ... all resembled similar songs like Malcom McLaren's song "Deep in Vogue "... it did not matter who you are or where you were from, because when you went through these doors to this" magic kingdom "you became part of something bigger than you were / you were important / and most importantly, creating your own moves and imagination ... and anyone from anywhere could become king (or queen). The words and the joke were as sharp as the movements on the floor. The film captures all the tension, excitement and spell of the very urban NYC energy. BRILLIANT!!! READ THE DVD for the world she sees! Thank you!
