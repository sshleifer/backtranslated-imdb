That's why historical / biographical films are all important to us all, moreover, when they are as good as this! <br /> <br /> Before I saw "Young Victoria," I knew a few things about Queen Victoria, but in the end I knew more about it. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is just as great as Victoria (who would have guessed it!) and she was probably nominated for this year's Oscar. I personally support it ... <br /> <br /> For technical issues, I'm glad it's a very successful production with a wonderful artistic direction / set of decorations and of course as if it was expected to be a great periodic costume design ! <br /> <br /> One drawback is that I want to see more and learn more about this interesting queen, but especially about an incredible woman and mother! <br /> <br /> BRAVO: 9 out of 10!
