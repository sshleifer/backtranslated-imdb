I first saw this version of "A Christmas Carol" when she first appeared on television. Actually, I expected the movie to be seen when it was advertised and more than met my expectations. Now I bought the DVD and I plan to watch it every year. With the exception of "It's a wonderful life," I consider this version of "Christmas Carols" to be one of the best Christmas movies ever to have. George C. Scott is an outstanding and excellent cast that led Roger Rees, surrounding him! Scott again proves to be one of the best actors of our time. Scott has artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and maintains a character unique to himself. How can anyone be remembered as Patton and Scrooge? Scott does it so easily. The direction is amazing with fine sets, costumes and music that give the film a special feeling of time, place, and era. You will just love this movie and place it among your favorite watching during the holidays.
