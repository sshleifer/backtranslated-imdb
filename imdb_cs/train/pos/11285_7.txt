Just like Tarzan the Monkey Man (1932), just more. There is more, more animals, more colorful African tribes and scenes in which the idea must be if it was good at three or four lions, forty would be better. Tarzan struggles with crocodiles - the crocodile spins in the water like a cylinder, around and around, the blades fall. Tarzan could kill him with his ubiquitous knife if the burnt saurian kept quiet. Tarzan kills lions and rhinoceros, and the number of animals is still increasing. His friends are real chimpanzees, people wear bigger monkeys and elephants. In fact, they use Indian elephants - much more friendly and training than African - with costume ears attached to their heads. Human Story: Another white man, worse than others, appears to join Holt to go to the ivory of the Elephant Cemetery. Tarzan does not show them the way, so the bad guy catches the elephant to follow him on his deadly bed. Tarzan is mediated and the bad guy shoots him, but of course he'll survive and come back to save Jane. Everyone else dies, Holt and the bad guy and every one of their "boys." People are consumed, especially Africans, and it seems that there are not many differences among black boys who are dying because they work for the white men who travel taboo and the black men who kill them. It must be the last movie of Tarzan before Hays's code caused her to wear more clothes. There are a number of underwater scenes in which Jane swims naked, and although the light flashes in motion and the flashes are very tempting. Apparently one of the Weismul friends from the Olympic swimming team did naked scenes, not Maureen O'Sullivan. She is, however, moving through a film that wears the same kind of lumbar wearing the Weismuller (plus bikini top) and shows a gorgeous flash of thigh and hip. They still do not have to talk much. They sleep together and come out with cold animals and stay away from the cities. No wonder they are happy.
