I'm Italian, and when I recently looked back on this film, I was surprised by his beauty: the first time I was 10 years old and I enjoyed it, but today I can appreciate it with adult minds and feelings. Now I can understand that it was the masterpiece of a special season of Italian film (Pasolini, etc.), which then disappeared. <br /> <br /> Hollywood epic films are good ... for fun. Perhaps this "Odyssey" does not have an English version because it's not fun enough ... it's not suitable for pop-maize and coke audiences. Whether it is appropriate for Homer Pathos and existentialist reflection. In Italy, a very good version of DVD: INTEGRAL with excellent colors has recently been released. You can find it in some shared files, but it's just Italian and untitled. Pity: the dialogues and voices of this movie are remarkable.
