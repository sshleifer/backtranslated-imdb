During the 1940s, when films touched on issues that were not yet acceptable in the "polite" society, they resorted to codes that were likely to float over the heads of most viewers while warning those who knew what it was. Probably no decade-long film has been so loaded as the strangely dark Desert Fury, located in a small oasis for gambling called Chuckawalla somewhere in the desert of California. The owner of the Purple Sage salon and casino is the stunning Mary Astor in trousers and a sports cigarette holder; into the city playing with a handful of his daughter, Lizabeth Scott, looking at Technicolor as $ 20 million. But listen to the dialogue between them, which suggests that the older lesbian and her young, restless companion (one can only wonder if the original scenario of A.I Bezzerid explicitly stated this relationship). Even more are John Hodiak as a gangster and Wendell Corey as his madly jealous torpedo. Add Burt Lancaster as City Sheriff, stirring and sit down. Both Lancaster and (surprisingly) Hodiak fall behind Scott. It seems, however, that Hodiak has not only had past Astor, but also a wife who died in suspicious circumstances. The desert sun warms up these ingredients until hard boil, with face-slappings of aplenty and empurpled exchanges. Do not stay behind this glass melody, full of fragile exotic flowers if it comes; it's a remarkable movie.
