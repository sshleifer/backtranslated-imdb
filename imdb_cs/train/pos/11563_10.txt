I have seen it many years after the TV series and I did not care for it at first. Then, as the memory of the series went with the passing of time, I looked again and found it totally cheerful. Based on Neil Simon's play, it was not "open" for the big screen and that's one of its strengths. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are brilliant as Oscar and Felix and the supporting cast are wonderful, especially John Fielder as "Vinnie". Even now some moments can make me laugh with tears - Felix interrupted the Oscar in the middle of the ball game with a request for dinner, Oscar jumped and chased Felix around the apartment, giggling "Pigeon Sisters" Felix took the stories of rage, and of course the legendary caf√© scene Torn off Nora Ephron's "When Harry met Sally"). Also a sharp dialogue. When the boys think that Felix has overdosed, Oscar says, "It could be vitamins! It could be the most just in the room!" Fantastic!
