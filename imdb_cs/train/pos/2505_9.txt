Many people see it as a fan of film because there are plenty of superstars in this movie (Gackt, Hyde and Wang Lee Hom are a very popular singer in Japan). But do not look at it before you look, that's what I say. Gackt and the staff are very serious when shooting this movie and they work so hard. It's a good movie with a little story inside. Several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad. They did it so well that I could not stop watching again. <br /> <br /> The story is quite good, but I admit that their behavior is a little disappointing. This is especially true for Hyde because his ability to act is under the other and is odd when he hears the way when he speaks a language other than his mother tongue (Japan). But it's understandable because it's the first time they behave in the movie. I think Gackt is trying to show us how someone can be so weak when they lose the most important person in their lives. When Toshi was killed when Shoah asked Kei to make Yi-Cheho a vampire like him because he would not allow him to die when Sho brother died, Kei Shoot Son dies and the best and the finest scene is, even I said that Hyde's skill is still weird but I give him two bumps up on that scene! <br /> <br /> It's time when it's going too fast as they did not tell the reason why Son can join the local mafia and be Sho's enemy because they're a good friend in the past and also the Son's Sho is a brother in law. Whether I love this movie ~ (very much ^ ^). <br /> <br /> This is an action movie with a moving beautiful story.
