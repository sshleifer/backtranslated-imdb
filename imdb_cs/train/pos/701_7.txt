I did not know what except, so I think it was much better that I did not make much of it. Do not get my bad, it's not a bad short movie. Tess Nanavati is a fairly new directer and writer, so I think he deserves a lot of kudos for this film. You can say it was love for her. Playing (except Dominic) is a little sweet and the quality of the movie is not great, but even for a really low budget. There were times when the story gets into a complicated state, and some parts are attracted, even though I do not feel it greatly aggravates my ability to understand the movie. If you love Dominic Monaghan just like me, I say, go ahead. The Gag Reel was fun, I did not mess it up, but there is a special scene that makes buying DVD worth it so you can watch it over and over again. If you like the movie then look at The Pink Mirror, the movie also made by Jagged Edge. I know Dominic fans will have this little piece of heaven.
