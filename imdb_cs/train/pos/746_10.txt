As I get to the "back side" 35, I find that I have been shaking my head more and more in sexual, drug-affected adolescents today. It was great to remember that it was just as crazy for me as it is today for teenagers. This movie drives this point home to the core. If you are a fan of the late 70s, you will love the movie. From the KISS posters to the angel's concert, this rock movie! <br /> <br /> Watch the young Laura Dern. Why did not they have more songs from Runaways that I never know? <br /> <br /> I had a problem with the character of Randy Quaid, who snorted a 16-year-old girl. While she was gone, she and her friends had parties that destroyed the house of dude. The cops will come and everything, but no mention of all juvenile drinking and how these kids get their hands on these things. Foxes are right there with Over the Edge, Fast Times, Dazed & Confused, and Kids as one of all-time teen angst flicks. I would say buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about it all.
