Anyone who saw this movie and viewed it badly, I would refer them to Roger Ebert's review of this film. He is one of the most respected critics in the industry and has given him 3Â½ stars. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie. Perhaps it is not perfect or spectacular, but I enjoyed it. Chorus Line is not a story because it's a group of stories about the lives of Broadway people. I read reviews where people said too much time was unnecessary for the romance between Zachem and Cassius. That's the wrong look. It's another story along with all the other stories that each of the people in Broadway finds out. What people do not realize is that those who are dancers at Broadway shows are going through the same things a normal person goes through. And that I think it's really the point of the whole performance. Imagine not only the talent of these special dancers, but give us some tangible things that we should think about in general. This is the study of life as a Broadway star. Anyone who dreams of becoming a Broadway star watches this film with a great emotional relationship because it has gone through exactly what characters are going through. <br /> <br /> It's a great musical. It has its slow points, and sometimes it's a bit of a story about moving some stories, but I've enjoyed it all. Look closer to the movie and then maybe you understand what I'm talking about.
