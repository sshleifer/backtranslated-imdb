First, the female leader is too wonderful to fail. Now actress Wang Zu Xian, who played Xiao Qian in the film, is 42 years old and well. It is always good to re-evaluate these famous times when you saw the old Hong Kong schools like this. The film is one of the most influential titles of the 1980s. Artistic decoration and other aesthetic aspects are charming. More fantastically, the film had black humorous undertones. It feels like a horror movie, but it's not a scare but a fun event. I had the experience of translating the second scenario "Chinese Ghotst Story," and I thought the script was a decent record. However, when I saw the movie, I was first disappointed by seeing a movie other than a script, as on a smaller scale and involving more comical roles. It turned out, however, that it was better done in terms of entertainment. If you've seen Lord of the Rings, you'll notice the similarity of this movie with LOTR. The climax is mirror Miranda Otto fighting Ring Witch. It is definitely a laugh. Bravo!
