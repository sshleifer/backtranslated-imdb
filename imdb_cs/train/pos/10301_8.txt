Bruce the Almighty, one of Carry's best shots since ... well ... long. It contains one of the most fun scenes I've ever seen ... Morgan Freeman plays God well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly entertaining. It contains one or two romantic moments that are a little boring, but mostly a great movie with several fun scenes. The best scene where Jim breaks the anchor voice. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
