This is a fan-short film that pretends to preview for a new movie that paired Batman and Superman! It's a kind of movie that fans adore and watch in places like ComicCon and was made by the same person who produced BATMAN: DEAD END, Sandy Collor. As for this movie, I can easily pick it apart. Make sure the CGI effects are not perfect and the costumes are far from perfect. But, it was done on a budget and for a fan movie it's incredible. I was especially impressed by a big fan of Superman - he was no smart boy! If it were a preview of a real movie, they'd have to check out Omaha to see them. Good work.
