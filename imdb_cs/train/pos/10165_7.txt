Actually, my voice is 7.5. After all, the movie was good, it has funny parts that deserve to see it, it is not the most funny film in the world, and it's not original, because its idea that we saw earlier movies but it has its own taste, my friend said it was a movie for lovers ... I think it's not exactly, but who cares about it? Also is another movie that shows us almost the same theme, Chris Rock appears in it, the name is Down on Earth, men that one is a very fun movie, see both if you want and I know you agree, Rock won with his movies. I would love to get Ashton Kutcher the protagonist of a male character, but the film is good.
