Before you look, make sure you saw the Night of the Living Dead ... This could be the best 7 minute parody I've ever seen! Absurd, dirty "special effects" (rope, rope !!!) and handling slices of bread ... what more do you need ??? (You do not watch this movie while eating bread ... you can scare it!)
