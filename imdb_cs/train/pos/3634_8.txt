I had few expectations for this movie, but I was looking for something that would not be for the evening. I came out of the theater completely delighted and a little surprised. This is a very fine baseball tribute movie and a nice lesson about watching your dreams. Dennis Quaid has a masterpiece role and I touched his performance. It is definitely worth the full price and a few hours of your time!
