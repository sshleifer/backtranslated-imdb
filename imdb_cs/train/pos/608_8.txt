When I saw this movie, I was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea. Especially romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> I rarely knew I was going through cinematic magic. Everything in the movie from the screenplay to the dialogue to the effects was very close to perfection. Claire Danes shines like a star in the movie. From the beginning to the end you fall more and more into love with this character. Michelle Pfeiffer is terrible as the wicked witch who is about to capture the star for eternal youth and beauty. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is a nice character who gives the audience the greatest comic relief when the film gets the impulse to climax. Overall, it was a movie that surprised me and delighted as a film fan. If you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that will be fun for kids and adults, Stardust is the right way.
