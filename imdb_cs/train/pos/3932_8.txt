In the same melody as his American drummer on Mohawk, John Ford portrays American history in a way that is fictitious but still very credible. Henry Fonda created three consecutive films at this time with Ford and all three are a time and place with an emphasis on the environment and the cultural environment. In Mohawk, the pioneer of America is in full bloom with Americans who defend themselves against Indians and other forces. Here Ford shows us American America from the 19th century. when the invention and creativity began to appear, and this nation really became great. Among all of this, he was a tall, sly, young lawyer from Illinois named Abe Lincoln, and this film fictifies his life as a lawyer, predicting the size he would later achieve. Fonda is excellent in this film, capturing the essence of what is considered to be Lincoln's personality, though no one knows exactly what it was then. Sets and support also work well and provide a unique balance in the scenic Ford American Dream and its many forms. It is not a movie that should be taken literally, but rather symbolically, to show that Lincoln really warmed up for the events in his life that should have made his link. We even have some scenes between him and young Mary Todd; and it's hard to see how they ended up together, but that's no reason. I think it's just a homage to the size of Lincoln, widely regarded as the greatest American president. His silent and straightforward behavior was rare and would be today. Of course, our government needs more men like him.
