Forget about Neo and Bourne and all the half-compilers make up the modern heroes. They look only twelve years old to please a wide audience of geeks who want to be their heroes. Since they can not be Rambo or McClane or even Indiana Jones, Hollywood has allowed a lot of fake frogs who have no beard and still meet teenagers wanting to see something that looks more like an action movie. "action set-pieces" are just the pain to watch and each girl can question their masculinity without a doubt. This explains the resurrection of the old people on our silver screens over the last few years. For better (Rocky, Rambo) or even worse (Die Hard 4 - where John McClane, the backrest himself ... did not have a beard !!) I say it's a long time when a new hero appears and their government ends. This "Largo Winch" is far from perfect and perhaps too predictable, but at least Tomer Sisley has delivered a very promising performance as an action hero. And the only time he was weakened is when Melanie Thierry shaved his chin! I repeat my case. I did not know when I entered the theater room, but it could be a movie I've been waiting for for decades. For the first time in France since Belmondo, the film can be well-engineered and rooted in genre B without worsening its performance. Meanwhile, we had to chew either a gigantic pile of manure or something too limited to get to a wider audience ... In other words, it was "Le Pacte des Loups" or "Doberman" (I love the dobermana) ... I believe "Largo Winch" has what it means to be a popular and quality film.
