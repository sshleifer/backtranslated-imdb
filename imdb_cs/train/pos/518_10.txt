Also known as "Stairway to Heaven" in the US. During the Second World War, British Peter Carter (David Niven) shot down but survived. He meets and falls in love with the beautiful June (Kim Hunter). But it seems that a mistake has been made in heaven - he should have died! The French spirit comes to him, but he refuses. Soon he will have to defend his case before the Heavenly Tribunal to have the opportunity to live. It sounds ridiculous, but it's really incredible movie. The scenario is good with actors who play the role quite straight and are beautifully overhead - scenes on Earth are breathtaking Technicolor (I have never seen such beautiful blue skies) and the scenes in the sky are black and white! Niven is a bit stiff, but Hunter is great (and very beautiful) and Roger Livesey is great as a doctor trying to help Niven. The pictures are amazing (especially the stairs and during the final test sequence) and the special effects are really great (given the age of the film). There's also a very strange sequence when Niven gets into a totally naked young boy who acts like a sheep! This is a very beautiful movie with the idea of ​​provocation - we highly recommend it. This is unknown in the US, which is a shame.
