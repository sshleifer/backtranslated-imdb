I really loved it even when reading reviews it was quite disturbing to me .. But as an anime art fan I can fully understand this perfect artwork, even though some of them were against my culture and believe .. But hey, it's the art world .. !! the beginning of the film is very strong, strange and confusing. It's hard to understand the content that brings me to the respect of who did it. Only someone who is extremely open can do such a courageous movie ... it is not absolutely for the kids .. even though the characters are cute and adorable, but they go through some disturbing adventures that can not be erased (sorry if the spelling is wrong) from memoirs.
