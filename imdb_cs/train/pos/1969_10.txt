Frankly, I do not understand why this movie was such a big flop in publicity. Sharon Stone certainly has not lost any charisma and "touch" from "Basic instinct". I voted this movie 10 and I'll tell you why: The game opens this time in London. London is the city from where Catherine Tramell moved from BI1 events. Again he proves to be the manipulative leader of his own class - dissatisfied. She's "bending my brain" like Catherine with such a skill that in the end you are not quite sure who a real villain is. As for the technical part of the film: Only the real decline is the B-rate crew. Sharon Stone is the only really big name of the cast compared to her and Michael Douglas etc. In the first part. I also think BI2 would be better if Sharon Stone was a little younger, but she's still pretty awesome in her looks and improved only in her charisma. Her "assistants" in the "B" area are not that bad, though I would like some bigger names to be cast. I think there are relatively good improvements in the basic conspiracy. I think it's a much better thriller than many of the Hollywood bulls that are easy to divide these days. The plot is great, it is technically easy to see it; in the middle of the movie you are not snoring and the most important - the moon is on.
