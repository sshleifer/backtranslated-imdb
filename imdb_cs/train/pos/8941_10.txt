I loved watching this movie about Delana's sisters. I knew about them, but that was all. This film has opened my eyes to their bravado and courage. What a couple. What sacrifices they made to live according to their own conditions. It's not just a film for Afro-Americans, but for all Americans. It is a historical lesson and a documentary film in one and combines with a fun film biography. The effects were superior to everyone, and we really saw how these two sisters have lived for many years. Both sisters differ considerably from one another. They came from a very nice and very strict family with a high, perhaps even impossible, level of perfection. It is sad to see Sadie's father refusing to allow his daughter to continue seeing her friend because of possible misunderstandings. I strongly recommend this movie and I'm glad I caught it on TV the next day.
