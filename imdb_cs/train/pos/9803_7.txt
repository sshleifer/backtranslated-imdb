This Batman movie is not as good as Batman's Mask The Phantasm and Batman and Mr. Freeze subzero But it's still a good installment for Batman cartoons I say it's as good as Batman Beyond The Movie. This movie is good for the same reasons The story is good not as good as the other but it is still pretty good that it has a lot of action in it Cartoon effects are good The voice of actors is really good like Kevin Conroy as Batman / Bruce Wayne, Tara Strong such as Barbra Gordon, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Eli Marienthal as Robin. The villains are good, such as Kyra Sedgwick as Batwoman, David Ogden Stiers as Pequin, Hector Elizondo as Bane. So I'm sure you will not be disappointed with batman Batman. So make sure you borrow or buy Batman Mystery of the Batwoman because it's really good. Total score: ******* from ********* * <br /> <br /> *** from *****
