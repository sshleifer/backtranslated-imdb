The advent of age films is common today. For the 1980, "Foxes" really gives meaning. Jodie Foster plays his character straight out. Since she has done "Taxi Driver" four years ago, she has a stronger character in this film. It's Jeanie, a high school girl who has a lot of courage and seems to be getting away from any situation he's in. Scott Baio plays Brada before Chachim on Happy Days. He is considered immature by other girls. Cherie Currie is Annie, hanging with the wrong crowd, persecuted by her father's cop. Jeanie and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move to a rented house where the party gets rid of it completely. Exploring life on the other side of the tracks can be fun or dangerous. Annie is rescued by Jean and Brad all the time when she is unnecessary. Reality went back hard when she was killed in a car accident. And one married a much older man. Growing is not easy, sometimes we have to explore life as it is. In fact, you need to be careful about the people around you. For me, I was my own person and I tend to stay that way! Great music, great plot, this movie is a jewel! 4 of 5 stars!
