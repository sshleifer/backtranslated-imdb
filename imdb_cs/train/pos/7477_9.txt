This movie is made up of such great emotions, thanks to the excellent soundtrack that matches the movie. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm for making movies and having fun. This movie was not the best when I watched it for the first time, but about three more times I decided it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It takes place in New York and continues with its lifestyle. In his life he discovers a delimit with his girlfriend (Diaz). He goes through the state of depression and then comes out of fantasy. This movie was beyond my expectations and is one of the best movies at Cruise ever!
