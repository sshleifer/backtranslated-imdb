The combination of gorgeous black and white photographs and the "Eugene Onegin twisted" inscription made it a real elimination. The atmosphere created mostly by dark shades contrasted with occasional, very bright, overexposed whites. There was a great moment where banners - a seemingly conventional holiday, but where actors' faces revealed the character and situation gently but instantly - were shown accompanied by Lensky's heart-poisoning arias from Tschaikowsky's opera Eugene Onegin. <br /> <br /> For me, it is a sign of a good film that it should take advantage of the opportunities presented by this medium, which means that the story is often less important than the picture and atmosphere - last year in Marianske Lazne is a good example of such a film. Krisana is in the same form.
