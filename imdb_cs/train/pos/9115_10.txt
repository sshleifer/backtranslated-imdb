The idea is a very short film with lots of information. Interesting, entertaining and leaving the viewer to want more. The producer created a short film of excellent quality that can not be compared to any other short film I've seen. I've rated this movie to the highest possible rating. I also recommend that this be shown to office managers and entrepreneurs in every establishment. This is the fact that people with ideas are never listened, their voice is never heard. This is a lesson that can be done by any office that wants to move forward. I hope that production will create the second part of this "idea". I look forward to watching the sequence. Again, congratulations to Halaqah media to create a high-quality, high-quality movie with a memory.
