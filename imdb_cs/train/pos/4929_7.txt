I can not really condemn the movie because it works. There is plenty of movie noir that is considered a movie noir, but I think it's just in the category. <br /> <br /> There is nothing ominous in this work, and that's where noir elements fail. Certainly, the illness can be considered ominous, but I find it hard to see. The film suggests on the dark side: Blackie may be human trafficking, the police in New Orleans are just too willing to arrest the reporter, the ghost epidemic hangs over all the people in the movie ... but they are really just No attempt to question the motivation of Reed, like about Marlowe or Spade, or about trying to bring the human side to Blackie, which would despise him even more if human trafficking was actually revealed. <br /> <br /> This lack of depth is what ultimately the film fails. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, the acting is good, the writing and the direction are well done ... but there is nothing to return this film over and over again. It's worth watching it once, maybe twice, if you do not remember it years ago, and then postpone it.
