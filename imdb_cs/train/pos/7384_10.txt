Whoopi was the only reason I saw the Oscars that year. She is cheerful. Of course, there was a big, serious party on the show. She was great not only because she was funny but because she said a few things to say in a public forum. White people need to recall that the Hollywood Prize "ceremonies, employment, and representation are of racial equilibrium." There should be no need for "black" appreciation: white guys, baby nominees and judges need to bring their heads to the sun and see that great material is not limited to "White" directors, producers, actors, etc. Allowing Woody Allen to be in the air was the depth of bad taste, there was no business, the fact that this was the first Oscar-show I watched since "The Purple Color" was This punishment of voting has made me worse when I watched the show until 2002. It is not upset by other speakers Billy Crystal is a turmoil.
