"Most of us at least live in two worlds, a real world where we are at the mercy of the circumstances and the world inside, unconscious, a safe place where we can escape ..." With these words Mr. Gone introduces the world "Maxx", a fascinating world , where fantasy and reality are combined. Inspired by Sam Kieth's comic book, "Maxx" is very faithful to the material, inspired not only by the story but also by the graphic style that looked like a comic book, giving this show unreal and unique looks. But also a story that is interesting and fun. It might be too strange in moments, but when you get inside, it's hard to get out of it. The story and characters are beautifully developed. The music goes perfectly with the style of the show and gives her the right atmosphere. Unfortunately, like many good animated shows, this was short. "Maxx" must be seen. It's one of my favorite times.
