One of the first best musicals, Anchors Aweigh, features several unforgettable musical sequences such as Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse, Kelly dancing with Sharon McManus, Sinatra singing with Jose Iturbi on piano, Kathryn Grayson singing with Iturbi, and much more. Technicolor is perfect with some innovative cameras, such as viewing the piano played underneath it, transparent keys and Grayson singing, which is seen through another camera's viewer. The story is thin but engage with the enthusiasm of Kelly and Sinatra. Sailor is on vacation, has to take home a boy who escapes (Dean Stockwell) and Sinatra falls for his aunt. To build him with aunt (Grayson), Kelly suggests that Sinatra be auditioned with Jose Iturbi. But Sinatra is young and naive in this and in her own singing she falls in love too fast. While attempting to contact Iturbi, which is never available, he begins to fall into another girl (Barbara Britton); but Kelly is already down with Grayson. The Aweigh anchors most often remember the combination of live action and cartoons with Tom and Jerry, but there's still a lot more to look at. I'm giving nine stars because when it's not as good as the best musical - Singin 'In The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma - it's one of the first of their Techicolor major productions (perhaps Meet Me In St. Louis was the first) most others.
