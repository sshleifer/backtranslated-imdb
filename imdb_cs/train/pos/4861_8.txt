Joan Fontaine is a "damsel in distress" in this musical musical film in 1937, where they play Fred Astaire, George Burns and Gracie Allen. Conspiracy, what is it, is a British woman (Fontaine) in love with America that was wrong with the star of musical comedies Astaire. The film, directed by George Stevens, contains some great music Gershwin, including "Nice work if you can you get" and "Day hmlistého".

Burns plays over the top publisher, and Allen is Burns' secretary. She is cheerful. The problem, as stressed by others, is Fontaine, who is dancing with Astaire at the end of the film. Stevens could easily be double, because dance show in a long shot and runs between trees. I would have thought it was double, except that the dance was so bad. It is certainly worth seeing despite its shortcomings.
