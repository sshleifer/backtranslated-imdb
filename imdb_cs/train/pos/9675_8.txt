Most people could say that if you should spend a Saturday night watching a movie, you really need to get bored. Actually, I just came home to get out and turn on the TV and there it was, "Paulie." <br /> <br /> I missed the opening credits so I did not know his name, but I saw that it was Cheech Marin, so I naturally thought I was tuned to "Born In East L.A." When I saw him talking to a talking parrot, I was ready to reject this fact like the flop movie that they show late at night. Fortunately, it was better. As you know, if you have not lost Paulie before, he tried to return to the original owner. It seems that it takes years to find her. Paulie's advantage should in fact be a disadvantage. People meet a literate parrot and all they see is a way to make money or benefit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> While Cheech Marin's Character '' Makes Money From It, Dance sequence with parrots are something the kids find cute, I find them fun. Paulie, who is naive, learns quickly that not all people are nice people. Especially the owner of the research lab on animals. The man is indifferent when he tells him he can help find his owner until he helps him in research into animal communication. Paulie is now stuck, but he decides to make a fool of that man in demonstrating Paulie's other vocal skills. Throughout the film, Paulie tells his story about the equipment that eventually free him, several other animals, and finds the location of Paulie's owner. It's a moving reunion. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, the curve clipping scene should be assumed and not shown. This part might bother younger children. Otherwise it is a great movie for older children and adults who are at the heart of a child. (END)
