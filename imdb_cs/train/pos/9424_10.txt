For me, it's the most perfect film Ealing Studio - as fresh and relevant half a century later, as it was the day he was released. As a satire about economic ideas about "growth" and the business need of in-built obsolescence, it would hardly be up-to-the-minute. And from what other film can we say that the hero literally wears the land? Particular, there are parallels with the Jurassic Park, where the confusion with the environment literally turns and bites you. But Spielberg departed from the brilliant central mood of the book to join some nonsense about "children." Hmmm. In a man in a white suit, Alec Guiness plays an ideal young scientist who comes with a fabric that is never dirty and never exhausted. Suddenly, workers and capital in the northern English mill where they work, united like never before in protecting their livelihoods. Of course, it's Ealing, it's a comedy, but it does not have to be. A Comprehensive Constellation of Interests (if it suits it?) It plays beautifully, as each and every party realizes that "progress" is a threat and that it is incompetence and waste. /> Yes, it's a comedy - though a top - and between political ironies there are excellent performances and some good old-fashioned laughter knocks. However, it's a biting satire it takes - dazzling and white.
