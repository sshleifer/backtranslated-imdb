In 1993, with the success of the first season of the Batman: Animated Series, Warner Brothers commissioned a hit-show team to produce a feature film originally designed for Direct-to-Video but encountered a theatrical status. It would become known as Batman: a fantasy mask. Ten years after Phantasm, we have released three more feature films from WB, Sub-Zero, Return of the Joker, and now Mystery Batwoman is added to the family. <br /> <br /> The plot is basic and in many ways resembles Mask Phantasm: The new woman vigilante modeling after Batman began targeting the operation controlled by Gotham crowd boss Rupert Thorne and Oswald Cobblepot AKA penguin. Batman must try to uncover the mystery of Batwoman before crossing the border. Animation is a sleeker, futuristic style that was used for the Batman: Fifth and Sixth Season Animated Series (AKA New Adventures Batman). , it's pretty done and just as elegant as the animation returns Joker. There is also some use of CGI, but it is less important compared to the surplus it in Sub-Zero. The music was fine. Different and exotic and similar Justice League scores, though the points at the point where the old animated Batman theme appears, will certainly send waves of nostalgia through the heart-shaped rodents of older fans. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy, as always, does a great job like Bruce Wayne and Batman. It's also great to have old Batman: Graduates of the Animated Series; which includes Bob Hastings (Commissioner Gordon), Robert Costanzo (Detective Bullock), Tara Strong (Barbara Gordon / Batgirl, her comrades suggest a romantic relationship between her and Bruce, who was mentioned in Batman Beyond) and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. Alfred). <br /> <br /> The villains were also great - especially since Rupert Thorne, the old mob star of the original series, first appeared since the fourth season. <br /> <br /> Overall, although it has not yet reached the standard of the Phantasm Mask ten years ago, MOTB carries a flashlight rather nicely for animated films Batman. And if you have a DVD and you are a hardcore fan, you'll love a five-minute short Chase Me.
