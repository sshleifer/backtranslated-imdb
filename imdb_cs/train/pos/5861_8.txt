Overall, I agree with Ebert's review. In a sense, I feel like I should not even comment because it's such a movie of a vet and I'm not a vet (I was a resist). The mistake is that Martha is poorly developed and does not do well. My guess is that Stephen Metcalfe is a vet himself and spends too little time planning on her figure.
