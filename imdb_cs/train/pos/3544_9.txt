Boys and dolls must be one of my favorite musical films at all. It's a very fun movie you can watch and no more. it embodies what people forgot about musicals - musicals were made to have fun, not to preach. We currently have Rent and Chicago, which are great musicals and good movies, but they can not bring us fun without the strings attached. The only thing that worried me in the movie was Marlon Brando, the guy can not sing! It was very uncomfortable to listen to him singing and talking when I could not understand him. If Marlon did not do that, it would be 10 stars. Boys and dolls provide an old-fashioned entertainment that we rarely get these days. See that you have a good time!
