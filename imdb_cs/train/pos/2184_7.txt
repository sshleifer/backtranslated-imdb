While the pleasant musical that caught me with this film was an unexpected comedy chemistry between Basel Rathbon, composer and Oscar Levan as his assistant. He plays a tall stringed, scattered artistic type (far from his more familiar roles as threatening villains or coldly logical Sherlock Holmes), Rathbone's character looks as if he could not find his way out of bed without help. And this help is Starbuck, he played with the usual humor of Oscar Levante. When recruiting Crosby as a ghost writer, Rathbone meets Starbuck by saying, "He's doing everything he thinks about me." Which Levant replied, "Oh, it's just part time work." Of course, this is the past (or more) Rathbone, who is too busy to ask where his next hit song comes from. As another reviewer said, who knew Rathbone could be so funny! It was a shame he had no more opportunity to show his comedic talent.
