A pretty good picture of the wrong person being in the wrong place. If a murderer wanted to kill a lady, why not just make it out of her and let the cops try to figure it out? Involving all these characters in the conspiracy is dangerous, not to mention all the mouths that you have to worry about keeping them closed. Why did a depressed lady step into the bar when she barely sat down on a chair or said a word? Are there really police officers who are wise cracked, friable gums, strangling apes, who are approaching suspects in such a way? It probably played well before the bike was invented, but today it is so nasty and unbelievable. Catch maniacal break from Elisha Cook; his frenetic hammer never fit into the recording. His crazy expressions on his face were improved to synchronize the lever.
