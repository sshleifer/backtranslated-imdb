When I saw the movie, I was really shocked when I discovered what was around the 1960s. I know I can be wrong with some things, but it seemed that the 1960s really had an effect on the people of that time. Some people said they wanted to go back to the 1960s. From what I saw, I would say yes, and not for the result. But that is my opinion.
