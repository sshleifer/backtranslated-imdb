I'm glad to see this movie when he saw some other director's films in the past. I thought the production values ​​were great as costumes and bridge settings. It was interesting to see how the spirit and demons were treated. I agree with some other comments on combat scenes. It was difficult to watch at times. <br /> <br /> Finally, a moral story. It would be interesting to know what some Japanese viewers thought about the film. It's a movie I want to see again. Some scenes, such as those where Benkai and the Prince fought at the "psychic" level, were well done. <br /> <br /> I came out of the cinematography of what just happened. Intensive.
