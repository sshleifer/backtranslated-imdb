I must admit that at first I did not expect anything good. I just expected it to be a cheesy film promoting Gackt's and Hyde's performance, but I'd like to say he has a lot more. <br /> <br /> Yes, the acting is not so great, but it does not succumb to each of them being well disciplined and bringing enough strength to their characters. The effects lack consistency, but the action scenes are satisfactory enough. What really impressed me was the essence of the story, even if it blends fantastic elements, but it also shows a rough reality. Developing the characters, their doubts and their feelings really got to me and I think that's the key to this film. This brings you to thinking and transmits well. <br /> <br /> Meets any expectations for a good run. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.
