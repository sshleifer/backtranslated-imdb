Pakeezah has a very interesting history (which is well documented in the section "Trivia") about how it was. It seems as though fate has conspired to test Kamal Amrohi (the director) and at the same time secretly longed to see him complete his masterpiece. Pakeezah travels to metaphors, poetry and visual explanation. As a result, the intensity with which emotions come out reaches a dimension that may not be too real, but is very effective and leaves the viewer behind. Meena Kumari lives the tragedy of Nargis and Sahib Jaan her own. Other film stars include Ghulam Mohammed (music director), Lata Mangeshkar, Naushad (background score) and Joseph Wirsching (d.o.p). Their music and cinematography leave the spell bound. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is a classic in world cinema. It reveals new layers every time you watch. Kamal Amrohi is one of the rare poets of the cinema and left us all the gift.
