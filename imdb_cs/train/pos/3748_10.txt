I've been watching a lot of time and I'm planning to buy the full function. I love the comedy of Jason Steele. It is very different and unique and is very pleasant. I like indie movies and this is just great. The story is weird but very fun. This short film is about talking Spatula named Edward. The sequence of events is a bit mixed, so this movie is very interesting. At first you can see that Edward is fighting spoon, but then the focus will change to earlier in his life. This is a silly movie, but of course it's great. I strongly recommend watching this movie at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. It's very funny. Humor does not have to match everyone's tastes, but they also follow. It will take only 16 minutes of time and it's free. GO WATCH SPATULA MADNESS!
