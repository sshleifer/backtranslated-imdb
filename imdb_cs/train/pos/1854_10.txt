After I developed the critical eye for the film and the love of good cinema, I went to look at Antwon Fisher with my breathing symbolically held. While I'm a flimsy fan of Denzel Washington - both his skills as an actor and his public persona; I'm an honest fan who admitted (very few) times when he did not make a mark in a movie or two. And I can be wrong - after all, I'm not an actor. But it was different - Denzel would put his career experience into a movie that deals with one of the most sensitive topics known to man - and child abuse. As his directorial debut, no less. And develop the film to show that it will successfully present a man's triumph. I did not want to be disappointed. And I was not. What I saw was a promise film that combined a diverse audience and gave the inexperienced viewer a short, but true eye to the life of a young man whose childhood was hell of hell but who despite all the triumphs. This movie did it - and it proved the dry eye of any color in the theater. Does anyone want to know the topics in this movie to know when the truth is presented. It requires a talented filmmaker to convince the story when you have not experienced it. And if he can continue to draw audiences and cause the audience to react emotionally without compassion, the filmmaker has done his job. In every movie. Black, white, purple or polka dotted. That's what makes a good cinema. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and above all Antwone Fisher - you've really won.
