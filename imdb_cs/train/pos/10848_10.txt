Heads, Hands, and Feet - A group of the past, as well as Strange Fruit. There is a triple whammy. Those who said they did not like this movie are either bloodless or younger than 40, and they have no real experience. Sad for them. This is a painfully crafted little picture, which is a great way to walk an hour or two and probably will not disappear at the second show. Stephen Rae, Timothy Spall as a fat drum (and in many ways the most beautiful character of all) and Bill Nighy - a new name for me - as a neurotic singer and front man all turn to super performances and Juliet Aubrey is beautiful to do something sharp got Karen, who is trying to keep the band together when they are overwhelmingly destroyed. The echoes of Syd Barrett / Brian Wilson are loud and clear, Mott the Hoople rises up once in all of his bloody ridicule and the script is never more than a minute. Do not compare it with a spine tap or Rutlemi or Full Monty - it's unjust for everyone. The closest comparison is the Commitment, and that is not a bad thing. And every movie that can bring memories of Blodwyn Pig - a band I do not remember never see, but the name lives - well, it shows that someone in the team knew what it was about. <br /> Little pleasure and thanks for memory. Oh ... and I have one more - Stiff Little Fingers; and what about SteelEYE Span ... Haunted TOOTH ... That Inch NAILS someone? (You have to see the movie or you were on your way)
