For a long time, it seemed that all good Canadian actors were heading south of the border and I (guessed) that all other players filled the top slots and left the remnants of sexual comedies. <br /> <br /> This movie was a real surprise: although the actors seemed to be trying to put something into their characters and the viewers who came back were almost a true hold of faith. When the musical video accessories attacked the evacuation police, you almost believed it was possible. If you are a fan of some better sex factions (Canadian or not), you should definitely look for this out. And a great surprise, this sexual farce is also filled with some very good nudity.
