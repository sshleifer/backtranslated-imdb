I think part of why this movie was made ... and it's aimed at players who really play all computer games Nancy Drew. Recently, a lot of video-based movies have appeared, and I think in one of them. <br /> <br /> So this movie does not follow any book. But it moves through parts of the games. I buy and play all Nancy Drew games as soon as it comes out. And the games are from HerInteractive and are for "girls who are not afraid of mice!" And some of these games have been awarded the Golds Awards for Parents. They are not only entertaining, but you can actually learn during the game by two or two. <br /> <br /> I took two of my children who hid with me to see and love it! 10 years. old started playing her first game Nancy Drew the day before I took her to watch the movie and she had so much fun playing the game, I thought she would like the movie. And I was right ... she not only loved the movie, but she could not wait to come home to finish her first game and start another. My next step daughter is only 7 and she also loved the movie, but she is still small enough for the young to play still, but she enjoys watching her sister's play at times just to see what's going on. Games are designed for children 10 years and older. All games will usually get nice descending reviews and are classified as adventure games. For more information on games, check out HerInterative games Nancy Drew. So I personally thought the movie was pretty good and I would buy it when it came out on DVD.
