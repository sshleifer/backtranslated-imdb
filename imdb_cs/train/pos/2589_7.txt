Brothers with psycho-kinetic powers (yes, really) a duel, not only because of Debra Winger's affection, but really over the secrets from childhood, which left them in conflict with their powers. <br /> <br /> There are unreal touches (the fire brigade acts as a singing Greek choir), but also humor, joke and romance. The soundtrack is also great. Just like the way an American werewolf in London used every great Wolf song they could get, but with fire and I do not think I'll ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), set up your own rockin 'too' lady trailer <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> I love the movie (I ordered a DVD from the USA) and if comments written by such people who would be happier with Legally Blond 3, do not do it, try :)
