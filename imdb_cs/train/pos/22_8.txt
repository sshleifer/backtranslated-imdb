If you are walking through horrible singing, you will find a classic fairytale underneath. Christopher Walken is very funny and surprisingly good in the role. His stylish acting style works well for the irritated Puss in Boots. The other actors are good for their parts. I have not found any of those who make it terribly fake or unpleasant. Especially the king seems like a real dune and I wonder if he should be. I can not remember the original story. Special effects are typical for the 1980s, but at least not too fake as some of the computer-generated tariffs we see today. Overall, I recommend this movie for children and adults who are the heart of a child.
