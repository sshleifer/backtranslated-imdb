Esther Williams gets her first MGM post, where she plays a role and gets a good start. This movie is a great entertainment experience with a mature theme that would be repeated in the future a million times more - an innocent girl pursued a haunted woman's hatred. Esther looks great, and if she wanted to, she could probably go further and better, but according to her autobiography, she almost gave up work for marriage. Either way, she's so kind and cute that her fun is seeing her in a completely different role outside the "swimming musical". Universal was fabulous for making films with former MGM stars after the studio began to drop its biggest names when it started sliding down the hill. Stars like Lana Turner, June Allyson and others have become the first quality movies at Universal, as of course they still have power on the box office. I wish Esther did more, but since she did not do it, it's one more thing.
