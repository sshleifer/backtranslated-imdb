And I totally adore Isabelle Blais !!! In this movie she was so cute and was distinctly different from her role in Quebec-Montreal, where she was more like a man-eater. I think she should be nominated for Jutra. I think Syvlie Moreau was good, but Isabelle was much better, IMO. Pelletier first made a great job, and I noticed that he had a few friends from Rock et Belles Oreilles, Guy A. LePage and Andre Ducharme. It was fun to see them in this, I did not know you were about to discover. I do not think I saw a romantic comedy from Quebec that I did not like, and this is as good as anyone I enjoyed seeing. And if you're in the state and wondering how you can get a copy of the DVD, www.archambault.ca has delivered it to me in less than a week.
