It was a surprise. . . the impact and resolute of this film had on my automatic way of reactivity to people and situations. The most agonizing was the excitement of emotional anger. Just as the way a corrupt child would react to not getting it. . ... I think I was hiding this anger from the others, it was the most exasperated farce of all. What did it cost me? So much love. . .cooo many blessings. Now I am present, how she feels incredibly humiliating, and still has a gratitude for life. . for what is happening in the moment, without my wildly anticipated life being a strange way, as I think life or people should be. This film has contributed to the freedom I now feel connected with others, without any restrictions or expectations. . . and connect with true love. . without fear of losing. . . First love the first and accept what love is given.
