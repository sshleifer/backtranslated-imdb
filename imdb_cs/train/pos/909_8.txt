I like these movies. It's another Yash Paradise movie that you know will look good on the screen, all the characters are always nice or very nice, with one exception that you know will eventually hide that is nice ... Another rule of Yash Paradise is that either hero or hero; s have only one or no parent. Think back to all these films .. MPK Suman did not have a mother, HMAPK Salman did not have parents, and the FINAL rule is that you have 90% probability that Alock Nath will cry ... <br /> <br /> The film is also good . It's initially a little slow, but it's fun. There is almost no comedy, but it often smiles. The little kid (nephew of the hero) is well placed and gives a very good one pad. The actress is very pretty, but shy that you would not get it in real life. this film does not have a massive fortune in the BIG house family, which I was a good idea for making the film different from other films. At the end of the film, many women will cry. There is not a strong message from this movie, but its good watch. If you're married (organized marriage), the movie reminds you of what you've been through. And if you are not, it informs you and can scare you ... <br /> <br /> Overall, a very good looking movie. No large plots or curves, but a very fine film very similar to the classic Bollywood.
