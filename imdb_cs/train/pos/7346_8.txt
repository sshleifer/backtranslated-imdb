When I first saw this animation (maybe 15 years old), I was really impressed! It has a completely different style compared to Japanese animation and I like it a bit. The whole impression of the movie is more sinister and darker ... The colors are not so ... colorful. Characters do not speak much, it's not long and boring conversations about it and that (as in Ghost in the Shell). With his dark pictures, the look of a weird animal and a sense of spell, it looks like one of those old Scandinavian stories full of violence and scary creators, magical forests and deep caves that lived with dragons, trolls, orcs ... and a mysterious hero, who stopped the evil ...
