I had only a few problems with this movie, and I heard a lot of criticism that it was too long and overvalued. It is true that it's over three hours, but I was surprised that it was so fast. I do not think it is overestimated, I think the IMDb rating is absolutely decent. The film looks great, with great costumes and great effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely drops out of focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack and Kate Winslet is as beautiful as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. The story is very rich in details and is hot for personality development, obvious with a love story that moves greatly when it has to be, although in the first step the film is a little slow. The last hour is tremendously riveting and I confess I was on the edge of my seat when Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. James Horner's music score was beautiful, though I've never been a huge fan of My Heart Go On. The miniseries of 1996 were good, but suffered from unveraged scenarios and historical inaccuracies. Overall I gave Titanic 8.5 / 10. Bethany Cox.
