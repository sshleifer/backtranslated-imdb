Simply put, Oliver! is one of the greatest musicals of all time. It is full of unforgettable songs - "Food Glorious Food", "Oliver!", "Consider Yourself" and "Oom-Pah-Pah" to name just a few - and remembering characters. <br /> <br /> The film is a musical adaptation of the classic novel by Charles Dickens and like Oliver Twist, it is a perfect family film. There are some scary moments - villain Bill Sykes played by Oliver Reed is pretty horrible in himself - but overall, the film will appeal to children of all ages as well as adults. The story - which almost everyone is surely familiar with - turns around a little orphaned boy Oliver and his life growing up in London. Initially, he lives in the lab with the remnants of his other orphans, but after a bold question by Mr. Bumble, a warden, he is sold to the family as a servant. After a series of accidents he managed to get into the role - and through him, the greedy Fagin (Ron Moody), who trains young boys to pick the pocket treasures he keeps for himself. <br /> <br /> The film was shot exclusively in studios and studios at Shepperton Film Studios, but that does not even concern the film. The sets are perfectly replicated by Victorian London, as well as costumes worn by characters. The Oscars, a multiple winner, and a huge success when it's released, Oliver! is a good candidate for the best musical all the time and will delight anyone who loves the film.
