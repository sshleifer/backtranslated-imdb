Some critics consider this film to be bleak, but for me there was enough good humor and optimism to overcome this impression. For example, the quietly positive and stoic character of the daughter is still the center of the film, which often balances the unfortunate aspects of setting up and plotting. The film is full of original ideas and characters, and the end result is unpredictable: I felt it could happen anyway. <br /> <br /> By the way, many reviews I've read mention about the effective use of black and white, but the print I've seen on the SBS television network here in Australia was in full color. <br /> <br />
