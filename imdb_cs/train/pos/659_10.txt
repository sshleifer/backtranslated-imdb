One of the latest classics of the French New Wave. Jean-Eustache's cinematographer drew on cinematography of the early century; for the story, Eustache drew out the torture of his complicated love life. There are many things to say about this movie - remarkably brilliant; suicidal excessively; occasionally cheerful; emotional discharge ... etc. etc. In my opinion, any complaints that can be directed against this film are easily overshadowed by its many strengths. Every film student, writer, or just anyone who is willing to handle a 3-hour film without sudden cuts, playing music, no plot like a soap opera, and no banal dialogue should not mean that the movie should be seen. Everything is to be admired: writing (brief, smart, surprisingly funny), acting (everybody is perfect in their respective roles) and simple direction (the viewer feels like a casual observer in the movie) that makes the movie unforgettable. It's undoubtedly the movie that stays with you.
