This smooth and delicate film constantly adds. It's one of Frankenheimer's best and most underestimated films, and it's probably the best adaptation of Elmore Leonard (and if you scratch your head, she was thinking, "but I loved GET SHORTY" you have to be hit in the face). In my opinion, no one feels that Leonard's characters are better than John Glover at 52 PICK-UP. Moving the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) highlights the story's blunt factor at amazing heights. Be a man, have a couple of beers and watch this movie. For reference purposes, my favorite books are Leonard: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval and 52 Pick-Up. Among my favorite films Frankenheimer are SECONDS and MANCHURIAN CANDIDATES. I also have a real special place in my cool, film heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday.
