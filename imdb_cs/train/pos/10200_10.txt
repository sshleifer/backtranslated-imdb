All I hear about is how bad the animation is doing. Maybe it's not the same as what everyone expects, but look at that. Would you expect perfection in hell? It is my belief that the animation was destroyed and settled. It was great to see her character transformation in this movie, as it would probably be as close to the live action as we ever have. I hope it will continue very soon. If we want to live, I think we could be better with Chastity or Purgatori. I do not think that Lady would move to the movie. But as much as possible, it is my personal conviction that all the fools about this film are bad. No word toy was determined
