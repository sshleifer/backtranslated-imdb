Why can not these directors create horror movies like "The Shining" these days? There is an easy answer: modern directors are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick once and forever with this film was one of the greatest directors and authors of all time. So it's pretty simple. A man named Jack Torrance (brilliantly played by Jack Nicholson) and his family are moving into a large, light hotel that gets to know them off season. Kicker is that the previous hotel manager brutally murdered his wife and two girls. What follows is best summarized by the name of the movie, but you have to look at it to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie in a very long time that I think is "terrifying". These are some serious things, but well. One of the things that adds to the fear factor is amazing music. Music was the masterpiece of Kubrick's films (2001: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a few) and certainly does not disappoint. Score sets the tone completely and the movie will not be the same. Finally, I have to comment on Nicholson's legendary performance. Jack is terribly convincing as a mad killer. In fact, only his view steals several scenes of this film. This is the top acting that must be seen to believe. There will never be a horror movie that totally matches this. R.I.P. Stanley.
