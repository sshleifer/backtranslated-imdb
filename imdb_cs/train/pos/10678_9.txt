One of the seventies comedies. It also has the best signature song of any comedy show. The story is about three companies that share housing over their owners George and Mildred. The comedy is based on a mix of shared people. Man and two women. Richard O 'Sullivan is besotted with Paula Wilcox. She plays it softly and not ridiculously, which is why this show has been so successful. Scenarios and stars have always done the best, and Richard's frustrated love life has witnessed a relaxed spell. The final titles included visual jokes that were unnoticed at the beginning of the 1970s, but related to living arrangements.
