Before it was lost, everything was predictable on the TV. You could predict who is dying or who finds something, but in Lost you could predict NEVER. Every thing was so surprisingly stunning, and it was really a secret, not because it had so many secrets, but because it was nothing like everything so big. I literally joined him. LOST is a classic artwork. It gives you something you enjoy every week. It's genius. The surrounding area is brilliant, it is calm and warm on the beach and so frightening in the jungle. The characters are the work of the genius, each of them, especially those who are already on the island. Warriors are so dramatic, but we can never predict their death because they have much more work and much more to say, and they have secrets that affect other wreckage people who die with them.
