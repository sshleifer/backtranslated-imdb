Although this series only ran the season, she stayed with me for 20 years. It was far from my favorite cartoon at all. I give almost anything to be on DVD or any format I can get. If you find a way to see this series, I recommend you make full use of it. This series was the first (in my opinion) that had a truly coherent story that stretched over several episodes. I also really cared about the characters and what happened to them. Shit character The house has sometimes scared me. It was strange then. Also, the group leader reminds me of a lot of Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones. If someone has any way to contact the creator / rights holder on the series and can get them on DVD, please please!
