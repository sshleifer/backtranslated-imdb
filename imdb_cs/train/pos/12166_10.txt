A very strange and convincing film. This is a very uncomfortable and hard-hitting man who tries to go through his life as a fundraiser / door-to-door salesman. The director was able to capture a very disturbing tone that really served the story well. The original and disturbing and at the same time find a lot of humor in the pain that accompanies life. There is a sequence in the test device that actually came up and made me laugh out loud, which is not something I do as often as I should. One of those unforgettable movies I've long seen. I did not leave my mind and look forward to Bronstein's future efforts. Fantastic performances all around. Simple line "I really appreciate." is now iconic to me.
