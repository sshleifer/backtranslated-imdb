This is a vital giallo, representing all the aspects that fans of the genre have known and loved. Twisty plot, beautiful girls, black gloves, sharp blade and a little gore all together to make one heck out of a piece of Italian exploitation. <br /> <br /> The gialli favorite group, both before and behind the camera, work to make this one of the best non-Argento gialli around. There is the above-mentioned Martino adds his touches as a director, giallo great Ernesto Gastaldi as a writer, Bruno Nicolai creating music, and a number of giallo stars and starlets, such as George Hilton, the character of actor Luigi Pistilli, and attracted Anita Strindberg. <br /> <br /> With all these talents behind Scorpion? You bet. The film works on many different levels. It's an exciting mysterious mystery, a tense and violent horror movie and a thriller thriller. Everything in all the best gialli around. <br /> <br /> Martino definitely knows what fans want in terms of gialli. At some points in the film, it almost seems to bring Argento into his approach. For example, there is a direct reflection of a scene in Bird with a Crystal Feather, where the killer tries to break the door, which actually overcomes the Argenta flash. <br /> <br /> Are there any movement problems? Hmmm ... just a little. First, all scenes that do not lead to murders or upcoming romance between the two people start bored. But just before you fall asleep, the assassin will get out of nothing and you will immediately return to the swing of things. Also to the end, the twists are a bit too bizarre. I mean, what purpose did the pin pins actually serve? If you do not pay attention to dialogue, you could easily lose yourself by twisting, weaving things. But these little things aside, La Coda Dello Scorpione is tense, tense, elegant and all around a giallo fan movie. Search!
