I was from the beginning to the end. Great horror comes from disturbing images and organic shocks that are created so they do not have to jump, but to make you "what do I see?" All the other commentators provided brief summaries of what the film is, and so I will not say what has already been said. I told other people about this movie the days I saw it just because it was haunting me horribly. I even had a bad dream when I saw it, and I'm a real horror fan who is not as frightened as "The Grudge" or "Silent Hill." What made me sick dreams was the restlessness I felt about what I would do if I were in that cell with those boys. What would be my personal horror? my subconscious took me there and it was not pleasant. That my friends are a good scare for you. The best part of this movie is that it's fine. It's not about Bogeymen who jumps on you, a foreign invasion, or a lot of gore. It's the opposite. The horror you create in your own mind. The irony for the four characters is that horror does not come from the outside power that claims power over them. Men simply ask for one thing they want, and they will understand ... but not as they imagined. So, on the one hand, they get what they want from the occult book, but in the end they may wish they were not. Sometimes locked in prison is the best place!
