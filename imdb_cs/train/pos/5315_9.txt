This movie was very, very strange and very, very entertaining. All actors are quite real and very strange. The overall "look" of the film was also different, a kind of dreamy and faded, which only added to the cosmic, humorous, weird vibration of the whole thing. It's not for everyone, I guess it's not what you would call "mainstream," but I liked it. It's something I've never seen before. . . unpredictable, with a strange rhythm and punch lines in the most strange places. Children are so heart-creating (and pimply) that you can not help them. In other words, these are far from "hollywoodized" versions of teenagers. <br /> <br /> Everything that makes me a good thing.
