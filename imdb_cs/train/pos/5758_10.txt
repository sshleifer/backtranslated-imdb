In my opinion, it is one of the best action films of the 1970s. Not only is he equipped with great occupancy but is also loaded with wild shots and explosions that are still impressive. The story is about a Vietnamese veterinarian (Kris Kristofferson) hired by his brother (Jan-Michael Vincent) to help clean up a criminal in a small town and what happens when Kris begins to use his position and becomes as bad as the criminals have been hired to get rid of them. It's great that Kris plays against the type. Bernadette Peeters and Victoria Principal both offer great support as the ladies of two male stars. Jan-Michael shows real characters of movie stars in this movie. I do not think Vigilante Force is on the video but occasionally appears on television. It's a great movie for boys who like movies.
