I just watched it for the first time for a long time - I forgot how imaginary the pictures are and how funny it is. But I did not forget the opening scenes that are (with the Candlelight Club scene in Waterloo Bridge) among the most romantic movies ever shot. Anyone interested in politics or history will love movies, anyone who is interested in romance will be Hunter-Niven, and anyone who loves visual imagery will enjoy the image of domination. My favorite movie remains "Odd Man Out" this is excellent. <br /> <br />
