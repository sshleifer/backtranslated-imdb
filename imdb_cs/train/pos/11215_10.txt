For the first time, I watched Walking Tall movies when I was about 8 years old and I thought that both Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a great job because they had to watch the movies so I was trying to find out about the real Sheriff Buford Pusser, how can I? All three parts of the movie made me freeze and Buford Pusser was a real hero, I just wished he was alive today and that there were more people like him. I would like to thank him for getting rid of all the crime and being so brave. I am very sorry that his family must go through such horror and pain. My heart is going. So, from a 30-year-old Sheriff Pusser fan and three-part Walking Tall movies and actors who portrayed him, please do not hesitate with these films and actors, just trying to tell us what a beautiful person the real Buford Pusser was and what a great family. And to all the young people who have not heard much about Buford, I suggest that you watch the Walking Tall movies and learn more about it.
