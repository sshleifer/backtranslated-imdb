When I saw this film in the 1950s, I wanted to be a scientist. Science was something magical and useful. I took a friend and saw it a second time. I do not think she was as impressed as I am! This movie was comical but serious, at a time when synthetic fibers were rather new. Lessons from this film could be applied to questions about today's GM experiments.
