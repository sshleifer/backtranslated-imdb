RUNNING MAN, along with TOTAL RECALL, is my favorite film, Schwarzenegger. No, that's not 2001, but it's not like that. And the acting and screenplay is not even on the same level as other Arnie films such as PREDATOR or THE TERMINATOR. But I think IDEA behind this film is one of the best movies ever to hit a big screen. A state sponsored game show where criminals are convicted of serious crimes against "heroic" stalkers armed with all weapons (runners do not have any) to satisfy the public desire for sport and blood. Final prize for winning runner: Freedom. Or, they say the rules. <br /> <br /> There is really much to say in a movie with such mortal death and unicorn scenes. Someone else pointed to all the comments about the culture / government that was presented in this film, so we will not go into that. Just when you say that if you can look at what seems stupidly stupid, you can really enjoy it (especially if you are a fan of SF with great imagination). Like me, I tried to be a serious artistic film, but surprisingly layered for the 1980s. The assumption is borrowed from the short novel Richard Bachman (aka Stephen King), but it differs rather heavily from its starting material, especially towards the end. (The book ends somewhat nihilistically, no need to say that this film is not.) I liked both of them, but I like the movie better. My favorite line: "I guess it's caused by steroids."
