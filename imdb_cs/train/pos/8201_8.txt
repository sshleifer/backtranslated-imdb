Sudden impacts are considered Eastwood's artistic failure in his career when he earned a good reputation as a director. The reason is not the film itself, but the attitude that requires vigilance that it seems to support. In some places it actually owes more than Death Wish than the original movie Dirty Harry. One could argue if this is the case - at the end of the day, it's a film about guilt, justice, and indemnity. For me, at the end of the day, more empathy than compassion. However, given these arguments, it is easy to see that the sudden impact is a terribly well filmed movie. Forget about "Go to punk, do your scene for the day", it's iconic but not original. But take a look at the views of San Francisco, taken from the air and approaching the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular. Or take a look at the wonderfully created scene where Sondra Locke visits her mentally ill sister in the hospital. Eastwood makes great use of face comparisons. So everyone in all sudden bumps is a very visual film that really shows how adult Eastwood is as a director. And if I remember correctly, it was the first time Eastwood had been on the screen, though in the action film debatable ideology. I also think it's the first well-known Eastwood movie. Although Eastwood has a huge talent as a director, dramaturgy has always been his weak point (see Misty Play for me, Breezy, etc.). The space of narration leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the film and not distracting the story. The only thing that is really uncomfortable is the farting dog.
