This is an early movie "Pilot" for the Canadian TV show Trailer Park Boys. It was played with managers in several networks before Showcase decided to sign them for a TV series. A great actress and very funny cast make this one of the best movie comedies. The film plot is that these two little criminals walk around to "exterminate" domestic animals for money. If you have a dog next to you, barking all night, these are the boys you go with! But they get into trouble when they hit a job that is too big to cope with them and end up in the shootout. Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the TV series. I highly recommend it! R rated for swearing, violence, and drug use. Its too unpleasant (they do not really mean killing animals)
