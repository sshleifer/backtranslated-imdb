Bourne Ultimatum is the third and final trip for spy Jason Bourney, a man who has to kill the people who have made him a killer. The Bourne series is one of the most critical trilogies of criticism (Ultimatum has 85/100 on metacritic.com, which means it's a "universal recognition" status) and for good reason - the fight is very well choreographed and the deep story can be very <br /> <br /> First of all, I highly recommend that you look at The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, two preliminary headlines called Ultimatum. There may be three different movies, but in fact they are the sequel to the other: the missing one leaves you stuck and confused as much as I was. But you will be on the way to enjoy the action and fight the Ultimatum scenes if you skipped the first two, but then the story will be surely lead to some confusion. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you were so lucky to have seen the antecedents of this movie, you were probably interested in watching Bourne take off his enemies and track down a man who discouraged him from superiority. Jason Bourne plays very well with Matt? "Damon." Damon did nothing that would deserve an Oscar to nurse his work here is good enough to own it. Bourne adventures take place in many cities; cities are so diverse that the film may not be decent at times. The Bourne Watching Agency uses all the technology tools known to humanity to keep track of it. <br /> <br /> I will not go into the details of the characters because they are a sequel from the first two films. However, it would not hurt the movie to explain a few things to the audience - not every viewer is a haunted filmmaker who can pick up every little hint of story development. Ultimatum would not be damaged if the story was a bit more. It seems that most people agree that Ultimatum was the success of the film: the film opened at $ 69 million, and box office total is now up to $ 216 million - is currently working very hard on a movie that was in theaters from 3 August. It's the best action movie I've ever seen from live free or die. /> Good) Damon is a solid but not spectacular, very clever film bad) The story is like many other
