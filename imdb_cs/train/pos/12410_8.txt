This is an excellent example of what can be done with a small budget. Acting is excellent for the script and the whole atmosphere of the film is very predictable. Gore is well made and used gently (beware of the excellent barbed wire death) and the action is steep in use. It is true that in the script are sometimes boring lines, but compared to other films in the same (or larger!) Budget, it is invisible at all. Overall, it is recommended. Believe me, it's better than it seems! 8/10
