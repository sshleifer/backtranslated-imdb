Do you know how fans of Star Trek clustered in all Star Trek movies, even those really bad? Why? See their heroes in action once more. That's the way I feel about Doc Savage. I'm the main fanatic for this character, and the prospect of seeing Doc and his crew in the adventure was stunning. And the first 20 minutes of the movie just increased this sense of expectation. Then they decided to make elements from a series of doctoral adventures and throw them into this film, which would result in a rather incoherent film. There are lots of promises, diluted by a series of unfortunate decisions (music, "camp" elements, etc.). But the Spirit of Doce is there, and that is what those of us who are familiar with Doce and his crew. So in my long way of trying to say, it's not a bad movie: it's not as good as it should be. And anyone who is a fan of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai and many other personalities should check this movie just to get to know the hero that inspired them all.
