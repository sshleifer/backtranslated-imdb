The title is onomatopoeic, the sound of the tram on the tracks. That is metaphorical all that people who live in the dump can not have. The craving of these people is illustrated by the passing of the tram, which represents a relatively incomprehensible rich middle-class life. The patho of the little boy and his beloved but sad father is the most touching. It was the first Kurosawa color film and used beautiful shocking colors, colors seen only in dreams. The film is unreal and surpasses beauty. Compassion for humanity is a fascinating force, but as always, Kurosawa focuses on capturing the beauty of the film. It's a masterpiece of genius cinema.
