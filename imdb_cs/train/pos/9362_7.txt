Greetings again from the darkness. How rare is the film to examine the lost soul of men in pain. Adam Sandler performs as Charlie, a man who has lost his family in a September 11 tragedy, and has since lost his career, his reason to live, and probably his common sense. Don Cheadle works as Sandler's former roommate from a dental school who seems to have a perfect life (Sandler had apparently before 9/11). Of course, parallels in these men's lives are obvious, but it's really refreshing to see the feelings of men on the screen in the movie ... other feelings than lust and revenge, that's it. Watch how they really help each other by being painful and hearty. Writer / director Mike Binder ("The Upside of Anger" and Sandler's accountant in this film) actually brings the film a different look. Some scenes do not work as well as others, but overall they are well written and fixed. Sandler and Cheadle are both excellent. Sandler's character reminds a bit of his outstanding performance in "Punch Drunk Love", but it brings much more depth here. Cheadle is always fine and does a good job of expressing the burden he carries ... just by looking at him to work with the puzzle. Supporting work is outstanding Jada Pinkett Smith (as Cheadle's wife), Liv Tyler (as a very patient psychiatrist), Saffron Burrows (in a strangely attractive role), Donald Sutherland as an irritated judge and Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein as Sandlerin in-laws. The film really touches the tragic events of that day that hit one man so deeply that he was basically destroyed. In addition to an interesting story and some great NYC footage, you have to love any movie that contains vocals from Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey ... as well as Eddie Vedder, who stars as Daltrey. It's not exactly an amazing optimistic movie, but it's a quality movie with an unusual story.
