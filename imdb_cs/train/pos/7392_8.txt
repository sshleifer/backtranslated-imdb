I like this movie a lot. He has a great hemisphere among the actors and tells a story that is quite universal, the story of a crazy son. An aspect I like best was the way the spa house was more than a background for the story. As the father told his son's wife's family story in the northern desert porcelain, the element of water and bathing became an almost sacred ritual. The water was so rare that the simple bath had a deep depth and meaning. Overall, the film was very effective. There were times when she threw herself on "too" sweet ... bordering on cloying during the scenes scene in the park. Overall, however, I highly recommend this movie.
