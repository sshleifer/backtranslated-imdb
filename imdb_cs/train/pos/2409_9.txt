This film has problems with its presentation, it may even be offensive to people looking for time and cultural loyalty, but calls on the observer to think about a whole range of questions. One is the nature and character of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Another is the historical nature of the Bible and the Faith. And thirdly, it is Jesus' humanity. The tension of the Christ-traitor relationship develops and maintains in the film. Judas's passion is presented as darker in parallel with Christ. When Judas takes his own life, the audience can feel anxious. Peter's denial and guilt, however moving, are not so strongly portrayed as the Judas drama. Chris Sarandon offers the novel and the provocative Christ, whether it is believable or not. I would like to find this movie on DVD or even VHS so I can use it in studio or newsgroups.
