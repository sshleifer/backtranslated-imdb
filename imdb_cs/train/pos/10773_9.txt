I recommend this film to everyone. Not only fans of rock Lucian Ligabue but all film fans. Because it's honest, moving, fun and true. Because Ligabue is a born story and a film lover and every film of his film is made with love and care. Because his characters are loved and ask to be loved. Since most of the debut films in Italy are bad and the outsider is really happy to watch and listen. Because Stefano Accorsi is beautiful and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza, who, just like Freccia, was beautiful, talented and good and lost her life because of the heroin that Ligabue shows, as it is, spectacular and ugly without moving away from easy moralism. Because it's a movie that speaks to our hearts, our ears, our souls. And because I lived the experience of FM radio and that was exactly what I was doing. Thanks, Luciano!
