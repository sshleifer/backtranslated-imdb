The film is very nice with a great cast and excellent leadership by James Eves. The film is fun with a very charismatic performance by Stephanie Beecham and they are all perfectly busy. James Eves has a good eye for casting and is conducting as a conductor who knows exactly when to throw action, fall and then culminate. It's done with a humorous element, lots of twists, excitement, and blood. This is the return of an old vampire movie with lots of gore, blood and shouts. The movie works at great speed and the characters will take you to an amazing adventure, but what makes it work is that the movie does not take too seriously with a lot of tongue in the face of action. Great!
