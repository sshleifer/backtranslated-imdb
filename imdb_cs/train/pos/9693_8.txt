I was very surprised by this film. I touched the lives that Paul had touched his journey to find her "marie" little girl from which she was separated. Humor was also very good and did not hurt the story because I thought it would be. Actually, I expected that "paulie wants a cracker" jokes to hurt this movie, but it was even done in a very humorous scene that touches greatly when paulia is at a research lab conference. So if you want to see a good "animal that speaks" movie, check this out much better than Doctor DOLITTLE in my opinion. PAULIE also has a surprising treatment that happens very nicely.
