With a number of actors working on the project, they have a wide range of cast. Nice CGI spaceship in places, but their green screen needs some work. Anyone who heard about Adobe After Effects 7 should buy it to get better keying. The stories are well thought out, there are plenty of trekking elements to keep in the right context. But the thought of two boys kissing makes me welcome an episode. I'm not homophobic, but I can not help that I can not find men kissing fun (dont mind women). Anyway ... For a series of fans, that's a good thing. With less refinement of their green screen, clean up gaming and some of the landmark ratings of this series is stunning. Anyway, I recommend this series, who has ever used TNG and DS9.
