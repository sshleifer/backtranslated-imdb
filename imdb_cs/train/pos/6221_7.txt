If this movie was made a little better, it would be the best Astaire and Rogers. As it is, it's a great movie, but too long with a boring subplot, Randolph Scott's romantic Rogers sister played by Harriet Hilliard (that's Ozzie Nelson's wife with you baby boomers). Astaire and Scott are two men from Navy. Scott first meets Hilliard when he looks like a stereotype librarian, and later after Ginger Rogers asked her boyfriend (blonde but unmistakable Lucille Ball) to make her charm. Meanwhile, Astaire tries to pick up where he and his old dance partner stopped. The result is some beautiful dance figures, with Astaer and Rogers as a team and separately: "I put all my eggs in one basket", "Let It Go" and "I'd rather lead a band". Hilliard is sweet but a bit lethargic because Jane has become a girl, despite her singing two songs: "But where are you?" and "Get behind me, Satan" - one poster did not care about this song, but I like the title. Rogers is a lively and youthful Astaire is a dynamo. The highlight of the movie comes at the end with "Let's Face the Music and Dance," one of the most painfully beautiful songs ever written, and certainly one of the most famously executed Rogers and Astaire. This is the embodiment of 30 years of spell and fantasy. It's really glad and watching over and over again.
