We rarely see such short comments written by IMDb movies. Perhaps this is because this light dark comedy entertains and delights in depth, or does something lack us? If I had any suggestion, I would have looked again. <br /> <br /> So what's the coincidence? For the French, is the "Le Battement d'Ailes du Papillon" Serendipity? Fate? Maybe it's an event that is the culmination of a series of random events. We all have it (it's called life), but when you look at it, you start to feel that "random" might be more "fatal". <br /> <br /> This film could be as small as the knocking of several leaves of the salad from the back of the truck or as important as establishing a crucial decision about the life of the alien who tossed the pebble. All these events cause more events that ... and you have a picture? Dominoes. Multiply them by three characters and an average of 6, and you really have to stretch your imagination to take a remote chance that this scenario can happen. And I think there is a diagnosis for those who believe that life is such. But then it's the magical world of cinema. We admit that it is fun to watch the way the writer / director links these unrelated events to the story that fits into the lives of these French citizens. If you have a few hours looking for an exciting escape, it's where you do it. Or, if you recover from surgery and do not go anywhere else, it will take you when the stitches heal. <br /> <br /> "Happenstance" does not fall as a winner, but culture should develop. Foreign things have happened. Soren Kierkegaard is attributed as follows: "Life can only be seen back, but it must be live ahead." If you look at the detail in many of your own life experiences (meeting your first love, finding the perfect gift, your last car accident) you would find a number of seemingly random events that would lead to it. <br /> <br /> This is the answer! I forgot to bring existentialism to explain Happenstance.
