I saw this movie only ten years ago. I bought the DVD two days ago and after watching it, I think it's even better than I remember. Paperhouse is far more than horror. She had such an amazing level of emotion and great characterization passing through her. I especially thought Charlotte Burke was really great. It's such a shame that she did nothing else because she was a great actress. Her impression of emotions throughout the movie was perfect with the right amount of subtlety to get a message, especially at the end when she realized that even though Marc had died, she knew it would be okay. <br /> <br /> Several scenes made me jump (which is a rarity in modern horror films), most notably the scene in the bathtub, the scene where Anna's father chuckled with a strange radio background and a piece where his legs fell apart he fell into dust. Overall, a great and very moving movie.
