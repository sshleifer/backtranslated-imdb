Is it a good idea to use live animals to view business window stores? <br /> <br /> No, and here's why. <br /> <br /> In the "Hare conditioned" sale that Bugs is help support is over and the store manager (Nelson) will be transferred to a new department: taxidermy. Of course, Bugs objects and entertainment starts. <br /> <br /> You use almost every department in the store (baby clothes, sportswear, boots, costumes, nightgowns - do not ask). at every turn, even refers to a manager as "The Great GilderSNEEZE". Even if they are caught in the elevator area, Bugs does the best of the situation. Director Jones is at the top of his painting game as always, just like Blanc (like Bugs, natch) and Nelson (manager - who calls Gildersleeves - go ask your grandmother). And the sage word of advice: When confronted with a fuzzy looking woman who wants to try on the slippers in the bathroom, always look at her ears. Ten stars for "Hare Conditioner", which is the best argument for animal work laws.
