This movie is exciting, courageous and the music is very good. The Moonwalker movie was intended to coincide with the album Bad (1987). I have a bad one. It's fantastic (*****). "Man in the Mirror" on the scene. Then it shows the history of Michael, from his early days in Jackson 5 to the bad era. Oh and Badder is also good (Badder is a music video parody on a music video for bad single). It then displays the Speed ​​Demon video. The song and the video are very, very good. which will appear after. Then the film Moonwalker.after a few minutes, he plays a smooth criminal at a club called club 30s.like when he does lean.anyway, nice to see you.bye bye.
