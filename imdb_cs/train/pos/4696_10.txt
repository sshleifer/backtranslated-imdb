even though this movie is quite old, no matter how many times I look at it, it still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> One particular citation in the movie stands out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When Danny (Joe Piscopo) pulls out into the office and parks in the affected area, Danny partner claims he can not park here, it's for the disabled. "<br /> <br /> Danny answers "I'm disabled, I'm psychotic". <br /> <br /> This is one of the many rows in the movie that no matter how many times you look, Johnny Dangerously stands in his top 5 comedies / spoof films of all time. <br /> <br /> As a bonus, legendary actor Peter Boyle adds a cast, so look at this movie & like me and many others who watched him, you will be hooked.
