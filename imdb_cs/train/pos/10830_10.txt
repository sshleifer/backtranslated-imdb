I liked Still Crazy more than any movie I've seen for years. A successful bands from the 1970s decided to try again. They start playing in some European venues with concerts with merry results. Music is fantastic, script and acting are amazing. Characters are in place, especially the main vocalist with a heavy voice of heavy metal, make-up and personality problems. The concert at the end was unreal. Go and see, best in a cinema with a good sound system :)
