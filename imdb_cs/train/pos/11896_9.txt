After a few years I came across a rerun syndication of this show and fell in love with her. TÃ©a Leoni and Holland Taylor perform and hold me laughing, one episode after another. I think it was not that big and was canceled after several seasons, but I believe it's a good run, and I suggest that it look ... if it happens.
