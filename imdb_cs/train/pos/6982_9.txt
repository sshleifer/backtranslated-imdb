Good show. The underlying background is that humanity is at a crossroads. There are a number of moral dilemmas they face. Humanity has made a number of technological breakthroughs, but is mankind sufficiently mature to deal with new toys? There is moral decadence in the virtual world. There are religious fanatics who are willing to kill to get attention. I predict (based on the BSG background) that there is a problem with Cylons and slavery. Besides, there are all the other problems we bring. <br /> <br /> This show is not BSG - at least not as far as humanity is on the run from the ruthless problem that was ultimately the result of their own production. There are not many special effects of shoot-em-up or the universe - at least not in the first few episodes I've seen so far. What it has are very good stories, characters and motifs. He also has good performances from the actors. They can create a culture that is similar to modern society, but the stranger is also completely credible. Like BSG, this show is about humanity - about our strengths, weaknesses, possibilities and shortcomings. It may seem strange that human society in another group of worlds has ties, antique wagons and chicken. But these things are really more about creating a semi-familiar background than anything else. Anyone who gets these details is really missing. Whether you are from Mafia-style cult or rich and high-tech culture, people and human nature are not so different 150,000 years ago in cutting-edge technology than what we see in today's world. It seems the writers are trying to say something.
