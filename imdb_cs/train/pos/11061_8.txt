I've also been through a very painful personal loss (twice) and this film draws the awareness of the reality of this experience very well, Life from Balance, Nothing Makes Sense, Well Understand Relatives, etc ... It was nice to see Ally again. He is one of my favorite film actors. <br /> <br /> I laughed and wept as the story unfolded. Big story and cast. Great!
