A highly atmospheric left that shows great ingenuity when using props, sets and effects (fog, lighting, focus) to create a mysterious and moody texture. The story is neglected, acting is only functional, but it shows how imaginative effects can develop the whole visual story. This film is recommended for its mood and texture, not for its story.
