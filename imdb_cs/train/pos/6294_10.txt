This Twilight Twilight episode combines a silent section (1890) with melodramatic fiction and visual gags, honoring early films by Buster Keaton. Lots of Ghost: Buster falls on the door of the counter, falls into the puddle, runs around his legs. Strong Scientific Invention Time helmets, reminiscent of Flash Gordon's idea of ​​the future. Cheap prices, such as $ 1.95 for women's hats or 17 cents per kilo of beef, appear to be extremely tall Buster. Even the 1890 world is too much for Buster / Mulligan. How shocking when mistakenly transferred to the "modern" world of the 1960s! Buster tried to go back! The "scientist" of that time wants to return to a quieter world, until 1890, which he studied and admired. They come together and Buster / Mulligan is now happy and the "scientist" regrets that he does not have electronic equipment, a modern bed or electric blanket. So Buster sends him back with a crazy helmet. This Twilight Zone has no hard news. Since Buster Keaton died in 1966, it's his last effort. It is enough. One other cute thing - a long-time useless Maytag Man Jesse White is a repairer who fixes a helmet - a precursor to his washing machine career.
