Charming in every respect, this movie is perfect if you are in the mood to feel good. If you like jazz music, you have to see it. If you like to see love figures that smile at you, it can bring tears to your eye and swing as if this movie was not for you tomorrow. If you are looking for an intensive, deep and heavy work of art that you could analyze and analyze, you might be best with Darren Aronofsky (another word - the reporter djjohn makes it easy, you do not know the good time when you see!) My only complaint is that the movie was too short. I think I'll have to watch her several times to make it happen.
