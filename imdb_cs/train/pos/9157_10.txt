Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! When I came across this movie version at the end of the nineties, I was ecstatic! This is the best and most complete version of the movie about the movie! This version is a bit long to sit in one sitting, but it is worth it. Timothy Dalton is amazing as Rochester. I was glad she made a normal-looking actress (Zelah Clark) like Jane and not a charming person. I like sets and locations. For anyone who is a real fan of Jane Eyre, it's a version that will look !!! For those of you who are interested, I just found this version on DVD. I watched my VHS copy almost at break, so I was thrilled to find it on DVD.
