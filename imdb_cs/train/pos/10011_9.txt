I liked the night listener very much. It's one of the better movies of the summer. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams gives one of his best performances. In fact, the entire cast was very good. Everybody just played the right notes for their characters - not too many and not too few. Sandra Oh adds an amazing comic touch. Toni Collette is great as a mom and never crosses the top. Everyone is very credible. It's a short film, just an hour and a half. I noticed that the overall version is 9 minutes shorter than the Sundance version. I wonder if some of the disturbing images are removed from the movie. The director narrated the story and did it in a straightforward way, a refreshing change from many directors who today seem to think their work is to impress the audience rather than tell the story and say it well. <br /> <br /> Do not be sucker divided by thumbnails and ads. It's not a Hitchcockian thriller. Look at Night Listeners because you want to see a good story well. If you go to Hitchcock, you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with the movie was the end. The director could leave the audience's imagination a bit, but it's a tiny bite.
