I stumbled on this film on cable and was totally hooked. The story of a group of surfers who ride on big waves, waves that are huge, waves that would cause a rational person to escape terror is one that can be magnificent and makes you understand why people spend their lives chasing waves. There is nothing special about the film, except that brings together some very interesting people who are in love with what they do, and allows them to speak. Sure there are scenes of them surfing, but what makes this film so special are the people. There are plenty of people who are passionate about what they do, it goes to the people who watch. By the middle of the journey into this movie you will want to leave and learn how to surf as well. Several documentary films have ever managed to save the passion that these people have, and because our films can feel it's a great movie. Look at that.
