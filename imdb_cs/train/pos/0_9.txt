Bromwell High is a cartoon of comedy. It ran at the same time as some other school life programs, such as "Teachers". My 35-year-old teaching career has led me to believe that the satire of Bromwell's movement is much closer to reality than "teachers." Bullying, financially surviving, faithful students who can see directly through their miserable teacher's bludgeon, the slowness of the whole situation remind me of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw an episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn a school, I immediately remembered ......... at .......... High. Classical Line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to throw one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect many adults of my age to think that Bromwell High is far from interested. What a pity it is not!
