The first was victory. That means defeat. It is happening in Bolivia, there are guerrillas ill and prudent and do not meet so much sympathy from farmers. If you know your 60-year history, you understand how it ends. You understand it even without this knowledge. <br /> <br /> Del Toro is wonderful again. He continues to build this icon about the revolutionary who remains the same, regardless of success or failure. That's what Guevara says, but it's still so good. <br /> <br /> The documentary feeling is around the icon, which is one of the greatest achievements of this great Soderbergh project. Succeed.
