It is an excellent little film about the loneliness of a single man. Phillipe Harel as Notre Heros is a bit like Robert de Niro amalgam in a cab, inspector Clouseau (in his Stoicism) and Chauncey Gardiner in Being There (also Peter Sellers). He is the only one, but he does not know how to attract the opposite sex - in fact he does not participate at all! He has stoicism and fatalism that rejects any hope of ever reaching the bond - his friend Jose Garcia as Tisserand is in the same situation, yet at least he makes a brave effort to overcome his widened virgin (28 years old and admits he never had sex). Very good outdoor footage in Paris and Rouen, where both software people travel in business. They try different nightclubs and places, but it's all frustrating. My theory is that they are trying for bad places - they go to more or less "young" nightclubs; they should try a type that has older people, more of their age. <br /> <br /> Harel is becoming more and more isolated and doing a bit of Niro's effort, as with a taxi driver, calling his friend / colleague who drew a pretty girl in the nightclub. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching.
