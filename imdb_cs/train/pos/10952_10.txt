Sarah Silverman is a dangerous bitch! She is beautiful, sexy, fun and talented, dark and demonic. I read a second note on this show as well as the billboard, and people simply did not get it. Nothing that appears on the TV is an accident. Too much money, time and work is included in the production of the TV series because of mistakes. This show is stupid because Sarah wanted her to be stupid. This show is juvenile because Sarah wanted her to be juvenile. I thought the jokes were great, and the theme of the show, just like the rest of the music numbers, is beautifully bizarre. It's a lot like Pee-Wee's Playhouse for the badly modified, lightening twentieth olfactory glue, Future Pornstars of America from the valley. The cast is amazing. Scenarios and events are well-behaved. I hope this show will succeed because the Central comedy did not allow David to shoot his show. Who plays Sarah's sister? She is not in a cast list on the show home page. I'd like to see her stand. Does anyone know about their upcoming shows or DVDs that can float there?
