** Maybe Spoiler *** Adam Sandler is usually broadcast in a comedy, but in "Reign", he gives a deeply moving performance. While the people who show Courage face after September 11, 2001, Sandler plays Fineman, a widower who is lonely and "lost in his own world". Johnson (Cheadle), a practical dentist, meets his old college boyfriend (Sandler) and wants to catch up with "old times". We see how it is in dune Man (Dustin Hoffman) also gets emotional and withdrawn in stressful situations. Oldies music seems to be comforting and a "psychological" crutches for him to lean on. Johnson, in Fineman, is looking for some delight and comfort in his family. He also feels unhappy and dissatisfied with his work. In the same case, he also wants to make sure that his friend does not fall into social "cracks". I came from this movie, with a different view and sympathetic Compassion with grieving families.
