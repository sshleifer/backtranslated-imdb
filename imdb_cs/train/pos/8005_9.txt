I bought this game on eBay when I heard it's a similar game with Elite. The game is really very similar and very addictive. As soon as I played it several times, I immediately went back to eBay and bought copies of all my kids so they could also join the fun ... I played this game right through and the story makes me feel like you're in the movie, it's brilliant. If you're having trouble exploring the freedom to do so because of the limiting nature of a single-player game, simply set up a Freelancer server on your computer (easy to read and included with the software) and play your heart. There are still many Freelancer servers on the Internet, so multiplayer is no problem and it's not all threatening, because you do not often mean other players if you do not. So go to a copy of this game, learn how to play a single player campaign, then create an online presentation and enjoy it. The depth of this game is overwhelming, with huge discovery and wreck systems, as well as many other discoveries - hidden planets, wormholes, secret bases, the list is almost endless. Fantastic game and especially how you can buy it for a few emails on eBay. Get one with a complete written manual if you can (blue box, no Xplosiv red box), it's better!
