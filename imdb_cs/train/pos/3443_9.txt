A breathtaking, honest, courageous and unforgettable psychological horror movie that touches the painful experiences of pain caused by rape - "Descent" is a movie that has been dropped under the radar because of the lack of distribution because it is frankly the film is so brutal in its imagination, if it was theatrically released, it might encounter some strong preconceived hatred. The film deserves to discover not only its dark motifs, not only for its amazing direction and authentic style - but above all for its performances. Chad Faust is absolutely stunning, it brings enough illness and enough vulnerability to not interested, but he understands that broken man with a broken perspective of his sexuality not only with the women he has raped but also with the fragile insecurities deep inside him. It is a supportive performance that is so complicated, courageous and emotional for Faust. And hard to forget. However, standout is Rosario Dawson, whose performance here is an absolute revelation. A show of realistic dramatic tikes and one of the finest yet louder performances at some time. While Dawson is seen in some good supporting performances in some great to bad movies, he proves that he has what he needs to bring emotional sweeping and moving performances credibly and thematically. One of the best films of the year (and 2007 was strong) - if this underrated and intelligent film hit theatrical release, I would like to praise him, like Dawson and Faust. It was a pity he was calling too broadly. Such films deserve better!
