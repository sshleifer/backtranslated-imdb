Celebrating as a great supporting actor in the movie "Glory," he proved that he was not "Malcolm in the middle" middle actor in "Malcolm X", showed his brotherly love to participate in the Philharmonic Orchestra, "He got the game", pulled no punches and rocked us as a hurricane in the "Hurricane", he has provided us with effective training of the water lily in the "Training Day", and now he has proved that he could also direct! Denzel Washington's directorial debut "Antwone Fisher" is the most moving film of the year. This story of a fisherman's story is by no means associated with the debacle that occurred in the 4th quarter of the Miami Dolphins against New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. Unlike the Dolphin tragedy, Antwone Fisher has an emotionally happy conclusion. The film is based on a real story about a young naval officer who has troubles with anger because of the disgusting that he has suffered as a foster child. Denzel plays a naval psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his anger and persuades him to find his natural mother. Derek Luke's debut performance as Antwone is the most popular acting actress actress. In fact, I have seen some detailed eccentricity in Luke's acting, as I have seen in previous performances in Washington. It was as if Washington had told Luke - la la la Luke I was your acting father. "Okay, I will release the star wars before the readers send me into a galaxy that is far away." When he spoke of a great Denzel, his psychologist's work was masterful, but what can you expect from the actress "Master D." Antwone Fisher wrote an emotional pathos that he put into the script of his story was the material of the "king of the fisherman." I stood for the chief Mr. Washington in catching the right bait in Antwon Fisher. ***** Excellent
