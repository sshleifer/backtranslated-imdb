Everything was better in the past days. Even children's television. And Fraggle Rock proves my point quite easily. At the time of writing this comment I am at the age of 14, but even in my teen years I can not resist Fraggle Rock. For those of you who really live under the rock (haha!), Fraggle Rock is about a horda of playful and elfs named Fraggles who live - amazingly - in a rock. But they are not the only creatures. The rock is inhabited by a number of other species, such as the Doozers and the countless living plants. Outside the rock on one side, the inventor-scientist Doc and his dog Sprocket (who later engages with Gobo Fraggle), on the other hand, the family of the Gorg-presumed rulers of the universe. The five main Fraggles Gobo (fearless leader), Mokey (arts and peace), Wembley (indecent and friend Gobo), Bober (pessimistic domestic god) and Red (loves something in common with sports and general feistyness) in some special situations each episode sing and dance their worries away. <br /> <br /> Fraggle Rock is definitely a family show - plots can have intricate details that babies do not have a good watch, but song-and-dance routines will keep their attention. The characters are strong and sympathetic, their conflicts are believable and their adventure exciting. Gorgs are scary, enlightenment Doc and Sprocket, Uncle Traveling Matt cheerful (segments of postcards are very 80s!) And the final episode, Address change, really touches. Let's go down to Fraggle Rock again!
