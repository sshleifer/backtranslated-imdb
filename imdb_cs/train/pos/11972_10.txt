I grew up when I looked at Full House as a child. I stopped for several years, but about two weeks ago I went back and watched it again. Now my children look at the show and like to watch. My kids can not believe the DJ at the show, and I'm the same age. <br /> <br /> I really like the show because it's a show you can watch with your family. She has good teachings from which your children can learn. Also there are no drugs and violence. Also, when children have a problem at the show, they can always turn to help their family. This is a message that children should get out of the television for days, turning to their family for help, not drugs. Children should watch other shows like Full House instead of half the mess on television, now days. I also like to show because it makes a laugh and it is on the ground. They talk about real life issues and family issues. The show is always a lesson from which you can learn. <br /> <br /> I vote for the show 10.
