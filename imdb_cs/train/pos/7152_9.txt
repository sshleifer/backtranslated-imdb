The "Holes" were a great movie. Disney decided right. Everyone I talked about said that they loved him. Everyone was determined to do what they had, and Shia Labeouf really has a future to play. Sigourney Weaver was perfect for the Ranger, it was just as I imagined. anyone who did not see it, I recommend it and I guarantee you to kick it out.
