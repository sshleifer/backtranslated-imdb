This great movie failed to score higher than 5! Why not! It is a great display of Christ's life without the merciless sensationalism of Christ's suffering. John Cash made great things for God, who were amazingly avoiding and neglecting in areas where they should have the greatest issue, such as our churches. The film itself lasted less than a month of shooting because Johnny felt the strong presence of the God that led him through him. Great merit to all who are involved in this overwhelming frank film, its fans. At least Billy Graham's crusade has been rated so much that he uses it as a source of education for new Christians. We thank Fox for producing them. As he walked along the line, it turned out that it was strange that he survived, an underestimated masterpiece. The songs are not canonized by popular vote, as evidenced by this production! Overall, I am convinced that this film is one of the world's greatest documents because it is direct, sincerely portrayed and a great witness to the Christian faith!
