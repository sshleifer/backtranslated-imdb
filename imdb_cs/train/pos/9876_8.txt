Presentation Lily Mars is a really nice little movie that shows Judy Garland's comedic ability with her singing singles. The conspiracy consists of Lily Mars, who broke after the John Thornway brand. I think the comedy is light and it's not too hard here. I really recommend this film to everyone. Judy is breathtaking in this role!
