This is the type of movie that will stay with you for a long time. Soha Ali and Abhay Deol look very beautiful. Soha reminds her of her mother Sharmila Tagore. Abhay is a born actor and will rise a lot in the coming future. The end of the film is very different from most films. In this way, you remain dissatisfied, but if you really think about it, you realize that the only meaningful end is the end that shows up in the movie. Otherwise it would be a great gross injustice for everyone. The film is about a professional witness who encounters a girl waiting for a marriage in court. Her boyfriend does not show up and she finally helps a witness. Slowly, slowly, she falls in love with her. It is not clear whether or not she has such feelings. Watch the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The film really belongs to Abhay. I look forward to seeing more movies from him. Soha is pretty but she did not talk much in the movie. Her eyes and her innocence spoke most of it.
