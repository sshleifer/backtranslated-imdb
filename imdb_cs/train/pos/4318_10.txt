One measure of the size of the film is: "If you come up tonight, would you like to sit and watch it again?" My answer to the Grand Canyon is so strong "yes" as if it was for almost no movie I've ever seen. There are just so many powerful moments, such an intelligent and moving story, such incredible performances. <br /> <br /> Perfectly capturing the confusion and violence that was so embarrassing at the beginning of the nineties. But it also dramatically reaffirms the ability of individuals to love, think and care. The film was a gentle way at the time. It partially shows the company as a balloon to crack. Given that the country was in recession and was so unnecessary to lead, so it was at that time. But the film is also timeless. I think he could sincerely oppose any film ever made, and it's the most viewed film of all time.
