Walter Pidgeon is Braley Mason, a civil law attorney who deals with a criminal case in "The Unknown Man," the 1951 film also stars Ann Harding, Barry Sullivan, Keefe Braselle, and Richard Anderson. A great believer in justice, Pidgeon accepts pro bono the case that prevents the young man, Rudi Walchek (Braselle), being accused of murder and liberating him. Shortly thereafter, he realizes that the man is guilty of expelling security money from his victim, as well as other merchants around. He is recommended by DA (Sullivan) that Rudi is a small change in order to eliminate the organized crime. Mason finds the top man and faces a dilemma. "Unknown Man" is a small, black-and-white movie that can hold audiences interested in their various plot of fences, although the plot is somewhat invented. It is really the story of a good man who is looking for his god, justice, and what he is willing to do to attain it. And that is the most fundamental part of all. I suppose there was time before the OJ, Brothers Menendez, etc., etc., when people believed in the justice and integrity of attorneys. For those viewers these days are for a long time. Walter Pidgeon is doing a great job - his handsome, elegant behavior and declamatory voice show us a successful, sure man but also a deeply caregiver. Pidgeon had a spectacular 60-year career, but never went to superstar. He was a solid actor who could play almost anything and did. Perhaps it was because he was in his thirties when he got to the post, and he was missing a matinee idol; or it might be that he missed something; or that was written shortly thereafter, leading to a big female star like Greer Garson. Hard to say. He gives honest and moving performance here. <br /> <br /> A very good movie with good performances.
