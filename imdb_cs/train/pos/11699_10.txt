I've seen this movie ten times and it's amazing. The only thing was that at the beginning there were too many people about who was going with whom. I think it would be interesting to make a remake. But at the official site, they said they would not do a remake because so many people got saved by looking at it. What happened to Patty Dunning? She's a pretty good actress. She made several other movies in the 1970s and 1980s, but since then we have not heard from her. I know for sure that Thom Rachford, who plays Jerry, works for the RD Films accountancy. But overall, I have to say that the series itself is like an old school.
