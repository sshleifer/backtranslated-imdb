It is a film about deep and unspoken human relationships. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is talk, but there is an opportunity to change the situation. <br /> <br /> Originally in Shanghai in 1948, and without any propaganda, the film introduces us to the Dai family. There is a certain weight in the history surrounding the family. History usually has a weight in Chinese literature and serious film. A young married couple - Liyan, an invalid, and his wife, Yuwen, live in a once large family family that is partially destroyed. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> The bright contrast is Liyan's young sister, who really can not remember the past of the family but accepts everything in a natural way. Her spirit is as clear as the other two. <br /> <br /> In this seemingly stable world comes an unexpected visitor ... <br /> <br /> Finally I felt quite sad - but definitely an excellent movie.
