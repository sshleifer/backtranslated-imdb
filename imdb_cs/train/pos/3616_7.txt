Casting the unknown Michelle Rodriguez as Diana was a genius stroke. Is perfect. Their inexperience is in their favor. We have never seen her before, so it really feels like her story. It also brings true toughness. But it works against her because we never doubt it. You will never have to earn it for winning, because you never went against any fighter shooter he thinks he can not beat. So, like a boxing movie, it fails. <br /> <br /> Then it's not really a boxing movie. How do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer who is not a boxing film? You do not. But Karyn Kusama has the same. Like many Indian movies, "Girlfight" reverses classification or genre and stands by itself as a folk that could happen in the near future. <br /> <br /> Diana is bad at school. Fights people who do not like (like all other girls in their school). She does not fit. Her father forces his young brother, Tiny, to learn to box to defend himself when it becomes difficult. He pays little money for his boxing session, and Diana gives nothing, as if she did not have to defend herself, or anything that could become her life. Tiny wants to go to art school (clich√©, yuck), so he gives up his boxing contribution to Diana, who actually wants to box. Things get complicated when Diana falls on another boxer, Adrian (Santiago Douglas), who wants to stand for. From there, the story opens towards the inevitable ... they both meet in amateur battle for the title. <br /> <br /> What left me cold was that I found none of that interesting. It's all just a little credible. Kids with heavy lives growing in coarse urban areas fall into sports. From these circumstances, the number of professional boxers has increased. The mental and physical toughness that this upbringing requires is a box where your friend is anger. This time she's a girl. Big deal. Or there is another position: eventually a boxing movie about a girl. The female box has been for a long time. The brutality we usually see in boxing movies is replaced by discussion about the lives of people and their feelings. The whole combat thing is used as a platform from which you can paint a bigger picture. Respect. Overcoming adversely. Self-discovery. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Girlfight" because it has a good spirit and is an example of some great work for the director for the first time. Dialogue never went beyond the quality of solo operations, but the story itself changed its mind on some things. Yes, the world looks like a better place. The movie did. <br /> <br /> Grade: B-
