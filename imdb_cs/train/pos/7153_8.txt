My wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story when she read it for several hours. It never sounds interesting to me, and I bought a DVD when I thought it would be a movie that would not really be in my alley. The first half of the movie has a lot of settings and I found out that I think I'm right. It starts a bit slow and I have to admit I was a bit bored - but curious enough to stay with her. Boy, I'm glad I did, because it ended up as a very satisfying and enriching film. I would certainly watch it again! <br /> <br /> Casting was very good. Since I have not read the book, I can not guarantee accuracy, but I must say that Jon Voight was really wonderful. You like the characters you like, hate the ones you ought to hate, and laugh at those who should be funny. I see some people do not like this movie. It is sometimes tiring, especially at the beginning. All obstacles can be disturbing (although they are crucial to the story). Once the story begins to gather at the end, I think you are feeling patiently. When everything is said and done, I think it's a very good movie - 8/10. <br /> <br />
