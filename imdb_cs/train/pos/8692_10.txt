I liked watching this. I had no idea he was part of a larger series. I had to be about twelve when it was on TV. I thought it was funny, and for some reason I had a deep fascination for something that was clear that he was in the President's pile of bathtubs. My parents recorded the television when it originally broadcast on NBC. The tape had even old Sanka coffee along with several others. I intend to come back home soon and try to upload a tape to my computer so that those who want a copy can do it. If any of you want to turn to me, I think you can do it through the IMDb site. I'll let you know and I'll let you know when I have a show in digital format.
