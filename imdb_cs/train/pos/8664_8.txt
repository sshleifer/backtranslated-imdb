The equally strong gangster top-ranked Frankie Diomede (always a terrific Lee Van Cleef in a gritty form) himself arrested and sent to prison to rip his visually impaired partner. There is also a small hood and dirty Tony Bred (a lovely painting by Tony Lo Bianca). Frank and Tony make an unlikely friendship behind the grid. Tony helps Franco out of his knuckle and helps him exact revenge against a competing group of mobsters led by ruthless Louis Annunziat (Jean Rochefort). Director Michele Lupo, who works on the script of Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, watches the pure story at a constant pace, maintains an appropriate but sometimes silent tone throughout the body (gross unintentional collision backup and prolonged mondo destructo as persecution). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco show nice, free and engaging chemistry on the screen; the relationship between their characters is alternately fun and touching. Amazing Edwige Fenech unfortunately does not do much to do as Tony is a horrible girlfriend of Orchid, but at least she gets into the color of her madly gorgeous and sensual body in a highly prized free-of-charge naked shower scene. Riz Ortolani is a groovy, vibrant, syncopated funk / jazz score that will surely hit the soul-swinging spot. Polished cinematography by Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is also impressive. Great and fun little winner.
