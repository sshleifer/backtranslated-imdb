Absolutely pleasant singing and dancing film by Frank Sinatra and the Kelly genre, as well as Kathryn Grayson. The film was awarded and Oscar for George E. Stoll's score, and received nominations for best painting, best actor for Kelly and best cinematography, as well as nomination for best son for "I love in too easy" sung by Sinatra. It was a cute story that Kelly helped his friend Sinatra get a girl and fall in love for herself. Beautiful Grayson (Toast from New Orleans) dazzled us with singing and we had a lot of great Kelly and Sinatra songs and dances, as well as the art of pianist Jos√© Iturbi. <br /> <br /> Classic Hollywood music from the past.
