When I looked at some other comments here, I have a major complaint about this presentation. <br /> <br /> Two main characters are attractive in their own way - beautiful "victims" and nice, of course, extremely "out of center", protagonists of blue collars (if only "totally") - , like a Kabuki caucasian scenario. <br /> <br /> That's okay, and that's of course a mainly "turn-table" story. However, my reference complaint is that I believe the director was interested in showing the well-known and the apparent physical attributes of Farrah, beginning to be lovingly dressed in a thin coat, and with a number of scenes that show more than a dramatic effect - and yet they are extremely gratifying - divert attention from the dramatic level of drama. <br /> <br /> Her roommates are definitely doing their job as they are written and directed - but their skepticism and histrionic madness and sobs did not mean truth - based on previous experience ostra Farrah with this guy, obvious proof that he had come to his place with the only worst intention and that he had absolutely no reason to overdo what had happened. But this is a movie and a story that convinces yet, the director's work.
