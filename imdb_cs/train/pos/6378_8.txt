Atlantis: The Lost Empire has some of the finest, finest animations and a cleverly written dialogue about any Disney movie I've seen. And I was convinced in the first 15 minutes. I particularly like the voice of Don Novello on Vincenzo Santorini and Phil Morris as Joshua Strongbear Sweet. It is a shame that the film moves at approximately the double the rate that would be appropriate - at least in the first act. One of the important aspects of each Disney movie is a satisfied antagonist - who does not provide Atlantis. It's on average at best. Halfway through the film is an average procedure. That is all. It's a great movie. Everyone should look at it.
