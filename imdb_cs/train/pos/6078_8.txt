I was especially pleased that Othello was dark-haired in this film, and Desdemona did not have fair hair like almost always. The shot also played very well and the lyrics I liked the original text of Shakespeare's text so faithfully. But I have to say that some scenes were too expensive for a character like Desdemona. I always thought it was very modest, so it's not right to show her in bed with Cassius-even though it was only in Othello's imagination. At first I was a little surprised that the love scene between Othello and Desdemona showed so openly. But as a whole, I liked the film and especially Desdemona weeps in the dying scene.
