(I'm wondering what Luca is doing today, probably a lawyer or something like Bela Lugosi Jr or David Hennessey there's a guy from Lucy Venantini, Venantini Venantini, Alicia Moro (two stars come from CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD) dark shadows who want to forget that there are dark shadows.) There is no music in the Thorn EMI video above the initial credits ... but the music is great as it comes ... Italian movies are not movies so good music ... my favorite the scene is with a boy with a robot hand after Alien Alien through the desert Alien says why you are watching me Tommy responds because I feel like it ... Alien answers how you did Tommy says West then Alien says good, I'm going east So after a while of walking, the theme plays in the background Alien looks up and sees Tommy sits on rock petting pet hamster ... Tommy looks up and tells Alien what took you so long ... I love this movie ... It touches my heart. Robot arm boy needs his father and the Alien is designed to be Tommy's father in the desert. . . yes, they also need water. . . not a ROAD WARRIOR (MAD MAX 2), but a stupid western / post nuke movie with a boy with a robot arm and Alien and Trash and some other good guys with a middle-sized cat with an iron claw and CRAZY BULL, who looks like Wez in a road warrior. . On Sunday afternoon on Channel 57 (Philadelphia, PA), I went back home to find the church. . . often. . . too often. I love it. 10/10
