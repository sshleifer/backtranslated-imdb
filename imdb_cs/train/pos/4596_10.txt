That's the best Jackie Chan movie and my personal favorite. After an unsuccessful show in the US by director James Glickenhaus "The Protector," Jackie adopted a concept and placed him in Hong Kong. It is also probably the most violent film Jackies, with an audience hurrying to the boulders breaking stones. The action is fast and enraged, Jackie and his crew really did their best to fight the design. Bones were broken and the blood spilled into the process of making this movie, as you will see in credits. The script is a simple problem for cops and thieves, nothing special, eventually it was written around the action. I have to say that the English version has some subdued dubbing, but it should not get you too much. <br /> <br /> So, let the boys round, open the beer and enjoy. By the way, the movie was nicknamed 'Glass Story' by the stunt crew. Why? I'll let you know!
