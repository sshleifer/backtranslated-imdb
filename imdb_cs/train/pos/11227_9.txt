Hidden Borders - More Than Fan Fiction - It's a well-thought-out and organized series that keeps the Star Trek worlds alive and growing. From a small fan project to a familiar network line; Hidden boundaries have something for every fan of the star trek. Set in Late Star Trek: Next Generation / DS9 and Voyager Hidden Frontier, it deals with themes and issues that appear in other Star Trek storylines that use well-developed characters, drawings and arcs. Star Trek Hidden Frontier has taken stories about the social context Gene Roddenberry has failed to bring to the screen and has shown the evolution of characters in long-term spatial tasks - real things that happen in close proximity, as well as the exciting space wars and sci-fi addictions . Done in the studio "Green Screen"; Hidden boundaries bring the regular cast to the screen and into your hearts. A large set of actors plays well together and lovingly devotes their time and energy to them. The inventive use of green screen technology, props, makeup and costumes works to make the hidden boundaries of the Star Trek world fun and believable. Hidden Frontier walked away where she saw only a few steps in the science fiction world, and when they got there, they were thriving. The Hidden Border offers a great bonus feature with a well-thought-out website with interesting discussion forums, access to creative, production and acting staff and a fun weekly interview. I strongly recommend loading time and tracking.
