At first I did not know what to expect when I started the video. Whenever someone brings a culture of the type of cult and adapts it to the present, something inexplicably disappears in translation. </ br /> <br /> This is not the case. This movie is just starting out on the right track. It's part of a well-known territory, but it can be done despite the summit. Crockzilla scene someone? You need to see this and just try to keep your face straight. This film contains some of the old entertaining classic classics and can mix it seamlessly into modern production. It is good to see that someone in this market is filling the need. Very well done. <br /> <br />
