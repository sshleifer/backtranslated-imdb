Like many of them, I grew up with Scooby-Doo. Unlike many here who did it, I love this show! I think it was very well done and thought. All this means that it is a split that should not be taken seriously. The formula is simple - it's a parody of other cartoons with the only bad guy trying to get the best of a good guy. Using the well-known Shaggy and Scooby-Doo characters, it's much easier to engage the parody spectator in humor at the beginning of every 30-minute episode. <br /> <br /> There have always been Scooby-Doo spin-offs with annoying fans. The classic are Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts of the 80's. These spin-offs had their place: they were able to sell new content, created new fans, and kept the Scooby-Doo merchandise on shelves. I agree that "Shaggy & Scooby-Doo: Get a Clue!" does not fit into this traditional role, but it's probably what I've always wanted Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts to be: an action packed show that focuses on the best / most fun Scooby-Doo characters! Good features of the show: animation, voices, attention to detail, bad guys, best friend's relationship between Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, constant humor! Bad Features: None, although the enhanced Mystery Machine is pretty close enough. <br /> <br /> Well-done Warner Bros. Animation! One of the most beautiful cartoons for a long time!
