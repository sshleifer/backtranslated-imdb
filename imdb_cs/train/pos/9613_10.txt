It's hard to describe Bug's words, it's one of those films that really has to be understood. This is a story that is much more fluid and more interesting than everything I've seen recently in the Hollywood release. Because its characters respond to the chain of events in different ways, and as events dictate different paths for the characters to follow, viewers are only observers. Almost the Proustian story of thought to the idea, the very spontaneity in the script will be stuck to the screen, waiting to be anxious to see how it all works at the end. As for the thematic elements ... there is a certain sequence in the film, which is based on melancholy, clear and beautiful and then tragic, all within a minute. And it works. <br /> <br /> This movie is pure magic. It reminds us why independent film is perhaps the brightest star the film industry has at the moment. Maybe with other Bug quality movies, people will start to notice.
