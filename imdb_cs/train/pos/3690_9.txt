Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave all men the ability to love the whole world, but given that the human heart is very small, every person has this special place that loves more than any other. It seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of the most prominent directors of today when they embarked on confessing eternal love to this special place and portraying the situations in the lives of their inhabitants and visitors. The result is a wonderful collection of short films, Paris is a t'aime in which our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others take us on a breathtaking walk through the Parisian arrondissements, human feelings, desires and expectations. /> <br /> <br /> There is always another quarter, always a totally moving story about ordinary people in search of love, whether in a car park, an art studio, a metro station. And Paris's t'aime is about a huge amount of graces - love for a partner, baby, parents, for those who meant for us the world, but they are no longer around, love that needs to resurrect, serendipitous love for this alien as your eyes meet or love that is simply not meant to ... today, but tomorrow - who knows it? This film is not just about love but about life itself, about joy, about pain, about loneliness, about confusion, everyday rises and falls. And its most important quality is the fact that it is not at all, but rather warm and full of hope. I give this film 9, because its last part suggests how some stories could develop further, but not all, and that is the thing I miss, and "further development" I do not mean any concrete reference to the characters' future. As for everything else, I can only say - charming. Make you want to leave everything behind you, get off to Paris and live the romances yourself.
