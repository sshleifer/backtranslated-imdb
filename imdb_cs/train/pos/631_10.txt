This movie has everything that should have a fantastic movie, romance, clever jokes, great acting and lots of magic. <br /> <br /> I look forward to this film and I was attracted to his original plot (based on Neil Gaiman's novel, which I now want to read) and color characters. the most notable things for me actually were, as it actually contained the story is. Unlike so many fantastic sci-fi movies that are now leaving the open end, this was a pure fairy tale that satisfies itself without having to go on. Original. Entertainment. Fantastic feeling.
