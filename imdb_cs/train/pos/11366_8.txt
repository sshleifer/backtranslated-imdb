An excellent and convincing drama about hunting for the famous Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. The impressive performance of Stephen Rea as the forensic investigator-in-chief, who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress, is the Russian government, especially the older members of the Communist Party who want to maintain a closed society. <br /> <br /> The film has a basic theme about the decline of communist society and progress in hunting the killer is a reflection of progress in social and political change in Russia, which is gently overcome. There is a conflict of old ways and new ways that are represented by two views of the Rea Superiors (played by Donald Sutherland), and Rea himself. These are first polarized, Sutherland is "tall" in the system looking down, and Rea 'low' on the ground, looking up. Do they have a common cause? capture the serial killer. In the movie, the relationship between the two evolves and the tension gradually quenches until the Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland respects each other, the killer is captured and Glasnost symbolically comes. An excellent scenario. More credits bring the performance of Sutherland, who is excellent and compassionate, Jeffrey DeMunn as a murderer whom we despise, but we can not hate, and Max Von Sydow, who is convincing as a humble psychologist who risks his reputation help.
