*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Well, I see that I'm a big fan of H: LOTS, maybe I liked the film more than normal people. However, this film is still excellent. It had a lot of surprises and gave the series even more closure. While I was sad that Bayliss became a killer, the overall feeling I felt was satisfied.
