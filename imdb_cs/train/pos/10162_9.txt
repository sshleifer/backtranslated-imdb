Oh, I loved this movie. I think it all had to. Several times I laughed loudly. Yes, I'm a girl, so I write it from the girl's point of view. I think it's a shame he only gained 5.2 points. Too many voices? It was far above other romantic comedies. Just because I am a woman, I do not like all the elegant movies, on the contrary I prefer other genres. Romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as entertaining as they wanted to be. But as I said, this film had almost everything in my opinion. Great script, good one-time game, fine acting. Though Eva Longoria Parker's character very much reminded Gabrielle of Desperate Housewives, what? It was amazing. I leave this movie for rainy days, days when I feel low and I need a few laughs.
