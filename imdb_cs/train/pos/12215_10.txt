I loved this film from the introductory sequence to the end. I find that the director / actor is in a style that was directly involved with my audience very engaged. What I found most exciting and refreshing about this film was its ignorance - and hence the demanding - gender and class stereotypes. Characteristic characters are portrayed as strengths, and the absence of judgment and the ability to accept oneself and myself allowed me to accept and allow myself to be drawn into my world. Without preaching and intelligence and gentle and loving humor, this film has the power to open up to new possibilities and offers hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals. I look forward to other offers from this creative and talented director.
