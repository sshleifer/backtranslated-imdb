"Ten Tenant" is the biggest IMO film by Roman Polanski. And I like "Chinatown", but this is much more original and unconventional and totally scary. It's also a great black comedy. Some people who have shown that this movie was * very concerned * by being warned in advance that it affects some people in this way. Polanski is doing a great job playing the lead role in "The Tenant" while driving it.
