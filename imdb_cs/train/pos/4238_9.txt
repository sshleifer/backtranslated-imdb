On the surface it's an above-average post-romantic comedy. Under the vase, MGM is the most entertaining actor. <br /> <br /> The guides are straightforward, but all the secondary ones are pretty lightened. Margaret Hamilton, Edward Everett Horton (professional obsessive-compulsive fussbudget) and Sig Ruman (Marx's brothers in "Night In The Casablanca" and always-glorious "Night At The Opera") who try to combine both guides together, to separate them as their "ordinary" characters would do. He's also trying to entertain many romantic comedic conventions, which is another sign of this, it does not mean such a "direct" romantic comedy, as it is a cruel reinforcement of many post-war romantic comedies and their two-dimensional action characters. I saw it only once, with interruptions, so I can not be positive, but this movie may be one of those that worked better in the context of the time it was created, but it is less successful when viewers "see" these secondary characters a completely different lens . I suppose that's the way I give him nine stars. I thought it was hysterical.
