Here is the horrible revenge that takes place on the bad guys and plays with Denise Washington tireless and crude. He has three acting personalities: a former mercenary, then a drunken mercenary, then a loving paternal man with a little girl and then a brutal maniac for a free search for answers and revenge. <br /> The story is that Washington was hired as a bodyguard for small American girls living in Mexico where kidnappings regularly occur (at least according to the film). She becomes attached to a child and plays a winning child actress of our day, Dakota Fanning. When Fanning is kidnapped, Washington goes after the responsible men and nobody is playing. Beware: this movie is not for the sake of sorrow. <br /> <br /> This is a stylish movie that is good and bad. I liked it, but many people thought it was too frenzied for your taste because working with the camera is one that could cause you headaches. I thought it was a tense thing to do, and it was fascinating to see it, but it was (a broken camera), not all tastes. In addition to two stars, Christopher Walken, a low-key role, and many other fine actors are always interesting. <br /> <br /> The movie is subject to the basic emotions, but it works.
