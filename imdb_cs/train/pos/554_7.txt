(contains light spoilers) You are interested in how Anthony Mann uses James Stewart here. Stewart, of course, remembers much like George Bailey of Frank Capra "It's a wonderful life," so it's easy to find parallels between these two movies. In "It's a wonderful life," Bailey sees the world as if he were never born. In a "distant country," Stewart's Jeff Webster, when not engaged to help someone else (apart from himself), basically faces the same direction: a world in which (for all practical matters) does not exist. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Unwilling to look at it, Webster is forced to see those for whom he can not help, but care is wounded, pushed and even killed when he stands and does nothing. It reminds viewer George Bailey that he is looking at the world that turned back, because he also decided not to become involved in never being born. <br /> <br /> Both films end with the same picture - close up of the ringing. Stewart, when he turned his philosophy of non-participation, seems to have gained his "wings".
