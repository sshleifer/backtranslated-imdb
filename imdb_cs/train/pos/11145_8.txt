After racism, rural exodus - also known as rural countryside - is another social-political problem of the 1960s. WestSide Story has dealt with racism as a love affair in an artistic perspective. Now, Midnight Cowboy deals with the rural exodus of the tragedy of friendship in psychological terms. It has a deep ending that we are witnessing the death of one of the two companions of fate. Director John Schlesinger skillfully delivers our deepest secret thoughts, dreams, fantasies, fears and ratings of two New York dirt. While the handsome Joe Buck (Voight) dreams of all the beautiful women of the world begging to share wild love, poor Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman) dreams of a better and healthier life in clean and sunny Florida. That's why Joe becomes a cheater to fulfill his imagination; and Ratso becomes an assailant who collects enough money to move to Florida. In addition to Ratso, Joe helps find his way to what he does. They begin to share everything in life. They share food, share medicine, share uninhabited homes, share their profits and share fate. Unfortunately, as the story progresses, Joe realizes that being handsome is not the only reason why all beautiful women ask to have fun; and in addition Ratso can not see Florida because his heart fails to defeat his illness while he was in the bus there. Might is always fine and Feeble has no right in the daylight. From here, "Midnight" gives a realistic look. <br /> <br /> Despite the tragedy, there is no melodrama in the Midnight Cowboy. Every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who carry their inevitable destiny. This makes Midnight Cowboy a provocative view of the socio-political issue, the rural exodus.
