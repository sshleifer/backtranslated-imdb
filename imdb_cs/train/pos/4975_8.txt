God, I've seen it a long time ago. Probably about 18 years ago? The film tells us (children) about human blood and circulatory system. Very professionally assembled - Disney-style animations, plus human actors - this was driven by Frank Capra, for pete! I wonder if the high value of production is worth figuring out that film belts have information about the human body? The boy, however, will follow these children as he learns: even now I clearly remember Dr Baxter, who himself challenged Hemo to name what the most common material reminds of human blood, which the doctor immediately responds to "seawater".
