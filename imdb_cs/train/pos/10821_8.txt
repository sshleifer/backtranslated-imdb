I also saw it after my release in 56, and since then I have been hit by the last scene. If it is a response to "high noon," then it is an appropriate and reasonable response. The notion that when this string is governed by "The City Gathering," it is a much stronger message than lonely personal heroism "high noon". In this theme, "Concho" is the phenomenal precursor of my favorite favorite, The Magnificent Seven. Both Sinatra and Conrad give an impressive and convincing performance, especially Sinatra's transformation from brother's chic to the liberating city savior. I can only hope that at some point they will have all the friends and family I have been able to experience for myself for the years that have caused my affection for this film.
