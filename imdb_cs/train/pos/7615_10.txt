This show is undoubtedly one of the biggest shows ever seen on television. I think acting is great, tension, drama, comedy, it has everything and a simple story: The plane has hit the plane. The characters are great and Evil Lilly is HOT !!!!!! Matthew Fox shows us again what a great actor Josh Holloway is so great, Jorge Garcia is Merry, I can go on and on. Also unexpected plot plot, back story characters, music that is at the end of each episode. J.J. Abrahms once again proved to be a great writer and producer. I think it's better than ALIAS, and I loved ALIAS. Whoever does not watch this show should definitely consider how to get and watch DVDs because they lack something great. This show could be the best show in TV history!
