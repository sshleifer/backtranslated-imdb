Dev Anand (or Prashant) and Zeenat Aman (Jasbir / Janice) are siblings raised in a single-parent family. Jasbir (sister) grows up in a rich environment, but it is not enough to reject it and eventually joins the hippie movement that eventually leads to medication. Prashant (brother) on the other hand grows in a less rich environment but grows up as a mature gentleman. The story suggests that Prashant seeks to save his little sister (who is constantly in the trance) from the hippie hostile environment. This film is a test of time and reminds that cults and hippie groups are the place for those who give up their lives when they stand up instead and count against face-to-face adversity. Great musical compositions in this movie that mean different things in different situations and different people, and the director brings a horrible feeling to it.
