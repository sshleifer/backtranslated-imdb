MPAA: R rated for violence, language, nudity and short drug use. Quebec Rating: 13 + Canadian Home Video Rating: 18A <br /> <br /> I saw Coonskin today. This movie is also known as Bustin Out and Street Fight. After watching Fritz Cats I wanted to see more Bashki movies. I saw Cool World and I thought it was average and I saw it. When he was released for the first time, the film was very controversial. He was considered racist, and Al Sharpton wanted to forbid the film, even protesting outside the theater, where the film was released only on the VHS under the name Street Fight. Today he is considered a cult-classic film and African-American celebrities such as comedian Richard Pryor, director Spike Lee and rap band The Wu-Tang Clan who enjoyed this film. Personally, I thought Fritz Cat was a much better movie, but it's also nice. It is worth watching for fans of Bashki or Blaxploitation film. The film mixes live action and animation such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit. I would prefer it in full animation but wh atever. The film starts with a reverend and another man who races to save two of his friends from prison. While the prisoners are waiting, the elder tells the story of the three men he knew. The movie then switches to the animation format, seeing the three black men selling their house to this man. They decided to name names in Harlem. So the leader, a black rabbit, kills a big player in Harlem and basically becomes a big shot. The film moves like the Italian mafia wants him out. The Mafia includes a godfather, his three sons, who are homosexuals and an Italian clown. Choonskin is a fun animated movie that's worth trying if you find it.
