I was about thirteen when this movie appeared on television. This is much better than most movies. Martin Sheen is excellent, and although Nick Nolte has a small part, he also provides excellent support. Vic Morrow as a villain is excellent. <br /> <br /> When Sheen "tests water" in his 34 Ford (COOL) along the highway, it's spectacular! <br /> <br /> The end is grand. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed that I got a low voice. I think younger generations are more interested in much of the junk emails that come out of these days. Good taste avoids masses!
