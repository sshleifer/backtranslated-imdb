OK, so FX does not have a high budget. But this story is based on real events. There is nothing in common to a few rich actors, even richer! Like most books that are based on books, there are things that are not right. Only a few people said that this film was based on real events, not as a knock-off, because most people believe it is! This movie is by no means related to TWISTER! Other than the two films are tornadoes. For those of you who have trouble with the science of tornadoes and storms in the movie, there are a few things you need to remember. The "Twisters Night" was June 3, 1980. So this movie was released 16 years after real events. Try to realize how far the storm research has advanced. It happened in a bigger city; Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the state. Although the film calls the city something different and says it's a small town.
