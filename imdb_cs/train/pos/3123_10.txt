That's the first ten out of ten that I've given some movie. What made this movie so good to me? Constant action - there are no slow parts, great gaming, intelligent writing. I also liked the movie style where shakes and different angles just seemed to be part of the scene. Finally, I look at an action movie that does not try to please everyone in the public domain (that is, there is no forced romance). I liked the first two Bourne movies. <br /> <br /> Warning - after watching this movie you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to be a little calmer than driving your car!
