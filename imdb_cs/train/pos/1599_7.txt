"Moonstruck" is a beautiful little film driven by an excellent story, Norman Jewis (At Night, Fiddler on the Roof, Hurricane). The movie is great on many levels. It shows a good piece of Italian culture, has a touch romance and (best of all) is a cheerful comedy. One thing I was most interested in was the relative unconventional appearance of the actors. Nicolas Cage looks remarkably strange to most of the movie and Cher ... well, Cher always looks a little weird. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a fun movie and it's easy to recommend. <br /> <br /> 7.4 of 10
