MONTH IN THE MONTH is in the 1950s a warm and moving age track centered on a farmer's family. The main story follows a 14-year-old girl (Reese Witherspoon), who decays to a seventeen-year-old neighbor (Jason London) who eventually falls for her older sister (Emily Warfield) and how unexpected tragedies change the dynamics of this family forever. The 1950s are evoked mercifully and the script gives you those characters you've almost taken care of. Witherspoon is already beginning to showcase the talented Oscar talent that would develop in this early role, and London is a charming lead man. Warfield delivers silent maturity to the role of an older sister, which is also effective. Kudos to Sam Waterston and Tess Harper who play the girls' parents and Gail Strickland, who plays a London mom. I was unexpectedly moved by this silent and influential drama that produces strong emotions and gives deeper meaning to the expression "family ties".
