Obviously, this movie never got to the big screen in Denmark, so I had to wait for the release of the video. My expectations, if they are high, but they are by no means disappointed. As with Ang Lee, there is fantastic acting, intelligent and thrilling plot that you have to guess to the end and great shooting. Together with Unforgiven it's simply one of the two best westerns of the 1990s. People who expect something along Mel Gibson's line in Patriot (chmurno) or Braveheart (acceptable) will be sour disappointment, all others who appreciate the above features will have a fantastic time tracking it. 9 out of 10.
