In fact, it's one of those movies you'd have to give 7.5. The reality is; as has been said, it is very fun. Beautifully atmospheric. Askey really meets over the top, but it's a great way for him, like Mrs. Porter's for Will's hay. If you like old movies and trains from dark houses, then it's definitely for you. <br /> <br /> It is a wonderful movie that you will want to see again and again. It's friendly and charming, and it's all great, with all the nostalgic links that made great war fares. The "special" band of the character simply vanishes as it happens in many other typical British wars. It would be amazing to see this film if it was shot by Ealing. The real pity that the original from 1931 did not survive intact
