This is a movie I decided to go and see because I am a huge fan of adult animation. I often find that when a film unfolds around a famous actor or actress, but rather a story or style, it allows the film to be perceived more as a work of art than the ability of actors to differentiate their style. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely more about the style than about the story. While I discovered the interesting story (a thriller that borrows the story and the atmosphere from films like Blade Runner and many anime movies), it was sometimes hard to watch and did not feel like it was all together, just as it could have. He definitely had a mixed sense of French animation and the Japanese anime. Whether it's a good thing or not is dependent on the viewer. Visually, this film is an enchanting eye and in this sense an artwork. <br /> <br /> If you like adult animation or want to see a movie that is currently different from most films. I would recommend it. The only thing I can say is that I enjoyed the film experience, but I was a little disappointed because it could have been better
