Sudden impacts are two stories. Harry is focused on the crowd who wants to kill him, and Harry is glad to return him a favor and show them how to do it. This little war gives Harry a pause that he does not care about, but has gone on a small vacation. Now is the second part of the story. Someone kills some punks and Harry gets into this situation where he meets Jennifer Spencer's wife with the secret that a small tourist town wants to keep silent. The police chief is not a gentle man, and Harry warns him not to get involved or cause any trouble. This is Harry Callahan Trouble follows. Dave watches him in this city and hell opens when Harry goes to war. Meanwhile, she is cautiously withdrawing and the gang who finds her is ready for her. Jennifer Spencer is captured and Harry gets to her during a movie bout. Sudden impacts are not the biggest dirty Harry, but at that time he gives Harry, who is very opposed to a hero ready to go to war, just to seek justice. Again, not the best, not the worst, but the one with the most famous line. Go Ahead Make your day.
