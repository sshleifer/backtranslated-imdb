This movie is very cheerful and has a great compilation of actors such as William H. Macy who have always performed this kind of role, perhaps his most representative Fargo; and George Clooney, who is a very good actor who shows his comedic work in the Cohen Brothers movie "Oh, brother, where are you?" which is one of my favorite movies at all! But it was hard to find "Welcome to Collinwood," here in Mexico. My city lacks a good place to buy some good movies. I tried to buy it in Blockbuster, but it does not know by its original name, so maybe it will be a little easier to find if I have a name they gave him in Mexico, does anyone know? Because I can not forget! Cheers. AND.
