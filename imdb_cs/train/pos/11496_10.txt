Love this movie as well. He saw this when Germany appeared for the first time in a small independent cinema in Frankfurt. It was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere. The film's erotic has hit audiences and the discussion with Moritz Boerner, producer and director, has always been underlined. In his genre, it was a very ambitious film, especially when you think it's an independent film. There are not many copies of this film, Mortitz Boerner came from the theater and produced two three short films more worked for television before becoming a kind of therapist. For people who want to see the movie again, you can find it on its home page, which is not so easy to search for, but it is possible.
