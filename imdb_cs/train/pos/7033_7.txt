First, DO NOT take it for the remake of '63. Even though this version is really true, it is extremely long. Casting was good with a few exceptions. Chyna Phillips was not a good choice. She was almost 30 years old when she made this film, and it was hard to believe she was a teenager. Jason Alexander was a good choice, but after a while he gave me a headache. Tyne Daly takes her role as Mae Peterson. George Wendt was funny like Harry McAffee and showed he could even keep the melody. Like movies '63, they flew an unknown to play Conrad Birdie. Marc Kudisch had fun with the role of Birdie and showed up. I even have a soundtrack and I like to listen to his singing. So what made the difference in TV ratings from this movie? It was tedious. Insert new songs and scenes. While some of the new songs were good (for example, "Let's Settle Down"), was that really necessary? Do not let me down, I liked it, but rather watch the '63 movie (see my review). It was just the case when some actors exaggerated the roles, made some changes and again LENGTH. One more thing I forgot to mention is Vanessa Williams. She works well with role and music. Give her some lyrics and she could sing them. So here is my advice that comes from someone who has made several productions Bye Bye Birdie: If you want to watch the funny take on the game, look at the '63 film. If you want to watch the version that is really true, look at the '95 version. Just remember it. Do not be a hero and try to watch everything in one sitting.
