I'm a fan of ART, I like something about art, I like paintings, sculptures, etc. This movie shows it so I like it a lot, it shows how a woman wants something to paint about art, especially a naked body, but she can not do it because of her (father), she had naked herself at the beginning of the film, but she wanted men for her paintings, but her family did not allow her to bar nude men because it was against moral. Even Artemisia could draw her friend and art teacher completely naked. She falls in love with her artistic teacher, and it seems that the artistic teacher is completely in love with her, so at the end she sacrifices her freedom for her lying. He said he had raped her, but it was not true. Artemisia fell in love with him, but if she says she will suffer a lot, because in the process of Artemisia, her father and art teacher, somebody hurt the artistic hands to say. I think it's a great movie about ART and artistic love, it's worth watching. Valentina Cervi is great like Artemisia, it works very well, and I like her performance in "Portrait of a Lady" like Pansy Osmond. 8.5 / 10
