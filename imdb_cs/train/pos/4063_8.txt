The castle in the sky is undoubtedly the film Hayao Miyazaki. After seeing it for the first time, I'm glad it will not disappoint. On the contrary, you get your time, which means (as far as Miyazaki's movies are concerned), it's nothing but excellent! <br /> <br /> Produced early in his cinematographic career, Castle in the Sky anticipates many of the brands in his later films, with strong (but young) female characters forced to grow up due to outside circumstances, helped by very interesting (and sometimes nice) supporting characters. And of course the usual battles of nature versus civilization, flying machines (much of them!), Beautiful painted scenery? but unfortunately, no pigs (at least what I noticed, after all I only saw it once). Miyazaki, however, had a theatrical debut with Nausicaa two years ago, which was a dress test for Princess Mononoke, his magnum opus. Cloud Castle is part of the two, with a soft action packed for the first 30 minutes, reminiscent of his television series Conan and his directorial episodes, Meitante Holmes. This is where Sheeta, the girl who literally falls from the sky, only presents her to Pazu, a young boy working in a small rural mining town. She is interested in her amnesia and suspects the connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa. Pazu is ready to help her find out where she came from while escaping the army and gang of pirates. As the film progresses, the plot becomes heavier and more interesting, revealing Myiazaki in its best form. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack reminds of Spirited Away (or, conversely, because the castle was first made in the sky) and like his director Joe Hisaishi - the composer starts a very light score, which becomes more complex and beautiful, as the storyline goes on! <br /> <br /> Note on English dubbing with a good interpretation of two stars, although Sheeta Anna Paquina has a very strong accent (which the actress still had at that time in her career) and set off for Mark Hamil as Muska, to make up for the joyous yet a devilish villain! <br /> <br /> Do not miss this one people!
