Yes, I call it a perfect movie. It's not one boring second, fantastic cast of mostly little actresses and actors, a lot of characters that are all well defined, and they all have compelling motifs that I can compassionate, perfect lighting, sharp black and white photographs, good soundtrack, intelligent and harmonious scenic design and story that deals with and works. It's one of the best shots on which to relax all the pride of Hollywood, a brand that everyone should strive to achieve. Barbara Stanwyck is just amazing. This actress could not do anything, and she always moved on the melodramatic side. No hysterical explosions with this lady-I always thought she was a better actress than a screen goddess like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, and this movie confirmed my opinion. Always as tenacious as nails and at the same time bringing true feelings. It is fair to say that during her long career she has also gained many good parts, and this is probably the least interesting. The title fits very well with this movie. These are desires, human desires, which I think everyone can understand. In fact, nobody is interested in this movie, all the characters are acting on the impulse, everyone wants to be happy without hurting someone else. The sad fact that it often leads to complications makes dramatic content I do not want to go to. <br /> <br /> I like what this movie says about youth, maturing, and the need to compromise. The film most associated with is Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of Doubt, creating a similar atmosphere of the idealized and cartoon Small Town America. The story has some resemblance to the much harder film Clash by Night, produced by Fritz Lang, which took place a year before Stanywck played a similar role. I can also recommend.
