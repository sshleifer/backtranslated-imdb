William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) bought an old house where a brutal murder happened many years ago in a very bad state with the intention of restoring it. They move with their daughter Sophie (Emma RidleY) and become friends with their neighbors Jean (Patricia Maynard) and George Evans (Brian Croucher). There are terrible events in the house, including the death of Sophie's cat. Sophie's birthday party celebrates blood and they leave the place and publish the secrets later. "House Bled to Death" is scary and one of the best episodes of the "Hammer House of Horror" series. The fantastic twist, the revelation of secrets and the tragic conclusion are really excellent. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "A Casa Que Sangrou At√© Morrer"
