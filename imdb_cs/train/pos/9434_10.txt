I remember seeing this movie on television a few years ago and not paying attention, maybe even missing the first half, so I concluded that it was boring and overvalued. I decided to return yesterday evening to find out if I forgot the first time something. I certainly did. This is one of the most disturbing and amazing movies of all time, and today it has a clear influence on movies and is likely to be forever. I can not believe I thought this movie was boring! Young Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds perform their career and are supported by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. This story will leave you with feelings of disgust and fear long after you look at it, it's really scary. Oh, and I mentioned that it's also a great song? Well it is, and this movie should be seen by all fans of the film. <br /> <br /> Every movie should see this experience. Just do not expect a picnic.
