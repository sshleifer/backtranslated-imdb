A sad story about the downed pilot B-17. Brady is shot down over the occupied territory. Local ranchers gave him kindness and protection at the cost of his own life. I have never heard of this movie and captured me for two hours. After the movie I'm glad I did the time. It's the whole story explaining the look of Brady's face at the beginning of the movie.
