John Singleton's best film, before appearing as a fan like Shaft remake, is a provocative film with a total great actor and an excellent balance of stories of three main characters, each with identifiable young problems. She also liked the fact that it also concerns the problem of suicide in young blacks, a problem that mostly ignores media and other films that mostly focus on social and economic issues and white racism. This film shows that blacks can be just as unconscious and racist. The masterpiece of this film is that it deals with so many themes without getting shallow. It's not just about racism, it's about how difficult it is to get into a new world (college), raping data, exploring sexuality and isolation. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Kristy Swanson each deliver a gentle performance. The supporting cast is as interesting as Jennifer Connelly as lez (yay) and Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes as college bums causing small riots. <br /> <br /> The only negative is the cartoon of Professor Laurence Fishburne ("Peppermint?"). Certainly a lot of professors are nuts. But they are not so flat. Skinheads are a bit of a cartoon, but I think they're in real life. Overall, a great underestimated piece of film, if you like American history X, you will love this. <br /> <br /> 8.5 of 10
