Musings: Charming from start to finish. It's not a laugh but a smoother and more sophisticated humor. What is the golden minute of great scenes and actors, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robars Sr. Cary Grant is in the house of his new home, which is at the moment framed. The young carpenter, who plays the future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants his "lallies to be ashamed" or some sort of thing the carpenter would know. Grant, who did not want to look unconscious, responds positively. Barker yells to his friends: "Okay, boys, he wants to kiss them, so ... YOU ARE EM EM!" A second later you hear the ripping and tearing of about 20 large nails pulled out of different plates. All Grant can do is moan. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is dated. You would never see that many carpenters working at one time in one family home, and such a place in Connecticut in all places would probably run several million dollars. A classic movie that is really a treasure.
