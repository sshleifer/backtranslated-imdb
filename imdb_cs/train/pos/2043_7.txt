I just saw this movie last night at the Toronto Film Festival where he played in the Midnight Madness section. To tell you the truth, the only reason I went for this movie was sharing her name with Radiohead, and also because my friend bought tickets, so I really did not have a choice: it's like Silence, but it turned out to be a semi-gore flick. Someone has already mentioned that none of the characters are sympathetic, and that's perfectly correct. I really would not have had to worry if Potente's character had gotten her Creep outfits. I was rooted to the homeless to keep it alive, because Potente's character got her only for desserts. Christopher Smith certainly did a great job with the visual aspect of the film. The story is rather weak, but then again the whole movie looked like you scared the bullshit and it was quite effective. Bristol's The Insects score was top-notch. That was more than anything else, really scared of what was happening. The director was a really decent guy and was quite fun during the Q & A. I really hope he will have a better film in the future. <br /> <br /> It is exclusively for fans of the genre, but I recommend to non-fans to try it out. It was a fun ride.
