I love this TV series so much. contains an animation that is interesting and beautiful. I can not believe they cut it off on television and that I never knew if cybersix and data7 would die or not, they probably will survive, but I'm not sure. Cybersix was by far the best TV show ever. I know it's too late to hope to start the series again, so I'm really glad I was looking at it. I've taken so many <3 <br /> <br /> his about women called cybersix, not human. She goes adrian seeldman, a male university teacher. Now cybersix is ​​actually a woman, nowadays she is simply dressed as a man. At night cybersix watches the city. A guy named Von Reichter is the one who created the cybersix and when he finds out he is alive, he uses everything he can to capture her. <Br /> <br /> If you have never seen it, you should download it completely. It was the best TV show in the world. Why did they cut it ???? some people have problems. but I'm glad I have to watch 13 episodes.
