One of several musicals about seafarers on vacation, a typical sailor meets a girl, complications and a happily solved plot. It is going smoothly enough, even in places. The dialogue is not as rumored as "Top Hat," and Randolph Scott seems to be out of the box. There are compensations. It includes some of Irving Berlin's most selected songs, including Let Itself Go, I Put All My Eggs in a Basket, and Let's Face the Music and Dance. This is Fred and Ginger, who will take any film into heavenly heights while dancing and here they will not disappoint. They do a nice dance dance, comic dance and swirl dancing dance all in the same movie! Great versatility and art. <br /> <br /> She also has Harriet Hilliard, who is rather good in her role. She had a diverse career and became the more famous Harris Nelson and Ozzy. Here it touches without being sentimental. His two songs are simply and effectively delivered. She makes a good contrast with Ginger, but you can believe they are sisters in the movie. <br /> <br /> More tightening has made the movie even better. Pretty good.
