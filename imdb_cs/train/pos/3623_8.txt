Disney could be here for something. They first recalled the Titans with Denzel, a story based on the truth of sports and a small town in Central America. Now with Quaid and The Rookie ... another sporting story based on the truth. Both films sometimes move you to tears, and they both smile at you and feel warm when you see them. My wife and I were at The Rookie and we expected it to be a great feeling of a good movie. We let it go, when we asked him if we bought it on DVD when it came out, it was insignificant. Most certainly.
