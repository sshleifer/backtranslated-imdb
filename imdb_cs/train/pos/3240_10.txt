I discovered the film many years ago and thought (and yet) why it did not recognize it. Well-written, beautiful acting, one ironic twist after another, and it's VEHICLE in what the dishonest characters are trying to do. I do not intend to recommend this movie to people with short attention; it requires enough intelligence to understand that this story is perhaps the core of truth.
