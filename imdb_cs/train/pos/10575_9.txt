Fast-paced, entertaining, sexy and spectacular. Cagney is always amazing. Blondel enchants you with your joy and energy. Obviously, this is a film before censored inscription in script, costumes and the way they touch each other. And bikini before bikini! This is not a barrier for everyone. I do not understand John Garfield. Does it matter whether or not it is in this movie? If it is, the screen is so short that it is basically a pad. You have to follow her by the frame to even find him if he was there. I'm a big fan of Cagney but never seen before. I found it on Turner Classics. I found it for a terrible accident. Sit back and enjoy your ride!
