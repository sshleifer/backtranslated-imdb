I do not know if it's a sitcom or not, but I agree that it's one of the biggest TV shows ever. It's great that this show is still being broadcast. I love Michelle. She's cute about the episodes when the baby was and she talked, and she sometimes said something funny. Aw. <br /> <br /> This show can relate to children and adolescents and .. well, families when they fight in harsh times and try to resolve them as a family. I do not know who would ever refuse the opportunity to watch this show with someone. <br /> <br /> I love an episode when I think her name is DD .. the older girl accidentally stole a sweatshirt and she learned a lesson about theft. It was a great episode. An example that this TV show shows that the family is working as a family. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show to everyone.
