Nice Shirely Temple short. Child actors screaming at their lines seemed to be the norm for that day and time. Maybe it was "seen and not heard" had to be invented. Besides, it's fun. Because of the film era, there are certain aspects of the matter, from the social point of view, which I consider to be very progressive and liberal. I'm not going to go here, I'd rather not want it for you, but you let her watch her and see if you can see these elements. How soon it was easy to see from this short fascination that had already evolved for the temple. This will help you watch if you are a Temple fan. For others, it's a great way to kill ten minutes while you wait for your glass of milk to warm up on the stove.
