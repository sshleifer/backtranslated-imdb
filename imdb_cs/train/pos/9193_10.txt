This is true for the original manga of the same name, aka (Tramps Like Us in the US), but you can still enjoy it even if you did not read the manga. It's a different kind of tail, showing a strong and independent woman who hurts like everyone else. But because of her external power she is afraid she is showing her inner feelings, leaving those who have harmed her with their blunt remarks. The only one who really tells her and who she can be, is her new pet ... man ... Momo. If you want anything other than normal boring stuff with some of the wonderful J-Dorama actors (Japanese dramas), then it's definitely a series that you will watch ... and read!
