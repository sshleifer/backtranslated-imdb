In this sequel to action comic classic K-9, Detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee return to fight the crime, but this time they are linked to another detective [Christine Tucci] and her partner Dobrman named Zues, who with Jerry Lee does not very well. Dooley does not even like his new partner. It all changes as the movie continues. The film is intense because it's a man who really wants to kill Dooley how he'd been treated in the past. There are some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of Dooley's wife who do not really seem to be with the movie's tone because the rest of the movie is action sequences, funny joke dogs, fart jokes, and jokes about dogs biting bad guys in a certain area. I know it looks like a very low humor, but some of them are really fun. I did not see a joke movie, I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is because I'm a big fan of James Belushi and the other is for action sequences. James Belushi is more fun than K-9 and the action sequences are also better. It would be nice to see more characters from the K-9 to come back, but it's still a fun movie. If you are a fan of James Belushi, you will love this movie.
