A nice story about watching your dreams and actually taking a sting. It was not easy for Morris - he had a family, a job, a job, a job, a mortgage, etc. - it was not like he could just drop what he was doing, and the boy's guy grew to play the AAA ball for four months. It took courage. I'm glad they showed his indecision, almost until he got callup on majors. I remember seeing the Red Sox pitch (I think ...), that was a great story. Although Morris actually looks more like John Kruk or Mills Watson than Quaid - that's fine. <br /> <br /> Quaid does a very good job of playing a man, a teacher, a trainer and the "oldest newcomer" .... As a person in the same age group, I can definitely identify my situation. You are not too old to do what you dreamed of as a child, but it gets there. You have to do this before the lator. <br /> <br /> Hard to say, nicely dressed, they walked, it was good to see the familiar faces of late Royce Applegate, Brian Cox and Rachel Griffiths. <br /> <br /> Good work everywhere, I'm glad to see it happen. <br /> <br /> *** Apart from **** ... who would think that Tampa Devil Rays would be the subject of such a good movie at the beginning?
