It's one of the wild movies I've been watching recently. This is because it seems less like a movie and more like an experimental film. Kurasawa's experiment was supposed to attract a number of people who live in the rubbish dump and weave their experiences in a tapestry that offers insights into their generally harsh existence. Not every episode is depressing and cruel, but overall it is definitely a tone. Let's see that ... we have a case of blood, rape, attempted murder, wife change, alcoholism, infidelity, death of a little boy after eating a spoiled fish, a person with severe depression (he never talks about the movie and looks a very scary dreamer Probably diagnosed with schizophrenia, a mentally retarded young man who thinks he is the street conductor and spent all his waking hours, he 'drove' his street car through the paths between garbage piles (I think I liked her character even less than an incestuous bully! ) etc. In fact, it is so depressing that it almost seemed like Ingmar Bergman's film in Japan because Bergman made many movies tended to solve mental illness and hopelessness of life.We are no wonder that after doing this film Kurasawa tried to kill himself So, did I enjoy it? No. It was not fun, but it was a very well filmed movie that definitely keeps el my attention and as a result I really wanted to see what happened to these people. It was a bit like watching a train wreck - you do not see the whole carnage, but you can not just look! Of all the vignettes, I think the older man, who tried to watch everyone and who does not really seem to fit (he was too well-groomed and wise to live in a garbage dump), Kurasawa himself. Maybe. I do not know. If you've seen different Kurasawa movies and have high tolerance for strange art movies, put your watch on. However, DO NOT constrain your first experience watching his movies - it is sure to scare many viewers!
