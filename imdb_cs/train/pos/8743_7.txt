A good movie with strong performances (especially two leads). The film is about two American girls who are captured at the Thai airport with heroin weighing 6 kilograms. Both are thrown into prison and one of them supports the confession. Bill Pullman plays a lawyer trying to get them out. All he has to do is find Nick Parks, who put the narcotics in the bag of one of the two girls. So far for a story that is not original (it has many similarities with a better return to paradise). Attractive and Newton Thomas Sigel beautiful photographs make this movie worth watching. A 7 out of 10.
