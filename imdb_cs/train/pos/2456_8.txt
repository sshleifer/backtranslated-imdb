When I was watching this movie, my expectations were really low, but I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I thought I was going to watch the boring teen-flick, but in fact it's an interesting and well done plot, the acting was somewhat convincing - especially from Melville who really shows his talent in this movie, and the battle scenes - for a low-budget movie - were very well done. I think this movie deserves a wider audience than it has received. It is a movie that can be seen by the whole family - perhaps not the smallest of the children, because it contains rather harsh scenes. A film about love and problems that can happen when you oppose your family traditions. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is very similar to "Bend It Like Beckham," but actually I think this movie will pull it off better.
