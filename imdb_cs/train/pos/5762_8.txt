I have to admit I'm looking forward to bad movies. I love them looking at them. Especially terrible. My friends and I all gather after a busy week at school and work, borrow some crazy tapes, order pizza and blast. This one had a big box so I waited less than usual. The story concerns a housing project that is built over a nuclear facility that has bulldozed overhead layers and the other underground layers are simply covered. Residents of this neighborhood find sheltered facilities when some children fall into a hole inside the cave. It wakes up with some zombies. From now on, it's a piece town. Gore effects and actions will never stop until the end of role credits. OK, it's not a great art, but this, with its in-joke dialogue and over-top-fervent stuff was our favorite evening. In fact, it was one of the best "party tapes" I've ever had the pleasure of watching. And you could say it was done without money, with a bunch of mad people. There are hundreds of zombies, and the director looks like Brendan Frazer (he's a friend) and it's just a wild trip.
