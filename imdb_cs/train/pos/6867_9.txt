I was born in 1982. Most of the children's memories are in the late 80's and 90's. I watched Groove Tube for the first time in 2001 when I was 19. So I thought it was fun. So for anyone who thinks something "dated" can not be quite funny 30 years later .... think again! It's funny, even if you have no idea what it is in the 1970s, and the idea of ​​a curly-denim pants causes Who can argue with the Bozo Klaun type who reads mature literature? There's a lot of laughter. Scrotal puppet show at the end is the best.
