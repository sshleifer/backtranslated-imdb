John Waters gave us a really nice movie. It certainly is not without shocking water moments, but it is beyond its older cultivated things, such as "Pink Flamingoes". "Pecker" returns to the early mainstream of John in reminding the viewer of the same kind of humor that was evident in the "Polyester". Overall, a really fun comedy with some great moments!
