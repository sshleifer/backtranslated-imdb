I bought it from cheap rent at our store. It was almost in a mint condition and I never heard of it. Of course, no one else. I can not believe my luck. You are going through the whole area of ​​emotion and trying to overcome the complex message - undoubtedly the moral and non-triumphal attitude of the Party of Mandela. Despite its huge length (I had to watch it in two sessions) - it was like a book I could not destroy. Maybe the songs are not all that's memorable, but the spirit of things shines forever. I do not understand the notes that a musical instrument (clearly intended for the scene) is not realistic! I saw the "South Pacific" and I also read a book and I can guarantee that the music is not realistic compared to the book. I want this little discovery until it's exhausted. One day he will do it for a better budget. <br /> <br />
