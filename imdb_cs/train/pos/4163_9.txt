I saw it as a child in the late 1980s and I must say that Galaxy Express is one of those films that has long been in your imagination. If you've never grasped the attraction of anime, discovering this movie may be your golden ticket to the city of Otaku. The story is as delicate and poetic as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The animation of the cells, though somewhat traditional, has a lively style that exponentially portrays Leiji Matsumoto's great talent for character creation and visual narrative. This is one of those unique children's films such as Star Wars, The Dark Crystal, and Magician from Oz, which completely exceeds the state of "family entertainment" and stands for classical cinema according to their own words. I highly recommend this movie.
