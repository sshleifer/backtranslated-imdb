I really loved this movie, yes, I know it was quite far, it's not possible that the Shelby car managed to stay on track as well as the 540i with all the controls of traction and other gizmos, but besides the fact that the whole movie was well assembled. Cage was as good as usual and the rest of the cast was also pretty good, except Brit Bad Guy, was a little too "too" you do not think? Anyway great movie, great cars and great acting. Once I made sure my car was closed and alarmed in my remote-controlled garage. :)
