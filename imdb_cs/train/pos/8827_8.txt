With a minimum budget, 8 minutes and a lot of fantasy, Nacho Vigalondo has reached one of the most moving shorts I've ever seen. The inconspicuousness of the script is really remarkable, because it does not end until the last moment. Do not let anyone tell you what it is about because you will be able to enjoy it much more. Nacho Vigalondo is the discovery of the year for his one-man show: Directing, writing and acting in this impressive short is the most striking effort I've seen in years. Also pay attention to the performance of Marta Belenguer, her reaction shots are incredible. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 8/10
