It is interesting how the flow of research can flow. I started to look at an article about Crist "Gates" in Central Park. The article said that Maysles have been Cristo's filmmakers for years. Hmmm ... Then I looked at their work. I believe he handed one of them, but the other is still filming Cristo and Jean Claude in their stages of creation. Gray Gardens sounded very interesting. Video station, in Boulder CO, is a place to look obscure or unconventional and of course it is in stock. DVD and VHS. Edith and Edie are women living in the past and oh what a glorious past. Edith was good, she was born to Bouvier, she was well married, she had some beautiful relationships and became a singer when she was forty-nine. Her daughter Edie was a d√©butante, a fashion model and she had many beans. She never married, and sometimes she returned home to recover from the thirties. He seems to have some nervous disorder. It worries too many things. It's just the shadow of the world they live in because Jackie O. came and took a bath so her aunt and cousin would not be evicted. This is a 28-room house that is worn out and worn out. But in the movie, you will notice a fresh color on the walls. If you look closely at the newspaper clippings, you'll see that it's a dirty mess. Equipping Edie comes with a very clever and creative one. The viewer has the impression that Edith loves the act, but he does not have a movie. Edith was really quite beautiful and you can see the shadow of her beauty still when she sings "Tea for Two". Edie was also beautiful in her day and quite attractive to 56. It was a good movie, though not for everyone. When a cat urinates behind Edith's portait, she says, "At least somebody does what they want"!
