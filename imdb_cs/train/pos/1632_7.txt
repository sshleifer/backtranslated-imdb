Are they disappearing in military school? Hmmmm, it sounds funny, maybe even for some. You have those characters, an Arab thief, a sex crazy teenager, a smart mouth, a smoker and do not forget that guy who burns things. Do not hurt strictly any nonsense Sergeant, homosexual sergeant and one teacher of sexy ammunition and it makes it a crazy movie adventure. I've seen this movie and it's funny, because comedies revolve around the fact that when you're trying to work together, they do things. <br /> <br /> This group of students unknowingly at the Weinberg Military School was located here because, as Sgt Liceman says, "because you are outcasts, embarrassment to your families and community, shame." One of the previous performances of Ralph Macchia in front of Karate Kid and my cousin Vinny, who also appeared from Barbara Bach, this film attracts teens and young adults. <br /> <br /> Great soundtrack keeps the film moving.
