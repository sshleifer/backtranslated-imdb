This film is a moving story about the adventure that was taken by 15-year-old Darius Weems. Darius has Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, an unsatisfactory illness that at the age of nineteen took his brother's life and is America's number one killer. He and a few close friends travel all over the country to Los Angeles to get their trolley on MTV, Pimp My Ride, one of his favorite shows. The journey begins in Georgia, where Darius grew up and never left. Gang head to the west for a trip that all of its participants will never forget. Darius first gets to the boat, runs in a hot-air balloon, swims in the ocean and visits the sights he always wanted to see as Grand Canyon and New Orleans. Movie makers here have a clear connection with the material. They do not make money from selling $ 20 DVDs. $ 17 goes to research the disease and $ 3 goes to create more copies. The film has won over 25 awards at festivals and I agree with the quotation given to the Variety film "Sure to Mix the Heart".
