The fun and substantial film, Non-Stop, earned a comparison with "Run Lola Run". The film is rapidly evolving into a sequence of persecutions, during which viewers learn about three main characters through flashback and sequencing. Chase does not serve as a rapid culmination, but as the path that makes up most of the film. During the run, we see that the characters are growing and for a moment forgetting their sad life, the "macho" roles they have bought, and eventually forgetting why they started to run first. Just as the fights provided "clarity" for characters in the "Fight Club", the run provides the characters of this film with the means to move away from the false values ​​that all allow the company to create for us. Their run serves as a way to actually taste life from an unharmed perspective and all three find a certain level of clarity and joy in the process. My awards and entertainment just disappeared slightly at the end of the film, where instead of learning from their experience, the characters seem to return to the fact that they are coming out of the mock macho roles that I thought escaped from paths. was not previously distributed outside Japan.
