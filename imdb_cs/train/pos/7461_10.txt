Comparable with Fight Club, The Matrix, A.I., Sixth Sense, among others. This movie is approaching the psyche as never before. The first 30 minutes creates an interesting love story between Diaz-Cruise-Cruz. The rest of the movie is, well, confusing, you choose more whenever you look at it (I've seen movies to see it three times)
