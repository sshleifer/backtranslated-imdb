"Johnny Dangerous" is a kind of hit and a missing comedy that laughs and "huh?". But I suggest giving him a chance. I think it's overlooked. Not many people give this film a chance. It works. Just think of it as a little parody "Goodfellas". Michael Keaton is very funny in his role. And it does well. Johnny Dangerously is a gangster who wants to move on in his life. It only goes from the big boss to the beautiful woman. And of course like a lot of mobsters, somebody wants to be dead. 90% of the jokes laugh. I said he would give him a chance. Take your favorite gangster movies and mix comedy. You have "Johnny dangerously". <br /> <br /> 7/10
