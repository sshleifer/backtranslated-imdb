This film was impressive. My first experience with foreign film was not too long or too complicated. I myself enjoyed the subtitles; and the fence was surprisingly fresh. The story of an adult son who attended his elder father and slowed down his brother after long separation had first appeared clich√© but proved to be very moving and realistic. There was also some fine humor to avoid suppressing or bored audiences.
