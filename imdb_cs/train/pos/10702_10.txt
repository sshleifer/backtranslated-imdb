From what the critics and the audience said, BIRTHDAY GIRL had to be a big fat slurry. However, because I love Nicole Kidman, I decided to rent it last night. It turned out to be pretty good watching. Sure, it's not your basic American comedy, and it's not brilliant to realize it's a very British film, but that's why I liked it. It was a change from all the other films around me, the breath of fresh air. Sure, there was a conspiracy, but overall it worked. First Kidman was wonderful again in a very different, not very charming but still quite sexy role. He just proves he's one of the best talents in Hollywood. Not only is her Russian accent when she speaks English effectively, but there are times when after long conversations in Russian, and if you did not know it was Nicole Kidman, you would never question her authenticity. Harrison Ford was to take note of the "K-19". Overall, a small, small film that works despite terrible buzzing.
