(I apologize for my faulty tongue, I'm not a native speaker ...) Yes, it's a movie that almost requires a huge response. Personally, I agree with all the superlatives that are around. But I do not use it as a rather sematically invalid way of describing myself here. Because you "perfect! The only and the only one!" - Review that some people turn away (including me). So if you're looking for another Hamlet that has the potential to compete with many theatrical and all cinematic - Do not miss this if you find it anywhere. (Unfortunately, too many people will not be able to see it. There does not seem to be a DVD, and the German version, which is quite well done, is not available in any format.) <br /> <br /> Only in case, that you decide to get a copy: Replace that you cut the two hour (or so) version of this movie. It's no use and no fun, and it gives a bad impression of a movie that is interesting in the current and architecture. And it also crippled the 4: 3 aspect ratio. <br /> <br /> Hello from Germany, F.L.
