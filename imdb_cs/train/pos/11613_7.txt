Distortion is a movie that caught me in surprise. This is a multilayered drama that focuses on a person who writes about his life experiences at the moment. To be more accurate, he feels that his wife is cheating on him, so he hires his private eye to look at him. His wife does not know it's happening. Meanwhile, the actors in this game also have a few people who get rid of their sleeves by deceiving each other and along with the words of hopeless people in the world of Israel. The whole thing culminates in the theater with all the actors present and predictable (but not really) happening. The director of the work really keeps things moving along with cast casting and editing in a way that makes you pay attention, it's a fun movie in fact, the one that did not mind viewing and I recommend people to check.
