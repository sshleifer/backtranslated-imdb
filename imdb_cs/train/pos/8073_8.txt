A great portrait of a traitor (Victor McLaglen in the Oscar), who is persecuted by his own conscience. McLaglen plays the IRA roulette that betrays his leader to earn a reward during the Irish rebellion of Sinn Fein. Scenes showing matches and crowd events are very realistic and focus on desperation within individuals. Lack of hope for a better future seems fate worse than death. Director John Ford famously creates a dark and tense atmosphere, enhanced by the vague and dirty drawing of the Irish landscape. Max Steiner's dramatic music score adds to the film's delight. Oscar Winner also for Best Screenplay, nominated for Best Picture. This is one of the classic Hollywoods.
