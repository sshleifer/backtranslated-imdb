It's an interesting little hit of 1967, with cool jazz twang soundtrack music and a plot that will laugh at you ... OK, it's not really stupid, but it's fun fun. I have seen many similarities between this and "A Blood Dead Creature" and have the same director! Scotland Yard is the best investigating murder of young women at college. Criminals seem to be released from a local prison to make an offer of a bad guy and then return when their work is done. It's a smart device hidden inside a Bible burning prussic acid, and there's another device that's neither handy nor secret, it looks like a big spray gun, and the victim has to be pretty submerged before it's over. Joachim Fuchsberger plays an inspector and mostly chews rubber and looks in the distance. There is a "monk" and as someone identifies him as a "monk" he is behind me, he carries a whip and dressed in a red suit with a red hood, rather a Clan member of a different color than a monk. There are all kinds of handy devices such as a fireplace fireplace that moves up and down to admit a monk and goes directly over the fire without forgetting that the garment appears, and that was a great trick. This is an odd combo of criminal drama with fraudulent stimuli, and while it's rather silly sometimes it's fun to watch. 7 out of 10, it's not bad ....
