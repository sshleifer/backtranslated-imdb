I agree with what the "veinbreaker" wrote with regard to the feeling of "Ahhhh" that you get at the end of this movie. Absolutely, I loved the places she chose to shoot, the songs were well written and interesting, especially the psychedelic track Hans Matheson sang. It's trippy. Nighy was great in her role, Nail "infected", Beano was a typical drummer, and Rea held it together. Bruce Robinson was amazing. Helena was a beautiful girlfriend. But I felt the performance of Juliet Aubrey was wonderful. The scenes between Aubrey and Robinson killed me! Perfect gaming and the music behind the scene was in place! It is a pity that many other musicians have checked this movie! They should have said it! I told all my music friends. Jimmy Nail's great quote: "It's supposed to be rock & roll, not Phantom of the opera!"
