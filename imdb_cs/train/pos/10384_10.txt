Almost 30 years later I remember this original PBS movie almost as unbearable. I regularly check IMDb and I hope someone has a good sense buying rights and putting it on DVD. It is September 2004 and I hope - deep sighs. One of the two main actors set out for a small career, especially in evening soap preparations; the second, Frances Lee McCain, has been seen in small roles here and there for several years. But anything they did before or after some time did not match this little film, which was produced, as I recall, in the short-lived PBS series that depicted the original scenarios of new and preferred playwrights. <br /> <br /> I saw it every time it was shown on PBS, maybe 2 or 3 times. That was before the video recorders, so I have no record of it, except what I think. <br /> <br /> 12/31/2006 In addition: Happy new year, ladies! This wonderful movie is finally available on DVD at ladyslipper.org. My understanding is that DVDs are burned from their own copy of a writer.
