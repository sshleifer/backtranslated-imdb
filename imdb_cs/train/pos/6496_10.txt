An example of how a WWII documentary should be filmed, using first-hand accounts from real soldiers and civilians who participated in this terrible conflict, and archived footage gathered from time to time. I caught it on re-run on the History channel for a year and a half backward, not knowing that it was World War II at the time, but it surrounded me and now I consider myself the second world soldier to watch and read everything , what can I find about it, but nothing is approaching this guideline, it's definitely worth buying a box set ............. <br /> <br /> It's just a documentary work the highest standard.
