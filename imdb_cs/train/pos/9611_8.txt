It was surprisingly intelligent for television and true to my own experience with bulimia. It was really well explored and I can assume that it was written by someone who had similar experience because he had all the little details. The characters were pretty well drawn and the performance of Mare Winningham and Alison Lohman was great. I think what I like the most is that they have made them specific and smart and there was no reason why Beth's bulimia was not (it was not a "diet that avoided control caused by pressures, pressures we are not familiar with ... "). Her mother was not completely clueless - too often on TV they will have a problem that every conscious person is trying to tell us that their protagonists are the last remaining people in the world who do not have ("Diabetes? What is it? Oh my world is everything dirty, Doctor, please explain it to me as if I were a little kid ", etc.). It was great that her mother was a psychologist and did not even see a sign. And the scenes that Beth had cast out were not very melodramatic and sensational, focusing more on the need for bulimic secrets and their uncontrollability. The scene where Beth tells her mother that she's bulimia would make me cry if there were no other in the room. <br /> <br /> Well, I liked it. What did not work so well was the end that came back to the movie area we know and I do not like very much, but I think they had to pack it. "You can also cure your child's disorder if you have a lot of money and you live in America ..." And I can only say again that I really like Mare Winningham. It's great.
