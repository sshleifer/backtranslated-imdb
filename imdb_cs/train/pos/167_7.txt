"Dance, Fools, Dance" is Crawford-Gable's early 1931 vehicle. Crawford plays Bonnie Jordan, a wealthy young woman whose life consists of social events, booze, and dressage to jump off the yacht and go swimming. It all ends when her dad dies and leaves her and her brother (William Blakewell). Bonnie gets a job in a newspaper called Mary Smith; her brother goes to work for bootleggers. The main man is Jake Luva - portrayed by Clark Gable when playing another cheater. Later, of course, he becomes a romantic hero, but at the beginning of the 1930s, MGM used him as a bad guy. If she does not realize that her brother is involved in illegal activities, Bonnie is glad to Luvu. Gable and Crawford made a great team. Her facial expressions are a bit on the wild side, but with her dance one of the things that make the film fun. Look at Cliff Edwards, the voice of Jiminy Cricket, like Bert. <br /> <br /> It is always interesting to watch movies from the front-end and "Dance, Fools, Dance" is no exception.
