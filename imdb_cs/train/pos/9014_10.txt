Even before I saw this movie, I was shameful with Helen Bonham Carter. I had to do some research to make sure she was not really affected, as well as her character (well?) With whom she was affected. I was in full respect of this beautiful lady. She picked it up perfectly. Who would have thought that the sexually explicit circumstances that require and need the finals of a unique young lady could be interpreted as gentle and romantic? Well, it can be when the administrative artists represent the right way, as was the case in this wonderful film. I forgot to mention how dynamically beautiful Miss Carter looks in this movie. I have often said that she is the most beautiful person who ever gave birth to the face of our country, but she seemed to be in this particular film. I hope some of you who are watching this movie like me like me. Thank you for allowing me to express my opinion.
