Saxophonist Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell) wins a studio contract and goes to Hollywood. It stays at the Hollywwod Hotel (of course). At the same time, great egoistic star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) has bouts and refuses to attend the premiere of her new film. The panic studio hires Virginia (Rosemary Lane) to pretend her and Bowers takes her for the premiere. She did not tell him it was not Marshall. They naturally fall in love. The plot is old, but Powell and Rosemary Lane make a very nice couple and have beautiful singing voices. The score is good (emphasized "Hooray for Hollywood") and director Busby Berkeley performs his unique visuals in a really fun musical sequence (with Edgar Kennedy, who makes his patented slow burn). Also, Glenda Farrell has several fun bits like Monas sister Jonesie. <br /> <br /> The film is still not that good. The remaining cast mugs wildly and most of the humor is simply not fun. Lola Lane is particularly miserable when she tries to play Mona on a comedy. There is also racism - the stereotypical black virgin is playing with laughter, and there is some really upsetting racist "humor" at one point. This is probably what most of the time is holding this TV channel. I realized that it was accepted at the time, but today it is revolting. <br /> <br /> Overall, so a movie with some serious problems helped good cast and some great songs. I give it 7.
