Welcome back Kiefer Sutherland. it was too long before you appeared in the movie, and what a movie it was, it was 24 no, but it was very interesting, especially with pro, like Michael Douglas headed as a shotgun agent. Kiefer's character is the one that chases Michael Douglas the whole movie, "Kiefer's Partner" is Eva Longoria, Desperate Woman. wow she can actually act besides flirting all day and look good, but I wish Kim Bassinger had a bigger role, but besides, I really think the whole movie was a blast from beginning to end. This film is what I consider to be a political thriller, they all played their part. nothing in the movie has been unveiled to keep you guessing. and I really think that Kiefer did one job in this movie, but in my opinion, Michael Douglas had a minor performance of the day, thumbs up.
