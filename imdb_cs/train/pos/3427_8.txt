This film illustrates the worst part of the surviving war, memories. For many soldiers, men and women, returning home can be the beginning of real problems. I remind you that my father and his brothers were coming back from the Second World War. For one of my uncles the war never ended. He survived the D-Day invasion, something similar to the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan. For him, the memories not only broke but tortured him. He became an alcoholic, like some of my cousins, his sons. Skip 60 years and put soldiers in another war, in another country, the result is the same. When I saw it at KC FilmFest, I remembered there was something about a war that would never change. Ideal young men and women are not spared the emotional suffering of what happened in Iraq, and especially if you are against the war, you are leaving with greater sympathy for soldiers who are trying to do what they believe or have been told right. <br /> <br /> The Vietnam War brand line tells everything. "The first victim of war is innocence."
