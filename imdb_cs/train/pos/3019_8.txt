First of all, I loved g√∂ta kanal 1, he had a lot of classic jokes including the unfortunate guy in the canoe who always seems to be in bad time in the wrong spot still acting the same guy in the goth of the 2 movie, but in my opinion hes performance it's not as fun as the first movie, you really do not notice it at all. The thing that made me wonder about this movie is the choice of boats, in this movie are only racing boats, they are certainly fast, but they do not make waves like the big floating settlements used in the first film, I like the old ones better and these new boats do one the latest scenes look ridiculous when a man in a canoe suddenly jumps out of avoiding "big waves" from those small fast boats. Really minus. You must agree that we do not live in the same Sweden in 1974. This film also contains a little more violence than the first. Though the movie was great in everything. I just concentrated on some drawbacks that I was disappointed, but the rest of the film was my expectation, so go get it! It's worth the money.
