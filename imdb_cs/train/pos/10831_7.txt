Excellent cast makes this film work; all the characters are developing extremely well and it is clear that the actors enjoyed filming this movie. It's not the kind of comedy I've been waiting for, much more than a light look at an attempt to gain youthful glory than an angry humor. For music fans there are plenty of fine links that are intelligently fun in themselves. I hate to draw direct comparisons with other films, but so much of this film reminded me of Alan Parker's films that I can not help: Imagine if the commitments really made it big - and then tried to regain that glory 25 years later.
