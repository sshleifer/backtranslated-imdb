The first few of this notorious horror series is a woman kidnapped by a group of black-haired men who suffer her for a few days before finally killing her. He is violently beaten, turned endlessly in a chair, the animal's intestines are poured on it, hot boiling water poured, and eventually her eyeball is punctured with a needle (a really sick and unpleasant scene). The creators of this unforgettable martyr show have tried to make it as likely as possible, and for me, one of the closest things to a snooze tobacco film you can get without committing a murder on tape. Of course some of the special effects are rather poor, but the idea of ​​producing snuff is quite terrible. I've also seen "Flowers of Flesh and Blood," which is more cruel and sadistic but less disturbing. Anyway, this is a must for horror fans!
