After watching the movie I immediately became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The river runs through It's about two brothers who each take a different path in life. Norman Maclean (Craig Sheffer) is the eldest of two brothers and is on the way to education. Paul Maclean (Brad Pitt) is a rebellious younger brother who travels along a path full of obstacles. The film follows these characters, because each follows their own path. <br /> <br /> There is no disadvantage of this movie. You will have fun all the way. Play, direction, and script are perfect. Two exceptional things are cinematography and score. They both capture you in the world that Robert Redford creates for you. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie that is meant to be classic. This is certainly in my book. If you have not seen this movie, you should watch it as soon as it stays with you forever.
