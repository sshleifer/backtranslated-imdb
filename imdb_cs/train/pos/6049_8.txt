Freebird is the perfect marriage of road comedy, gang kapar, film "stoner" and British movie "good feeling". They are great leaders who distinguish this film from other films of this genre. Stars Phil Daniels, Gary Stretch and Geoff Bell have great chemistry and their characters very sympathetic and realistic. The main story focuses on the journey from London to Wales and the adventures and misfortunes that appear on the way. This little movie also has a great heart - it's not just for fans of cycling because it's based on relationships with each other, including dreams and regrets like Fred's longing for Gary Stretch, who longs for the family he left behind. Cinematography is also great - a love letter to the Welsh countryside, as well as capturing the roughness of London's streets and typical pub life in Welsh rural towns. <br /> <br /> Stylish, slick, fantastic soundtrack, famous characters and a fun story - I would recommend Freebird in the heart!
