TESS OF STORM COUNTRY is perhaps the best film of all Mary Pickford movies. Two hours it was quite long for a silent film from 1922 but still keeps his interest about 80 years after he was shot. Mary gives one of her best performances at a time when the role appears to be the "greatest hits" of the performance with bits Mary innocent, Mary Little Devil, Mary Little Mother, Mary Spitfire, Marie Romantic Hero, etc. Characteristics that were often used in one movie in the past. The film is surprisingly sincere about the unauthorized child of one supporting figure in 1922, and at that moment our little Mary is considered as an unmarried mother! If academic prizes were to appear in 1922, she would certainly be the best Oscar for Mary for the year.
