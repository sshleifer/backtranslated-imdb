This movie was amazing. It had an original concept (the movie Vampire meets Yakuza mob). It is a humorous and yet very dramatic and tragic film about friendship, love, immortality, death and happiness, and commented on the company. On the Gackt Camui side, Sho's role was greatly delivered, and HYDE was surprisingly good for his first film as a tortured but humorous vampire, Kei. I also laughed and wept for the happy happy figure, Toshi, who grew up with Sho. I loved every second of this movie, especially moments like funny Cigarette scene, combat scenes, and especially ending the end.
