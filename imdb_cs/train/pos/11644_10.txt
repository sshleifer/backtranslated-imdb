This show is awesome! I've been a fan since it's been premiered, and it's just watching me ... I've seen a couple of terrible things that I wish I did not do, but, it really shows how addiction affects all those involved, not just the drug addict. You can see all sorts of different addictions, from drugs and alcohol to shopping habits or eating habits. And actually, it's really sad to see some of the famous faces that have passed as well. We have seen great musicians, NBA players, and even young people who really need help. And since they began to show several follow-ups, it was also amazing. Now you can see how long after their ep is broadcast. If you did not try it, please. It's on A & E, and it's amazing! New eps are Sunday evening at 10pm EST, if I remember correctly ... so set up TiVo!
