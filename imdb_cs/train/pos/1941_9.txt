Actually, I thought this was a comedy and she sat watching she expected me to laugh. it soon became clear that it was not a comedy, or at least not a "Jim Carrey type". what we watched were characters - the movie begins with some pretty dark people who gathered to try to fight one of their basic fears - fear of water, fear of swimming. we begin to get a bit of a bit into their lives, testify to their troubles, to guess about their thoughts. In fact, I've made it look much darker than it really is, and next to the chain of events will soon bring some light and I hope in their lives. I probably would not have noticed that I had known my comedy, but rather a drama, but I had a good time, enjoyed the story and did not mind spending with me for about 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many films deal with alienation among people in the Western world, this film shows how people can connect and help each other <br /> <br /> "in the light of the dying day when you meet it, do not let it go around and go away, do not lose it, it's your gift from the sun ...
