My grandmother bought me this movie when I was 5 years old (I always love scary movies), and I even enjoyed it. The atmosphere is amazing and the story is original and fun. I especially love scenes where RV is invaded in the desert. Rocks are truly convincing for such a low budget. The effects are above average for these types of movies and the music is mysterious. This is certainly a gem. I recommend it to anyone who likes these strange movies from the late seventies, early 80s, such as "Alice, Sweet Alice," "Poor pretty Eddie," "Nightmare," "Hospital Massacre," and "Return of Foreigners, Potter. Definitely a classic!
