I remember seeing this movie for the first time - I was in the office working over the weekend, and TV was a background noise. But I gradually became more and more involved in this movie, which I have never seen or heard until I was fully absorbed. Life and Death (British title - Stairway to Heaven in the US) is beautiful, convincing, moody and moving, all in one perfectly written, well-functioning, perfectly managed package. It's a classic that's really good with Casablanca, it's a wonderful life, away with the wind, a Kane citizen, and a car fire. Why has it never been given the same duty and honors? Fortunately, some critical scientists have listed "Top 100 of All Time". There is hope - Fantasia of the 1940s was not hit until the 1960s and the Wizard of Oz was crazy in the box office but made a hit TV. Buy - Rent It - Track - Require! You will be disappointed!
