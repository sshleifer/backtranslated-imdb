Most people know Paul Verhoeven as the director of many good (and bad) science fiction films in Hollywood. But long ago, he released generic thrillers in his native land. The story is a basic prerequisite for femme fatale, nothing new or fascinating. Verhoeven thinks he can do it better by adding a series of dream sequences that instead of defining our main character and its situation are being used as a way to move forward predictable conspiracy. The screenplay was solid, dialogue helps to improve the effects of a tedious story. What really made the film at least good was some amazing acting. Jereon Krabbe was amazing as a "tortured artist," and supporters were also very good. Jan De Bout's cinematography also gives the film at least some life, which helps Verhoeven look at as a director at least. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span>
