Excellent show. Instead of watching the same old sitcom type showing where the old thing is, different "stars", this refreshing show gave an incredibly entertaining look at the office situation. We have been away from watching TV for 2 years and after returning from all the shows we are looking forward to watching this show on W. Shame on Global that she pulled the plug on this. I thought it would be the winner. Let's be realistic, FEW Canadian SHOWS do it. Everyone I speak with enjoys this show and I believe Global is stupid to go. I think they want to stand up with the typical soap shows in the States instead of going for a Canadian show that has a lot of promises. Do not get me wrong, I like many TV shows, but come with people, we leave the variety. This unique show has provided a very comic look at the slightly exaggerated realistic aspect of office life and relationships, with unique characters you do not see in any sitcom today or in the past. The pity that the global had to say no, a stupid mistake.
