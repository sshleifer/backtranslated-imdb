I loved this movie because I was young! It's great. Although it may be a bit for an average filmmaker, if you can not interpret some subtleties in the movie (for example, our hero is the name of Achilles, and in the final battle between him and Alexander is shot at the heel with a rocket, as well as Achilles in mythology was shot in the heel) . That's just a little thing that's a bit fun! Anyway, a great movie, a good story, it would be neat to see how to reverse it with today's special effects! Strangely, Gary Graham had an average success, starring in the T.V. Alien Nation. This movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated!
