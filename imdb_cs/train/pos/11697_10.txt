This movie was really opening. I have seen this movie several times. First, when I was four and I actually remembered it and then I was twelve. The whole message the director brings is that everyone wake up and do not make the mistake of leaving God out of our everyday lives, another mile to offend him. <br /> <br /> A great movie for unbelievers and believers alike!
