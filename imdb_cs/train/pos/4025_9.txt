Splendid. Originally I thought that, given the Communist tendencies of Amrita Pritama and the Nazi nationalist film, Mr. Dwivedi, they would be more sincere than a novel, but when I read a novel, I was surprised that it was reverse. Kudos it marita Pritam for not being a pseudo-sec and that Dr. Dwivedi is objective. This film touches the sensitive subject sensitively. Victims of any war are women, as some poets have said, and this film embodies it. It's also a sad comment on the Hindu psyche because they can not stand up against their kidnappers or a Hindu brother who can burn only the field of his torturer. On the other hand, it also shows the economic angles of division or the fact that girls were abducted for the first time. I think kidnappers thought that by kidnapping girls would become legal homeowners and they would be new governments. they will not be able to apply for a return home. This separate person must greet the courage of the characters Puro and her Bhabhi, that they are two simple village girls who do not have the outer world conscious and risk each of them by trying to return after being put to death. Because there are many documented cases where such women have not been admitted by their families in India. No wonder it requires a woman to understand the pain of other women.
