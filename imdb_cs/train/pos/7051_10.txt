Let me start by saying that "War, Inc." is not every cup of tea. But it's very nice (and you think - "Oh, crap"). The comedy about the film is not at all obvious - it's pretty fine (Tamerlane tanks, chemical cleaning services, etc.), and it changes with the turns and turns in the plot. only one, but I will not compare it to "Grosse Point Blank" because it's different. John Cusack - I do not think he's "awesome" or "brilliant" - but he was good. On the other hand, his sister (Joan Cusack) was incredible in line deliveries and comedy timing - although there was not much in the movie (I'm talking about Ben Kingsley anyway). <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei plays a convincing reporter and can pull him out. Hilary Duff is very praiseworthy for her role as Central Asian pop star Yonice Babyyeah. Duff's development as an actress is very noticeable in the film and does a very good job (although her accent is unrealistic). Overall, the film is what I would call "fun". She has no special story, and it's sometimes silly, but she has a fine message. I think it's worth watching.
