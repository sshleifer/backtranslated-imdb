Kurt Russell is in his best job as a man living in the past of glory, Reno Hightower. Robin Williams is his polar counterpart in a rare low key performance such as Jack Dundee. Big Pass missed more than one. You will see some of the most sensitive scenes that were once embedded in a single movie, such as Row's Rat Cabinets, and Caribbean Calling Off. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this classic, which is not afraid to show football in the mud as it should be.
