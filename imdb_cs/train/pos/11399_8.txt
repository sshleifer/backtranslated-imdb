Okay, so the conspiracy is on turbulent soil. Yeah, well, there are randomly composed songs and / or dance sequences (such as Adam's concert and Henri's scenic act). And Leslie Caron can not really, um, you know ... act. But somehow, the "American in Paris" can pass through all of them as a polished, first-class musical - mostly on the basis of incredible dancing talents and choreography by Gene Kelly and spell trucks, he seems to import Caron to every scene. (This is because he seems to have an ... emotting problem.) The most famous and technically respectable work in this musical is, of course, a 16 minute ballet at the end of the film. Kelly and Caron are amazingly shot and dancing. But my favorite number should be Kelly's character, who sings "I have a rhythm" with a group of French school children and then I break into a number of American dances. Just show how you do not need special effects when you have real * talent *. <br /> <br /> Not at the classic level with 'Singin' In The Rain ', but nice high there though. It's a lot!
