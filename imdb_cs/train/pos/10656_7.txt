What a great Barbara Stanwyck movie I saw at night. "Jeopards" was fantastic. It was made in 1953 and probably for double bills, but it kept me on the edge of my place. Barbara Stanwyck plays Helen, who along with husband Doug (Barry Sullivan) and son (Lee Aaker) isolated fishing spot in Mexico on holiday. The husband has a fall from the pier and the only way to save himself is when Barbara returns to the garage for a rope. While he leads to a psychotic killer (Ralph Meeker - one of my favorite videos), and what follows is a game of cats and mice because Barbara is trying to do everything in her power to bring Meeker back with her to freely dismiss her husband. The film was so thrilling and such a surprise - I did not expect such a great movie. But I suppose I should realize that there is something Barbara Stanwyck doing is less than amazing?
