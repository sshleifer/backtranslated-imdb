This is what I would call good horror. With the occult / supernatural undertones, this nice low-budget French film has taken my attention from the first scene. This proves that you do not need a wild FX or a lot of gore to create an effective horror film. The plot spins around four confreres in prison and each of these characters (and their motives) is gradually becoming more interesting as the film creates tension in the final. We see most of the events in the eyes of Carrere, who has just entered the prison and must get used to living with these three other prisoners. I do not say much, because this movie really deserves to be more visible. However, there are some mistakes: FX is not that good, but it is effectively used; the plot leaves some secrets; and things are overwhelmed by the end, but Malefique is redeemed at the time it ends. I thought it was a very good movie, 8/10
