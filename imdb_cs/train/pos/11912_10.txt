I liked "Nemesis" by Albert Pyun for his cheese event and a semi-composite screenplay. Many people complain about the "confused" plot of the first film, which is probably why Nemesis 2: The Nebula is stupid as a rock plot with the same super action that leads her. <br /> <br /> This gives the name of the hero of the first film, Alex, a mass super-woman sent to the past to save the future. It is brought up by a tribe in Africa. A good part of the film has a dialogue in the African language without a caption, which I liked because it seemed to be a bit authentic (how often movies in this genre actually try to do it?). It does not take long for the evil Cyrus to return to find them and try to kill her. Do not get me wrong, it's a bit of a bitch first thing was great). There are subplots involving African political riots, treasure hunting, and indigenous struggles. The image is very small on the brain, so none of these things are very good. The image is basically dragged out of combat with some persecutions that are reduced to muscle babe vs. cyborg. It's funny, just do not expect quality or something from the first movie.
