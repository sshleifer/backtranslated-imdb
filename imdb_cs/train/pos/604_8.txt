Saturday 3 June 18:30 Neptune Monday 5 June, 16:30 Neptune <br /> <br /> Few festivals of ethnic and cultural identity will be as successful as the brilliant interpretation of Carlosa Saura Isaac Albeniz's the masterpiece of Iberia Suite. On the occasion of the centenary, Saura united the unprecedented wealth of talent from the Spanish art community to create this song of loving love for their homeland. The twelve "Impressions" suite is presented without telling in a sharp environment that allows the power of every power to shoot before Saura's camera. Creative use of large dwellings and mirrors that move around the set, combined with screens, shadows, fire, rain and rear projects, bring great dramatic effects to different choices of song, dance and instrumental performance. The photos of Albenizu appear throughout the program, uniting the passion of music with their great creator. Saura includes all the Spaniards on stage from the beautiful elegance of the older flamenco dancers in traditional costume to the children gladly dancing with the instructors.
