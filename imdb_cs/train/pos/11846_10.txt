I enjoyed this movie very much. The animation was great and the romance was cute. I like most Bryan Adams songs and Hans Zimmer's score was great. What many people do not realize is how well it relates to the Heart of Darkness / Apocalypse Now (what happens when "Civilization" attacks someone else, what it means to be "civilized", etc.). . Opening sceneries and music were very mild. The film is a lament to America, once beautiful.
