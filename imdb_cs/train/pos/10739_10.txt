An amazing document. He has seen it on the original dates and on the DVD several times in the last couple of years. I was shocked that he was not even nominated for the best documentary for 2002, the year he was released. No other document will ever appear. <br /> <br /> It was recently on TV for the 5th anniversary, but at the end I missed the added segment "where are they now", besides, hazmat. <br /> <br /> I have seen criticism on making documentaries from just a few on this list. I do not see how that might be different. They had less than 6 months to assemble and get them into the air. The DVD contains more materials and backgrounds. I'm also surprised that according to IMDb.com, my brother has no projects in four years. What are they doing?
