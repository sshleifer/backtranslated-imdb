My left foot is an epic excellent film explaining the life and times of Christy Brown, who had cerebral palsy, a severe disorder and he was just using his left foot but he was defiant, able to become an artist and writer against everything I've seen this film many times and every time I see it, I consider him to be as brilliant every time. I wonder how this wonderful film did not win Oscer for the best picture, it's a terrifying academy. Jim Shirdan is one of the greatest directors in the world for me. Scenario, music and everything else is great in this movie. As the film continues, you will almost feel that you are in a brown home because everything is happening. Raj MacAnally and Brenda Fricker are awesome because the parents of Cristies and Fiona Shaw are just as brilliant as dr. Eileen Cole, who helps Christy in the fight for defiance. <br /> <br /> <br /> The Iraqi film industry had a lot of name before its left foot. The left leg was the beginning of a beautiful period in Irish film. movies as strong and brilliant as a field, crying play, in the name of my father and Michael Collins followed my left leg. These Irish films have been considered so strong all over the world and have been nominated for more Oscars and won some, wonderful time for Irish film. My left foot is a powerful film excellent. Daniel Day-Lewis plays crippled Christy Brown so well and so brilliantly and the same goes for Hugh Conner playing young Christy. These two performances are two of the best movie shows, especially Daniel Day-Lewis, which I would consider as tall as Antony Hopkins in the silence of lambs. Daniel day-lewis has shown in his career that he is a great actor. This is an excellent masterpiece in the movie, to see it!
