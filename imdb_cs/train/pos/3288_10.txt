It's a fantastic movie. One of my favorites is really cool. The director is Bernard Rose, who went on to direct Candyman, and began to make a great start with this movie. A film about a girl named Anna, who had her jaundice fever on her 11th birthday. She draws the house on a piece of paper from her exercise and falls into a dream in which the house is real. Every subsequent dream he has is altered by the presence of what he adds to the picture. In his third dream, he meets a boy who thinks Mark created. He loves him and their relationships become stronger when dreams become darker and more terrifying. Charlotte Burke, who plays Anna, is an amazing actress, and it is very strange that she should disappear after one film and never be in anything again. She really gives great performance in this movie. <br /> <br /> Hans Zimmer's score is also an ace. Like Broken Arrow, music is spooky and mysterious. It's really a shame that the soundtrack is no longer available on the CD. DVD is only available in R2.
