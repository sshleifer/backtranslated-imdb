I saw it in a large cinema where the audience is usually white, educated and urban. The demonstrations I've visited have blended African-Americans and the differences in response between the audience between the two groups have been a great social commentary on the state of racial relations in this country. In fact, the white people AFRAID were laughing or nervously laughing at the funny bits - and there are many! - because they would "read at the Blacks" while Blacks also remained quite silent, because many could not laugh themselves in front of the white. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I was Asian (and so belonged to none of the groups), and so I was looking at this satire of rap culture and its egos / values, pseudo-philosophy. Cast is talented and does a great job that becomes a rendered character. The pisces are too funny to be trusted. This film is one of the best pseudo-documentary films, including "Powerful Wind"
