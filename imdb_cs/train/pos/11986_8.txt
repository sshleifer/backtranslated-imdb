I was looking at one night "Speak to me lightly" and I thought it was ok but something was missing. Maybe Buster Keaton talked strangely about throwing me away, or about delivering the ladies. The next day I was thinking about the movie. I could not get Durant's song out of my head, trying to remember the first scene of Thelma Todd, I thought maybe Keaton had done some funny falls and a physical comedy. The next night I watched the scene with Thelka Todd as a charming girl's choir that tried to impress Buster and Jimmy with sexual attraction. Very funny scene, excellent actors, their faces, eyes and silly expressions. So I watched the next scene, their show opened on Broadway. Buster in his blissful innocence hits every act. I laughed again when I appreciated Keaton's clown and jerk. So the next night I watched the whole movie and this time I see it for the first time: It's great! It's sensational! It's noble! Three great comics! Todd is dancing! Durante sings! Keaton talks! Sure it is not poifect ... but there is a lot of laughter in this picture.
