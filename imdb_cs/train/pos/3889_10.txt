Eddie Izzard has nothing to do with the comedy genius and this is Eddie at his best. His material is extremely funny and cheerful and his delivery is one of the best ever seen on the stage. Instead of insulting viewer's intelligence, he relies on drawing humor on his merits in his wardrobe, Hitler, the moon landing, and the British. With so many memories, some of his lines can not be repeated. Forever, "Do you have a flag?" should be considered as one of the most entertaining lines ever broadcast in a common tent routine. Every fan of the top comedy of the standup needs to see "Dress to Kill". By far the best British comedian I've ever witnessed, Eddie Izzard fought for success from the live scene. However, his lack of commercial success in the film should not indicate how extremely talented he really is. "Dress to Kill" is a treasure that fortunately has found its way to home video, and could and should enjoy over and over again.
