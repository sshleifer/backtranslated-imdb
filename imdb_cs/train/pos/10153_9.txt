I recorded this film on screening. He was very surprised to find a really sweet and fun story. He acted well. Natasha Henstridge is another Julia Roberts. Men's leadership was bad. Very funny movie. It takes place in the best places in New York. I wanted to go there. I just saw "You've got mail" I thought "it should have been you" was a much better story, fresher. It was clean and great for the whole family. The audience saw it with joy.
