Channel 4 is a channel that allows more disobedient things than any other channel. This show was definitely disobedient. Speaking of this roughly grown adult chat show, BAFTA's four-time victory and the British comedy victory (also twice nominated), Graham Norton was just the perfect gay host for a good show like this. He had one or more famous personalities at his center. In essence, they had an adult idea that would either gross, humiliate or humor a guest, but some are not for the weak heart. There were women who play with the recorder, men used their cubs to play xylophone, women were developing in the bath, men with or without their trousers and many other rough but cheerful ideas. This is only for adults, but enjoy it! She won the BAFTA Award for Best Entertainment (program or series), won the British Comedy Awards for the Best Comedy Program (also nominated), Best Comedy, won Emmy for Episode 18 (?) And won National TV Awards Twice for Best Talk show. It was the number 52 on the 100 greatest entertainment moments. Very good!
