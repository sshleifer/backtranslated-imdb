Excellent film, a realistic picture of contemporary Finland that touches and deep. One of the finest Finnish films he ever did. Amazingly capturing everyday life in a small town in central Finland, human desires and weakness, joy and grief. The bright early autumn sun creates a cool atmosphere of this clear exploration of people in social society. Lampela is indeed one of the most promising Finnish artists. It shows that it is possible to grab movies without machine guns and bloodshed. His next film, Eila, is worth seeing, though the story of cleaning women fighting for their work is not as universal as Joki's fate.
