He just saw ICE AGE, a very funny and especially nice looking movie. The story is simple but effective, the characters have liked and improved nicely, but what really shines is the digital design. <br /> <br /> More inspired by traditional animated films than reality, designs make you really really looking for a world in stunning color use. Sometimes touching reality (especially the water was impressive) is nevertheless a fantasy-world based on reality. It includes many large landscapes, especially helping to minimize the cost of rendering. <br /> <br /> Pixar shines with technical brilliance, shining with the effective use of technical know-how. <br /> <br /> Enough technical blabber, fun movie, family friendly, and sometimes funny funny.
