I did not know the real events when I sat down to look at it, just because it was based on a true story. After the death of the child's father, Rhonda is trying to help her daughter Desiree (... I did not know that someone actually named their offspring that) to cope with the loss. This is really done for children, as is often the case with "family" films (so go ahead and get together for viewing, although I kept them youth if you are not sure they are buying a concept) but it does not do it that it is the death of a parent, and no one tells anyone. The story is interesting enough and moves well enough. Acting Changing, with an outstanding Burstyn intimidating most of her fellow cast, Mathis succeeding it quite well, and Ferland and his peers (with a few exceptions) being the least convincing band (and frankly, they are irritating, then again, In this sense, I am not the intended audience). Cutting and cinematography are standard and certainly not less. While humor is limited to several fun lines, such a tone is not unpleasant. There's an intense scene or two. I recommend it to fans of these types of films. 7/10
