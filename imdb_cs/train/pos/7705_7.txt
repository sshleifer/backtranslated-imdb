I've seen this movie about ten times, so it's something I like! 50 sci-fi movies in the US were almost a mixture: they were either intelligently made and / or thoughtful or cheap and blended cheese. The forbidden planet is a bit of both, but in that rarity for genre, color. It also had a head start - though Shakespeare may not have known that it was based on his timelessness so that a certain amount of long life is guaranteed if he is doing well. It's the story of one man murdering id artificially enlarged by infinite machinery, when the dead race left on 200,000 years earlier. On the way, the fence is based on stereotypes of 50, and in such pure corn you sometimes wonder why you're watching it, but you always do it. This love triangle ... yeah! Disney's cartoon still keeps well and cartoon background directly from Galaxy magazines, etc. It looks good even after 50 years. Robbie, who drives the car through the desert in the distance, is a horn! <br /> <br /> Overall, with all the mistakes, the best of its kind, and we should be grateful that such an untouchable print will survive.
