Since I'm not a fan of almost any movie "Desperate Life" John Waters, I warmed up to "Pecker". When he left the underground, Waters produced a trash-lite version of his earlier songs ("Cry Baby", "Polyester", Hairspray) that hard fans looked like and diluted like a liqueur. An attempt to ward off early success is a mild, quiet and humble commentary on the whims of celebrity and the pretentiveness of the arts world. Waters clearly knows this topic because he also exhibited and sold (at ridiculous prices) some of the most amateur pop art ever created that you could not imagine anyone could get away if it was not stuck called Waters. "Edward Furlong is fine because" Pecker "and Waters' non-histrionic style is fine with the subject.
