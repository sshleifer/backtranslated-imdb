John Thaw from Morse's production, starred by Tom Oakley in this movie. Tom lives in a small English village in 1939 and the beginning of World War II. A bit drunk, Tom had not yet recovered from the death of his wife and son when he served during the First World War. If you can imagine that Inspector Morse is old and retired, twice as crocheted as a policeman, then you have the character of Tom Oakley. Still, this heart of the bushes melts. London children are evacuated from lightning. The young William (Willie) Buk is sacrificed to protest Tom. Willie plays Nick Robinson as a good effect. This boy needs care with Capital C. He is the smallest of his problems with his schooling, who still sprinkles his bed and is unable to read it. He comes from a terrible backdrop in London, with a mother who can not cope, and that's a little. Slowly, still, the man and the boy are warm to each other. Tom is re-discovering his ability to love and care. And the boy learns to accept this love and care. See that Tom and Willie will be building a bomb at the end of their garden. See Willie enjoying what is probably his first birthday party thrown by Tom. <br /> <br /> Do not divorce the end, but Willie is adopted by Tom after a big fight and the couple is starting a new life much richer for their mutual love. In this film, Thaw and Robinson watch a long line of films where one meets a boy and develops mutual love. Look at the late Dirk Bogarde and Jon Whiteley in "The Spanish Gardener". Or Clark Gable and Carlo Angeletti in "Started in Naples". Or Robert Ulrich and Kenny Vadas in the movie "Captains Brave". Or Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl in "Man without a Face". Two points of interest. That's the only thawing thing I know where she sings. The only verse of the anthem, New Jerusalem, but he sings. <br /> <br /> Secondly, young Robinson also starred in the second film featuring "Tom" in the title, "Tom's Midnight Garden", which is based on a classic children's novel.
