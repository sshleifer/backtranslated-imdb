As a comic book reader, who is still considered the same child in my heart, I admit that I could be somewhat concerned about this film. I think there is no good superhero film for some time (NOTE: Batman Forever was not a good superhero movie). I really wanted this movie to be good and, unlike most of my recent movie tours (read the Blair Witch Project project), I was not disappointed. Mystery Men certainly was not a high-impact, tension -filled action, it was a comedy. And on this basis it was a success. Everybody in the small theater laughed, got applause and laughed over the final scene. Stiller and Garofolo are gay, as always, and Azaria adds just the right touch of foolishness. William H. Macy plays a great person, while Kel Mitchell and Paul Rubens are just added to keep the kids happy. Although the bizarre series (and occasionally seem to be rips from both Batman and Blade Runner), and some of the jokes are obvious, it's still just funny. There are lines that capture even the most crazy viewers and take the tears from the belly-laughers between us. I definitely recommend this movie. Although it's not a classic classic, it's twice as fun as last protector Austin Powers. Writing is good and acting is great. If you are afraid, plan for a matinee and pay less, but you will either be pleasantly surprised. Do you understand who does not leave us once in a while for the losers?
