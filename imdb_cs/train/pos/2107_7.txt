I recently bought this movie with lots of other LaserDisc from eBay. I usually go to war and action movies, but sometimes I like romantic comedies. <br /> <br /> If you are bored today with special FX movies and romantic comedy with high gloss, you should be on a quiet evening. I like the movie that the characters have a lot of decency. There is nothing fake or alert about them. Take Mr. Matuschek, for example: When he finds out that his wife is cheating with one of his staff, he tries to fire. Not just because of humiliation, but because he was unfair to the character of Stewart. (OK, exhausted example.) Yes, the focus of the film is narrow and the plot is predictable. Still, I liked it a lot. If you like Notting Hill, you'll like Shop around the corner. in fact, Hugh Grant reminds me of a lot of Jimmy Stewart.
