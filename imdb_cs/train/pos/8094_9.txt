First, no adaptation is ever as good as a book, especially when you're dealing with a writer master like Tolkien. This ADAPTATION fabulously synthesizes Tolkien's universe with psychedelia, aesthetics and liberal culture of the 1970s. Yes - Animation and background painting is sometimes a bit "harsh" in its technical realization, however it is beautiful and very evocative when it comes to providing a unique "feel of place" of each scene. In addition to the absolute uniqueness of the images, there is an absolutely excellent voice actor - acting that is superior to acting in new live action movies. And while cell animation does not have to be the most "technically capable" animation, it perfectly captures expressive body and face gestures while not forgetting that it is soft and nuanced. Background images differ from the traditional "fantasy" theme to full abstraction, but the transition to abstraction settings is always motivated by narrative and greatly contributes to the themes of the film. If you are a person who must have a large computer rendering in the movie to see everything for you, then I see you do not like this movie, but if you like excellent acting, transcendental images and JRR Tolkien, then this movie needs to be seen .
