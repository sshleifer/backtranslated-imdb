You know, this movie is not so great, but I mean it's about the baseball angels. I think the story line is supposed to be cheerful, such a child's dad says he will take him back if the angels win the flag (because he knows he will not do it) Kid prays to his false god to help the angels win, god helps all day through Christopher Lloyd, RIP) And finally, his father does not return him, and he does not come out of the motorcycle right on that baby's face. it's funny until Danny Glover comes and she's a girlfriend. I think the upside is that the old lady stays alone to die with her stunted projects and her stories. But the true winner here is God. Because later he got a job as a writer for numerous jokes. <br /> <br /> As a children's film, he gets 7. As a movie about the mysteries of blind, silly faith and the nature of "god," he gets 10.
