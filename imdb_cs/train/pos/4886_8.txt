The last of the Blond Bombshells is funny a little fluffy. Judy Dench plays Elizabeth, a newly widowed woman at free ends. She spent most of her life as a compulsory wife and mother, but she was never really happy. Shortly after her husband's funeral, Elizabeth has regular lunch days with her wand kids when she sees a street artist. This raises memories of being a member of the Girls' Swing Group in London during the Second World War. Soon we will learn that the band was not exactly such a girl because the drummer was a man who dressed as a woman Some Like It Hot. Elizabeth pulls out her saxophone (secretly practicing her entire marriage) and joins forces with the guitar player playing the guitar. Elizabeth is much more talented than a guitarist and the money is flowing. They do not take any money because they are rich and do not need it. Her play is exclusively for artistic fulfillment. Elizabeth is one day seen by Patrick (Ian Holm), who was a drummer in the movie. It seems that Patrick was - and still is - quite a ladies man, and Elizabeth, at the time only fifteen, was the only band member who did not record Patrick's "talents" other than drumming. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth is inspired by her granddaughter to get back into the old band so she can play school dancing granddaughter. So begins a wonderful trip down the commemorative stripes combined with aspects of the humorous road trip movie - all ended up with some really good swing and blues. I think I'm in an age where I really like older actresses doing their stuff and this movie is a treasure, not only Judy Dench, but also nothing less than Olympia Dukakis, Leslie Caron and a number of experienced British actors. All of this ends in an extraordinary voice of Cleo Laine. Yes, it's a fluff, but a very pleasant and extremely fun fog.
