An outstanding political thriller, played much quieter and slower than other highs in this genre. When people talk about Pacino and Cusack, how can they overcome these amazing career achievements? The story of friendship, father-son relationships, corruption and fraud. These two actors are incredibly well connected and the support from Aiello and the Funds are equally impressive, although Aiello is great, especially when papers are running to print. Instead of concentrating on a comprehensive corruption scandal, it creates wonderful figures that show the human side of the failure of political bribery. Final scenes with each of the main characters are greatly written and done.
