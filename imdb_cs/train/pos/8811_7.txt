Eleven different filmmakers from different parts of the world will gather in this film to present their views and ideas about the WTC attack. This is one of the best efforts you will ever see in each movie. Such films rarely make and appreciate. This movie attempts to touch every possible WTC core. Here are some of the most important film stories that make this film so unique. A story by Samir Makhmalbaf (Iran), where some people in Iran are preparing for attacks from America. There the teacher tries to educate their students by informing them that innocent people have been killed in the WTC massacre. Then comes the story from Youssef Chahine (Egypt), where the filmmaker meets face to face with a dead soldier in the WTC attack and the dead terrorist who was involved in the WTC attack. Then we see the story of Idrisa Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso), where a group of five innocent children see Osama bin Laden and plans to drive him and get a reward from America. Then we'll see a story from Alejandro Gozalez Inarritu (Mexico) where you can see black screens and you can see the real footage of the WTC buildings. The people in the building are thrown out to save their lives. Another most important story is Mira Nair (India), where her mother seeks respect for her dead son, whose name is falsely imprisoned in the WTC massacre! After the September 11 attack, our hearts will automatically begin to draw when we hear two names anywhere in the world. The first is the World Trade Center and the other is Osama! This film will completely change our perception and make a strong point by claiming something more. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes such a home DVD collection. Definitely worth the money you spend. But please do not expect anything other than Movies on this DVD. There are, of course, filmography of film makers, but no other features.
