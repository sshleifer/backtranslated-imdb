About two hundred members of the film company Cleveland, Ohio USA, Cinematheque, gathered on August 19, 2000, to look at the unspoken film production of 1970's Michelangelo Antonioni "Zabriskie Point". Cinematheque director John Ewing, who is doing excellent work to get the best prints for his series, shared with the lecturer in advance that this print was specially transported across Italy because this one is only shown. once the film shot its artists on a huge panorama screen. Watching this excellent press showed the way Antonioni intended, realizing that it was really modern artwork. It was even more appropriate for this series to be located in the Cleveland Institute of Art in the University Circle. <br /> <br /> Antonioni's songs are created for the Cinemascope landscape. His beautiful balance of paintings, prominent use of colors, extensive choreographic movements, everything is the work of a real artist using canvas. <br /> <br /> Finally, the audience could understand "Zabriskie Point". As his narrative was told, it was obvious that this work was not about the story per se, but rather about the artistic impressionist painting of the flying images of his subject. Setting up some of the more turbulent activities of the 1960s is only a dramatic engine of artistic collage sweeping. <br /> <br /> Antonioni is not bound by conventional narrative standards and can stop at any time to creatively embroider the event with magnificent adornments. The audience was glad to see his remarkable imagination, for his huge images on the massive screen kept one in sharp focus. While the audience could only be tangentially involved in character relationships, she realized that there was a theme of human arranging, a recurring subject of the director. <br /> <br /> It has also been found that in this cinematography it is not possible to print any smaller or smaller quality than this one. The audience was therefore even more appreciated by watching the Zabriskie bod in its original, breathtaking format, and eventually came to a thunderous applause.
