This incredibly formal movie from "Walker, Texas Ranger" includes some of the most incredible scenes ever seen in a television movie. In addition, the get-go result can be very predictable. However, it's a fun little movie that does the job: it's fun. That's all you have to do, and it does. Stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot is not absolutely bad. The game is also decent, which is not a big surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is not Steven Seagal. If you are a fan of the genre (and "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you will definitely love it. If it is not, then do not waste your time. 8/10
