Wow, I can not believe I waited so long to see this movie. I just could not even look. The conspiracy has nothing to interest me. I do not know anything about football (football.) I'm one of those American fools who have no idea. I have never seen David Beckham before this movie. I decided to ignore the buzz around this movie at the time it was released in America. Enough for me. <br /> <br /> In truth, it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of movie sky. What a funny movie. It is full of color and exuberance. I had a monstrous smile on my face. Parminder Nagra is so sweet and sweet, you can not help but spice it. No wonder why the US television show E.R. she grabbed. I have a new recognition of Indian culture. These people know how to have a good time. Wedding scenes are brilliantly beautiful. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had was to decipher some British slang and accent dialogue. I turned on English subtitles to make sure there was nothing missing. (It's not a film critic!) I'm sure the audience around the world has trouble understanding the ever-changing slang in American films. <br /> <br /> It's a perfect movie. It has a great sports site like Rocky and a strong sense of feminism that empowers women. I watched it with my wife and sixteen-year-old niece, and we all loved her. I highly recommend.
