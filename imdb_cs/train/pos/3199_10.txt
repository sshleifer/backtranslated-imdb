Okay, I really do not think Trailer Park Boys has bad stories because they're banging. They're just ... in a conflict. For example: At the end of the film it shows that Ricky and Julian tell "Patrick Lewis" that the dog is down and going away. Then at the end he shows that Ricky and Julian say they are in prison for 2 years. In the pilot series of television series the first clip they show is the same clip when Ricky and Julian yell at "Patrick Lewis." But in the television series they are reportedly only in prison for 18 months. We also feel that the story of the movie and the story of the TV series are connected (due to the screaming scene among boys). Some actors, however, display completely different characters. Of course, Patrick Roach plays in "Patrick Lewis," but plays Randy in the series. Sam Tarasco plays one of the guys who pays Ricky for extinction and then plays Sam Losco in the series. Also (again ... I know, I have a lot to say), in the movie, boys snort coke instead of smoking hash. The point is, they never affirm that both stories are connected differently than the screaming scene. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I'm crazy.
