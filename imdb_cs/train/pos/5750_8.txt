But we others who love a good sentimental and emotional story that is a lock to cry you ... like! Tom Hulce is beautiful as Dominick, a mentally slow trashman who loves a professional match, and his brother Eugene played Ray Liotta, who is a doctor and works for a very long time. <br /> <br /> Due to Eugen's work plan, Dominick is a lot of time and tends to make disputed court calls. He really wants to be a good guy, do the right thing and make a proud brother to him. He stops praying in the church in one place and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character is to cry before the damn film even begins to really start. <br /> <br /> It's not about giving something, but the movie is extremely entangled and sad and heartbreaking. Those who will not be afraid of these things will have this beautiful story with a beautiful story, loving characters and a great song I can not quote here that has nothing to do with the movie but is strangely good ... but you hear it in the bar. I thought Tom Hulce would be nominated for this film because he was for "Amadeus". I thought he could give him an inside footprint that would actually win. No luck. Liotta is just as good, but it has less emotional impact, but later it does. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she does not have much, but it was nice to lend her the name of a little drama in Pittsburgh about two brothers that you will never forget.
