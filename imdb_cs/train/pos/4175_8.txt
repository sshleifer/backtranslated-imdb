I've always been interested in what happened to the magical sort of feeling that old Slovenian movies seemed to have in them ... Well, I was wondering if the feeling was just nostalgia. Or did the "feeling" decide to wrap his bags and say "goodbye" somewhere in the middle of our cinematic history and then never come back? Or was it? Because it came to me for the first time when I saw "Ekspres, Ekspres". And that was the old me. <br /> <br /> There are three characteristics of this film that make it somewhat unique and joyful to look at - the flow of the story, the warmth of the color, and - which I have most appreciated - the lack of excessive use of vocabulary at least consider many other (not only) Slovenian screenwriters. Words are not useful when you are well understood (yeah, or better) by other means that are being used. Just look at Bakovic and Cerar. Uh. <br /> <br /> So it's just so many words to recommend to you all Ekspres, Ekspres as a Slovenian movie no matter what you've heard about Slovenian movies (if you've ever heard anything, that's it. ..). Oh, and the scene where Bakovic is dancing to Vivaldi's music ... Feeling. <br /> <br /> Treat yourself. Bach.
