When I watched this movie, I began to feel very nostalgic. As a child growing up in rural areas, I felt like I was still a child! The swimming pool (in central Texas is called "the reservoir"), cross the landscape as a wild spirit! The story was very plausible, and I totally lost it and wept to the end. Through pain we are experiencing life ... life goes on and can be forgiveness.
