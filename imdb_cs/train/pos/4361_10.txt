It was probably one of the best films of the 1940s - Warner Bros. at the very beginning of their style. Shooting Sol Polito is probably his best success - beautiful composition and light shading. Max Steiner contributes one of his most complex and most beautiful scenarios - the embodiment of his classic leit motif method. Music gives children great emotion and excitement and is beautiful and unforgettable. It is interesting to note that the same production team that made this film later released the movie "Now, Voyager" - a great film that won awards and awards and went as a historical favorite because it played Bette Davis. In my opinion, "The Gay Sisters" is a much better film - better in all departments and more interesting, complex and fun. The most unusual film that entertains those who take it for what it is rather than to show its own modern creative sensitivity or advanced and demanding standards of hypercritical perfection. Every thing must be judged according to its own timetable and what it seeks to achieve according to its own conditions. Most complaints I've read in these reviews are so childish and I miss them at all. If you are hungry for a perfect mignon fillet, do not go to the bakery and start whining and complaining about delicious pastries. The art of film criticism is indeed lost to a large segment of the population. I apologize to people - maybe if this movie had some Rolling Stones scores and hundreds of complex and competing subpages, you are all happy to be happy. I take an old movie without modern intellectual claims every day of the week!
