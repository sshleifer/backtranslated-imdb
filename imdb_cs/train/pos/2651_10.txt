That is right. The film is better than a book. Do not get me wrong, I love the book. The film is much better. This movie has Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall at their best. (I did not see Scatman Crothers and probably Danny Lloyd in anything else.) Some of the ideas used in this movie are better than those used in the book. But I've already talked about them in my mini-series commentary. But I missed a couple. The film is shot in a better place than where the mini-series was shot. The REDRUM scenarios are more creepy than those in the book. So if you're looking for a great movie, bring Stanley Kubrick The Shining. But rely on nightmares every night for 3 weeks
