Hit at that time, but now better categorized as an Australian ball. The humor is wide, awkward and in the final scene, where the BBC studio fireworks goes out, it's rough. It contains almost every cliché about the traditional Australian pilgrimage to the "old earth" and every cliché about those unfortunate, stuck, silent, Tory Brits. It would be acceptable to the British because of the strong cast of famous actors and Australians of that generation who can "get" humor. Americans - forget it. Language and jokes are in the Australian dialect of English, and as such they will be incomprehensible.
