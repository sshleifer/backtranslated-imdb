This film should be required for all librarians or future librarians. All the best lines are directly related to librarianship. Public Library Argument vs. the academic library is a classic argument among librarians and students of libraries. It also breaks many library stereotypes. Librarians may even be able to have fun - even if they do not usually * have sex in the Romance language section! (Best movie about the Desk Set, with Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, of course.)
