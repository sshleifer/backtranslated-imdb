A good story. Good script. Good casting. Good deal. Good Direction. Good direction of art. Good photos. Good sound. Good Editing. All good. Put it together and end up with good entertainment. It is a shame that there are not enough films of this caliber today. We can be happy that writers / directors like John Hughes sometimes hear their creative voices. Whenever I notice that I'm watching the third or fourth film and still find it satisfyingly satisfying, I have to conclude that something about the film is right.
