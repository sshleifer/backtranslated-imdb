I saw it when I was a kid in The Wonderful World of Disney, so I did not remember much. When I looked recently I sat there when I thought, "This is the most tragic thing I've ever seen." Passenger scenes look like something caused by overdose of LSD. Animated characters are mostly oddly colored versions of Jungle Book and Robin Hood. Some things I have not seen I noticed: children were threatened by a knife and prostitutes (during the song "Portobello Road"). It was very fun, though the musical numbers were long, and I see few kids bored with them. Such an object was also a little dark, seeing how it was set during the Second World War.
