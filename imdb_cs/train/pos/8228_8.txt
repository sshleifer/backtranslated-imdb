it's hard to tell you something about this movie without spoiling it. I liked it because I did not expect what I see, but a common sexual career so ... It's a sexual sexual thriller that does not seem to be anything. Emmanuelle Seigner, a journalist on the genre (and nakedness), whose husband Polanski directed her, A scary performance (I said scary / yes CREEPY) by Toreton (actor Bernard Tavernier). It seems that Pascal Bruckner will meet Roman Polanski (better than Bitter Moon) like Chabrol disappeared or thriller Clouzot (I saw someone who mentioned Les Diaboliques) but closer to Les Yeux sans Visage Dr. Phibes and others). Jewel! I'm afraid they'll throw it into the Hollywood remake like they did with Nighwatch and The Vanishing.
