I really enjoyed that "Revolution will not be a television". Again, he gave me a positive sense of how people can decide for themselves how they want to be controlled. It is unfortunate that in Venezuela twenty percent of rich citizens made every decision for eighty percent of poor for decades, if not centuries. However, when their coup failed; after the temporary government dissolved the Supreme Court, the Constitution and the Ombudsman, the Electoral Council, and all civil rights, no one came to the plotter and shot them. They did not even go to jail. The main plotters live in Florida and continue on. And the protection they had was the "Bolivarian Constitution" passed by a large majority of the Venezuelan people. It's not just History. Democracy can give you hell if you let it go. And Venezuela is free.
