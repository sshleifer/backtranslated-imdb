The cast really helps to make it a pleasant surprise and transcendence of a normal human-versus-woman-argue-all-time-but-wind-in-love of Hollywood screwball romance / comedy. <br /> <br /> Most often I do not go to those types of movies and annoying storyline, but this was a refreshing, fun watching and oasis with a spell. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play each other well and make a very nice couple. Supporting acting is excellent - from Felix Bressart always to the villain Joseph Schildkraut. <br /> <br /> Frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen in his career. He takes the film and turns it into a different mood as soon as something dramatic happens to him. This "twist" is another reason why this movie rises above others of its kind. <br /> <br /> Again, when a movie has a good combination of categories, it's usually successful. This is a great example of this. In this film, it's romance, comedy and drama, and it's done well. I'll take it over the re-make "You Got Mail" every day. No comparison.
