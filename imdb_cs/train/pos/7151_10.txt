I read Holes in 5th grade, so when I heard they were making a movie, I was ecstatic! Of course I was my busy self, I did not have the chance to see the movie in the theaters. The openings were out of town, but unfortunately we were too busy. I was surprised to hear that all my friends saw it and none of them invited me! Everyone told you it was good, but I read great books that make dirty movies, so I was definitely afraid. Suddenly there was a perfect opportunity to see it. It was that week and my parents went on a cruise, and I let them watch. My sister, 9 years old, I followed her and absolutely loved her! Then I took it to the other people who were the home of babysitting and their children, 9 and 4, it also liked it. Even my parents loved it and they are film critics. Overall, I recommend that this film be for anyone who understands family morals and loves cheerful acting! This movie should be on your 5 most popular "to See" list !!!!
