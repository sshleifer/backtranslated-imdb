I really enjoyed the film, but I did not realize that little Richard had so many things in his life. I did not know Lucille first. There is very little (barely any) mention of women being intimately involved with Little Richard. Even in his present life there is no mention of how women would engage in a romantic way. I wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned. Overall, the movie was great. I also did not like the fact that Leon plays part of Little Richard, he's a good actor, but I feel that his part should go to another actor. Visually I did not remember Little Richard. I also did not fully realize the promiscuity that was little Richard. The film was portrayed as a sexual habit. Nowadays, reference will be made to counseling for his sexual replenishment. It was a voyeur. I do not want to destroy the movie for someone who did not see the movie, but there were a few things about the film that I think should not be part of the final cut.
