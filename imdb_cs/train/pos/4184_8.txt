Some war films succeed where others can not, and it can be judged from different angles. Humanistic angle in which you can feel raw emotions (horror of attack, camaraderie among soldiers, demanding trials that people face in combat, etc.) There are always films I find convincing. Movies like Das Boot and A Midnight Clear are just two examples of movies that you feel connected with characters in the movie. This movie is also thriving at this level. He speaks of "Supreme Honor," and this honor does the right thing. These 23 soldiers did the right thing, they were honored and recognized in a way completely incompatible with Western thought, but ultimately it is a true story of honor. An unforgettable movie. Based on a real story.
