This movie later appeared with breakfast on my Sunday morning with my brother. We drunk. This is one of the best ripping movies I've ever seen. From the "luxury" ocean line, which is actually the "turn, turn" the ferry, supplemented with cast iron in the door by self-adhesive labels that call staff, then they see that the same door is used for something else in another scene - !! Continuity is so bad that you can not help, but notice that it pops over you in the face of the holes. In the final scene they jump from the lifeboat with the ferry in the distance. Cut yourself off to your son and new girlfriend (ship PR director who knows the kung-fu and used to be in the police, but he was released because he does things in a way - right) on a ferry that has turned away quickly from the blast. ... ... Then Dad is embracing. As???? Who cares, has magic. This movie is not one redemption. The casino has a large bedroom with one casino table. when persecuted by villains, there is only one place you hide, you thought. Enter the villains who instead of checking under the table One shoot four fruit machines and a small corner bar (the corner bar in the casino - fantastic). They move right around a single shelter, allowing our Casper to circumvent and "take out". Get a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, insert this movie and run out.
