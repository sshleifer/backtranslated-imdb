The second alternative story of the universe Gundam (G-Gundam is the first), Gundam Wing is another look at the verse Gundam. Known elements are found, but Gundam Wing actually differs from their counterparts. The biggest ones are Gundam, nothing more than terrorists fighting against one lonely organization. In fact, the show will not actually be a show of war until Episode 7, but in truth a real conflict, Eve Wars, will not happen until later episodes. <br /> <br /> The greatest positives of this series are its characters. All the main characters are included throughout the 49 episodes and you can really sympathize with each of the roles that have been embedded in them. Another great plus is the fantastic character and the mecha design series. The design forced some of her Gundam counterparts to shame. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest critics of this series is how many hard-hitting UC fans claim to have been knocked out of the original UC. Why Gundam Wing gets this rap when the UC clone Gundam Seed is obvious is outside of me. It is true that many moments are lifted, but in a new way, there are also different differences. Take, for example, the usual comparison of Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable. In the whole series, Zechs is more outcast in the alliance and also in the OZ style, while the red comet lit the Zeon symbol. Another big difference is the fact that Zechs loses a lot of soldiers under his command and is therefore another nickname he gives in early episodes: "The Killer of His Own Men." Char is not tagged with this label. <br /> <br /> The problems with this series are not the mumbo jumbo philosophy, but two problems. The first is the animated Gundams attack record. Sure it's fun when you see attacks on heavy weapons, MS and aircraft for the first time. But on the fourth scene of reuse like this, the old. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that the entire series is to be held throughout the year. If you really think about all the events that appear in the series, it's going to happen a lot in one lonely year. <br /> <br /> But I think you can easily reject this fact when you ignore intro of the first line so often. How it fits is probably the best of the Gundam stories about the alternative universe and a great introduction to the Gundam world. After all, this was the first American anime Gundam on TV.
