At the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), his colleagues and friends recall how stubborn he was in finding a spoon. Meanwhile, the dead Joe will reveal the identity of the serial killer of the Tarot Card in London. He is cheating on Reaper and appearing to American journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), who is on the stage in the magic show of Magic Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London and tells her that the killer is aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra in his investigation, Sid attracts and finds evidence that Peter is a murderer. However, she falls in love with him and asks if Joe Strombel is right in his spoon. "Scoop" is another great Woody Allen comedy outside Manhattan, actually again in London. Its ironic and funny lines are just fantastic and I laughed a lot, including my hero's fate in a country where people drive "on the wrong side". Sid Waterman is immensely entertaining, and Woody Allen has a great look like a comedian. His current sculpture, Scarlett Johansson, of which I am a big fan, has many times over effects and is annoying, changing in his accent to histrionic pronunciation. Her character is absolutely stupid and promiscuous, and I was quite disappointed with my performance (probably for the first time in my filmography). But this supernatural comedy is still cheerful and useful fun. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Scoop? O Grande Furo" ("Scoop? Big Scoop")
