Realistic depictions of young love to college, but also tempting to an older viewer like me. It has ups and downs, twists and turns and forced me to break a tear or two. We rarely see movies with black urban characters that could appeal to older non-black audiences and show more realistic views of young adult blacks. This film takes place at a university and in a city where two people meet and fall in love. In the background, different friends are familiar and situations that affect them for better or worse. Typically someone can say, but it was really unexpected. <br /> <br /> I found myself based on the survival of marital relationships and I see my own history in my story. Immediate moments of deep thought and revelation fled from the performances. <br /> <br /> It's a clear film that I would support for those young in heart and in love or when they were in love. Great movie. I'll look for a copy I can add to my movie collection.
