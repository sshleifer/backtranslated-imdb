Tigerland is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and in my opinion even a full-metal jacket, a film of a similar character. Bozz plays extremely well Farrell and is a character that stays in your mind long after the movie ends. The end is brilliantly cut by the schumacher - melodic harmonic singing and slow soldiers who are about to leave. What movie.
