Other reviewers seem to be a horrible movie. It's just not true and a little unfair. It plays in good quality and the direction moves with good fluidity. I do not think there is anything wrong with how Tarantino-esquire connects together. Maybe it's just a new tool for directors. I thought the movie was a lot more interesting. Perhaps several elements of the scenario need to be tightened, but it's the only bug I can find. Nestor Cantillana gives great performance as Sylvio, and Antonella Rios is amazing and is worth the admission itself.
