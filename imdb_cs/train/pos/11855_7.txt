Wow. Something surprised. Though wrong, it is much better than I expected. The brand new Arcturus spacecraft with about 3000 passengers is in the last days of his sixteen-day trip to Jupiter. Without warning, the brain (central computer) of the ship sounded an alarms alarm and ordered everyone to evacuate. <br /> <br /> Soon, there are only a handful of people left, including one of the ship's astrogators (Penny), the Captain (Cary) and the Line Director (Kenyon). <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> It turns out that the alarm was false and that the main brain acts <br /> <br /> erratic. Remaining passengers and crew must escape from the ship and avoid personal conflicts to survive. The movie starts very well. The opening ad is a very nice touch. There are obvious parallels to 2001: Space Odyssey and the historic Titanic sinking. The film sometimes slows down and has movement problems, but it is generally well done and acting well.
