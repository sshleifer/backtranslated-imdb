Nicolas Martin (nicmart) from Houston, TX: "Good movie but DVD reformatted for television", April 8, 2002 - This is a charming and emotional movie. On the other hand, the purchased DVD was "reformatted to take your TV" behind the Columbia Tristar spikes. There is no excuse for not filming in a wide format except Hollywood treats all movies like dirty, disposable waste , which is so used to production. br /> <br /> What (crime!) is really shame. But there is another version. See http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDCompare2/kingofmasks.htm <br /> <br /> Wonderful performance of two major actors (The King and Doggie) BTW.
