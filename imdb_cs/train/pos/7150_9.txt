What a great movie! This is reminiscent of Disney's gorgeous family films from the 1960s and 1970s. I was so pleasantly surprised that after the last 20 years of absolute detritus, Disney live productions bounce. <br /> <br /> This movie is an absolute joy. Children's stars were just that; professional and quality actors. The quality of this film is most amazing. Sigourney Weaver was totally sycophantic * put hyperbole here. * Keeping a prison camp for boys away. Siobhan Fallon was fabulous as a star mother. I'm not going to tell the story because it has nothing to do with it, but the story is wonderful, the direction was extraordinary and the acting quality was great! This work reminds you what it is like to be a child without going all sweet or being too cruel. The deleted scenes displayed in the DVD version were really best omitted. They were too harsh for this movie, and they would have taken so much. While abuse was implied in the finished product, it was not clear. It was the best. <br /> <br /> It was an absolutely beautiful movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Get 9/10 from ... <br /> <br /> Attachment :.
