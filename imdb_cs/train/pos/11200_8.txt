This early film has its mistakes - a predictable conspiracy and some exaggerated scenes with dubious meaning - but that's already clearly demonstrated by Hitchcock's mastering of the adaptation and use of powerful images. It is also one of the most prestigious films in style; note, for example, the strange distortion it uses during the party sequence and frequent echoes of both title and plot in the image. Its core remains the final match, which is still among the more exciting examples of cinematic boxing. Although you know the hero has to win, it is fairly believable that he loses and his wife's move from the corner of the champion to his, which motivates the final payout of the plot, is very well connected with the development match. Stopwatch inserts do exactly what they should; you can almost hear ticking (although it is a silent film, visuals often have a surprisingly aural feel). This stimulation becomes incredibly fast, and the viewer gets absorbed in the excitement and brutality of both matches and the sexual jealousy that is under him. The only edition of the DVD I'm familiar with is that it's Laserlight, a publicly owned company. As with all hitchcocks who were released, they joined various music choices, mostly orchestral. Audio editing is often unattainable and sound quality varies considerably, but true care seems to be taking place in most real possibilities, and the music accompanying the final match works very well. it is unlikely that this succession will sometimes be better accompanied than here. <br /> <br /> This is a much more impressive film than its previously unclear suggestion. He deserves a place of honor in the Hitchcock canon and a slim box of precious boxing films.
