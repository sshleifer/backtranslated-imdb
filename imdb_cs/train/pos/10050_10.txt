Dad Danielle Steel, what a refreshing story. This film celebrated the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children. How rare is it? At these times, "Heather has two mom" (or whatever, you fill the blanks) it's easy to understand why this topic is not for everyone. With my father's roles being prominent, I was hoping it would be another Daniell Steel Saga. How disappointing it is when it ends. Each character was important, and the wonderful work carried its role. I'd like to see every figure over the years. I loved this movie, it is one that I will watch defiantly every time it is on it. A good story, good acting, and I hope it's not a spoiler, but not a bad sex or a bad language. Yes, touched my heart. Beware, prepare Kleenex. What I find sad is that this aspect of family life is rarely displayed today in our entertainment, whether on television or on television. Movies. Daniell, if your listening, Go Girl, will give us more.
