"Hamlet" Kenneth Branagha will hit all the stamps. Acting is spectacular, 70mm cinematography is wonderful, Oscar nominated costumes and suits are amazing, and Patrick Doyle's (also nominated for Oscar) scores are sensitive and moving. Yeah - The script of a guy named Will S. is not too bad. Critics criticized Branagh for accepting the fourth Oscar node to "adapt" the script, but his decision to use the entire text was real. I can not think of many better ways to make four hours flying around. Almost every Branagh decision makes a great job: the use of the English Blenheim Palace for exteriors, the Edwardian dress, and the production of "Be or Not Be" in a hall of mirrors, naming a couple. Casting hollywood lights such as Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon in smaller parts can distract attention. Major Cast Outstanding: Derek Jacobi captures the conflicting nature of Claudia; Kate Winslet acutely depicts the descent of Ophelie into madness; Julie Christie brings passion to her portrayal of Gertrude; Richard Briers is perfect as the sad Polonius; and Nicholas Farrell highlights Horatio's potentially ungrateful role to the apotheosis of true friendship. Every speech, every line, every word is delivered with passion and conviction; there is no unnecessary moment in the whole movie. The final scenes increase the extent of Shakespeare's tragedy in a way that is not possible with theatrical adaptations. Branagh's "Hamlet" is a courageous, ambitious and ultimately successful attempt to combine the majesty and the poetry of Shakespeare's language with the same eloquent images. Is this probably the greatest Shakespeare adaptation ever shot? strong praise but deserved.
