... On the scene, on television or in a book, "Woman in Black" is an excellent story of spirits. Other reviewers have already said they are not talking about this movie at all, but I thought I'd add my lazy little review. The movie made for television has a deliberately slow first act that chronicles Arthur's main character when it comes to doing business as a lawyer in the 20th anniversary of London. I understand why it does not seem to everyone. However, for me, I love this British style narrative similar to any BBC "Ghost Story for Christmas" by adapting the great work of M.R. James. In the second act, the story of the spirit begins when Arthur sends his boss to the provinces to calm the affairs of the deceased client. The third act is relentlessly tortured - an ant's conclusion ... Like London, I saw the game. I have my own book, DVD-R and I have an undamaged audio book on my iPod. What is for sure that "Women in Black" in any medium is a story about a spirit with several straight. It's time we had a legitimate 2 DVD release area.
