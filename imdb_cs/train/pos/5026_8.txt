It's a great movie that everyone should see. It's like Dean Koontz's book. Bill Paxton's performance was great in that he really seems to believe in what he says and does. I do not know why viewers have to read some kind of defending religious murders in the movie. It's a fiction. The end is surprising, but fictional. So what? I think it makes this movie so good. SPOILER DO NOT READ WHEN THE FILM WAS DISPLAYED. Throughout the movie, the viewer is constantly shocked by the nature of Paxton's disease, the impact on children, and the way children behave in this unfair manner. And finally it will turn out to be true. God has given him the mission to rid the world of demons. Paxton is not clear-cut, as other viewers suggest. Sure, he got the information that he could not know otherwise, but the film goes on to show how God is "protecting" Adam through an appropriate image quality problem and a total lack of memory from the other FBI agent. The film does not support Christian murder, it's just a reflection of the viewer on a very unexpected ride.
