"Scoop" is the most entertaining film of Woody Allen in 2000. Allen, while finally looking at his age, is at the top of his play as Magician Sidney Waterman. His unicorns and behavior are merry. Do not allow critics to influence your opinion. "Scoop" is the top spot of "Woody-Lite". <br /> <br /> The score of classical music is an excellent compliment to on-screen action. Scarlett Johanson looks beautiful in his swimsuit. Jackman is breathtaking. Cinematography shines. "Scoop" is a great escort fare from the beginning to the end. The last film of the film is worth the entry price.
