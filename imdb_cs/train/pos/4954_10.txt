Big, fun, sweet film with Morgan Freeman (who plays alone), who meets a Spanish girl called Scarlet (Paz Vega) in a small store while exploring a potential independent film. During the first ten minutes I was a bit dubious about the movie, but when I was in the store, I really enjoyed the film. It shows how a positive approach can change something. It does not contain any complicated drawings and is easy to follow, but it raises the saddest moods and makes you smile all the way without the need for small clich√©s of romance. Includes several scenes that can connect your hips with laughter. Very rare work!
