I swear that the zombie was killed twice and is constantly returning. I made this film 8. Let's assume it's people, that's exactly what other reviewers say, ie Handy-Cam Movies. Hey, hey, hey, I welcome you making india. The fact that Todd Sheets got over 700 zombies to appear in this film is a tribute to his talent. Yes, the story has gaps, yes, we see the same zombies again and again, but who really cares? Take it for what it is, an amusing and horror horror film, one with the kids you share with your puddings, or you share the people who really care about LOL. Soft people, I suppose you all liked lots of garbage like "Titanic" or "Twister". Peace and support an independent film!
