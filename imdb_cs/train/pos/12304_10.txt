it's a great movie. I like where Ning climbs to get the ink, and the skeletons chase him, but fortunately he has avoided them, opened the window and did not even notice them. xiao qian is also very nice. and when he stuck the needle up Wu's ass, his hysterical. and when he says love is the greatest thing on earth, while standing between two swords is also great. then also the part where the bread plays her when she watches the man kill a lot of people. then you see him sing poems as he ran to escape the wolves. love scenes are romantic, xiao qian and ning look cute together. add comic timing, giant tongue, and u have horror, romance, comedy, all at once. not to mention the excellent special effects for the 90s.
