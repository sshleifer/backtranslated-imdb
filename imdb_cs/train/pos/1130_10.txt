"Iphigenia" is a great success for Michael Cacoyannis. This master game is majestically adapted to the screen and brought to life by a wonderful cast. Cacoyannis has made it impossible. He managed to make a Greek tragedy without losing efficiency and importance. Stellar Greek occupation helps him in this. Newcomer Tatiana Papamoschou is as impressive as Iphigenia. Also impressive is Irene Papas, who sometimes seems to be over the top, is very realistic. A beautiful Greek film, beautifully dressed and directed by Michael Cacoyannis, with an outstanding musical score by Mikis Theodorakis, which is perfect in every scene. <br /> <br /> Short stories tell us that the film lost the best foreign language film Oscar by only one voice !!!
