I loved this movie. I thought it would be easy to watch and easily forget. When I watched I bought a DVD, I ran out of it and did not forget it! <br /> <br /> The script is great and casting can not be more perfect. Each character has its own moment and in this movie I laughed, comedy timing was in place. <br /> <br />
