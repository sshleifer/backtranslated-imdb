For this film I only make one apology: There are far, far, too many widescreen details, and if you are irritating to perseverance, fair enough. The bartender was driving me in the first ten minutes or so. But then I did some truce with terrible cinematography; and long before the end of the movie I stopped worrying. It's too much of a comedy that's so easy to destroy. It's funny, it's funny, the comic delivery of all the cast is flawless and however many Usher peers on his attitudes through the cold, fish eye lens - HE does not have to worry too much - he can present them with warmth. "Mystery Men" is actually not only fun, not only smarter, but even deeper than anyone seems to think it is worth it. Also jokes in Austin Powers movies, as well as less funny than jokes, are also much toothless. Satirization of "mysterious men" bites when something is worth biting and gently absorbs when it is not there. Not just an old thing is ridiculed. That's why, unlike what some (I have to consider them unnoticed) critics have said, it never exhausts ideas. "Super" heroes are an attractive group. Sure, they are the second, but they are not the only ones. Blue Rajah, for example, does not make people just cutlery and it's not good at it. On the other hand, it is not even funny. He is better in his limited area than most people, and he works diligently. It's not a joke, which is much more fun than if it were. If the Superman is in the Cape, mysterious men are all smaller demigods from the foothills of the Olympus cap in the cap. Much more fun; also much more cute.
