This is an excellent Sammo Hung movie. In fact, this is a great piece of action cinema in Hong Kong. The story tells the story of Macau pedicure drivers looking for love and mixing with an evil pimp. The performances are excellent and the characters are all pleasant and well defined. The story includes and has enough romance, drama, comedy, and tension to watch one between combat scenes. Sammo Hung proves he is probably the best combat choreographer in the field. The event is just amazing, especially the fight with Lau Kar Leung and the final. Billy Chow and Sammo Hung are amazing. He has to see every fan of the event.
