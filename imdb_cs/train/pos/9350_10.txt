let me tell you that I love Adam Sandler, watch the reign over me that I pay great attention to his acting when he picks up his voice, I can not help but think about the happy gilmore screaming at the golf ball, then I'm glad when Adam Sandler sucks me. <br /> <br /> Reign over Me is a great movie, a movie that is slowly falling apart, and you're expecting emotions in every scene. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle always does a great job and there is no exception with some really great lines and is a good Oscar in any movie that makes Adam Sandler was amazing in many ways not only that it was his most dramatic / your career. but I can recall the loud laughter in many parts of this film Supporting the cast was great with Saffron Burroughs and Jada Pinkett Smith <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to get amazing actresses beautiful shots from NYC great comedy big drama A a new revealing respect for Adam Sandler, if you ever doubted him, or the certainty of how great the Don Cheadle is
