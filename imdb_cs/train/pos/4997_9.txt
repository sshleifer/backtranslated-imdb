This is a great movie for any action fan in Hong Kong. In addition to a small conspiracy, poor drama and bits of comic horror, the film is action full of combat and martial arts action. I kept having fun from start to finish. I thought Shannon Lee was amazing in the movie. Being an Action Director, like Corey Yuen, is what keeps the Hong Kong action strong. This modern action movie is highly recommended !!
