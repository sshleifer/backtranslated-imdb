For the first time I saw it, I was not too shy. At that time I was only fifteen years old, and I thought maybe somebody in the deepest humor was too mature to understand at that time. I had the same reaction when I saw her a few months ago, and this time it was because Felix's suicide attempt at the beginning of the film somewhat diminished the movie. This scene did some of the things Oscar had said and he did Felix later, the film seemed unnecessarily cruel, and their personality clashes were not as fun as they could be. If I did not realize the story, I would be afraid that some of the Oscar's horrors that Felix would have might have jumped him. As it was, I did not laugh or smile like a TV show with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall. Still, overall, it was a pretty good film and filled one of the biggest sitcoms on television. 7 out of 10.
