It is not a bad film, with Sanders, Barrie, Hale, Cowen, Hamilton, Gargan, Fitzgerald, and even Willie Best we could be with either Charlie Chan, Moto, Falco, Blackie, Holmes or the Saints, etc. In other words, get the opportunity to spend another hour in the society of some old friends, from ordinary to urban, murdering and being assassinated - it's always a pleasure in my book. Barrie is a hard-cooked lady to avenge and clean her framed and dead father, a police detective, by planning and carrying out a chain of assassination underground with his coterie. Which should definitely have the opposite effect! Sanders joins in the fun simply by dancing in the right club at the right place in the right city at the right time, with the right lighting falling on him and the first killer (at the right time!) And killing him. > <br /> Story and acting are all right, the only thing I have is near the end with the hasty and almost laughing discovery of who is the evil genius (Waldeman) - they almost forgot his meaning in the plot? This means a solid entry into the series.
