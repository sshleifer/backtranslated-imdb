Overall, this film was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many generations. Although the story is not exactly 100% accurate, everything is right. The film goes far ahead and some important parts are missing. I found the book and was ready and immediately wanted to shoot the film (because I did not find out about the movie yet), but later I found a movie at Wal-Mart and I decided to buy it and see if it was what I was expected. Overall, I give movies 7 out of 10 for their good parts (relative accuracy and overall sense) and for their bad parts (large transitions and small but noticeable inaccuracies).
