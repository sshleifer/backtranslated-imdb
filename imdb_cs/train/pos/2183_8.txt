Billy Wilder is a part of the story and his sentimental touch is evident in this completely original story of ghostwriting composers who both work on the burnt music legend Oliver Courtney. Apparent misunderstandings are getting out of the way quite quickly, thanks to the wonder and what remains, is a funny and cute mix with some fine songs (and others forgotten), Crosby in his most beautiful, big turn legend Broadway Mary Martin and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant providing the majority of cynical barbs (the Levant is in a rare form and its readings are not at all). Surprising surprise and recommended to all fans of this genre.
