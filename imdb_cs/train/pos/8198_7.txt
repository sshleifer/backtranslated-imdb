Dirty Harry must trace the victim of a rape that will pay off by shooting his invaders in a dove before he kills them. The most likely appropriate punishment is to let them live after the initial shot and let them suffer forever like her and her sister ... Anyway ..... a story set in action in San Francisco and Santa Cruz. Andy Drake, the main rapist, is badly nasty and will of course punish him at the end of course (of course!). Not a classic movie, but better than others except the original Dirty Harry.
