The primary aspect of this movie, which most people lack, is that Luhzin lives as a chess game. So many people saw this movie and just did not get it and I do not understand why. While watching this movie, I was taken on a private trip that surrounded me. I will try to explain it without spoilers, but be warned in advance, I'm talking about the things that happen in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** Possible Spoilers **** Be Forewarned! **** <br /> <br /> It's the life of "big moves" versus "small strokes". She chooses Natalie for her queen and he and her acting as her aunt first described the king and the queen and their moves when she introduced him as a chess. Listen carefully to this description. When someone asks the question, he remembers the past as if he had looked at past movements. (Incidentally, flashes are beautifully lit.) Flashes are also quite interesting because they give not only his opinion as a child but also a look at the other character. It's amazing. Different characters become either his helpers or his enemies, pawns, bishops, and knights, their deeds enlighten you who they are on the side. Even their location in the scene is key to understanding what's going on. Beautifully done. <br /> <br /> I will not comment more on what happens to Luhzin, but I hope it will explain what is going on at the end. <br /> <br /> This film is constantly working on many levels and I therefore support it. It was an experience and joy. If you like this movie, I recommend Fresh. The only way these films are similar is the use of chess and characters that are considered to be pieces. <br /> <br />
