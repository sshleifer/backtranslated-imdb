There are many problems with Mystery Men. Above all, there are too many different characters to get complex or even interesting personalities. Special effects reduce the story and are not that special. Paul Reubens is useless in a terrible, teenage role as a character who simply looks and speaks with an inaudible accent. Now on decent parts. William H Macy, three heavenly words and his performance as a shoveler is perfect. Sphinx is an extremely funny character that is just mysterious and radiates from traditional mystic proverbs. Ben Stiller is also very entertaining, showing the weak character that is trying to get into the big league superheroes. All the characters do, and this is an area I found particularly ironic. That's because all actors are actors in India who are trying to get into the big leagues of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the reason I thought it would work better if more effort was made to improve the scenario than to have unnecessary CGI landscapes and effects.
