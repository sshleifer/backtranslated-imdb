What can I say about such a story? This magical story follows my early childhood, evoking warm memories in my heart. Characters bring you to so many moods that make you want more of all scenes. For example, the market has had so many different flavors of tradition. I loved exotic dancers who accompanied a steel drum. The storyline was wonderful. I wanted so terribly that Landsbury decided to have early children, and to stay with Mr. Brok. find the other half of the spell to keep men less armor to win the war. I'm still a kid inside, and this film appeals to my inner child like no one else. This film is my decisive favorite of all time. I hope that all children will be able to watch this classic and be taken away and transferred to another time.
