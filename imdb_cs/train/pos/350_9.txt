I wanted to see Valentine since I saw that there were Denise Richards and Marley Shelton because they played some of my favorite movies sometime. As I watched Valentina, I was amazed at how great the story line was. It kills me when I see it has a low rating because it was not terrible at all. Actors and actors played the game great, and the way he finished was so great and cunning. Some of the scenes were a bit unbelievable or bad, and I admit that in a few smaller parts it is a little boring, but overall it was always fun and thrilling. It was a story that helped you guess all the way and did not deserve all the bullshit it gets. I recommend watching this movie anytime, but especially on Valentine's Day, because it's sure to give you a lot of winters. Oh, and do not even pay attention to the trailer or rating, please, NO ...
