I watched it a few years ago. I remembered this as a very mysterious situation and a mixture of melancholy things, such as the destiny of Dorothy and the personal future of Bogdanovic. I turned to look at my copy of VHS and then I examined it more and more. Today I'm waiting for the DVD version at any price, please! <br /> <br /> The country and easy listening to music is very well chosen from the first second, a little blue-gray but also happy. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All the characters are great for me, with funny situations, great gaming and lots of dialogues that have transformed me into a cult movie and a lot of people I met on the Internet or in cinema. This may not be an accident. I think the title is hope for life! You have to be happy and laugh as much as possible <br /> <br /> I know it may be a special commentary for the film but the fact is, I like it very much, I think the film has marked me and I will never forget it.
