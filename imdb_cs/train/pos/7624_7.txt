A nice unforgettable film of animal-killing-human-like animals, specifically similar to "Willard" by playing an aging actress (in this case, a little falling to the level of Les Tremayne, the performance I saw him giving) as a man whose life is unbalanced, and who then decides to use his pet friends to avenge vengeance to those who have hurt him. Yes, this is one of those movies where almost everyone is contemptuous, so you will have fun when they die, and really a selection of actors, location etc. It could not be better if the film was the atmosphere of shabby decadence. <br /> <br /> Tremayne's character is "Snakey Bender," and he is definitely the most interesting in the movie: an old snakes collector who is obsessed with the music of John Philip Souza. When the local preacher brings together his practice of collecting small animals from local schoolchildren as a bait for his snakes and his boyfriend marries a disconnecting (such an uproar concert ritual Wednesday night bandage), rampage continues to create an unforgettable mass of clunks under the cliff where he interprets wrecks after, what they have disposed of their unhappy owners. One fun game you can play when watching "snakes" is to place bets on which cars will land the most on the cliff. <br /> <br /> In all, very cheap and exploitative, there really will be a lot of fun for fans of these kinds of movies.
