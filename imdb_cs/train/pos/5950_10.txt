This movie is great. The plot is very true for the book, which is a classic written by Mark Twain. The film starts with a scene in which Hank sings a song with a group of children called "When You Stumble a Feet on the Moon." It reminds me of Sinatra's High Hope song, it's fun and inspiration. The music is great and my favorite song is singed by King Hank (bing Crosby) and Sir "Saggy" Sagamore. OVerall great family movie or even great movie Date. This is a movie you can watch over and over again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is beautiful. I love this movie !! If you liked Danny Kay in court Jester, you will definitely like this movie.
