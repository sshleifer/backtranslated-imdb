'' Sentinel '' is one of the best horror films ever made in the film industry! I think it's very scary because there are really few movies in fact. Alison Parker is a model with some fame. He meets a lawyer called Michael Lerman and has another Jennifer model as best friend. Everything was great in her life until she decided to live alone for some time and borrowed a beautiful and old apartment. The problem is her neighbors, who are very, very strange. Suddenly, Alison will begin to experience health problems and faints with frequency; She remembers some painful facts about her past that cause her to have nightmares or illusions. But everything has reason, and it has to do with the new house he lives in ... I personally like "The Sentinel" a very haunted movie and along with "The Exorcist" are two of the worst movies I've ever watched. we find that Alison's house is only a priest and my blood is frozen! It's also terrible to see that it's necessary to become blind at the end of the film to become a new guardian to save monsters from the world.
