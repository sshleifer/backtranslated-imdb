"The Garden of Allah" was one of the first three-strip Technicolor films. To repair the previous poster, the first technicolor (after Disney's 5-year exclusivity deal) was in 1935 "Becky Sharp", a costume drama that used the color for its lush costumes. <br /> <br /> "The Garden of Allah" looks like it could be filmed years later because cinematography uses not only color but also the use of shadows. It had to be amazing for the audience at the time to see the color of seeing only black and white movies all their life. Unfortunately, the film is not cinematographic. That being said, the film is worth seeing as well as visual treatment.
