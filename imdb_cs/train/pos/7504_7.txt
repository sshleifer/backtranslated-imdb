Hey, I'm actually in this movie! I did not even know it was on this site until I saw myself a few years ago and I was so surprised! I played Pete, son of the main characters. It was a great experience and I loved it every minute. During filming I needed to be in two places at once, so they used their twin sister as a double body! The finger that pushes the button in the car is not hers. I'm still acting and doing some television, but not so much. Oh, and if you want a document, my name is first at the top of the scrollbar. <br /> <br /> Review: I thought the movie was fine, but if I was not in it, it would not be one of my favorites. I thought acting was really good, but the story was just that.
