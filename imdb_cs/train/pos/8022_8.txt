Muppets from Jim Henson are popular since childhood. This movie again seems like a child. Okay, Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. The premise is that they are trying to get to Broadway at a music show where else than in New York. You will see the cameras of the then-mayor of New York, Ed Koch. Anyway, this movie was shot this year, and I hope today's kids will learn to appreciate the freshness of the Muppets Gang. The problem with the show is that Kermit is missing and the gang must find him in New York. It is worth seeing for children and sentimental adults like me.
