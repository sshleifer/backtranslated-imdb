I found out that this is a very fun little childhood movie that is actually more adult oriented with lots of jokes and humor to understand. Several things are inappropriate for kids, but few. Othewise, "The Grinch" (Jim Carrey) cracks so many jokes that you can not keep up with everyone, from sexual to cultural to insider - Hollywood to racial. The movie is very colorful and looks great on DVD. Little girl here, "Cindy Lou Who" (Taylor Momsen) is really cute and the costumes and hair of the little people here are fun. The voice of Anthony Hopkins is also pleasant, so with his narrative, he is uplifting another movie. His braids are fun. I saw it in the theater even though it was "fair", but it was much better on DVD. I've seen it three times and always got better.
