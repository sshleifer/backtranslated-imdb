This movie is there with classical music. Music, camera shots and gaming are great. Viewing the movie in black and white has offered him a much better look and perfectly complemented music perfectly like Psycho. Surprisingly, how few people commented on this movie. My guess is the hard movie he finds. I filmed the movie 9. See the movie and you will know what I'm talking about.
