The strong adaptation of the best-selling book and the breaking Broadway play about the lives of Bessie and Sadie Delana, two "color" nurses who have lived a hundred years old. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll starred in their old age, telling their story in the memories of Amy Hill Hearth (played by Amy Madigan), white reporter of the New York Times. Flash and contemporary scenes are not as inspirational as the book, but they are really strong. Some aspects of the nurses' lives, such as their mother's inter-racial background and the reasons for their father's strict personality, are not clearly stated. You have to read the book to fully understand these things. Which is just as good because the book is just as great! In addition to these shortcomings, it is greatly done and performed, especially by Dee and Carroll, and a very strong and educational film.
