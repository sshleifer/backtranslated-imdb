Based on the real story, this series is a jewel in its kind. A secretary who will become the queen by capturing the heart of the strongest man in the village. In the diamond mining town of Tijuco, Brazil, the diamond commando - appointed by the King of Portugal - is the ultimate body. She has grown in relative security in her home, young and beautiful Xica da Silva finds her world is at risk when she decides to sell her in a bourgeois house in the city, and refuses to admit that a black slave girl might be his daughter. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Xica steals the diamonds that gathered the diamond commandos for the king who wants to use them to escape. The Royal Army arrives to collect the diamonds the next day, and when the spoils disappear, the diamond arrival is carried in chains, his family is thrown out and thrown out on the street with only the back of his clothes. Martin, son of a diamond commandant, swears revenge. But Xica and the other slaves are sold at an auction, and Xica ends up in the house of a Sergeant Major, an old man who bought it just to hit him. However, the new diamond commandos, the elegant and ruthless Joao Fernandes, come to Tijuco. She instantly hit the beauty of Xika, manipulating the Sergeant Major to sell him. And so the love story begins, full of danger, intrigue and passion, between the noble nobleman and the predatory slave that rises in one day to become a queen. The series is filled with rich details about the era of belief, superstition, politics, fashion, and so on. It really can capture your attention every minute. Sometimes funny with a sarcastic and dark humor, full of tension and unexpected twists. "Xica da Silva" is definitely a must. I wish I could buy the whole series on DVD.
