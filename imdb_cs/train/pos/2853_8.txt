Finally, I saw this movie after I leased it in Blockbuster (VHS). I have to agree that it is wildly original. Yes, maybe the characters were not fully realized, but it's not one of those movies. Rather, he's dedicated to the director, his idea of ​​what the story is. And it does not stop. And to be honest, I did not want to. I believe Sabu had to influence director "Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels" and "Run, Lola, Run". But I absolutely loved the way the three lead a beautiful woman on the street to turn it away immediately. I really have to see another director's work, because the movie really caught me. To look into culture, patience and drang, go somewhere else. To laugh, move camera and criminal fun, check out here.
