The home room deals with Columbine-like high school shooting, but rather than hadhing through the very occurrence of the film depicts the consequences and what happened to the survivors, their trauma, guilt and denial. * Spoilers * The shooting itself is considered a premature conclusion, without any action shots, rather than the reaction of the almost teen SWAT commutator after shooting the assassin in high school. The film has three protagonists; a detective investigating a crime that is not convicted, and two teenage girls surviving the incident played by very young Erika Christensen and Busy Philipps. Two girls who have nothing in common except shooting are put together for this and the drama appears. Erika Christensen, though only 24 were around the block so much that movie viewers are largely acquainted with her firm and reliable style of acting. Busy Philipps, three years older than Christensen, and totally unknown, threw me away with her stunning dramatic force and presence on the screen. This girl was part of it. It's a great movie and it combines with you with a confidential focus on the fragile and ever-growing relationship between two traumatized girls. Elephant Gus van Sant (2003), though good, seems to be almost superficial and miserable compared to the Home Room in terms of dramatic taste and acting. I can see that this movie has very little time on screen and exposure - much more loss for the same traumatized America. Ten out of ten
