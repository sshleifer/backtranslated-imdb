What makes Midnight Cowboy a successful movie is the way Joe Buck becomes associated with Ratso Rizzo through a series of suffering that touches them. There is really no hope in this movie for previewing this film, but the hard facts surrounding them give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within themselves. <br /> <br /> This film represents the best performance Jon Voight and probably Dustin Hoffman. The rest of the cast is made up of strangers, even though it is rounded off by a fine series of actors, including cowcock on the bus at the beginning of the movie. Also for those interested, Andy Warhol's apprentice Paul Morrissey will appear briefly during the party scene. If you have not seen this movie, it is necessary. Look at it.
