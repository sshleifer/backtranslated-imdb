I'm embarrassed when I say I missed "Mother" when it was in theaters. I saw this tonight on DVD. I gave her 10 votes, one of the few I gave here. This English independent film is filmed with such care and quality. He pulled me inexorably. The story, pure and purely human, is brutally honest and totally absorbed by Anna Reid's acting acts, Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw. Cinematography is amazing. The score is firmly attached to the conspiracy. The story is epic, brilliantly dressed by the writer Hanif Kureishi in the life of the world. This story deals with great problems with the fineness of Impressionist painting. And some of these big problems are very controversial, which probably explains the lack of honors, despite many nominations. It's just one of my favorite movies.
