This is the movie Arnold. Now that you know, I saved a lot of time to read this review. If you do not like Arnold then you will not like this movie. If the case is different, you will probably like it. It's so simple. <br /> <br /> Now, if you still read this, I expect you like Arnold. Good for you! It's pretty good, no. A running man is a very typical feature of Arnold. It has the usual retro-future that we have known so well since the 1980s B-Sci Fi, it has a lot of terrible unicorns, lots of violence and explosions and heroin and a happy ending. <br /> <br /> <br /> In this case, the evil player is an all-inclusive 1984 government that uses television as effective crowd control with gladiator games. Arnold, of course, ends up on one of these shows and turns it all up and down, with little help from his two comrades and pretty amber. <br /> <br /> It's not a big budget movie, but it has still managed to create a pretty good atmosphere of the future, with some nice matte paintings and sets to help. It's hopelessly the 1980s, but I think it's charming. The act is different, Arnold does the usual terrible and gruesome thing with a helper of stone tiles. Heroine Amber is slightly stereotypical and gently named Damen Killian is a typical creator of a bad TV show. Despite all the mistakes, the film shows its message very clearly; television is an opiate of the masses, which is a good way to control people. It also includes some at the time of futuristic digital video editing, allowing bad guys to change faces in video to fool their audience. Today you do not seem to be futuristic, which is a bit alarming. If you've seen Arnold, you know when to look at this. Enjoy.
