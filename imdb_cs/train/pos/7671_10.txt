Dr. Mordrid, what can I say? Jesus Combs did it again! Anton Mordrid has been on Earth for 100 years and is waiting for Kabal, the evil magician, to come to kill him. Mordrid and Kabal co-trained as children, so Mordrid knows all Kabbalah tricks. The film is a bit confused, but you feel a part of the action soon. I will not end, so go and look at Dr. Mordrid! I thought the film was very fun because it does not have too much violence or sex scenes. The film has focused on the story and that's what I like! I find the best movies that seem to fly. It's because you are so interested in the movie. Doctor Mordrid is a fantastically stunning movie! I give her 20 out of 10. It's worth seeing! <br /> <br />
