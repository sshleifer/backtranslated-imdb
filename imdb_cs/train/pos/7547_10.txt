Cat Soup first seems to be a very random animated movie. The best way I could explain it is that it's pretty sour. Though it's not entirely random. The story is about Nyatt, the young cat and sister Nyaak. Nyaako is very sick and dies, but Nyatta sees her soul being taken away by death and able to get her half. The story is about trying to bring Nyaako back to life. Although much of the content in this movie seems entirely random, it's not. Most of them are symbolism for life, death, and rebirth. You can also see links from other stories such as Hansel and Gretal. This strangely cute short film has an interesting story full of deeper meaning than what you see on the surface of the screen.
