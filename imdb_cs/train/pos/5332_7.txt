In the light of bad reviews - or automobile accidents - I feel obsessed with getting into gear and making a transfer to get credit where it is due and to do the service. I'm not sure people have the license to say it's so bad, almost automatically. <br /> <br /> It's rare that the movie has SUSPENS. This film keeps tension, it's full length, despite all the mistakes that can be made. How many movies can it say? Not many big ones. Because of the simple assumption you do not know if people get out of a life-threatening situation that lasts the whole movie. Yeh, the hanging was tight, and despite some wounds, shocks did their job. It's not just a television movie but a versatile movie; there is no point where it stops, deviates or becomes talky. It would be hard to create such a movie, always on the way. Only duel or speed, I remember that. The best of them was the constant tension. <br /> <br /> ACTING is not bad: the judge is as good as ever and the others are. <br /> <br /> SCRIPT is good. But the jury is clear whether sometimes it can - or seem to be - a little bad. What seems unrealistic is not necessarily the case. Your first decisions are not always right, but I think the main actor was right in this movie. <br /> <br /> STUNTS are mostly amazing, especially for TV movie. Their only failure can be noticeable and again apparent slow speed. But we all know how the deceitfully slow Grand Prix cars can look like. I liked the beginning of "inspired by a real story". So you will not go how true it is? You know it is the basis. The usual "based on a true story" makes me think that it should be mostly true. But maybe it's my fault. <br /> <br /> HOW TO SAVE: A good idea for the reviewer to design a towing carriage to lift the rear wheels up. Just a few centimeters would do it. A bit driver can do that at 100 mph. Special that they did not call a car expert - neither an autoelectrician nor a mechanic - to find out if there was a way. I hope that this review has stated that this movie is a disaster. Or at least neutral. And it will help make it an unsuccessful success. <br /> <br /> Quality Pic is a bit soft for DVD. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: They would have been exported to the baby, but strangely this life-saving idea was cleverly solved in a funny interview to get away. I think we know why. End of film. A suspension of mistrust came out of the top window with a child.
