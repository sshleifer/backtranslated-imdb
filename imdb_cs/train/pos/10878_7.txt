I personally liked Cut. It was the first time I saw the teatrically release Australian slasher flick. A genre that is usually limited to mainstream Hollywood movies. With all the usual cookery comedies and dramas from Australia, I enjoyed seeing a home horror film that was not broken. I did not even think it was really a spoof of other movies. It was supernatural theatrical horror like the Nightmare on Elm Street, not Scream, or I know what you did in the summer, and it was more than late. I think it's time for Australian films to get more into mainstream genres. Cut was original, quite horrible and ultimately just a little fun. I'd give him seven out of ten, and he would not consider it serious. He did what I expected to do, entertain and frighten me enough time to satisfy. I enjoyed it.
