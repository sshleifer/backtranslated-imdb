I saw this Australian film about 10 years ago and never forgot it. The film shows the horror of war in a way that Hollywood usually hides. The relationship between the soldiers of the two warring countries is highlighted by the differences in culture and the ultimate realization that, in the end, we are not actually really different from the inside. If you can find any kind of copy - buy or rent. You will not be disappointed, you were just afraid.
