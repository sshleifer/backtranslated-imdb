I'm not usually a fan of tightly romantic movies, but I hear it's good. I was amazed. The easiest, most romantic thing I've ever seen in my life. Stunning. Brilliant, sweet, funny and full of heart. Chemistry is flawless, just like writing and directing. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are so natural and sweet together that you really think they are a couple. <br /> <br /> Movies will instantly grab you and will not let you. You can not turn away or you can stop listening. Even those small moments will melt your heart. <br /> <br /> I jumped into one of my favorites. Masterpiece.
