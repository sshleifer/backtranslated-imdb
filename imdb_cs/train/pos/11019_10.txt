Cliffhanger seems to be Slyvester Stallone's last action movie before he became such an underestimated actor. This is a mountaineer who has to help his friends after being held hostage by mercenaries who want to find three suitcases with over 100 million dollars of money. It has a great action sequence, the edge of fun and great time on movies.
