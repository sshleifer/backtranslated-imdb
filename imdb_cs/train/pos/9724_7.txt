I love Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. I think she's such an actress who could not do better in front of the camera, but it's herself. She did it, and she looked so naturally in Elizabethtown. In this film, however, she tried to add more artistic performance, especially in the first half of the movie, so she looked more like a sober editor. While in the second half she was completely back in her daily routine, and I simply could not say she would be in some way a editor. That's why its performance is not in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film is as attractive and inspiring as a whole. the character of the young is full and reasonable. In any case, the film tells a big and sophisticated story. <br /> <br /> The only big flaw is that it does not show the hero's momentary momentum and the hero's love story. I'm totally confused when she kisses at the end of the story because it's unclear to these two people.
