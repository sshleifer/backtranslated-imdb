Sleepwalkers are creatures that lead the life force completely out of people to survive ... but they can only use virgins (that's not explained why). Charles Brady (Brian Krause) is one who needs to feed his mother Mary (Alice Krige). He goes after the sympathetic Tanya (Madchen Amick). Will he escape? <br /> <br /> On one side it's a great horror movie. Fast-paced, lots of blood and gore and a nice, twisted sense of humor. There are lots of joke references for horror fans (Castle Rock is mentioned once). Krause is also excellent (who would think he could act after returning to the Blue Lagoon), as well as Kirge and Amick. However, I find this film unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Stephen King wrote it and it's madly unclear. Sleepwalkers are never completely explained. Where are they from? Why are they told? Why does a son have to feed his mother? Why do cats hate and kill them? What are their powers (does Krause make the car disappear and change color and style!)? Why do they need to feed the lives of people? Why should she be just virgins? Why does a son have sex with his mother? None of them is explained, so the story is confusing. It's really bad because these questions are aside, it's an excellent horror movie. Excellent make-up and special effects too. <br /> <br /> Fast, bloody and lots of fun. If the scenario was better. Also, the relatively explicit sexual scene between Kraus and Krige was modified (you can say) to get the rating R. I can only give 7.
