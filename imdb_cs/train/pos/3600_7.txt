At first glance, I expected this movie to be dirty because I thought it would be too feminist. But I was wrong. As you may have read in earlier published comments, I agree that the feminist part of this film does not bother. I never had the idea that the main character exaggerated her position as a woman. It's like Guzman is presented as someone with a backbone, in contrast to his classmates. So I was surprised by the story, in fact I thought it was pretty good, except for the predictable ending. Perhaps it would be better to imagine a radical plot, so the viewer is somewhat more surprised. I would also like to say that Rodriguez has earned her respect for the way she put down her character. I can not really explain why, but especially in those love scenes that convinced me. It just looked really good, I think. I gave her 7 out of 10, just because of the boring last half hour.
