Action. Comedy. Tension. This movie has it all. <br /> <br /> The site is such that 4 professional thieves are being asked to take part in a robbery in a small town in Montana. Every type of creative character of crime is here. Frank, the main mind. Carlos, a gun expert. Max, an expert on explosives. Nick, safe cracking and Ray, car. Unfortunately, due to Frank, he is captured by two annoying detectives, which Ed O'Niel and Daniel Roebuck portrayed very well, who chased him from New Jersey when he sent letters to the other four. <br /> <br /> Our four characters meet the train station and from the beginning none of them likes or trusts each other. Added to the mix is ​​the fact that Frank is gone and they are not sure why they gathered together. Frank is now taken to New Jersey by two detectives, but soon escapes on foot and tries to come back to people who have all their own problems. <br /> <br /> Really great movie full of laughter and great acting. Just a good good movie for anyone looking for laughter or something else
