I first saw this movie when I was the youngest in high school and the movie got stuck this year. It is not about soundtrack or cinema, dialogue and somewhat bad behavior, it is an educational purpose and the message is the most important. It's not a sin to have a child when you're a teenager and still in high school, and it's not really a bad thing, but it's a problem. The tones of a girl I knew now have all the kids, and I think they never looked at this great movie and if they did, they did not get it. It's about not having the chance to have a sexual relationship. Every girl can get pregnant for the first time. It's not a myth. You do not necessarily lose your dreams, but in the future you have to take the back seat because you have a child at first glance. <br /> <br /> This movie has a clear message: DO NOT Say No!
