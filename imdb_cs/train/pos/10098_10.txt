The Dominion Tank Police is without any doubt, one of the most amazing performances ever produced, not only in the field of animation. While the first part (Acts 1 and 2) mostly consists of action and entertainment, the second part is more serious and the second part should not be treated in the same way as the first. Fine shades are really out of this world and the characterization is out of brilliant. You have to have another degree of intelligence to appreciate the complexity of the second part (Acts 3 and 4). But I have some complaints. In the first part of the tank, Tank Bonaparte literally jumps over the tank with no tank at all. One could also question the likelihood of Bonaparte jumping on the wing of the Helicopter Gunship, even if it was okay. Rules of Buak.
