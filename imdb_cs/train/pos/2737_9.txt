The film has grasped from start to finish and its black and white photography of the American heart is amazing. We feel that we are right with them as they pass through the great sky and then into Mexico and back to America again. Close to the end of the film, the reflection of Blake Blake's wound looks like small sweat streams and tears spinning on his face. Finally, we will follow them up the stairs to the last moment. The two criminals who introduced Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, like Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, could be seen on every street in every city. Hickock is a smiling boy beside him and Smith, the man staring in the wrong side of the city. This point is in the movie and it always surprises us that the criminals will not change in appearance than anyone else. Evil, even the most terrible, is part of the human condition. These two devious men kill the whole family and look for a safe one that is not there. As soon as you are on the run, you start writing bad checks, plotting the trail for the authorities. There are many great actors. I like John Forsyth as a detective on the Alvin Dewey case. Will Geer will also experience a short but excellent scene as a prosecutor. I often wanted to see the whole movie only when I caught it in short hijackings; Finally, I did it after buying a DVD. The result is the most beautiful classic crime movie I've ever seen. Do not miss this great movie. It's a great movie for me.
