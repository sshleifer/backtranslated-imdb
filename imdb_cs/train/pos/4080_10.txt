This is one of the best animated family movies of all time. In addition, practically all serious opponents of this title came from the same creative mind of Hiyao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli. Specifically, other great movies include "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Kikki's Delivery Service". Spirited Away is quite good, but a bit scary for typical family fares - better for teens and teens. The only thing that sets "Laputa: Castle in Heaven", among other Miyazaki movies, is that it is much more exciting adventure rides. Why is this movie so good? Because it's a complete package: the animation is very good and the story is really engaging and convincing. Most Japanese anime is imaginative but definitely dark, cynical or violent; and the animation itself is often jerky, stylized and juvenile. None of these problems will damage the Castle in the sky. My imagination is burning and the characters are well-drawn when they are somewhat exaggerated versions of realistic people. (None of those layers wearing the dress) is a lot of adventure, but not blood and gore. Animation is a smooth, detailed and film ally - lots of flat shots. The backgrounds are beautiful. <br /> <br /> The voice that plays in dubbed English is the most important, especially the two leaders, Pazo (James Van der Beek) and Sheeta (Anna Paquin). Sound engineering is also great. Use your studio sound if you have it. One of the aspects I enjoyed most is that much of the back story remains inexplicable. Laputa was once inhabited and is now abandoned. Why? We never know. We know as much as we need to know, and then we have to take the rest, which is easy, because the invention world is so fully realized. It is true that it is likely that the world is fully aware of most of the smaller characters, which are mostly one-dimensional characters of the stock (eg, Gross General, Stupid Brother, Knitting Old Miner, etc.). for people between the ages of 6 and 60!
