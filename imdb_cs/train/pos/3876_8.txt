Beautiful Danish actress Sonja Richter has stolen this film under everyone's nose without a little kidnapping in view of the amazing performances that surround her. <br /> <br /> Richter plays Annu, an inexperienced, independent, somewhat neurotic (and perhaps suicidal) actress who comes out of a desperate job that takes care of a slave slave father called Walentin (great Danish actor Frits Helmuth who died in 77 shortly after filming this film). Walentin refuses to answer anyone-until he becomes confronted with gifted Anna, whose moody and dirty way brings the poor old devoted devil back from the death penalty imposed on herself. /> <br /> The writer / director / actor Eric Clausen made a powerful film about the difficulty that a heavy business son (Jorgen, played by Clausen) loves a father who never accepted him. The film is down, but Clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia, the nature and value of love and care, and how a man, an unconfirmed Anna, can change the course of human life. Highly recommended. Sonja Richter's performance stands alone for the entrance fee.
