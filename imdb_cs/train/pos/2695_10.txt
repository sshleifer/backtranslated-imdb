What keeps us - or at least what I feel the writer wanted us to stick to at first, is our desire to know if Martinaud has done a dirty act. Without being spoiled so much, of course, there are red herring and twisting. But then we find out that this is the story of Martinaud's imperfections and his difficulty in settling. When it's a revelation - we begin to sympathize and sympathize with it, because when the story goes, we think about it being a bad, perverse pedophile that we have in mind to keep in mind. One of the things he has to deal with is the distant space that he and his wife have, even though they live on the same roof. These problems, of course, given their discovery in the movie is a shocking finale. This movie requires your patience and it definitely tried those restless teenagers sitting in the back. Apparently they were angry because they are not part of the "central locations" films. Though there is a little traveling there when we get into the woods and the beach. And we realize that Gallien is not as clever as we thought he was. <br /> <br /> Inquisitor is 5/5
