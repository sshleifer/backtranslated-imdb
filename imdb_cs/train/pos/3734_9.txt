The dehumanizing effect of war is a much-studied subject in films; as it is the dehumanizing yet potentially life-saving, dehumanizing effect of military training. "Tigerland" Joel Schumacher follows a standard template, we see men who are considered dirty, but act as soldiers with some degree of mutual respect to their commanding officers, and it is decided whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; how to evaluate the merits of the war for which they are trained (typically as here, Vietnam). But "Tigerland" is interesting to focus his account on a small dissident named Bozz (played in an excellent way by Colin Farrell), who understands that all power ultimately follows the consensus and lack of awareness among helpless helpers. Around this character, a learned, grasping plot was built, and it is also a plus that the action never leaves America (while Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket" to name just one other of a similar type of film moved to Asia). Though it's not a film of stunning originality, it's a great done and captivating tracking in the whole: the best film of this director I've seen and among the best of my genre.
