In 2151 in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, a farmer shoots Klingon Klaang with his plasma rifle after a methane explosion in his farm, and the Klingon is sent to the Starfleet Hospital. Vulcan Ambassador Soval proposes to disconnect the system of life support and to bring honor to the Klaang corpse into his war empire on the planet Kronos. Captain Jonathan Archer, however, proposes to go with Enterprise on her first trip and return Klaang alive to his home planet. Jonathan invites Ensign Hoshi Sato and Dr. Phlox, who cures Klaang to finish his crew, and Vulcan Assistant Commander T'Pol is assigned to take part in the dangerous first mission of Enterprise. When the star ship is turned off, Clown is kidnapped by Suliban after firing at the hospital. After the autopsy of Suliban killed in the shooting, Captain Archer was informed by Dr. Phlox, that the alien was in fact a mutant, altered in a sophisticated process of genetic engineering. T'Pol modifies Suliban Space Sensor Enterprise Sensors until it reaches the planet Riger X. It examines and publishes that Klaang was a courier, bringing an important report on the Temporary Cold War from Suliban Sarin to the Klingons leaders at Kronos. Despite the huge Star Trek fans, I did not hear the episode "Enterprise" on cable TV. I decided to buy a DVD box from the first season and this first episode surprised me. The adventures of the first venture, Captain Jonathan Archer, the magnificent T'Pol, Reed, Mayweather, Phlox, Hoshi and Trip are excellent, at least in this pilot. In IMDb, I noticed that this episode is in fact divided into two parts, but there are only one DVD on the DVD, so my review is valid for both. I did not like the music theme that I found very uncomfortable, but this was the exception in this great show. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Broken Bow"
