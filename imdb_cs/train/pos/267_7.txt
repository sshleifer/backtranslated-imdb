Everything starts with a series of thefts of seemingly unrelated objects in the Hickory Road student hostel in London. Concerned about her sister who is a housekeeper, Miss Lemon asks Hercule Poirot to look at this matter. He agrees but soon strikes will increase when a girl who admits that she is responsible for most (not all) theft is found murdered. "Hickory Dickory Dock" is a solid exercise in the brain without it as a mumble complexity like "One, Two, Buckle My Shoe". The murders, theft and smuggling of diamonds are the crimes they are participating in, and the final surgery that combines everything together is only revealed in the last 2 minutes! Characters are interesting, especially the student of psychology Colin McNabb and the mysterious American girl Sally Finch, inspector Japp has her funny moments (perhaps in the near future this series came to "toilet humor") and Miss Lemon becomes an integral part of the story than usual.
