Writer-director Brian De Palma is best known for his series of films that have been termed somewhat unfairly "Hitchcock imitations". Unlike the general faith of De Palma, Hitchcock will not break; he borrows the story or character elements that can be seen in the film Hitchcock and then spreads to them in a more violent, modern way. Like Hitchcock, De Palma is known for mixing blood-soaked death with horrifying humor. The "Killed Cloth," which was back in 1980, is perhaps the most well-known Hitchcock's De Palmy, and is probably his best. The story includes an occasional serial killer who follows a burned housewife (played by Angie Dickinson) and a street-wise hooker (played by Nancy Allen). Yes, it reminds you clearly of "Psycho," but De Palma is as technically brilliant and darkly creative. The museum sequence is particularly well-rated and edited; the shot shot scene is also one of the most unique shots ever shot on the film. "Dressed to Kill" may not be a complete original, but I think it is definitely worth it. Named R. for 105 minutes. 9 out of 10.
