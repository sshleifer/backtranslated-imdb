David Beckham is a British football star and husband Victoria Beckham ("Posh Spice" Spice Girls). His trademark is a shooter who heads across the pitch and into the net. The soccer equivalent of a fixed baseball ball. "Bend it like Beckham" means doing this kind of spectacular shot. In addition, and a small sanctuary to him in the master bedroom and faux-cameo at the very end, the film has nothing to do with it. The film is full of little football in-jokes such as the presence of one of her parents giving her a 9th jersey on it (the feature of the great Mia Hamm, for those who know it), links to "Posh 'n' Becks "A video homage to WUSA one of the characters plays for an unbelieving boyfriend (" they have * that? "), lesbian gag, sport-gag bras, and so on. The story is about a teenage girl in England who prays Beckham and wants to be a soccer star. He has a real gift, but two seemingly insurmountable obstacles to overcome, are the absence of a British professional league league (hence their fascination with our WUSA) and her parents who are Indian immigrants set in a very old-fashioned style that does not allow daughters, into contact sports. The family of the girl is portrayed as characters of ironic entertainment, but with great affection - you think my big fat Greek wedding. The girl loves them and respects them enough to go through hell with comedies to hide their growing soccer stars.
