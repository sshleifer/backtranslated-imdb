First of all, I would like to say that I am a huge fan of Sarah Silverman and that other people say this is behind me. Everything in the pilot was in the typical form of Sarah Silverman, perhaps not funny, but the situation and delivery are what counts. If you liked Jesus is magical, then I do not see it like that. It has the same current and the same rhythm. True, it's just for true fans, but if you are, you will be pleased. <br /> <br /> Again, it's only true for real fans that there's nothing left around. If you are not used to her style then you would not know why it's funny. But it is, and I hope you think so too.
