This is definitely one of Jeta's best efforts. Few actors are able to play stoics like Jet Li. The action is fast fire and special effects supported for intensity purposes. As a result, Americans may lose some attention. A small suspension of unbelief continues in a long way in Jet Li. I feel that this is a great introduction to Jet's work and we look forward to other masterpieces (especially the Fist of Legend) that will get to the American market. A nice mixture of quarrel and physical conflict will satisfy most event enthusiasts.
