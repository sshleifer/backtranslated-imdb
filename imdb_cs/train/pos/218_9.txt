Taking over the role they played on Broadway Jack Albertson and Sam Levene, Walter Matthau and George Burns are playing some old comedies in vaudeville, a team in the tradition of Joe Smith and Charles Dale, who have a seemingly different view of life. /> <br /> Walter Matthau can not stop working, one never learned to relax, take some time and feel the roses. He is a tiny old boy whose best days are behind him, and his nephew and agent Richard Benjamin is less and less for him. What badly hurt him was that George Burns, 15 years ago, decided to retire and spend some time with his family. A worker like Matthau can not understand it, and Burns's decision will be taken personally. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Benjamin hits a brain storm, links boys and does it on special national television. What's going on here is pretty funny. Sunshine Boys is also a sad, hot-blooded story about old age. Matthau is on screen for most of the movie, but it's Burns, who got a shit like an Oscar at the age of 79. Burns brought a little personal to this movie as well. As we all know, he was a direct man of the great Burns & Allen comedy team who borrowed a lot from Monty Python's troops. In 1958 for health reasons Gracie Allen retired and George continued until he was 100 years old. At least as a very active artist. <br /> <br /> Sunshine Boys is based on the Smith & Dale team and if you like The Sunshine Boys, I strongly recommend that you see two Broadway tickets and look at some guys who have entertained the American public at the turn of last century . The physician draws out that Matthau and Burns are doing right out of their material. And I think you like The Sunshine Boys.
