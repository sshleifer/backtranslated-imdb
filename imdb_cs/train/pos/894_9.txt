This, "Prodigal Son" and "Eastern Condors" are my favorite films Sammo Hung. Fat Dragon is fatter on this trip than he was in "Condors," but he's not as sure as a director or actor. In fact, he is at the top of his mold and brings a devastating, brutal shareholder who boasts a half dozen amazing sequences and can also say a compassionate, sweet love story. Love and romance are not the director's main priorities, but they serve as extra additions to action and ensure that viewers do not reach the buttons of rapid movement between physical clashes. <br /> <br /> The opening scene, which contains a humorous template duel, creates a solid but fraudulent tone. The sequence in which the Sammo pedicab is pursued by car is beautifully presented and celebrated with a sharp comic tone. The rapid and furious fight between Sammo and Lau Kar Leung is a model of dazzling choreography and a sharp, gorgeous direction, and easily one of the finest species of its kind. The film slowly escalates by violence, and finally, when there is a climate conflict, we are exposed to some of the most brutal riots ever seen in Sammo's production. The attack of the director / actor on Billy Chow and the house filled with angry, threatening opponents is a stingy, physically disgraceful delight. Amazing at every level and one of the best martial arts films he ever did. <br /> <br /> Great scores, too.
