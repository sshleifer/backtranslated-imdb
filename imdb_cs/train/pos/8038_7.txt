Two snipers travel deep in the jungles in search of their goals; slim South American drug king and prominent general. Slightly successful in building the atmosphere, Sniper is, according to most accounts, a very solid thriller, taking the time to base its characters and their misfortune and culmination in some good action sequences. Director Llosa is not always successful in keeping a dark mood and could tighten the story a bit; some businesses do not add much power here. But this film is much better than its Stallone / Stone The Traveler The Specialist. Billy Zane, usually incredibly tedious, surprisingly well, as the inexperienced Sniper teamed with veteran Berenger. As for Berenger, this film proved to be his last good big budget in Hollywood. He can do such a role in his sleep and it is very convincing here to repeat the role twice as much in direct sequel to DVD sequels.
