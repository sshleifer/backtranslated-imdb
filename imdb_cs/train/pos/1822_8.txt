An unforgettable masterpiece by the creator of the Mystery of Nimh and the Earth before time, it was a very moving warm-lipped cartoon. I remember it very well from childhood, it was funny, sad and very beautiful. Well, it starts a little dark, a dog that escapes the pound and is killed by an old friend, ends up in the sky and returns. But it's sweet when it comes together with an orphaned girl who can talk to animals. Some scenes were a bit scary in contrast to other cartoons like the dream of Charlie's succession, but everything else was fine and the songs were fair. The unforgettable role of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, I love the guy, ahhehehe. And Judith Barsi from the jaws of Revenge, God can resist his soul, a poor girl, not deserve to die, but now he is in heaven, all good people go to heaven. Overall, this is a very good animated movie, Don Bluth classic enough to make anime and Disney to shame. Recommended for the whole family. And you know if you have the original video about this, we find the film, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message, I have to love that guy, ahehehe.
