A group of friends decides to take camping in the desert - and finds they are buried and murdered by a mysterious murderer in a black pick-up truck. "Mirage" is of course inspired by Spielberg "Duel" and Craven's "The Hills Have Eyes" But this slasher yarn offers a lot of ugly violence and gore. The film is a cruel peak is a sequence involving a man's hand and foot connected around the tree and then having his limbs dismembered when the chain is pulled by the truck. There is also some tension and some exciting stalk-and-slash sequences. The acting is nice and the script is fairly but the film is fast and shocking.BGSteers who play the villain are quite threatening.The desert places provide a certain atmosphere and the gore is quite strong. Overall, if you love low-budget horror movies, make this look8 out of 10.
