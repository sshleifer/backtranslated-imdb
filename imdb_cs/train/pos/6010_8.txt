"Zabriskie Point" (1970): Was that especially interesting to me on a personal level, because it takes place under the same circumstances, with the same peers, in my own life? the Counter Culture movement from the late 1960s / early 1970s, on and off the premises. We follow two unrelated young people in separate stories who are slowly weaving together. One is a young man in Los Angeles, tired of all the infinite, pseudorevolonic jabbery in the classrooms and dining rooms of his campus, and the other young woman who leads to Phoenix to meet father and employer, "foundation." The film is full of visual notations by our Italian director (Michelangelo Antonioni) and the confused psychedelicrage of this era is self-righteous, "we know it all, we change everything for better" youth. Who is "revolutionary"? What does it really mean? Do you dress like one and march with chanting? Do you have to "fly under radar", but inform your arrival in advance? Do you keep your plans for yourself and make changes without having to approve the group? "Zabriskie Point" is definitely a "period" - full of slang, uniforms, some unreal film moments (after all, it's a movie from a man who gave us the amazing "Blow Up" of 1966) and the artefacts of the era, but it's more. It is an opportunity for a cultural revolution and Antonioni (who seems to support him), the youth is too busy to see what is needed for a radical success. For this reason, it becomes a powerful, frightening film that applies to everyone, anytime, anywhere.
