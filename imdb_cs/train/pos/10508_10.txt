Mario is invited to Princess Peach's Chateau. When Mario gets there, he finds out that Bowser has kidnapped her! Mario must rescue the day again. Unlike 2-D games, Mario can explore everything he wants. He can only wander, climb trees, try to find 1-Ups, find secrets in levels, and more. You can spend four hours in one level. No time limit. There are 16 worlds with a series of stages and there are stellar gates where you need a certain number of stars. Once you get into these star doors, you have to go through the stage and fight against Bowser at the end of the stage. To get to certain worlds, you need several stars to get in. You enter the world by going through the picture. There's so much work and so many hours of playing, I do not see how anyone could love this game. That's great. This starting title is a game that insured the player that the N64 will have a good life. Every 3D platform we know has something to do with SM64. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are examples that are commonly used. Super Mario 64 is one of the biggest games in the history of 3D games. 10 out of 10. If you have N64, buy this game. It's hard to find used because no one sells this baby for $ 5 in a pawnshop. Perfect 10.
