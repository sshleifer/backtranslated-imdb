Jokes are obvious, gags are furious and the characters are walking - but I could not stop laughing in my very funny movie. It does not matter how many times I've seen it, I still get kicked and I recommend it highly for all lovers of gratuitous fun. It contains many sensitive moments and some of the best views I have seen today. If you've had a bad week and need a taste, ask him to travel home on Friday night to make your weekend a good start.
