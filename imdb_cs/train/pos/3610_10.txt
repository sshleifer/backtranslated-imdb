Girlfight is a story about a rogue, named Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). Diana is burdened by her mother's suicide and sexist father living in the sexist community. The short nature and lots of things that ignite the fire are about to get out of school out of the fight. Her brother, Tiny (Ray Santiago), coaches with Hector (Jaime Tirelli) in boxing. Diana tells her her father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), to deliver this weekly payment for Tina's training. While Diana walks around the gym, she realizes that what she wants to do. He wants a box. Diana asks her father for money to practice, but she refuses because she is a girl and should do more "girl" stuff. All Diana wants to be treated like another guy. He did not look down because he was a woman. She stole money from her father to start training. <br /> <br /> A great movie. Genius, pure "effing" genius. Recommend to anyone who needs to see a good clean movie without "monkey activity".
