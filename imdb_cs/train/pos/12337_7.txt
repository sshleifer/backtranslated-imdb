Poor Ivy: Although born, she was unlucky to get married with a glamorous turn (Richard Ney). Since the film is set in the 1920s and 1930s, when the rigid Victorian thoughts of the class begin to turn its edges, this uncertain situation is unduly disturbing. The Gretoreks (because they are called) do not know where their next shilling comes from, but the yachting party and the magical dress are in the love of love that attracts her. When Ivy (Joan Fontaine) meets the rich old master (Herbert Marshall, who had to be born in middle age), he sets up for him one of his extravagant chapeaux. Fortunately, one of the beaux who is still running (Patric Knowles) is a doctor whose counseling room provides a cache of poison he likes to say goodbye to. The fact that it means that Knowles does not even fit her, even as the clocks run, until it can be hung on his neck until he's dead. Turning the plot depends on police inspector Sir Cedric Hardwicke; Mother Knowles (Lucile Watson); and faithful housekeeper Knowles (Una O'Connor). Sam Wood adds some gentle touches to this very above-average melodrama; The bright face of Fontaine delivers the rest.
