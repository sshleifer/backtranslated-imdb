I first saw this movie in the theater when I was 8 years old and still cracked me. Muppets are so cool and approach the show business in a refreshing naive way. My favorite scene is when rats start whispering a campaign called Kermit in a fantastic restaurant. It's one intelligent and funny movie for both children and parents. Long live Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang.
