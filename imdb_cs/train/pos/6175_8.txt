I saw this pilot when it was first shown, and I'm sure the countless fans of the "Spirit" hate it because like Batman, Green Hornet, etc. It took the character in the direction of the "camp". But apparently I did not get Batman because I thought it was fun as well as this show. There are two parts that remain with me. First, when Dennyin's partner was mortally wounded, he spoke a dramatic speech about how he always held the law and listened to the exact letter. Then he says something like, "Boy, I was stupid!" Which is his way of calling Denny to become watchful instead of what he does (though the TV Batman kind). Then there is a scene where she tries to conceal the villa to let her kiss her, but she is not deceived because she is too honest to kiss her convincingly! This was a great example of a "camp", which was also "underestimated" by both the actor and the actress.
