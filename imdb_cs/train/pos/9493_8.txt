White Fire is so much interested. Larry Bird looks similar to Robert Ginty, who led the accusations that he feared with his beautiful hair and super macho mustache, the film surfaced over other low-budget shareholders. The charisma that has it, Tom Selleck looks like a putz. With the Ginty hitting everyone, the film just rises in amazement when the diamond intrigue story enters the game. Then add to Fred Williamson, some frontal bush, motor saw attacks, and some amazing motives of incest ... this impact ends in all the cylinders. If you're looking for some amazing B-Action, it's where it is. Now that I can get my hands on the soundtrack.
