I did not feel that this movie was as clever as it seemed to think it was, but still enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> It's original, although it reminds me of a bit of the other two French films, Vidocq and The City of Lost Children, mostly for coloring, but also for the sharp state close to the characters. /> <br /> Set in a prison cell, but do not let it go, this movie seems much more than many multiplayer burglars. <br /> <br /> Always interesting, with persistent "Black Arts" well in the foreground and a very good characterization to make some just too plausible! <br /> <br /> Scary with some gore is worth seeing.
