Kirk and the crew land on a lonely planet where the sun will explode. They intend to evacuate the inhabitants, but to find a place deserted, except Mr. Atoz, who runs a high-tech library. Despite the fact that Atoz is trying to get a direct answer to where they are, their questions are indifferent and he insists he has to make a quick choice while there is still time. They have no idea what he is talking about, but he wants to look at hand-held mirrors for viewers and sees images of the planet's past. Then, while the disc is in the viewer, Kirk walks through the door and is magically transported back in time to what the Earth will look like the time of Louis XIV (1960s). When McCoy and Spock are watching, there is a different disk in the viewer and they are sent to Hell's time. They realize lately that the library is a machine for time and storage. While Kirk's visit is rather short and not all exciting, Spock and McCoy are much more fulfilled, as Spock falls to his feet for Mariette Hartley - who was sent to this terrible place like a punishment. Spock scenes are exceptionally interesting and very atypical for a normal logical boy. Spock's departure from normal, wild imaginative scenarios and very diverse sites make this exceptional episode - one worth seeing. <br /> <br /> FYI - Ian Wolfe, a great actor, played Mr. Atoz. I am a huge fan of older films and I saw him as a supporter and small player in countless movies in the 1930s and 1940s and looked almost exactly like in this 1969 episode. Interestingly, though he looked ancient, he lived another 23 years - she died aged over 95 !!
