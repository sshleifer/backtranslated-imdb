There were not many films about aspects of the plane, but it's one of them and it's damn good. Just a fun movie you can watch. Most of the film takes place in Navy Lakefront operations (NAS Tustin plays a role). Wallace Beery plays sympathetic, but Munchausen's senior Chief Ned Trumpet, the pilot with whom they appear, and his great stories are so frequent that no one really believes in him. Half of the entertainment is near the end of the movie when events begin to show that most of its more bizarre stories are true. <br /> <br /> Set during World War II, the main fence rests around bachelor's Trumpet wooing a local widow only ultimately having a father and son relationship with a widow's crippled son Jess. He said he would never go without a doctor's crutches, the main trumpet pulls some strings, and a nurse surgeon from Navy helps restore the boy's crippled feet. Jess continues to enter the Navy to become a flight officer by flying back to Lakehurst and facing a whole new challenge. A very well-done film, though not without a sloppy Hollywood dialogue sliding around technical consultants, and the apparent inability of Beery to march in step. Otherwise, this film gets good marks for technical accuracy and gives a rare look at Navy LTA operations. The Cash Cash Scene, the exchange between Trumpet and Jessa Cathy's daring love is an absolute horn.
