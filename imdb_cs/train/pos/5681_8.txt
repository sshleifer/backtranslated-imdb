I did not have a problem with the movie that I thought was pretty good. It's a real LAPD crime video that worried me. I wonder if Lion's Gate really believes that a general audience would want to see people who were brutally killed to death and blood everywhere. We apologize for the Lion Gate, this was a UNIQUE FUN! When returning to the film: The cast was excellent, especially Val Kilmer as late John Holmes. John Holmes was dirty, ill-treated with women in his life (Lisa Kudrow as his wife, Kate Bosworth as his girlfriend) and is hopelessly deep into drugs. His association with Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian) creates a spiral that has resulted in the infamous murder of Wonderland. Exactly how much was Holmes involved in murder? Maybe we never know the whole truth of the story (Nash is still alive and a free man), but the movie is pretty good work though.
