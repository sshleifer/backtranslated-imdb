My discovery of cinema Jan Svankmajer opened my eyes to the whole tradition of Czech animation, which Jir√≠ Trnka was a pioneer. His hand is one of the best, most technically impressive animated films I've ever seen. The potter wakes up and fills his plants. Then it's about pots. But there comes a huge hand that crashes the pots and requires the potter to create the statue itself. He shakes his hand, but soon he returns and traps him in a bird cage where he is forced to form a stone hand. He comes out of it, fails from exhaustion, but eventually he completes the task. In the amazing sequence of the metacinus, the potter uses a candle to burn his visible puppet strings that keep him in thrall, and he escapes home. It closes and is accidentally killed by his own beloved plant when he falls on his head. This film does not conceal the fact that it is a pure animation, unlike modern films that try to be realistic (why?). The hand, for example, is obviously someone's hand in the glove. Everything else is clay. The strings are visible and are part of the narrative, which is the forerunner of Strings. The atmosphere is frightening: the hand that happens after the little potter managed to make me more fearful than a lot of horror films. <br /> <br /> The film is obvious, but it avoids complete manipulation of its simplicity. it is a poem about artistic freedom and tyranny that can not help win the heart and mind of anyone who has freedom as a natural right.
