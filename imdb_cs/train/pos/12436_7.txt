I've been reading Blaise's modesty for years, collecting tape numbers. After the fiasco film, which was based on the first book "Modesta Blaise" many years ago, I was surprised that the result got it well. <br /> <br /> What I got was a movie that was not based on action or violence. The director focuses on history and psychology. How humility was created on the basis of her own story and what part of her life influenced her Sunday. I think this effort will give a better understanding of the next (hopefully) film. I just loved movies in an old-fashioned style. However, everything was not so good, the gamble was not that good. almost boring and unreal. Also, acting could improve. I think the bad guy in this movie felt real, the only reason she was there was that Modesta might have someone telling her the story. They could also expand the film and show more about when it built a "network", but I guess it for another movie. And forgive me, please, for my bad English
