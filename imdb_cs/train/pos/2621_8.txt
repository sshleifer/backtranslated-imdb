Disney did it again. The brilliant way Timon and Pumbaa are brought back to life to tell us how they came and helped Simba when he needed them. I love this movie and I look again and again. This shows how Timone lived with his family and other meerkats before he started looking for his dream and adventure. Then he will meet Pumbaa and things will change. Together they look for a home that Timon wants and repeatedly fails, which is fun because Timone is getting more mad. Then Simba appears and we see more of his childhood than in the previous two films. The rest, you already know.
