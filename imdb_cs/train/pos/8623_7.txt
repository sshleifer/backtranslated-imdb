DER TODESKING is not one of my most popular films by Jorg Buttgereit - but it is an interesting suicide film and its causes and consequences. Those looking for gore-fest or NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM-style exploits will likely be disappointed. DER TODESKING is definitely an art-house movie, so those who need a linear, explanatory narrative do not have to pay ... The basic concept of DER TODESKING is that there is an "episode" for every day of the week that revolves around a strange chain letter , which apparently causes people to commit suicide, scattered by the scenes of a slowly falling corpse ... There are some very well-done and thought-provoking scenes, including a man who talked about "problems" with his wife and a concert massacre (which unfortunately lost to me part of "power," because I was too busy laughing on SCORPIONS look-alike on the stage ...). But seriously - it's sometimes beautiful (the scene that shows the different angles of this huge bridge is especially effective - especially when you understand the meaning of the scene and that the names are people who actually committed suicide from the bridge jump ...), sometimes confusing, sometimes stupid (it's really fun), sometimes horrifying (I discovered the scene of a guy who talked to a girl in the park about his wife especially effective) a movie that is more of an "experience" then fun, because many of these "artistic "the movies are supposed to be. Still, I did not find DER TODESKING to be as strong as NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM, and it would probably be considered relatively balanced with NKROMANTIK 2 as far as my personal "joyful level" is concerned. It is definitely worth seeing a fan of Buttgereit or an "artistic" movie. If you are copying this type of movie - look at SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY - in my opinion, the BEST art-house / horror movie I've seen. 7/10 for DER TODESKING
