What a fun b-movie! Shepis is absolutely beautiful and the Scarecrow is distinct and original. In fact, he brought me back to the 80s monsters. The budget is probably low and not all are Pacino behind the lens, but it does not matter because it's never taken seriously. From tram waste that crashed into the moving movements of spooky martial arts, it's really a b-movie gem. Grab snacks, snacks and a few friends and dump and relax. I enjoyed this movie so much that I bought all three of the Scarecrow movies. Sure, they are not for everyone but for everyone. Sometimes you just need to set your mind cap down and smile.
