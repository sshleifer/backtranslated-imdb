It's the moment I watched this movie and the series, but now it refreshes my memory! It was a very fun movie based on the classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were gay together. Bo and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse to lead General Moonshine. When Boss Hogg develops soldiers from their farm, Bo and Luke intertwine around the local Hoggo building and find coal samples. Soon they realize that Boss Hogg is about to get rid of Hazzard County if the Duke does not stop him with the help of their beautiful cousin Daisy. My only two problems with the film were that Burt Reynolds was not right for part of Boss Hogg and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane was too serious. In addition, I recommend DUKES HAZZARD !!!
