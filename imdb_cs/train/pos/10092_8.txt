Scintillation Elizabeth Taylor plays in this lesser-known class as a young London girl who falls in love with the tea owner from British Ceylon (today's Sri Lanka). Upon arrival, she immediately feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture, as well as a constant awareness of the herd of angry elephants. William Dieterle, who also directed the Life of Emile Zola and Jennie Portrait, performs the masterpiece of bringing this romance into a somewhat dark and almost mysterious hobby, and setting is one of the most beautiful that I have seen with a black and white themed manor and a beautiful island scenery.
