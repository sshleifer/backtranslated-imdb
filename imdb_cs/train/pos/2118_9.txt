The KORUNA SHOE is one of the sweetest and most sensitive romantic comedies ever made. It just does not work, and it's hard to really feel the feel of this movie. It's not one of those films that tries too hard, nor does it even think of the rarest possible scenarios to get together two protagonists. In fact, everything is inherent in its spell, contained in characters and settings and conspiracy ... which is very plausible to boot. It is easy to think that such a love story, just as beautiful as any other that you once said, * may become ... a feeling that you often do not get away from other romantic comedies, be they sweet and hearty. Alfred Kralik (James Stewart) and Clara Novak (Margaret Sullavan) do not have the most favorable first date when they arrive at the store (Matuschek & Co.), who has been working for the past nine years, asking for a job. They are confronting themselves from the very beginning, mostly through a cigarette box that plays music when it's open - thinks it's a ridiculous idea; she makes one big sell it and gets hired. Their harassment is going through the next six months, though both (unknowingly, of course!) They fall in love with each other when they share their souls and souls with letters passing through PO Box 237. It would be a fairly thin plot based the entire movie, except that THE TRADE OKOLI KORUNA is professionally exhausted with a brilliant support cast of impressive characters, from the paternal but lonely Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan himself) who learns that his business is really his home; Pirovitch (Felix Bressart), Kralik's assistant and friend, who always breaks out of the room when faced with the possibility of asking for his honest opinion; the deceptive pimp-du-jour Vadas (Joseph Schildkraut), who eventually got his arrival from the gorgeous Kralik; and an ambitious boy named Pepi Katona (William Tracy), who wants nothing more than being promoted to Matuschek & Co. An unforgettable love affair between "dear friends" takes place in this shop in Budapest, Hungary, which makes Kralik's insignificant appeal and subsequent promotion to a business manager helping both turtles to be together. It's nice that everyone gets a story in this movie; supporting characters are well developed and Matuschek's own path in life is almost as touching as Alfred and Clara. An invitation to the newborn boy Rudy (Charles Smith) for a Christmas dinner, made in the swirling beautiful snow of Hungarian winter, makes the audience happy that he is not alone; we'll take care of that for those characters whose love story is not what the movie says. <br /> <br /> In addition to the love story, I must say that James Stewart is really one of the best things about this movie. He does not play full-fledged Jimmy Stewart's staff in this movie (c / f "Mr. Smith goes to Washington" for that); in fact Alfred Kralik is prickly and violent and not too kind. He's a slightly sharper man, in fact, with a little hint (until the very end) of Stewart, who is going home. When he discovers Clara that they are in secret, Kralik does not care - to wait until he finds out how far he can take the charade, especially when he quickly realizes (due to his stormy relationship with Clara as the boss and the subject) that loving someone he knows through exchanged letters does not have to cope with the love of the person himself. His description of Clary from the fictitious Matthias Popkin (by name!) Who was supposed to become his fiancé is extremely cheerful, but also his way of proving that letters do not find that everything is for man as well as for her letters do not reveal everything to her. Stewart plays this role perfectly - keeps his face perfectly controlled when Clara offends Mr. Kralik as he often does, even (and especially) on his face, and yet, under this agility and professionalism, he believes he could * reveal his identity with such seriousness and sincerity and total hope as to </ p> <p> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> </ p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> the liveliest description of your virgin mailbox. Frank Morgan is well versed in how jealous Hugo Matuschek leads to a nervous breakdown, a man who has to re-discover his meaning in life when he realizes that his wife at the age of 22 does not want to get up with him. And Felix Bressart plays brilliantly but faithfully Pirovička (regular Lubitsch as he appears as a cheerful Russian ambassador in NINOTCHKA) - especially the scene in which he helps his good friend Alfred get a Christmas present this one * really * wants ... a wallet instead the sad Clara cigarette box so suspended. <br /> <br /> Ernst Lubitsch is really proud of this film - for example, a great and careful care for the detail of the Matuschek business is worth the effort for the Hungarian names on the door, the merchandise and the cashier, and so on. Although Lubitsch has decided to have a story in Hungary, the setting is truly universal: it could happen anywhere; it could happen to you. This is the magic of this simple story, these believable characters that are really * people. Snow on Christmas Eve is real, or at least as real as Lubitsch did (he had snowmobiles brought with a big load). It's a desire for everything to appear as likely as possible, which helps make the story even more believable, which gives this entire film a dreamy realism that can not be replicated. (No, not even remake like you did mail). * This * is really a Jimmy Stewart Christmas movie that people are missing when they talk about it's WONDERFUL LIFE. Do not damage the merits of this next film, but instead it would not be a shame, and in fact, a lot of good done in watching the SIZE THROUGH THE CHRISTMAS. It's sweet, fun, charming and Stewart is impeccable in his role. We should all be so happy to have romance in this movie. the best thing about this movie is that we felt like we could do very well.
