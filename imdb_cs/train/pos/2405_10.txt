Wow, I can not believe I'm the first and only person to comment on this great movie. Although the movie is seemingly interesting, the real thing that attracts me to this is Matt lillard, granted most people probably either thinks it's too caffeine happy or just sucks but we're both the same age and the same generation and I've been watching this guy so many times that he is one of my favorites now. It's one of the few movies where there's a big shot and the main star as in SLC Punk, another great Lillard movie. Bakerically this is the story of your usual heist films, but with more twists than anything that begins to be foolish. Also very remarkable in this film is another great actor named Vincent D'onofrio, a very underestimated person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a novice and she is not too bad even though you know she hired her mainly for her accent and nude scene =) <br /> <br /> It's a jack vs jill vs bob game as everyone wants to use rewards but share with anyone. Everyone is trying to get together and kill the other, and it's a time bomb waiting for an explosion. Matt shows his true fitness as a rescue JAck, which initially begins the whole scheme. Vincent and the woman play several art thieves who need money for lack of business. Vince's character is a little deranged and skitz is in the whole movie, but it only adds to the intensity of the film. Surprises left and right are welcome and the end is very non-clich√© and makes you feel happy, but it may depend on the type of end you like. This movie is very interesting to me except that Matt was in it, it's a great movie and I would highly recommend it to everyone who likes movies. Critics probably do not like this movie, but they do not watch movies, because they like movies as well.
