Early Hollywood for the best !! The classic poem Kipling turns into an epic adventure featuring an unforgettable performance of star cast. I think the good movie is the measure of how many times you can watch it and still enjoy it. I've seen it a dozen times and still cry at the end and, admit it, you're doing too!
