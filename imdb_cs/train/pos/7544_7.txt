Japanese animators have a unique freedom with animation, which is why they tend to be able to come up with such movies, films that eventually end up on anime-fans of hard drives and student floors, but ignore almost all countries of origin. Cat's Soup is one of the films that are assumed by Western eyes to have drug experiences or are deeply analyzed. In fact, it's just a very detailed Surrealist way. There is no real dialogue that would facilitate forwarding to other interested parties who are not interested in things like subtitles. Cat and His Half-Dead (Brain-Dead?) Nurse travel through different landscapes of imagination and association. Is there a general theme of water or its deficiency (perhaps because the cat has drowned at the beginning? Maybe due to the title?). It's an interesting genesis take. There's a pig that can eat alone. Elephant from the water. And it's beautiful, attractive, exciting, and entertaining - as long as you do not watch it around druggies who can not experience anything uniquely unique without comparing it with an acidic expedition. Finally, the movie turns itself off and adds another convincing self-reflective level to driving. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
