As others have mentioned, all women who are naked in this movie are mostly beautiful. This seems to make a very suggestive hypocrisy of female libido. When men are around, they want to be persecuted, but when they are not "men," they become the pursuers of a 14-year-old boy. And the boy becomes really fast (we should all be so happy at this age!). He then gains the courage to pursue his true love.
