Rock n 'roll is a dirty business and DiG! demonstrates it masterfully. The project of serious ambitions and possible dirt can be corrected by the filmmaker seven stormy years after two clumsy rock groups. This is said that a number of quality material ensures the ability of the film to engage the audience. If you've ever taken up a music industry, it will undoubtedly be an arrest. the music in the film, even though it suffers from the minimal need of cutting and inserting, is worth accepting itself. the morning after I saw DiG! I went straight to the recording shop and picked up the album Brian Jonestown Massacre (I was already initiated by the sounds of Dandy Warhols). The most important object of his exploration of rock music is the film at other deep levels. Dig! is a sincere and sufficiently objective view of the destructive and volatile nature of the creative process and of the people who are trying to guess these forces.
