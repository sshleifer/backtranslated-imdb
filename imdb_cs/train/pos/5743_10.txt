I loved this movie! It was all I could not say with tears when I was watching it, but it really is very exciting. I was hit by Raya Liotta's performance, but especially by the talent of Tom Hulce, who portrayed Ray's brother, who is mentally slow due to a tragic and terrible childish incident. But Tom's character, though heartbreaking, does not know he is himself and is full of hope and life. This is a great movie, do not miss!
