I absolutely love this movie! It was so good! This film says a parrot, Paulie's opinion. Paulie is the gift of Mary as a present. Paulie helps Marie learn to talk and they become best friends. But when Paulie tells her to fly, she falls and the bird is sent away. Then an adventure begins. Paulie goes so much as to find her way back to Mary. This movie is so sweet, fun, moving, sad and more. When I first watched this movie, she screamed at me. Birds courage and the urge to go find his Mary all the time, he was so concerned. I must say that the end is so sweet and sad, but you will have to look to see how it goes. Finally, his servant tries to help his story. Will she find her long lost Mary or not? Find out when you look at this sweet, warming film. It touches your heart. Rating: 10
