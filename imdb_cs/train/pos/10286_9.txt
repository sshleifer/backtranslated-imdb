This movie is amazing! While fun and entertaining, it is deeply deep and opens its eyes. I look at it again and again. Bruce is a man who is unhappy with his life. He has work and life, but that's not what he thinks he will need to bring him happiness. Bruce is bitter, unhappy and pitiful that his life is not as he should have imagined. As a result of this state of mind, Bruce ends up losing his job and blames God for everything he thinks is bad with his life. God comes to Bruce and gives him divine powers. Bruce uses these powers to get everything he always wanted. His life is ultimately what he imagined to make him happy ... with one exception. In the process of getting everything he loses the one person who really loved him. As the film unfolds, Bruce learns that the real change that should have occurred in his life was not the circumstances but his perception of what really existed. This film was inspirational and deep. If you really pay attention, it makes you look at your life with a profoundly humble respect for having a lot of time more blessed than we know. As my wife says, "Since when does anyone know what it means to be happy?" and my humble adage: "We do not want to lose ourselves and those who care when we try to find out."
