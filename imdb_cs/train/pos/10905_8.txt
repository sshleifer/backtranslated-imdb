In September 2003, 36-year-old Jonny Kennedy died. He had a terrible genetic condition called Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) - which meant that his skin literally fell with the slightest touch so his body was covered with aggressive ulcers and led to the final fight against skin cancer. In his last months, Jonny decided to work with filmmaker Patrick Collerton to prove his life and death. The result was a movie that was broadcast for the first time in March, an uplifting, derogatory and provocative humorous tale of a single man. Not missing from the cruel reality of EB, the film was also a celebration of life that lived completely. Produced and directed by Patrick Collerton and first appeared in March 2004 The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off became the most talked about documentary film of that year. It has attracted almost five million viewers, and after the show, the public donated more than half a million pounds to Jonny's charity, DEBRA. The Jonny Kennedy Memorial Fund was set up to earn another half a million to ensure that Jonny Kennedy leaves one million pounds.
