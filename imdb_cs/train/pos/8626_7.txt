"Der Todesking" is not exactly the kind of movie that makes you cheerful? Jorg Buttgereit is the second cultural monument in a row, which is actually much better than the infamous "Necromancer", there are seven short episodes? one for each day of the week? turning to suicide of unrelated people. Among these already very disturbing episodes, Buttgereit puts really horrible pictures of a seriously devastating male corpse. Episodes are not all as strong, but as healthy, "Der Todesking" is ranked quite high on the list of all the most depressing art-house films. Especially episodes in the middle involving a person who explains his sexual frustration to a complete stranger in the park, and Sunday, focusing on a younger man who is bothering the dead, are extremely intense and devastating. The added value of this movie or any other similar shock is debatable, and I'm not even sure if Buttgereit had any kind of message to communicate here. There is a vague mention of a mysterious chain letter that encourages readers to commit suicide, but mostly we have remained uninformed about these human motivations to end life so dramatically. Quite apart from what I expected, "Der Todesking" is not exploitative or nasty graphic! On the contrary, I could never hope that Buttgereit would be so gentle and thoughtful as to the display of pure human misery. The fourth episode is a perfect example of this, because it stylishly portrays different views of the famous German bridge, while the names, ages and occupations of the people who jumped appear on the screen. Production values ​​are inevitably poor, and editing often lacks professionalism, but this is not real counting in this type of cinema. Is the subject strong and compelled to think less fun? but also indispensable? aspects of life. Great use of tragic music too!
