Ella was excellent, Franchot was inevitably over the top (But he played similar parts in other films like "The Man on the Eiffel Tower") and Alan was almost nonexistent, but the film certainly "excited". > <br /> * A slight spoiler forward *: I wonder how many times Elisha Cook has been shuffling in his movies, but it seems to me that I remember other examples. He will avoid naming the killer, but I think it's clearly obvious because of the "thriller" plot. Very well done but dated movie noire (for example: everyone smoked like a fool and the police were really composing characters, and unlike today's gore festivals, no dead body has ever been shown.) Made in a well-known format of short period scenes. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10.
