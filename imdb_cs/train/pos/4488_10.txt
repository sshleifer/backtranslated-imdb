Here's a favorite Tom & Jerry cartoon that's perfect for Halloween. I know it does not have much creep, but it has a trick like in "Trick or Treat" because Jerry made Tom a blind window and a vacuum cleaner with a shirt on it hanging to make it look like a ghost; but she still wanted to put it on my list of Halloween cartoon movies. In this shortcut, Tom listened to "Witching Hour," a radio story on the radio and was afraid of the story of horror. Halfway into the story, they start to make a drama (hair standing at the end, hearts jump in the neck, cold chills on the spine). . . verbatim. And Jerry watched the whole thing and laughed for himself, thinking that Tom was afraid of scaring him. <br /> <br /> I like the end, it was a bit funny. And you know, this short is the first of four cartoons in which Tom attacks Mammy Two Shoes; others are Lonesome Mouse, Mouse in the Home, and Nit-Witty Kitty. And this short one is the first of twenty-five cartoon films where Tom talks. The Monster Mouse, Cat Mouse, Cat Mouse, Cat Mouse, Mouse Cat, Mouse Catcher, Mouse Catcher, Mouse Mouse and Cat Chuck Jones.
