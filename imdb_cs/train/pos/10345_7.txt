The only other review of this movie is the star of the movie and the movie itself. I usually read user comments to give me an idea of ​​what to expect from a movie I do not know much about. It's unfortunate when there is not much comment on a particular tile, because if there is only one review and it unjustifiably spoils the movie and the cast, you have no idea what to expect. I read the review before I watched this title and I do not know where the venom of the movie and the stars comes from. Douglas and Blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually supplied, although the material was not the largest. I found the movie and the show fun and enjoyable. It's not one of the classic classics, but a nice and fun turn-much more than you can afford in most of the newer movies. If you are a fan of these stars, you will not be disappointed.
