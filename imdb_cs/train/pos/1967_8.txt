I do not understand why the reviews of this movie are so universal if I'm not from my rocker. I found it wrong, brilliantly, twisted and psychologically sophisticated. You will not be deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood film than this one. It has layers inside the layers, it has a Stone effect and a plot that will guess you after it's over. People have to overcome the fact that Sharon Stone is 48 years old and that Michael Douglas is not in this. I predict that this movie will be a huge hit on DVD once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to professional reviewers. Give it a shot, you may be glad you did!
