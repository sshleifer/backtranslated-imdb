I've seen this movie more than once. It was on the same level as a lot of scary things that were being shown in television movies. The only problem I've had was for obvious reasons ... One immediately thinks about the famous cake of Drake's cake! Exiting the first part, "Hound of Hell", would be enough. Richard Crenna can always bring a sense of seriousness to everything he does as well - whether the plot is good or bad. But it was a nice Halloween ride offered by CBS. I loved the part where Crenna took a flight to a dark country where she would find a mystic to help him conquer the evil animal. He asks the cab driver how to find that guy. Big dialogue between the native cab driver and Crenna as regards the cabin, which distributes the ethnic beliefs of its own people. "Hello, Mr Barry, I left this thing when I came down from the mountains ..." - refers to a mystic who rarely sees or advises people and no one knows how to really touch him. <br /> <br /> As far as supernatural is concerned, this movie is still nice.
