Cliffhanger is a good action crime adventure with some flaws from director Renna Harlin, whose admirable film about a professional climbing rider who has found himself hostage with a fellow friend of a gang of dangerous criminals in search of suits full of stolen money Rockies. Sylvester Stallone works impressively like Gabe Walker, an expert climber, especially in action / combat sequences, but some of them are definitely bordering on a number of unrealistic. Because of the movie, I'm willing to stop my distrust. The rest of the cast, including John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall, and Leon, are good characters in the film. Action / combat sequences are well done, but as mentioned earlier, some are not very realistic, no matter how hard you are. The climbing sequences are very well done, because instead of filming the whole movie in the studio somewhere they chose, they felt very real and Ariel's views of the mountains are amazing that they add reality to the movie. Deaths are inventive, while others are certainly predictable. The villains are solid, but it would be better if they were centered on having more of them. The motion of the film was a little slow, but good in this case, it prevails over the bad. If you're a big fan of Harlins or Stallone, you're likely to like it. Overall Cliffhanger has character development with plenty of action, drama, a bit of strain, excitement, excitement and good cast performances that make this film to be watched.
