I remember this line so well. It was excellent - such strong and convincing figures, stylish and sexy ... so different from all the other ones offered at that time - and now ... I'm sure it inspired the excellent Canadian track "Traders". <br /> <br /> Both season 1 and season 2 are available on DVD region 2 in the UK. Her hospitality watch the series again. Season 1 is 13 episodes and Season 2 seems to be 10 episodes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems to have ended after 2 seasons. <br /> <br /> This series was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can get it on the special Amazon.co.uk site
