This movie made me so stunned to look at him at least once a year. Sometimes it seemed inconvenient to me. Sometimes I find it reinforcing. And I always find human and real characters. It's a movie that will show you the fragile reality of life in LA, starting with repeated search helicopter lights that scan the dangers that are so close to the normal lives that characters use. It's also a movie that will show you how the alien's favor can change your life and empower you to change. The Grand Canyon reminds you that any action you take, whether you intend or not, has a strong impact. I found this movie similar to the many ways of Robert Altman Short Cuts. Both had a stellar list of perfectly cast actors and actresses, and both films allowed them to gradually see how the characters intertwine each other and interact with each other, whether better or worse. Grand Canyon did a better job of providing a coherent message (hope in the face of desperate reality) than Altman's movie, though I found them both interesting in their own way. This film is definitely to be seen!
