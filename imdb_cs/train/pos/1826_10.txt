I loved the film when I was little. Today, at the age of 17, he is one of my favorite animated films. Beautiful animations and attractive characters are just two of the things that appeal to this movie. Though many people do not have to use some of the songs, most of them are well done and go with the story. It focuses on Charlie, the handsome German Shepard, who at first glance may seem unbeatable ... but ultimately he will win you. It's not a kid's movie. Often very dark and terrifying. Tribute to Don Bluth fans and animation lovers. But keep the fabric in your hand. ADGTH will never make me cry and will do the same for those who are sensitive to the movie. Probably one of the largest non-Disney animated movies ever. Together with Watership Down and my neighbor Totoro. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: Heavenly masterpiece.
