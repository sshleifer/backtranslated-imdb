When my 14-year-old daughter and her friends meet on a movie night, there's one movie that insists on looking again and again: You guessed it, the K-911, the third installment in the highly successful K-9 franchise, where they played all popular television dad Jim Belushi. People, I knew it was possible to wear a VHS cassette, but a DVD? It's played so often that it begins to jump; no joke! But of course you will have it when you have a movie so charming, so great. <br /> <br /> Of course, we have to thank Tom Hanks for introducing us to the beloved Cop-Dog genre with Tourner and Hooch; nevertheless, the film does not focus on the perfect excellence presented in all three K-9 films. Some non-believers say that Belushi has disappeared with this third film in the series. Poppycock, I say. While you might suspect that the third installment - right on the video - may not look like something worth watching, you will be wrong to watch this high quality movie. give a conspiracy, but I say that Belushi and his terrifying partner are giving their best performance yet - the one that will laugh at you! It's a shame that John Belushi is not alive to see what big steps his brother has done in the acting world. I highly recommend that your teenage daughter introduce this film to her BFF for her next party sleep. Do not forget the puppy!
