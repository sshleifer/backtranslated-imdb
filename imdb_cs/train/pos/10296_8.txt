A rather funny car Jim Carrey, who has it as a news reporter who temporarily gains the power of God and wrecks it. Carrey is back on the familiar plot and seems to have a good time, and Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriend is also charming and influential. The story is predictable to the extreme, but the cast (including Morgan Freeman as "God") is great and makes the film catch it. CLASS: B
