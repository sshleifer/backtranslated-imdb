I've seen a couple of eating disorders, but this was definitely my favorite. The problem with others was that people with eating disorders at the end automatically automatically improve or accept the fact that they need help, and that is it. this movie I thought it was a realistic cause in this one main hero Lexi is not just better. She improves and then has a disadvantage. I think this film shows more than others that I have seen that better not only happens, it's hard work and time, it's a long way to revive. I think this movie shows everything very well. There should be more films like this one.
