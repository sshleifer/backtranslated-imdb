A very good war film showing the effects of war on a native city boy who is losing sight of Guadalcanal and has to come back home and reapply with family and friends. An excellent cast of actor helps make this movie very funny. Eleanor Parker's girlfriend's role was worthy of an Oscar nomination. She has such innocence for her in this film. Ann Dorana's role was as satisfying as all her small supporting roles. I especially like the aura of the pre-war Phildelphia. The hunting scene is very good. Of course, the Guadalcanal war scene really showed the horror our soldiers faced during this epic battle. A well-deserved film and one that should not be forgotten
