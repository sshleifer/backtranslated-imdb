An interesting sight to Japan before opening to the West. John Wayne, the first American consul to Japan, will come in line with the Perry Cannon diplomacy agreements. He is not welcome. Wayne eventually wins his encounter with Shogun after bringing the cholera outbreak introduced by the American ship under control. Here is a colorful parade into the capital with gifts for Shogun, including the Old Tanglefoot bottle. Meetings with the shogun, interviews between Japanese nobles and murder in the show of archery represent an interesting view of the politics of the time. It's a rather nice film, and how often do you see that the Duke has lost the fight for half his husband.
