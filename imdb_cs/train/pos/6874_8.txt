A series of vignettes, most of which are spoofing television of the 1970s, but also with some kicks in government and corporate America. One of the longest segments, "Dealers," is not so fun to me, and I do not know what parodies. Some of the others are totally split. I especially like the cooking segment. Most of the bad words I know are used in the movie and if you have objections to full face nudity, stay calm.
