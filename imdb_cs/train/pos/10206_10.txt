Within a few years of visiting film festivals, I have seen many small films that never get into the theater distribution and end up in a $ 3 WalMart trash. I just found the DVD Yank Tank, a great doc, but how sad it was that it ended up like the remains of a rock. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, I wish I could see it in the cinema that's all. I would have preferred that the movie New Yorker Films translated the title directly. It is good for the Americans to stretch a little. If the movie title helps American audiences explore random chaos, the better. The cinema imitates life and visa. <br /> <br /> I also found it scattered that the headlines featured dollar prices. Come on! The euro is not hard to figure out for the gringo audience to do math. Looking at the film, especially one shot in Paris, the viewer should not have the effect blurry by reminding him: I am an American who is watching the film and converting the euro to dollars for me. <br /> <br /> We are looking forward to seeing more of these actors and more from the writer and the director.
