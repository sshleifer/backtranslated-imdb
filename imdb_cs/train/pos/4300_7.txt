This movie could be one of those common "soaps" that relate to the daily events of half a dozen families whose lives are intertwined ... broken relationships, building new friends, street bashings, almost accidents, hopes and dreams and even discovery a child that was dropped under some shrubs! What is a mix of events! <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the film producer goes beyond these day-to-day events and puts questions to be considered, even if satisfactory answers are not available. He asks in this chaotic world that things only happen, it is only luck when things turn out to be right, or it is a fatal view, the person is destined to be in a certain place at a certain time, and thus engage in action and his future has a new perspective? Most of us have this exceptional experience. <br /> <br /> Is it our super ego that leads us to be so important? How does one character say? he once sat on the edge overlooking the Grand Canyon and realized he was infinitely small. This is not one of my favorite films, but a good study of human relationships. Danny Glover is excellent in a sympathetic role.
