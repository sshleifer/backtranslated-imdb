My Teacher Friend is a well-written novel of a comedy film that has something like My Sassy Girl .. There is no kissing / sex scene. Hollywood should learn more from Korean productions. Sex is not always needed in a good romantic movie. The film is a light heart with occasional CG scenes in the movie. I like that part when Ji-Hoon almost kissed Su-Wan. The most fun moment is when Ji-Hoon defeats the first love of Su-Wan, for driving Su-Wan to another girl and soon to be father. As he became a father, he was revealed in the next scene, which brings audiences smiles. <br /> <br /> Mao points: 8/10
