"Saving Grace" is never exciting funny, but it brings quite good laughs and I enjoyed it to a large extent. Brenda Blethyn is a great actress and she's doing a good job of showing widow Grace, who is looking to grow marijuana to pay her huge debts. Supporting casting also does a great job. French actor Tchecky Karyo has a funny little role. The assumption itself is attractive. The idea that a woman who goes over a hill and gives a smoke is quite fun. And the movie plays around with a wise assumption every moment. Of course, there are flat moments as if two older women confused the leaves of marijuana Grace for the tea leaves and started pulling the kids' antics in the shop where they work. It was a soulless gag that did not quite go away. The tone of the movie is somewhat gloomy and occasionally boring, but I got enough laughter to recommend this English import. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
