I found it to be the most amazing Muppets movie because I felt it was the deadliest and best comedic delivery on most of its lines. Muppets are trying to go to Broadway to sell the original musical piece they wrote, but they encounter common problems along the way, including Kermit's memory loss. While there are not so many great actor, as in the original movie "Muppets," there are also Joan Rivers and Dabney Coleman. Simple timing and delivery of so many lines is great, and the situations where Muppets is located are fun. Original songs are also good and the end is satisfying. There is not much to say about the movie, but fans of Muppets should be sure. It's the funniest Muppet movie and everyone is happy. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
