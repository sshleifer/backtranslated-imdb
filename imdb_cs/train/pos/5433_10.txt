This movie is one of my favorite times. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr ... what cast. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gung Din. Drama, action, adventure, and comedy have all come together. The final combat scene still adds frost to the end and always leaves me in tears. If you have not seen them, I would highly recommend it.
