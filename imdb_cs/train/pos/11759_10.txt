The best of times is one of the great sleepers of all time. Setting you up with patience, development is stable, many interrelated relationships are lovingly based, gags and bits work and all fun. There is a lot of sentimentality. Kurt Russell plays Reno Hightower in one of his best performances, and Robin Williams plays Jack Dundee is as sure as never before. Casting also includes many great followers. Jack's wife plays daughter, Jack Palance, who is beautiful, just like wife Reno, who is a great comedian. I can not tell you how many times I watched this movie, how many times I enjoyed it, and how often I wanted more people to see it.
