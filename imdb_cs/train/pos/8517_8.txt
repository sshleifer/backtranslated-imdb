Russ and Valerie discuss family formation. The couple lives in a luxury apartment and runs an auction company that deals with valuable collectibles. At the same time, the owner of the freelance agency receives a mini holiday and leaves orphanages in the care of his father (Leslie Nielsen). Father Harry is on rent and gets a great idea to "rent" some children from orphanages to husbands like Russ and Valerie. Harry, who realizes the dilemma of a couple, offers a family of siblings for a 10-day rental! Brandon, Kyle, and Molly moved to the apartment with their temporary parents, with funny consequences because the new guardians are inexperienced with children. But where is the chance of a happy ending? It's a nice family movie. The actors, including Nielsen as a carriage trader and Christopher Lloyd as a kind home porter, are amazing. The script is fun and fun and the overall production is quite high. Yes, if such a life could be so! Lonely children everywhere deserve the chance to prove they are kind and can give such joy to parents who are considering adoption. If you want to show the family a movie that is rooted in good value but is also very entertaining, find this movie. It is guaranteed that everyone laughs, even if their heart melts.
