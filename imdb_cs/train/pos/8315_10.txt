A standard story of glory that has several high points. Number one, Lonette McKee as a sister who gives amazing stellar performance. The fact that it never became a huge feeling afterwards. Unfortunately, this is a supporting character and we are forced to concentrate on Irena Carter's innocent character, Sparkle, whose upbringing to glory is easy, boring and unconvincing. However, whenever the girls go on stage and play, the film is revived again. Original music by Curis Mayfield must be praised. The copy I saw was a very old VHS tape. Image quality was relatively low, just like the production values ​​I'm guessing. Overall, it's worth watching.
