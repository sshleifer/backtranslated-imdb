I can not accept negative comments from other reviewers. They are too critical, perhaps because they are stuck in the past. I would like to see a comment from someone who has never seen Basic Instinct 1, maybe someone very young? I let the cinema feel happy that I was not influenced by IMDb reviewers. About 14 hours later, I'm still trying to find mistakes in the plot, but I can not think of anything serious. My advice to all is to see for yourself and to invent your own thought. It comes from a similar pattern to Basic Instinct 1, but the fence is less confused. He was still thinking about the end, but in a more satisfactory way. Sharon Stone is as sexy and bad as before, and is 48 years old; this remains its definition. David Morrisey was satisfying even though Michael Douglas was not. From the supported cast, I liked David Thewlis as a police detective.
