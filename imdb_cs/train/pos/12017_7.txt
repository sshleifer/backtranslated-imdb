"The Last Menagerie" is a typical West for the 1970s. Most of them seem inspired by Sam Peckinpah. Also this, but director Andrew McLaglan is John Ford the pupil and it can be obvious that in many scenes. The IMO start is very good. In a way, McLaglan wanted to show the audience a journey from civilization to wilderness. The third part is some illogical mistakes and I am a little bit complaining about Charlton Heston. He has to play an old ex-lawyer called Sam Burgade, but he has a fantastic physical form. I never felt he really had trouble climbing on horse or rock. It does not seem to me much motivated, as she usually does in most epic films. The same goes for the beautiful Barbara Hershey, who plays the Sheriff's daughter. Maybe both have problems with the director or were unhappy with their role. Hershey and Coburn do not show their best, but they are still good. If John Wayne had a script like Sam Burgade? Also, Michael Parks as a modern sheriff is a bit less in his role. On the other hand, James Coburn is the criminal Zach Provo. Coburn is really a big thief in this. It portrays a bad man between manic hatred and cleverness. His roles and his acting are the best of the film. <br /> <br /> Landscapes and Shootouts are amazing. Shooting scenes are bloody and violence looks realistic. Zach Provo and his gang had some bloody and violent scenes. What I miss is typical western action in the middle of the film. I would have appreciated bank robbery or something like that. Overall, it's a fun western film. It's not a great movie, but above average because of the great Coburn, a very good start and some cruel and violent scenes.
