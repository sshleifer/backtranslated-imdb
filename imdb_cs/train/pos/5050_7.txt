We really liked Gray Owl: a simple story well-known in classical Attenborough fashion: a bit overly romantic, with archetypes, humor, and stress of dignity and values. Beautifully shot and in a pleasant tempo, it is the true story of Archie, an Englishman who became Indian Indian, and went to live and trap in Canada. A solid show of all makes this movie easy to read. <br /> <br /> Two of the stars of the movie are undoubtedly the cutest ones we've ever seen - and the message is good with its ecolence. It had to be great to meet or read Gray Owl in the 1930s, a unique character and it's a great movie hold.
