Due to all the negative reviews of this movie, I have almost never seen him. I was, however, pleasantly surprised that this is a very nice horror movie. Although she was a great actress - besides the great Alice Krige - but some of the dialogues ("Just get used to lunch.") It was quite fun. Overall, above-average Stephen King's efforts - 7/10.
