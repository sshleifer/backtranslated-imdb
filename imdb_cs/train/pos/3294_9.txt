This film has opened up in the first few weeks to bad speeches. Then Meena Kumari died, and it only brought crowds that rolled in. The songs on All India Radio, especially the Inhi LogoN were not played so often that I was sick of them at that time, even though they admire their beauty! <br /> <br /> Yes, it took everything. That was because the marriage was very unfortunate and Kamal Amrohi also had trouble locating the film; looking at intricate sets and costumes, is not surprising! Not only does Meena Kumari age and ill, but listens carefully to Lace's voice. Inhi logoN is not 50 years younger, while songs that were re-recorded as Chalo dildar chalo show a clear development. I would like someone to find the songs of Ghulama Mohammad that were not included in the movie, because fashion has changed that required fewer, though slightly, songs and published. Lata in a recent interview (2007) named Ghulama Mohammad as one of the best composers she has ever worked with, except for Madan Mohan (a great personal friend). Note also that you hardly see the actors in the song Chalo dildar, very unusual. There is only a short shot of Raj Kumar from the middle distance and you can see only the back of the anticipated Meena Kumari. Kamal Amrohi, out of necessity, had spent virtue and focused on the stars and the moon. Any other movie, this song should be close to both. <br /> <br /> As far as the best film is concerned, I would want to be different. It means that you miss a lot of Indian cinema, in any order, movies such as Barsaat (old), Devdas (old version), Bandini, Do Bigh Zameen, Garam Hava, Dastak, Guddi, Aan, Pyasha, Kagaz to Phool, Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam, Kabuliwallah, Abhimaan, Guide, Sujatha, Bombay and Babu, Daag, Parineeta (old), Umrao Jaan, etc. Atd. And if you value music more than a story, Raat on Naya Daur, Teesri Manzil, Mahal, Aag, Jugu, Anand, Mera Naam Joker: The list is really endless! <br /> <br /> So enjoy Pakeezah, but do not miss any of the above ...
