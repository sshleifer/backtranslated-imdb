After all these years I consider this series to be the best example of a World War II documentary film. Interviews with many participants from all countries distinguish it from any other project. It would be great to see the current documentary (Ken Burns?), Which would attempt to gather information from veterans before they are gone. With modern technology to improve old archive records and lots of information that has been uncovered since 1974 when The World At War was produced, an updated version of this series will be welcomed. History Channel has made some fine shows dealing with many aspects of World War II, but extensive series such as World At War have not successfully attempted from the original. If you are interested in this time, do not miss this series. Viewing is required.
