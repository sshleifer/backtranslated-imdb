Petter Mattei "Love in Time of Money" is a visually stunning movie that you can watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a lively portrait about people's relationships. It's a movie that seems to tell us what money, strength, and success people are doing in the various situations that we encounter. <br /> <br /> This is a variant of Arthur Schnitzler's play on the same theme, the director takes the action to the present day in New York, where all these different characters meet and join. Each one is connected in one way or another with another person, but no one seems to know the previous contact point. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated, luxurious look. We are welcomed to see how these people live and the world live in their own environment. The only thing that comes from all these souls in the picture is the different states of loneliness that each one lives. A big city is not exactly the best place where human relationships find true fulfillment, as distinguished by the majority of people we meet. Acting is good under the direction of Mr. Matte. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these characters alive. We wish Mr. Matte good luck and we are waiting anxiously for his next year. work.
