One of the most nihilistic and brutal films I've ever seen, but one of the most tragic and the most tragic films. This is the action melodrama that the world has never seen before. Sometimes I got to tears, while in the next moment I brought a shocking revelation like a stroke. Cooling performance Edison Chen. The story of the HK policeman and the Cambodian killer, who hunt down and lose their humanity, is strong. Thanks to very little dialogue in favor of a spooky photo and frantic camera work, "Dog Bite Dog" is pure HK-Bloodshed without heroism.
