This is really a great unknown movie. A perfect dialogue without typical clich√©s. This film relied on actor's talent and was severed. He even had a little comedy, but it was not exaggerated. is what is a crime drama and not a typical special influence on garbage with sex thrown in. I especially loved the interracial aspects of it all. Now on the actors themselves. Laurence Fishburne was great at playing a small criminal's career. It's a pity he has only the opportunity to show his talent in his own film. Titus Welliver was fabulous like the crazy Fishburne brother. Eamonn Walker added taste to a perfectly spiced movie. Paul Calderon was perfect as a greedy monkey / drug lord.I loved his acting from "The King of New York". The best actress, however, was Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, who were perfectly matched as two of Calderon's followers. Once in a lifetime he is certainly a goalkeeper. **** 1/2 * z *****.
