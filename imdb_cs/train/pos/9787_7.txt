This story is beautiful. It's sad and a heart about the young girl's journey to find out where she's coming from and where she's going. Stephanie was accepted by her mother as her best friend after her mother and father were killed in a car accident, and since she was labeled a "miracle child," she is dyslexic and finds life a bit tough. Her knowledge along the way affects those closest to her. Her relationship with her guardian and the ex-boyfriend of her guardian is very delicate and sensitive, and the whole supporting part is true, three-dimensional and believable. Set around the peach preservation plant in the small town of Australia, it's a warm, gentle, erotic movie and leaves you with a nice feeling when the credits are closing. After reading some other rather shallow comments about Hug Weaving, I would like to add that I think he was greatly busy and was very sexy. No, it's not Brad Pitt, but that does not mean he's not attractive.
