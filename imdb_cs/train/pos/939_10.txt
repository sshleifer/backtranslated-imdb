Okay, is there a ton of reviews, what can I add? <br /> <br /> I will try it anyway. <br /> <br /> The reason is that my favorite Scrooge is due to ALL. Sets, outdoor seats, costumes are so beautiful and authentic. Music is sweet. The support cast is very well done. One of my favorites is the narrator and nephew playing Roger Rees. His undervalued sincerity touches and his voice is a christmas sound for me. David Warner is also completely credible Bob Cratchit. It's a tough life, but it stays positive and dignified. <br /> <br /> The best part of the course is George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. Some said his rendering was too rough. I could not disagree more. His exchanges at first when they were cold or hard were not of a nature. He is a terribly disappointed man whose heart is hardened by the effects of life and his desire for wealth. <br /> <br /> While it's playing, it's obvious that it's not omnipotent. Here we see that there is hope for him. If he was gone, Marley's partner would probably never go for himself. And, after all, no one of us has recently hoped. I think that's a huge part of what Dickens was trying to say. When Scrooge looks at her dance with her employer with Belle, you can see that she's sorry when she tells Belle in the memory that she's going through a "smile on her face" life. Clive Donner was as cute as a director to allow those moments in the movie. Sometimes they play in the floor of the editorial room. And finally, his conversion is so full of joy that he screams me with tears of joy Every time I see her. His justification to his son Fred, so sincere, so moving, is not only the spirit of Christmas but also humanity itself. The joy he brings to Fred, his wife, is so obvious. And the line that always gets me: "God forgive me for the time I lost." <br /> <br /> Bravi tutti!
