It's all about Mitzi. I loved her in this. And did not look fantastic ?! I love these movie popcorn films about the afternoon life. This is one of those nails where they always go to commercial stores in the most vicious times. Richard's character was absolutely scary. I went to such guys. Well, it's not like that lol. I wish Zack did not kill him. He was a pussy and very easy for his eyes. I love stalker stories. I always got up and made sure my door was locked. My husband usually does not like these types of movies, but in reality he's sitting with it and really enjoying it. I can not wait to see what Mitzi does!
