CAROL'S JOURNEY is pleased to see so many reasons. The performance of Clara Lago is simply amazing for someone so young, and she is one of those special actors who can say they say many facial expressions. Director Imanol Urbibe represents a solid and controlled film without interruption in continuity, thus driving a parcel of steady pace with enough tension to think of what the nest will bring. Scenario Angel Garcia Roldan is a story telling his best, which seems to be the ultimate goal of the movie after all. The plot is unpredictable, but the events it reveals are completely logical. Perhaps the best feature of this film when telling the story of the Spanish Civil War, because it affected people. It was an important event of the 20th century, but it does not even know it. At 40 years of university teaching, on average, I gave an average of one semester that he even heard, much less anyone who could say anything about it - and the vast number of students were meritorious scholars, all of whom speak of a huge amount of censorship in American education . One way is that this movie is a good way to start studying this event, remembering that when one thread is pulled out, much history is melting. Appreciation of this film is therefore directly related to the amount of human knowledge. To watch this movie as another age-old movie, you will lose the movie completely. The Left Elbow Index considers seven aspects of film - acting, production sets, character development, plotting, dialogue, film continuity and art - on a scale of 10, very good, 5 for average and 1 for the needed help. CAROL'S JOURNEY is above all figures above average, except for a dialogue that is classified as average. The average LEI for this movie is 9.3, increased to 10 when compared to the IMDb scale. I highly recommend this movie for all ages.
