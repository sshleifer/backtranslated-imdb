The symbolic use of objects, the editing of shapes, the positioning of characters in the scene ... all of this was used with such joyous abandonment by Hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had. The way your wife moves from one corner of the ring to another when the fight is in progress, editing when the wedding ring is placed on your finger ... while these may look a little obvious to today's standards, in a silent era, storybooks without a word. Even the title has at least four meanings I see; a boxing ring, a wedding ring, a bracelet that a lover buys, and a love triangle at the heart of the story.
