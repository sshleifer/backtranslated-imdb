Who can watch the movie, look at Lucy Liu and do not be excited. This woman is an amazingly beautiful and talented actress. This is a tough combination when you find days. And Jeremy Northam. I have heard his name many times, but I have never really noticed him. My advice to Hollywood is, "Make use of it more". <br /> <br /> Now about the movie: I saw it in one of my cemeteries. I do not recommend anyone. It's a bit complicated and mysterious. I still can not believe I did not see the end of the coming. I'm not going to say what causes it to crush a hole. even if it says it's enough corruption. Now I think I'm voting on this movie. I like a dark mystical story, actors have done a good job, and I love the director (natali) in the past. There is not a big audience for such a thing, it is also quite risky. you know what, I'm gonna give this job 8, because everybody should see it. Again, deducting 1 point will cause room for improvement.
