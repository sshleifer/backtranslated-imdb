It was a totally charming series and I was sorry I was able to catch some shows back when it came out late in the UK. The style was so different from the others, and the whole thing was a disturbing air of stylish fear. All you have to do is read out all the positive comments (not just negative what I see) to realize what is truly innovative series and how it captured the imagination. Now I understand when I read the comments that I received CANCELED, it's so incredible. What amount of "headless paid suitable turkey" had to be (or maybe still) running around to do it.
