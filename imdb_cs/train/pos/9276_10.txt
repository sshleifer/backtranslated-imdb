The US State Department would not want us to see this movie because they have beef with the Iranian government. But it shows us what a truly civilized Iran is, despite the content of the film that focuses on fighting women there for equal rights in the simplest terms: the ability to watch a football game at the stadium, which is strictly for men only. The film is cheerful and entertaining and is in itself a proof of freedom of expression and expression in Iran. I enjoyed this movie. Five girls are trying to penetrate the police border at the gateway to a soccer match between Iran and Bahrain. The subsequent comedy is too fun to describe, from the bus to the stadium, to the arrival of the police and the subsequent detention of the girl until the end. Do not miss this classic movie. It has to be seen. One of the best foreign movies I have seen for years.
