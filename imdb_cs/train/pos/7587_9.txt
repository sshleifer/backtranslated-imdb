I have to say that I was amazed that the cinematography was amazing, the frames that were approaching perfection, and the way they built the tension around the object, which sounds more like awful drilling, is out of the question. two narrators, one saw, one invisible. Both are trying to explain the importance of the painting that has caused the scandal for a long time. The film is about theories and explanations of opinions, but the conclusion is quite shocking, I must say. Definitely a movie that deserves more than 171 votes. <br /> <br /> With only 66 minutes to play, it's a movie that still felt like a complete piece of work. Fantastic direction! I have to say much better than Blood of the Poet, which reminds me a little for some special reason. <br /> <br /> I suppose you can call it the slang word "artsy". It's quite a lot of professional talk about different theories and amazing visual effects, but the crew and Ruiz pulled it out. At least for me. Amazing film.
