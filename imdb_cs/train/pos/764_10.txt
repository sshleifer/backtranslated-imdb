Undoubtedly, Beat Street is the best movie about the Breakin scene. Everything about it is a place, clothing (puma), music and especially dance! The story is basic, but hey, what's the story to tell? The whole point of the film is to show what children are doing at this time, what is important to them. It shows that teenagers are generally good, everything that is everyday to these children is music, dance and friendship. When I watched DVDs recently, I was surprised to see how good the time test is! Clothes did not seem dated (perhaps because Puma now has a huge return), the music is still fresh and the dance is still breathtaking. A young 10-25 year film should be seen as part of its youth culture.
