I've just watched this movie and I can honestly say it's a work of art. I was very surprised to see the overall rating as 5.2. <br /> <br /> Not only did Guy collect ab lists (ish) and shoot them in such wonderful figures, he gave us a fantastically diverse story line with lots of fantasy. <br /> <br /> Too many people want movies with a theme that can be understood and handed over to a plate ... yet they are movies that have poor reviews because they are too predictable. <br /> <br /> This movie is special. Get it now!
