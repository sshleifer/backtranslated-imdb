This is an amazing film from 1936. Although the first lesson is not very interesting (for a modern viewer), the stylistic vision of 2036, which comes in words, does. However, do not think that you are able to understand all the dialogue - sound quality and accent (it's American, but "American of the 1930s") making it harder. Basically, it's a 100-year-old story of a fictitious American city, "Everytown". It has been spreading since 1936, when the war is on the horizon, until 2036, when technology emerges and creates its own problems. The first lesson is relatively slow - though it's hard to tell what audience he would think then. Events, tensions and visual elements are relatively low nowadays. But when it comes to the future, it's just fun to watch. Big files and a retro sci-fi look are all hard to beat. If you do not have great listening skills, this movie is hard to listen to. I think I understand only 80% of the dialogue. If you are a sci-fi fan, it is a genre classic and you need to see it (well, at least after the first hour). For the average viewer, wait until the closed version of the subtitle is finished, and then look at it if you like movies of that period.
