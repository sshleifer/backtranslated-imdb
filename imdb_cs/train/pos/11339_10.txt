Anyone who has experienced the horror of divorce will focus on the protagonist of this Indian film, a frightened little boy who believes his zombies are hiding in his wardrobe. Is Jake (charming Anthony DeMarco) simply "carrying" the trauma of two parents who quarrel about a clear picture? Or would it be real? Writer / director Shelli Ryan neatly balances both options and keeps the audience guessing. Her choice using one environment - a suburban home - increases the feeling of despair and claustrophobia. Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Bridgers are very convincing as angry but loving parents. However, it is scary little characters, Mrs. Bender (Barbara Gruen), a shameless watchdog and Sam Stone (Ben Bode), a dirty real estate agent in the mind. Jake's Closet is a dark-inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of hell.
