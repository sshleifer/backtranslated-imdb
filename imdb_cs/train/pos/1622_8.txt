I just saw this cartoon for the first time and saw the cartoons of famous black entertainers ... Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith (not Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker, who was white), Thomas "Fats" Waller, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, Stepin Fetchit on it) Louis Armstrong and the girls' choirs are outside the well-known "Cotton Club" in Harlem. True ... stereotypes are there, but that's how it was ... and these cartoons were seen as adult entertainment in your local cinema before the main feature. Harmann & Ising cartoons tended to be more "cute" and more upscale (after all ... talking about MGM) than the standard animated short end in Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox, RKO or Low Columbia. Even the very early Mickey Mouse from Disney had a lot of humor before Uncle Walt cleaned up just before "Technicolor" went. Disney had some cartoons with cartoons of black entertainers as well ... for example, 1937 is Silly Symphony "Woodland Cafe". But we must remember that these films are part of a certain time and place. 50 years since ... Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park clips will also be examined, analyzed, and even destroyed by future viewers.
