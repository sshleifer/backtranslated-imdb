La Maman et la Putain is to be seen as a film that is connected with the time when it was released (post-68) and eternal in many respects. It's true that the actors "do not" ... True, they talk a lot ... But what he's talking about is what makes life worth living ... or dies. The very long monologue spoken by François Lebrun is perhaps the most accurate and fastest text ever written about femininity, masculinity, and love. It's not easy to translate exactly. This film is a statement about the difficulty being man and woman (or two women in this case). And IMHO, Jean Pierre Léaud is one of the greatest French actors.
