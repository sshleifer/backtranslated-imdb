I really enjoyed the details that went into the script. Jonathan Rhys Myers (badly written) and Jewel were excellent in their supporting roles. Just like Jeffery Wright. Toby McGuire gave a great acting work, as he had ever been described, when he had to amputate his best friend's arm because he knew he would die without a procedure. <br /> <br /> Watch out for detail, with good coaching dialects to capture the incredibly great Southern accent. <br /> <br /> Why was this movie swept under the carpet promoters from Hollywood, which I can only imagine. I have a strong suspicion. That's what I like so much about. I gave a dozen DVD copies for gifts. <br /> <br /> A completely overlooked film. Rent her or buy her and pay her full attention for a few hours, then judge.
