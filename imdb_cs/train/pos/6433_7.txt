Several posters cite Renoir expressing the desire to make a film showing that Ingrid Bergman is smiling at the camera. The short answer is if we were all, while the hard reality is that only a few of them have been made. At this stage of her career, Bergman could not be arrested; she left Hollywood in 1949 to create a painting in Europe, fell for the director Robert Rossellini and never waited. After five turkeys in Italy, she was probably ready to open a vein, but within a year, after doing it for Renoir, she was back to where she belonged, and Oscar, who set out for Anastasia. This is one of the three films that Renoir has done at this time, and in balance is better than The Golden Coach, which is not hard, and even with French Can Can. Renoir probably came up with the fact that with such a big ride Bergman could get away with a couple of male leading men and Renoir chose in both cases two turtles in Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer, both mahogany. The plot is actually based on a real incident in French history, but Renoir is pleased to once again attract him once again and to concentrate on replicating his father's paintings after setting up. In her pastel colors she reminds another Les Grandes Manouvres movie, which is not a bad thing. Overall, it remains a pleasant little thing that represents a beautiful and charismatic actress.
