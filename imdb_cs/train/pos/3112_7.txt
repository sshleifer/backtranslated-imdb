I was looking at Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy on a DVD before I saw it in the theater. I've been waiting for it since they started filming. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Small Spoilers Below <br /> <br /> Overall, it was good, but there was also a lack of continuity of the first two. Identity and superiority flowed smoothly between adrenaline rush and introspective. This movie was sometimes shattered. The state of the ground was rather depleted. This made the event feel too frenetic. Camera: When talking about frenetic, the Greengrass trademark was a little annoying to me. I know she was talking about her / he was screaming for nausea on the message, but that does not mean it's not relevant. All of the martial arts exercises that the actors went through were absolutely useless. The funeral camera cuts and rotates the cameras to destroy most of the fighting in the movie. It's a cheap trick of students to make the movie feel unsteady. I would expect these techniques to be used in some horror that is going on for high school children, but not in this classic, adult, action series. Too many extreme close up too. Do some framing. Get interesting shots. The constant detail feels like a lazy direction to me. Story: The story was very unclear at first. They will pull out new names and faces out of the way. It made me feel like you get when you come late and find out that you have missed some vital information. Sailing has been submerged or compressed for time reasons. After exhaustion, the story is quite good. It's nice to do with Bourne. However, I did not care about the last scene of Superiority (Landy / Bourne on the phone), which is in the middle of Ultimatum. Basically it makes the film half-prequel. I thought it was uncomfortable. Cast / Characters: The movie star is action. Obviously, there are only two originals remaining. Bourne and Nicky Parsons. Their joining was a little strange to me. I think they just wanted to give Bourne someone to protect and trust him. If something is not gone, they will never tell you why they have come together. The other murderers in the movie were quite quiet. This felt like Gilroy / Greengrass / who does not want to leave open ends. Explanation, but disappointment. Seriously, Damon with Clive Owen in identity and Marton Csokas in supremacy .. These scenes were phenomenal. These murderers are just as unattractive as Castel (the first fighter Bourne fights with identity). Casting generally worsened as the series continued. Clive Owen was practically an idea. This is the power for the first cast. The other, basically dealing with Chris Cooper for Joan Allen ... It's not exactly the same. This one deals with Brian Cox and Frank Potente to be named after three actors. Nothing against David Strathair, Scott Glenn or Albert Finney, but they are not the first names that came to my mind. In addition to a couple of breaks that seemed long, acting took place directly. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was successful. They felt like they wanted to get a series with it though. If they had cut or regroup slower parts, scrapped Scott Glenn's part completely, zoomed out and removed the camera from a seizure victim, it would be perfect. <br /> <br /> FINAL SPOILER <br /> <br /> I do not see why Bourne leaves at the end. In my opinion, that was the conclusion. They clearly referred to the very beginning of the series and its silhouette moved motionless. I thought it would be. Round end type. I liked Nicky to respond to the report though. <br /> <br /> SPOILER specifies a warning - QUOTE from the movie below - <br /> <br /> Bourne the last line at the end of "Look at it .. Look at what they give you." quoted the first killer who killed, I loved it. The last scene was great. (Except that it was Vosen {Strathairn} who fired at Bourne, why would he do it just for revenge? If he was angry enough to kill it, then why not include Pamela Landy after faxing his most secret file ? make sense.)
