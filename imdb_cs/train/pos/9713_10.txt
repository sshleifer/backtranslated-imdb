This series was premiered on Comedy Central cable television in the United States. He was cut to death and showed himself out of the way. It was sad for the audience to attract, it did not go down and fell on the road. Fortunately, at that time my cable companies went digital and got the BBC. Thank you for the good because I saw the League of Lords okay, complete and unclear. <br /> <br /> "The League of Gentlemen" is here with English "Monty Python's Flying Circus" and Canada "The Children in the Hall". But ..... warning. <br /> <br /> The League of Lords is one step further. It's not just about dressing and lighting up cultural disorder, it's deeper and much, much darker. I will tell you now many of you - it will offend certain groups of people, it will upset others. But do not forget, his only comedy ... a gift, a dark comedy. If it's not your thing, do not look. If you think you know a dark comedy, watch it - if you get angry and angry then you do not know DARK COMEDY completely. <br /> <br /> These guys did it right and right on the button. They are great, they are great and I enjoyed every character. There is a complete story that is explained here from episode one to the end. You can not watch this one episode at one time, love nilly, that's one of the spells of this series. Watch it in order. See how these guys are creative and stylish and deeply disturbed. Nobody and nothing is out of bounds. That, dear, is a "dark humor." Bravo!
