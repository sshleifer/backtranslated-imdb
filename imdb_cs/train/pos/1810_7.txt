I understand why some people like this movie and why not some people. But for me, I like it, even though I noticed some good bits and not such impressive bits. The animation was truly superb, like the Charlie Dream. The figures were mixed bags, preferably Anne-Marie, expressed by late Judith Barsi (I was physically ill when I read what happened to her). Carface is also a very convincing villain, especially the wonderful Vic Tayback (I especially loved "Morony I Am Surrounded by Morony") and together with Rasputin and Warren T. Rat is probably the most memorable of all the dwarves Don Bluth. Charlie and Heart just missed the same spark, but I loved King Gator and his song. Some of the movies are very scary, like Annabelle's "You Can Never Return", which still scares me. Unfortunately, there were some bits I did not like. The story tended to become clumsy and blurred, but Disney's Black Cauldron suffered the same problem. There were also some dark scenes that would find the young children upset but the end was very violent. The biggest flaw was, however, the rather faint songs and the way they were sung. None of them will perform separately, except "Let's Make Music Together" and "Love Survives," and Burt Reynolds can not sing and Dom DeLuise has made much better singing. Overall, an observable film that could be more, but certainly unforgettable, I would definitely watch it again. 7/10. Bethany Cox
