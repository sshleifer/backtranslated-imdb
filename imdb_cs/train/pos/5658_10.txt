This is one of the best concerts on TV. Full of secrets and intrigues and twists and turns. Obscene viewing. I was lucky to see it in the UK. They could have a mistake in ordering the episode, I can not remember, but at least at regular intervals every week. My girlfriend and I have joined a trailer and neither of us is a big fan of American serials. <br /> <br /> After the pilot we knew this was something special. We missed a few episodes, and it disappointed you and was crazy for a whole week when these bows are missing. <br /> <br /> Great casting, great acting. Gary Cole was absolutely brilliant, better than his role Custer. Lucas Black has embarked on a wonderful performance for somebody, and Paige Turco has since gotten from Five Fifth. And Nick Searcy, of course, like the sheriff of a long-suffering assistant. Yes, there were some confusing and confused bits that I think would be explained later, and no doubt it would be in a later series. It ended up weak and you could say they killed him. We did it, CO? Why did they do it with one of the best concerts at all? Shoot the exec.
