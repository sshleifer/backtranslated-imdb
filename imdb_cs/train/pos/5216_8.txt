Erroll works for the Ministry of Public Security and his job is to control sexual offenders. Sometimes he moves his line to his job and beats sexual offenders. I do not blame him, but his boss is ready to retire, and so comes Allison. Erroll is training her now to do her job, and it's like shading work. Allison is somewhat naive at first, but he does not realize how much danger he really is, and it's all Errol's fault. He starts to go far with his obsession to find the missing girl when his job is not to be a policeman. It's a pretty decent movie about a crazy guy who pushes the border and works out of his "range of practice." Erroll did a good job, but for the safety of Allison. It has some good secrets, and just when I did it, it was more.
