I was really excited to see this movie. I thought that finally Australia made a good movie, but I was wrong. It was the most pathetic attempt to film slasher. I'm sorry that Molly Ringwald had to come all the way to Australia to shoot a terrible movie. The acting was terrible (especially that the Australian man who was trying to speak with the American accent), and the conspiracy was also bad. When I first heard about the movie, I thought the title was pathetic (because it sounds like the Stab movie in Scream 2), but I was willing to let it slip if it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> WARNING !!! MAIN SPOILS !!! <br /> <br /> Probably the worst thing in the movie is the end. I was expecting a great surprise about who was a killer ... but the killer was not even human ... who changed this realistic picture to horror film horror. I do not see this movie. you will probably be disappointed!
