The Dirty Harry series began with a very frantic cop of the action, and was almost instantly relieved of "Magnum Force". At a time when "The Enforcer" rolled, Dirty Harry was no more than a television police show (only saved by Tyne Daly). After seven years Dirty Harry finally returned to the roots. Maybe he's been gone for too long. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood is Harry's first well-directed film since the first Don Siegel, who helped extensively. Harry is again a darker figure, not the nice cop that he has become. He can say things like "Go on, do your day" and it really means. "Sudden Impact" is a real sequel to Dirty Harry. "Enforcer" should never be made. <br /> <br /> 7.2 of 10
