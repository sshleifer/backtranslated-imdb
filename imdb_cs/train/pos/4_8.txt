FUTZ is the only show preserved from the experimental theater movement in New York in the 1960s (origin of Off Off Broadway). Though it's not for everyone, it's a really great, funny, deeply disturbing story of love, sex, personal freedom and vengeance, a serious story of morals that is even more important at a time when Congress wants to ban homosexual marriages by we will liquidate our Institute. The story is not about being a homosexual, but about love and sex that are not in accordance with social norms and therefore must be eliminated by violence and hatred. On the surface, it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but like a big fable, it's not about animals, it's something bigger - America's shameful coincidence. <br /> <br /> The scenic version received an international award in its original production, a tour of the USA and Europe and along with others of its kind influenced almost all the theaters that appeared after it. Fortunately, we have kept the show almost as originally conceived, with original cast and original director Tom O'Haren (who also directed HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway). <br /> <br /> This is not an aggressive, restless, famous, deeply emotional, wildly imaginative piece of story that I will never forget. And that could change the way you see the world ...
