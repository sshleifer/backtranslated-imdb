How can audience ratings for this movie be only 5.4? Only the beautiful young Alisan Porter should automatically begin when you decide on the rating. James Belushi is also good at this first serious serious role, I did not like anything other than Last Night until that. He was very good at the Tupac gang. Kelly Lynch, you have to love her. Okay, I think. I just wonder what happened to Miss Porter? I gave Curly Sue 7
