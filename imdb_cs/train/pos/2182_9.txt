This excellent film draws on a variety of talented actors and musicians at the top of their form - Levant, Crosby, Martin, Rathbone, Manone are all at home in a story that Billy Wilder has probably delivered. One would like to know more about how much he has to do with it because it is an exceptionally clever variation of the sterile masterful / fertile business story - almost an allegory of the entertainment industry led by desiccated numskulls, but made by living artistic art and the play used by subclass nobodies and non- WASP. Looking at the last six decades of music, television and film in the US, it's hard not to see the basic insights of this film as prophetic.
