The first Australian film with the main stripe hit the screen with a bang. And stabbing. And slice. And a scream or two. And lots of blood, ghosts, red herons, and lots of laughter. In fact, there's a lot of first Cut around - it's the first scenario of Dave Warner to be produced, though he has several others either in or out; it is the first major film of the director and former Hoodoo Guru Kimble Rendall; and it's also the first film for producer Martin Fabinyi. And for a bunch of boys who first fiddled into this genre, they certainly know their stuff. Cut tells the story of many students of Australian films who hear about Slasher, Hot Blooded, it was never done because her actor, Hilary (Kylie Minogue), was killed by actor playing a psychoactive killer. In spite of his lecturer (who was assistant director Hilary died at night), he warns that anytime someone attempts to run Hot Blooded again somebody dies, director Raffy (Jessica Napier) and producer Hester (Sarah Kants) decide to continue and finish the film. They put together the crew and managed to get to the original star, Vanessa Turnbill (Molly Ringwald), to return to Australia - in fact to the original place - to complete Hot Blooded? 14 years after filming. <br /> <br /> Of course it's a movie slasher, a lot of bleeding follows? long with lots of laughter, some good burns and a swinging Aussie soundtrack. Cut shows that Australia can make a good horror movie on the mass market as well as Hollywood. It's a finely-crafted scene with great special effects, a tight plot, and a murderer - Scarman - a welcome addition to the ranks of Michael, Jason and Freddy.
