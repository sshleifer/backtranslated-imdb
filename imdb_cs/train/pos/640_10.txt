I and my sister saw the premiere last night ... it was so good that we were stuck to the whole thing .. hahaha .. I think I'm addicted to the season !! .... have some really good actors in this thing .. the guy of the main coach and the player who likes pete was very good and the plot already got me but I really do not understand how it will keep it stretched throughout the season .. there will probably be some big twist tho..i cant wait until Tuesday .. eventually Jeremy sompter who is he? I can say it will be big! he was so good that we fell in love with his character right now .. cant wait for the next episode .. GO Jeremy! <br /> <br /> Aimee
