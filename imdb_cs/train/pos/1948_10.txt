That's a great end of the show. The fact that Adm. Janeway was able to make a double switch on Borgo, he was great. The fact that she allowed herself to be infected and thus infected the queen's "poison" that had essentially ended the Borg was great. The way they ended has also left some, not a lot, for a movie that has gathered. However, they brought them "home" and the way it was fantastic! It was sad to say that part of my family. Terminating it with Tom and B'Lanna have their child just as they enter Quad Alpha. was a great way to show a new start. It would be nice to have a reunion movie - just to see where their characters will be today.
