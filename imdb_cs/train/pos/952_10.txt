So it was just 7.6 for the TV movie score on this site? Bah! Humbug! Undoubtedly, this classic story of the 1984 Dickens is the best ever. And yes, Hound saw the 1951 version, which was also good, but it was not good enough. The lack of color is perhaps the biggest deficiency of this version, although the acting was great. George C. Scott is simply incredible as Ebenezer Scrooge. We all know the story of this tricky merchant who is horribly persecuted by the spirit of his dead partner and then by the other three spirits later in the evening. Scott is just as cruel as Scrooge. Too incongruous in fact for some critics who claim to be unable to reflect the newly found joy that wakes up on Christmas morning after the ghosts teach him a valuable lesson. But hey, this is George C. Scott. She will never dance in the street. He has too much dignity and his Scrooge shows his emotions in a realistic way. Supporting performances are as excellent as costumes, music and scenery. The 19th century London is revived in the visionary style of Clive Donner. The film even borders on frightening in several scenes that include the spirit. However, the important story of morality fuses in each picture. <br /> <br /> You will not be playing this version already on TV, and that's disappointing. In 1984, the Christmas card should be a compulsory part of the holidays for every household. When the decorations from the basement go off, this movie should be accessed at least once during the season. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
