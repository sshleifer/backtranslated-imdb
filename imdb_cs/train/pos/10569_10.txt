Clever, jolly, funny, fast, sexy, extravagant, dirty, erotic, hearty and angry, Footlight Parade is first class entertainment for what movies are. Realistic, satirical treatments give the material new material and its pace and line delivery are breathtaking. If you want to think that 7 years ago they started to make fictitious photos! The clarity of the dialogue can not be found today, especially given the fact that "realism" has taken over and attracted contemporary cinematography. This movie originated at a time when content restricting the content of Hayes' code was ignored. the result is a fresh, self-referential, critical and lively cinema that spoke directly to contemporary listeners who suffered from depression and the general anxiety of their lives. I recommend watching any movie from this period, that is, from 1930-1935, to see what can be a popular cinema.
