I was expecting this movie to be in Canada for a while, and when it finally did, I was very excited to see it. I really enjoyed it. Of course, at first it's a very sad movie (and it was New Year - it's even more sad) - however, it sticks to you. The next day, I thought about it again, because even if it turns around something so emotionally exhausting, after a few days you realize it's such a beautiful story. How can one person be considered a reference to so many people, but sometimes you can be blinded so many things. And how Dian Keaton's character saves the rest by being there. And how to save her in the process. It was such a great movie and Chris Pine (one of my favorite actors) provides the perfect comic relief. This is definitely a movie that will need a tissue box, but it will really stay with you for a long time.
