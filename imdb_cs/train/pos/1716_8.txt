Abhay Deol meets the attractive Soha Ali Khan and says "Hello sister"! It sets the tone for a remarkable debut film by Shivam Naira. Soha, a middle-class girl, escaped from her home in Nainital and came to Delhi to marry her lover, Shayan Munshi. But Shyan does not seem to make Soha stop by heart and alone in the great bad world. . Abhay, the lower class cottage will protect against the vulnerable Sohu and help her get a job and a shelter in the old home. Sophomore slowly develops, and Soha agrees to take Abhay. Then Shyan re-enters Soha's life. A sensitively created film with a very unusual story, graciously shot in Delhi, revolves around fine Soha. This well-created film has moments that forever remain etched in memory? a bad first kiss and Abhay's quick apology; Abhay describes Soha as a "wali ladki class" and adds "not loving her"; his donation to Churidar Soha and ask her for a date. <br /> <br /> Music is good and the background music is excellent. In the scene where Soha is rushing and hugging Abhay, the soundtrack disappears. Silence expresses both the affliction and the tenderness of the relationship. <br /> <br /> The horrible end is caused by a bitter sweet film, whose memories will last for a long time. <br /> <br /> I have to see that I rate 8.5 / 10
