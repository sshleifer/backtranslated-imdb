The first time I saw this episode seemed like a shock, it was the first time I saw "24". The speed that's going on is amazing and it's so surprising, exciting and even interesting, it's almost like reading a book; Once you run them, it's very hard to stop. From the moment Richard Walsh spoke privately with Jack about having a mole at CTU, I was sitting at 6:40 pm, which means 10 episodes !!! (It sounds funny and crazy, but I'm such a guy who, if interested, can not stop) This series is one of the best. And it is built to have several different stories that are joined together. We recommend everyone!
