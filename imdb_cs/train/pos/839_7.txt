Think of Pierce Brosnan and think he is a decent, dapper, intelligent James Bond. In this film Brosnan plays against the type - and it does a lot of fun (just like the audience). This is a movie about a hired killer who is engaged with a harried merchant ... and it works! It's a fun movie with very good scenes (riveting Brosnan to reach good, compatible "off" -the-edge Kinnear has some good lines). My only hole is that Hope Davis plays a woman who is so tolerant ("Can I see your weapon?") It does not appear more often: it could be an amazing foil for these men. /> This movie is like a matador: playing with an audience while "going to kill". The end is awesome because a story (with positive morality!) Appears: It's a frenetic, frantic and funny movie that deserves a wide audience.
