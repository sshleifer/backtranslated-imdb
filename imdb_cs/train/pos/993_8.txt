In fact, this movie was not that bad. Includes action, comedy and excitement. There are good actors in this film, such as Doug Hutchison (Percy of "The Green Mile") starring Bristol. Another famous actor is Jamie Kennedy of "Scream" and "Three Kings". The main characters play Jamie Foxx as Alvin, which was quite good and fun, but the one that surprised me most was David Morse as Edgar Clenteen. He plays a different character than usual because other movies, such as The Green Mile, Indian Runner, The Negotiator or The Langoliers, play a very good guy, and in Bait, a man without emotions, it was nice to see. The only really negative factor in this film is a few pictures of the World Trade Center, which are probably a bit late in this movie. Overall, I thought it was a pretty good movie!
