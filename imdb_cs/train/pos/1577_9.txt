It seemed that von Trotta was much more satisfied with what was the balance of a personal story vs. history of events than her older film, Versprechen, Das (1995). /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To clarify two points that many people have confused: <br /> <br /> First, Lena did not sleep with Goebbels. Although it may seem implied, it was not an intention. Von Trotta told me too! (And by the way, it's a very nice lady!) <br /> <br /> Secondly, the time frame of the events was in fact historically accurate (current data is displayed in a detailed place of the memorial) and the prisoners were released as suddenly as in the movie. There is evidence that Goebbels was disturbed by doing so, and eventually planned to regain those he had liberated. Overall, I was most impressed that it was an original story of many "exaggerated" eras. It seems to be a shame that it took so long (for various reasons) that this film hit our screens. <br /> <br /> More like this, please Margarethe!
