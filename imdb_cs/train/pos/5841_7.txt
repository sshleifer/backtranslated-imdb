The story of peace lovers and city dwellers who fought for soil, water, law and order, and respect and the ultimate conquest of long-lived cattle interests and their hired weapons, had made good in previous (Shane) and possibly later films. There are several good action scenes, and the general story layout, except for disappointment, is well done. Law, order, and religion have established roots in the city, but the old order of cattle, cowboys and guns is still in the neighborhood. The confrontation of these two takes place in a nice ambushed scene, where the burghers go directly into the trap. Granger, a former shooting range, plays a guy who avoids the cities themselves who need his gun experience.
