Father and son communicate very little. In fact, they speak different languages. Either way, when the son moves his father about 3,000 miles to the Mekka pilgrimage, interviews are finally taking place. they are difficult and growth is necessary in both parts. This film takes us into the heart of these two passengers and it's really a great cruise for both the audience and the two main. The paintings are impressive, especially the final scenes in Mecca. It emphasizes for me once again how much the world can be, but at the same time alike. The same goes for the father and son in this movie. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. Tell your friends to meet them. You will be glad you did.
