I recently rented the animated version of the Lord of the Rings on the video after seeing FANTASTICK 2001 a live version of the movie. Lord of the Rings live action trilogy directed by Peter Jackson will undoubtedly be much better than the trilogy Star Wars "predecessor" George Lucas (Episode 1-3) will ever be like a true fantasy film series of the 21st century! > <br /> I remember seeing the animated version as a child and I did not know the depth of the movie at that time. Now that I read books, I understand what the whole story is all about. Surely, some of the characters are pretty stupid, (Samwise Gangee is particularly uncomfortable, almost like Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode One, but I have to say, and go to part two of the book Two Towers. The good thing is that the action is a bit Interesting and some of the animations are quite remarkable that it's time. The bad things are that they end up incredibly in the middle of Two Towers without any result of Frod's efforts to destroy one ring and the animation looks pretty late compared to today's standards. / /> Overall, it's not as bad as many people say, but the version of 2001 is a new feature of the Lord of the Rings! At least Ralph Bakshi took the script seriously! "Peter Jackson said his animated version inspired him to read books, by creating one of the greatest fantasy series ever shot in the movie, so we can at least thank Ralph Bakshi for the thing! the animated version of the Lord of the Rings through the live version of Harry Potter every day! 7 from 1-10 scale, far less violent than the 2001 live action version, but HERE so close! For book lovers and film versions of Lord of the Rings.
