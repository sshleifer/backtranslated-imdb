I started this film after reading that it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift that the company created as a monster. Just say that I was expecting something completely different from what I got. But it was a surprise. My friend and I thought the movie was very romantic (the fact that the male lead is not bad to look at certainly helped), and there was enough conspiracy, action and even humor (that takes up to part 3 a movie that was now called each other laughing laughing) to entertain you and invest in the story. So, shortly: Not what I expected, but really a very good surprise. I will definitely buy this movie when it comes out on DVD.
