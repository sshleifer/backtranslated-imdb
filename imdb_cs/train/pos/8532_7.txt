Lupine goes to Morocco and seeks a legendary treasure. His only trace is an interesting gem that the old man gave him. It's a nice place for Lupine, the desert and the warm exotic atmosphere. One interesting thing about this film is that Jigen has a much smaller role than usual, generally located in a different location than Lupine. On the one hand, their classical dynamics are omitted, but it is a change in tempo. Besides, Lupine can concentrate on ladies ... Fujiko in this rule. Throughout the entire function, Lupine and our audience will lead us. Then is Lara, the girl of this story, and she is pretty decent. This one has more nudes than any other Lupine anime, which is funny. <br /> <br /> It is a very entertaining female ninja who is the best villain in this affair and naturally has some great fighting with Goemon as well as some fun scenes with Fujiko. Inspector Zenigata, of course, is also on a war lane, in fine form. <br /> <br /> Well, that's a smooth ride with Lupine. The plot is average and there are some slow spots, but everything in the movie is a real pleasure. Enjoy.
