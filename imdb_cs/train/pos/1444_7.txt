*** SPOILERS *** When the Brooklyn North Det. Eddie Santos, Nestor Serrano, was supposed to meet a drug dealer named Zapate Larry Romano in Brooklyn, Williamsburg, for a buying and busting operation when Tito was the one who got into the hand that it was happening to Diet. Santos and Tito ended by shooting and killing each other. The innocent observer of six-year-old James Bone Jr., Jaliyl Lynn, was also killed during the deadly shootout. In New York, in the summer, to host the Democratic Presidential Convention in the summer, the last thing the city-mighty Pappas mayor, Al Pacino, wanted was a rebellion over James Bones's young tragic death, and it was later decided that it was a bullet from Tit's weapon , who killed young James, a member of the New York City Police Department. What was most shocking, even Bone's death, was that his killer Tito Zapatti was given the well-respected NY Walter Stern State Prosecutor Martin Landau. When he was to be held behind bars for 10 to 20 years by being arrested with cocaine in the back seat of his car! Soon, it turned out that the person who received Stern's job for $ 50,000 was no other political chief Brooklyn Frank Anselm, Danny Aielle. It is Anselmo who, with Mayor Pappas, participated in the land agreement that the New York Subway System, which would bring tens of millions of dollars to him and his real estate friends in the next two years! It will also indirectly involve Mayor Pappas in killing bones by associating him with Judge Stern, who has allowed Tito to be free, who is a common friend of both himself and his Gomba or Landsman Frank Anselmo! <br /> </ b> Let it all out of blowing late Det. Santon is framed while working secretly without authority from his superiors in bone-fired shooting. In fact, these Santos fractionists go so far, hiding $ 40,000 in cash in the summer home, which seems to have been paid for by Uncle Mafia's chief Paul Zapatti, Anthony Francois, because he let his nephew deal with drugs and got a piece of action. Who can explain to him, like Tito, that Tito shot him when he made a payment to Santos. <br /> <br /> It has turned out to be a representative of Mayor Pappas at Kevin Calhoun, John Cusack, that he is too honest to find out who is responsible for covering Tito's criminal record, which allowed him to streets. The facts Kevin revealed led directly to Frank Anselmo, the prominent political elected mayor of Pappas, who appeared to be linked to Tito's heroic chief Uncle Paul. The slightly overcrowded "City Hall" shows how corruption can be filtered out of the big city, as well as down, everyone in the city government without them, such as Mayor Pappas, even knowing it. Mayor Pappas, the greatest sin, was that he was a friend of Brooklyn Boss Anselm, who made people work, like Judge Stern, who had been extorted by the real boss of Anselm Mafioso, Paul Zapatti. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILS *** In Williamsburg, it was only a deadly shootout that not only Tito got everything from Titova. Santos and James Bone, who were killed, but why they were allowed to be on the street to bring the very popular Mayor of New York. Mayor Pappas enjoyed much greater things, as the governor or even the president, in his future political efforts. As it turned out, his Chief Deputy Kevin Calhoun, when he saw no other way, was responsible for his disappearance. Just like the mayor of a good friend Frank Anselm, and the person he helped build on the bench as a judge of the state, Judge Stern. Who decided to let Tito Zapatti release the entire disaster, which resulted in at least half a dozen murders and one suicide, maybe!
