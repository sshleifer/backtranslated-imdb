To Hank, you've never seen him before. Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, "The Angel of Death". He is a hitman for his replacement father John Rooney (Paul Newman) of the older Irish mob boss. Sullivan's young son (Tyler Hoechlin) testifies to what his father is doing, and they are soon on their way for seven weeks, robbing banks to avenge the murder of Sullivan's wife and another son. Enter Jude Law as a reporter / photographer, willing to kill Sullivan herself for the chance to add dead mafia photographs to her collection. He made a beautiful drama of life in the 1930s. Sometimes the tempo falls down, but the story brings a blast of graphic violence. Sam Mendes directs this powerful drama on loyalty, responsibility, betrayal, and custody of the secret man and his young son. Other prominent personalities include Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Hanks again appears to be excellent in a very unforgettable film. Make room for some Oscars!
