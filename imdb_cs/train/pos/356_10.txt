It turned out to be an elegant production with what had to be a low budget. The variety of characters is incredible, from dwarves with axes to shoots of 7 feet! I enjoyed the relationship between people, not too sentimental, but so romantic to keep my interest. I also enjoyed a mix of humor (which can easily get wrong, too / insufficient), which means it was not too dark or too fraudulent. It was a big step from the other efforts of Eaves, Hellbreeder and Sanatarium in terms of storyline and production. They have great websites that are worth it. You can not wait for Bane, if the level of improvement continues, it should be fantastic.
