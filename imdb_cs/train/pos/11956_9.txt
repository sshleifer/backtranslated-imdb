I would even say some shades of Hitchcock ... it's clearly better than MMM, which is to blame for some, if not most, Woody fans. By the way, do you know that Annie Hall was first conceived as the secret of murder? In any case, Woody gains some importance in this film scene in a film comedy. The plot is beautiful and nice. I will say that in the first 20 minutes some actors are a bit frightened in delivering their lines, but stick around. Scarlett Johansson will perform well in the role of Diane Keaton, and in no time is an awkward moment between her and the much older Woody. No one could imagine the perfect actor for Peter Lyman's role than Jackman.
