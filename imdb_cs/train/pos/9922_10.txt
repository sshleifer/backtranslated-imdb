This is the latest addition to the new wave of educational documents such as "The Corporation" and "Fahrenheit 9/11". Her commentary is clear and unwavering as well as the breathtaking film style of this well-designed feature. The film can strengthen the strong feeling of how unsettled our world is when we are immersed in an environmentally unsustainable future with lightning speed - and at the same time show us the terrific beauty in our drive for progress. <br /> <br /> Really remarkable success, which must be seen by everyone who cares about the world we leave to children. Bravo! - this is also the only film (at age 8) in the Varsity Theaters (Toronto), which boasts a sticker that reads ... "To organize a group tour, please ..." ... further proof of popularity and importance of this jewel. <br /> <br /> My bet ... nominating the Academy for the Best Document. <br /> <br /> OB101
