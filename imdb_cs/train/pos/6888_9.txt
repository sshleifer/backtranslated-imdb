I watch movies on living, I choose which ones are good enough to be dealt with ... Throw away those that do not cut. I'm not saying more about this vision than anybody else, I just get you to the way I came to watch the "Evangelium Lou" ... Anyway ... So many bad movies land on the table and actually I'm all sitting. Actually, I'm not actually looking at it, usually watching TV at times while I'm working on a scan of production value, performance, and how the story is presented. If something catches my eye, I'll have time to watch it. "Lou" pulled me in the first few minutes when I closed my notebook and turned my chair to the television to fully tune. Needless to say, I was fascinated throughout the film. The story is solved well, the characters are either cute or nasty (depending, of course, on the acting and directional character of the character) and they all played very well. Sometimes, when working with a camera and editing, I find myself in the opportunities of amateur mistakes, but the emotional nature of the story complicates these mistakes. I have heard other people's comments that sometimes the film has brought tears to the eyes, another time of extreme excitement ... Once I laughed and cried another and was incredibly affected by this film. Unfortunately, I could not get it because I was - as they say - a week late and a short dollar. That's how it goes sometimes ... but at least I had the pleasure of seeing this and I can not wait to see what kind of answer she gets. Good luck and great luck for you Bret Carr (if you read it), you are undoubtedly the talent you will be looking at.
