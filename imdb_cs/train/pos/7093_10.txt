With "The Twelve Monkeys" you need to pay attention, but if you do, you probably find a lot of appreciation. I know I did it. The story is interesting and deals with travel time. The virus killed many people in 1997 and a boy named Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990, he was arrested and placed in a psychiatric hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who probably has something to do with this virus. He also meets with a psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), who does not believe him in 1990. When Cole leaves the psychiatric hospital while locked and locked in the room and reappears in 1996, Kathryn begins to believe Cole's stories. br /> <br /> The film is constantly playing with time. Cole calls and leaves the report in 1996, is picked up in the future and sends "someone". For Cole, someone will appear just a few seconds after a phone call. Such things happen throughout the movie, so you have to pay attention. You might ask some questions, but because you can not have the answer yourself, it is better to agree with this movie. "Twelve monkeys work as a sci-fi, with some great pictures and a dark atmosphere, and it works like a thriller, you're not sure what's going on and helping the movie, it may have some mistakes in the story, but since it's a fictional thing, like time travel, you should accept what the film tells us and just try to look forward to. It was an easy part for me.
