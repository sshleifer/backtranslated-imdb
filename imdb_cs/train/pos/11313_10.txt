Gino Costa (Massimo Girotti) is a young and handsome drifter who arrives on the road. He meets young, beautiful and unhappy wife Giovanna Bragana (Clara Calamai) and old and fat husband Giuseppe Braganou (Juan de Landa), bar owner. With his mechanical skills he trades in food and accommodation and has a relationship with Giovanna. They both decide to kill Giuseppe and kill a car accident. The relationship between them is influenced by feelings of guilt and police investigations. This masterpiece ends in a tragic way. Noir and Luchin Visconti's neo-realistic film is excellent. This is the first time I look at this version of `The Postman Always Rings Twice '. I loved version 1946 with Lanna Turner and the 1981 version, when Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange have one of the hottest sex scenes in the history of the cinema, but this is definitely the best. My voice is ten.
