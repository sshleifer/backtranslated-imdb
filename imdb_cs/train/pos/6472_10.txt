One of the most beautiful TV drama of the last decade. Within five hours, perceptions and sympathies are constantly questioned, as it examines many aspects of modern British society. David Morrisey is as good as usual. First she encountered copper as a heavy hand in conflict with a hero, but then she turned out to be intelligent and caring when she was working on uncovering the truth. I've never seen Suran Jones before. I believe it comes from the world of TV soaps. Her performance was magnificent because she retains her humor and serenity while trying to cope with the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother. I could go on and talk about every member of the cast participating in this spectacular track, but their effort would mean little, without such an absorbing script constantly casting doubt on your assumptions about any of the characters. Programs like this reinvigorate the belief in the TV channel and at the same time makes it almost impossible to deal with most of the garbage that is increasingly carrying out broadcasting waves.
