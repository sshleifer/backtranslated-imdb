Dana Andrews is starring in this 1950 film, starring also by Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill, Karl Malden and Neville Brand. Andrews plays New York City detective Sgt. Mark Dixon, a moody policeman who was in trouble in the past for defeating the suspects. When a man is murdered in a gangster-owned gambling club, Scalise (Merrill), Dixon and his partner are going to investigate. Scalise accuses the murder of Ken Paine (Stevens), who has now left the club after fighting not only with his wife, Morgan (Tierney), but with the victim. Dixon thinks the victim has earned a lot of money and as a result men have been killed. He is about to look at Paine and does not know that a warrior has a plate in his head, knocking him down and inadvertently killing him. Now he has to cover up the murder. Like other complications, it drops to Morgan; her father (Ken Tully), who left for Paine's apartment after finding out that Paine had hit her daughter, was arrested for a crime. This is a really awesome, shining noir with good performance. Roughly nice and weathered Andrews is convincing like a tough but nervous detective who must stay a step ahead of his colleagues. The film connects with his gorgeous "Laura" cube, Gene Tierney, and looks beautiful as a model with a bad taste in men who apparently are used to being crude. He has little, he knows, he has another hand. Ken Tully does a terrific job as her father who protests against her innocence despite some evidence. Karl Malden is very tough as Dixon's boss. My only problem with this well-controlled, fast-moving and absorbing film is the end. Pure Hollywood, and when I got to Tierney, I doubt I will respond the same way. Minor criticism of the film written by Ben Hecht and director Otto Preminger. I did not find it as an inspiration like "Laura," but there are few things in this world. If you like movie noir, it's necessary.
