All I can say is the first movie this season, which got my attention. I chose it for the actors, Gere and Claire, and the story looked promising ... I just watched it and I can say - I'm overwhelmed. There are shocking scenes, the truth ... but that's what makes it more realistic. We should not run away from our reality, it is happening right now. And there are experts who try to change things and make things better and who laughed about their determination to cause. Actually, I can not feel the "Hollywood touch" in the movie ... and it does better. Both Claire and Richard have done great roles and deserved ten.
