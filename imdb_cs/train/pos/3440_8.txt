Love, Rosario Dawson, thinks she is one of the best actresses of modern times. It seems that descent is more about self-realization than about anything else. It's a consistent undertone in the movie. The dialog is flat, the characters are seemingly deliberately unclear and unilateral. The only consistency is the representation of self-consumption in attitudes and Rosario's path from reinforcement of self to the loss of reinforcement and back. <br /> <br /> That this is not a classic rape is not appropriate and that's probably why so many people do not like this movie. A standard audience of "rape" would not particularly like this movie, and maybe is it? The film asks for more questions than answers and confronts it with its target audience, whether they like it or not. There is a convincing relationship between the characters and the target audience, and while the film does not confuse the audience across the face with its own just courage, the viewer will take what may or may not be, for all the wrong reasons. <Br /> <br /> Downing is a good movie that IMHO is seriously underestimated.
