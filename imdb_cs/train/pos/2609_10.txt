I write it 9 years after I was broadcasting the last episode, and I was still crazy about the impact Wildside had on me. She effectively left where many dragon policemen left and succeeded. But it took more and it did not lose the realism of the streets, which often portrayed life events and characters up to T. <br /> <br /> I am terribly lacking in this series, instead we got the silly "Underbelly" that has evolved dramatically and created the entire load of US esquire garbage. Wildside has remained faithful to the uniqueness of Sydney and I am really indebted to this wonderful series. It was a grade A and it's a shame that only a few actors supported their careers while others lost their attention. I do not want Australia to forget this wonderful piece of TV history, so I'm going to ask ABC to release a full DVD series, not the first three. Give this series the end it deserves.
