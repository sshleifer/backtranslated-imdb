Once when I was in college and had an international fair, the Russian section had a Soviet-era poster saying "No boltay!" Which means "Do not be gossip!" I translated it as a "generation" of TV observers like "Do not be Gladys Kravitz!" (in relation to the bearer's neighbor Bewitched). But when you see the gossip result in Pvt. Snafu short "Rumors", you see, do not laugh at it. In this case, the constant ruthless soldier will hear about the bombing and immediately assume that the power forces have attacked the United States. It tells this to someone who tells someone else to tell someone else, and that goes on. Just as in the article "The Russians Come, the Russians Are Approaching," the story gets more and more disproportionate every time, so when they return to Snafu ... well, you know what I mean! Yes, it is mostly the propaganda of the Second World War - complete with a derogatory term for the Japanese - but I must say that Pvt. Snafu shorts were really quite fun. Of course, since they wrote to Dr. Seuss and Mel Blanc, they added voices, it's no surprise that it was just fine. Worth seeing.
