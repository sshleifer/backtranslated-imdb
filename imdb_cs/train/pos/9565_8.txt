Dog Dog Bite Dog will not be for everyone, but I really liked it. Even wasting, stinging and shooting (but do not worry, leadership is a terrible shot), it can best be described as a violent arrival through Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Cheng plays Pang, a Cambodian killer in the city who kills a lawyer. Despite being dirty out of his way, he is almost immediately sitting at a huge table in the middle of a seemingly expensive restaurant. If it sounds wildly unlikely, you probably would have avoided this movie. It was my story that would stop mistrust, and I enjoyed it more. Chasing Pang Down is Wai (Sam Lee), a young, nervous cop who likes to seduce people almost as much as he likes to smoke. Wai passes through the fine line being investigated by Internal Affairs, and his father, the legendary Good Police, is in a coma after a drug deal that went south (as a result of Wai's letting his father take the rap for his own corruption). <br /> <br /> There are cars, lots of murders, and the strange and unpleasant love story that's on offer here all in almost comic style. I suspect that humor was intentional (no one uses gargantuan concrete bludgeons without eyes for extravagantly absurd), although the above-average nature has lost a number of my colleagues from the listeners. There are at least three points where the movie could end up, and in 109 minutes it could benefit from more ruthless editing, or erasing one of the narrative threads (the light hearted things worked well, so I would have missed interactions with the three fathers). I am inclined to do this (high) pass, however, if only for the ending? I have rarely heard so many people laughing so loudly, what should be a good moment. This is one with a group of friends who loves laughing
