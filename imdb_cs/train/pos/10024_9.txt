There are a lot of things in Aro Tolbukhin. En la mente del asesino (in the killer's mind), it's very hard to talk about it without warning. Let's say this movie is like a cinema exercise, but really, really great done. It is made of super 8, black and white images, 35 millimeters, colors, interviews, shows. Aro Tolbukhin is a documentary film or vice versa, which the most strange aspect raises the doubts that leave you when you're wondering actually existed? The film tracks the later life of a Hungarian sailor who came to Guatemala, worked in a religious mission and then killed some people. The act for which he was imprisoned and the death penalty sentenced. The film begins because some French documentary filmmakers are interested in this character, so they talked about it before they died. Nowadays more people engage in in-depth character research. The one we're witnessing - the movie. For the major part of history, we are guided by a slow phase that can be seen inside Aro's mind, especially for decoding why he did what he did. However, it is important that creators never offer a two-way view; we have left the judiciary for all of us, and even when we understand his actions, we are clearly unaffordable. So the first half is based on information memories; later things changed into Aro's childhood and gave such incredible new strength (even hard never been weak or boring). I do not mean - and I do not want to - anything to spoil; so all you have to say is that if you happen to come to you, believe me, the trip you see is more than good.
