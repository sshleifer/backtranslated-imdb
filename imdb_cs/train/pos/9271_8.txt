That's what one of the girls said at the end. Is the football game a metaphor for a qualifying match between girls (or, broadly speaking, a free think group) and authority? "To Germany" means a future that is promising? <br /> <br /> It's one of the most unforgettable movie experiences I've ever had - despite gross cinematography and plot and mild over-acting (although I like the cast - they are nice and well above expectations for amateurs). The sad situation is well captured. I feel that deep frustration is rejected in the game (being a woman and a fan of football) and I can not stop thinking about how to make a convincing disguise. I wonder why there is no female section in which protection against dirty language and bad behavior could be provided - to defeat the wrong reasons why it denies it. The film is very cleverly created - amazing title, shooting during the game, spontaneity and various ways to get the characters striding - a game that is so important but inaccessible (not shown), attracting light and cheering from the stadium, the van, and the uselessness , when you are joining the glorifying crowds inside. I feel comfortable with radio, drinks and food, and of course, kindness and consideration from each character to the other. During the final credits, I'm amused that no character has a name - it's just a "soldier" and it's just a "girl" or a "sister".
