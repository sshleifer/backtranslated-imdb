I am interested in any film that draws a lively picture of Italy - in my opinion, the most romantic country in the world. Unfortunately, the film was somewhat short, unusually like a bit of time and a bit thin cinematographic aspect. An excellent story, however, does. The four ladies set off for a very relaxing holiday with problems in their minds. During the film, they realize their problems and start repairing them. He believes that San Salvatore, the castle in which they stay, has a charming effect on people. "It's a bath of love," says Lottie Wilkins. You can watch their gradual change from dissatisfaction with bullying, because the Italian seaside coast has a magic. <br /> <br /> All of their problems and solutions are credible. Actresses were great. Background music seemed very suitable for the romantic Italian environment. Overall, the movie for me for 10/10.
