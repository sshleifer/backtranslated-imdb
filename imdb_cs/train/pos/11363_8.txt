Imagine that you have defended the bureaucracy that one person spends eight years of life and has a mental disorder that attempts to solve mass murder virtually alone! Murder technology is clear, but the government, which did not want to admit the truth, let the monster destroy dozens of lives. When I think my work is stressful, I only remember the true story behind this amazement. Devotion to the main character was mastered by Rea. The comic (and sometimes tragic) relationship between Rea and Sutherland's character has made this one of my favorite films for the last 5 years. Catching one of the worst mass murderers in my history at the edge of my home. While it was not so much promoted and talked of as a "silent lamb", the plot was equally thrilling.
