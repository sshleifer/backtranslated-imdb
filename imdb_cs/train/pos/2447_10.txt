George Lopez has never taken my interest in his comedy, and still not. But this show is a work of art. It's never a show where jokes let you laugh every time you remember it (and jokes that remember it). This show has only an optimistic view of it and the characters range from an old, short drunk to a dyslexic teenager. I do not know who is writing this show, but the person does a great job. If they just went to the show, I'm sure the critics of this great country will get a positive response. If you are looking for a good, traditional comedy, then you are actor George Lopez! The only bad thing is the name. George Lopez? Really? Imagine that Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is "Will Smith". C'mon man! Otherwise, this show is brilliant! 10/10
