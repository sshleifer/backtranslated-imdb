This movie received a terrible rating from almost everyone who voted here but I'm here to say if you like movies like Dude Wheres my Car and Dumb and Dumber this movie is for you. If your movies like Citizen Kane and Casablanca id have to design you in a different angle. Still, I still loved this movie and everything about it, although it's a bit kiddy it's one of the few movies that me and my freinds have been able to watch over the years and quote whenever possible. GREAT MOVIE. This movie should have AFI number 1 because it's so great. The only problem with this movie is that it may happen that it will have problems because it was created for a TV channel on a channel that no longer exists. So I do not know how to get into this movie, id want to buy for a DVD, but I can not find it anywhere. It's still recorded when it was the first one, you can come if you want to watch it sleep. this movie of stones and that's all you need to know.
