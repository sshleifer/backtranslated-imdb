Darius Goes West is a film that shows American belief that everything is possible if you try hard enough. This wonderful, full-hearted and sometimes heartbreaking film shows a young man who never expected, but wanted to see what was beyond the boundaries of his beautiful city of Athens, GA. Darius wished to see the ocean. His long-time friends, Logan, Ben, and some other good friends have decided to make Darius's wish fulfilled. They started to be small - Ben & Logan's mother launched an e-mail campaign that brought Darius consciousness: Duchenne muscular dystrophy and funding for people to see Darius not just the ocean but see these great United States. To say that young colleagues managed to bring hope and awareness of this dreaded illness would be under-estimating. They realized Darius' dream and then some. They kept their lives in peace while Darius showed love, care, and lots of fun, and helped Darius see how he could show the same signs as the others who suffer from DMD. Darius continued as a volunteer in the Red Cross - sitting in his chair and collecting money (along with his friends) outside the local grocery store. His gorgeous smile tells the world that dreams come true - all you need is hope and a group of college friends who will support and care for you. Give Darius and all Oscar guys - no one else deserves it. Martha Sweeney.
