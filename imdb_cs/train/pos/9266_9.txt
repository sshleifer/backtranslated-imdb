Oh, the best and funniest film about female football fans, just a little better than the 1982 saga on a teenage maze in northern London (qv). By the way, I just watched it on film 4 [2008-12-21] and I say my inability to set up PVR. <br /> <br /> This is my second favorite movie after Mike Bassett: England Manager, but this time with an added plot that looks like a guerrilla movie from a team that apparently makes films that are banned in the country , where they are made (think of just where the girls are being taken away from the stadium, just like the Sun: quick reactions everywhere). <br /> <br /> It's rare that the movie makes me laugh out loud but when a country soldier escorted one of the girls to the benches and forced her to wear an in-tempt mask from the Ali Daei poster I could not stop wandering the others in the house with my snorts, especially when the young soldier misunderstood the grandfather's calls for help ... When I talked about toilets, I just wished I could tell Farsi so I could write writing on the walls of the toilets (yes, there were a few scribblings in the Roman scripts, but mostly referred to the wank of American rock band). Also, in the country-and-Farsi theme, do not you think Omid Djalili sounds like a jokel when speaking Farsi? Listen to the sergeant in this movie and then go "Yup". I will not touch the sexual politics of Iran and I will not be bored of dubious acting; my love for this movie comes from script and editing: top things. <br /> <br /> Here is a list of my favorite football films: 1. Mike Bassett, England Manager 2. Offside 3. These Glory Glory Days 4. Shot in Fame 5. Arsenal Stadium Mystery
