One is tempted to define the genre of Gert de Graaff as an "event of thought" by the example of Merab Mamardashvili. Nominal story is a bitter torture of Bartle Klever for this temporary substance, which forms the essence of the personality. The script of his new film is shaped simultaneously on his computer and in his own imagination. This film monologue comes from the answer to "8 Â½" Fellini and stands 13 years of work by Gert de Graaff. Exciting gaming with real and imaginary characters, as well as audiences, reveals a random link between real and imaginary, paradoxical coexistence in two different galaxies: Guttenberg and MacLhuen. For some time we are able to count a screenwriter who believes that the cause of all misfortune is the damned stereotypes of mass mental ("human," "Catholic," "washer"). And along with him we get trapped when the author-creator finally faces an insoluble dilemma: how can we exclude the future film. Bart Klever? Only five minutes before the final, thanks to the common minor remorse of the creator's wife, who is deeply immersed in the work, we realize that we were "framed" together with the main character. Indeed, what is the price of art for which it is acceptable to give up your own name and everyday care for a young daughter? So who is he, Bart Klever? Is he a brilliant prophet or someone obsessed with Frenhoffer of Balzac's masterpiece (as well as the one who writes the script in the memory of the computer all he wrote)? Gert de Graaff suggests that we will answer this question ourselves. <br /> <br />
