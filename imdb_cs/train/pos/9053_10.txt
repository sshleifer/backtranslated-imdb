1.) This movie was amazing! I saw it when I was in the city next to where it grew up! I went and saw the buildings that the story was going in. Overall, I loved this movie, one of Jake Gyllenhaal's finest! Also, my favorite piece was a scientific fair and all the time with my father. They were so sad. Homer wanted to watch his dream, and his father seemed uninterested in it. This line of the tag is true. "Sometimes a dream is clear enough to illuminate the sky." 2.) The way the film was filmed was impeccable, it was so plausible that it could have been recorded in the 1950s. The dresses were accurate and their slang down. Surely recommend this movie!
