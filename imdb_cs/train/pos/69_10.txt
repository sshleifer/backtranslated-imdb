One night I emerged from the cable channels and came into this movie about 10 minutes from the beginning - every time I even thought I was going to sleep, something kept telling me to keep watching, sleeping. <br /> <br /> This film could have been another easy opponent, but instead decided to investigate the consequences of the shooting. Better yet, the movie continued in real life - just when you think it's going to make an easy and apparently devised journey, a twist appears and changes the whole view of the movie. This film not only does not follow the formula, it shows how other events often lead to and / or affect what will happen later. I just want the filmmakers to investigate the antidepressant drug problems more - the Columnbine children they shot were on them for years and it was terrible to watch Deanna try every time they started nightmares. Until recently, they have been publishing things like candies, and they are just beginning to understand what long-term effects drugs have. It was very refreshing that the aspect of mental illness of the story got quite a bit of a film because a relative who suffers from a mental illness can say that the film was dead in every aspect of mental illness. Bravo to the director and writer who apparently did his homework on these issues. And for those who think that some things can not happen in the hospital (I do not mean some data), you are also dead in this case - I was there. The script was so real that it was amazing. <br /> <br /> Go to BUY this movie and show it to your teenage kids before it's too late. I thank you once.
