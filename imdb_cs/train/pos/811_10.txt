When I think of Jedi Return, I think, epic. Jo Ewok were there and what? They are an interesting addition to the film (not to mention that they are similar to Vietcong, who were able to take off a technologically advanced army with primitive acts). The Jedi is definitely darker than the other movies. Emperor Palpatine (introduced by stunning theater actor Ian McDiarmid) was one of the best parts of the film. Palpatine is so bad and evil, Vader looks like Mr. Rogers compared to him. When we talk about Darth Vader, what a terrific end of such an iconic character. Vader is indeed a modern Greek tragedy, and I think that people can now understand and appreciate the Sith revenge. His redemption at the end has moved and really brings you a happy but sharpened feeling. The best part of course was special effects. It is amazing how the film of the early 1980s is still able to pass the time test with its graphics. Scenes at Jabb's Palace (Leia looks amazing in metal bikinis) and of course the epic three-way battle at the end are still amazing to look at. In all the deep deic and emotional moments of Jedi (especially between Luke Vader and Palpatine and when Luke reveals Leia the truth) and the incredible special effects is a good end for one of the most popular franchises in cinema history.
