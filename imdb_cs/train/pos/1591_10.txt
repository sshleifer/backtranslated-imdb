My mother and I have recently become addicted to this show and laughing at our ass! I only saw about 10 episodes and I'm disappointed that I did not pay attention to this funny series before they were canceled! The story is very fun, the characters really have great personalities (or not so great, but they are still fun!). I TIVE every episode of what I like. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, like all the cast, will never leave me bored when watching! There is some inappropriate language for children and some sexual content, but with a parent guide nearby you should not have too many problems. There is some sort of friendly kind of relationship that attracts me to this show. I really enjoyed it.
