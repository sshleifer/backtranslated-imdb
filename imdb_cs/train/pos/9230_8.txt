You can say so much about this movie. This is not your typical nesting. Naturally, it's nudity and sex with nuns, but that's almost a random story. It is located in Italy from the 15th century, during the martyrdom of 800 Christians in Otranto. The battle between Muslims and Christians is a good part of the film. It was interesting when everyone ran from the Muslim heaps that the superior would ask, "Why are you afraid of Muslims not doing anything the Christians did to you?" Of course there was a lot of torture on both sides. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) is sent to a monastery for the slander of her father. Throughout this process, she testifies and sustains many things: the stallion's gelding, the rape of the local woman by the new Duke, the torture of a nun who was overcome during a visit to the Taranto sect and whipping when she fled a Jew. Torture was especially horrible when the brown wax was poured onto a nun and its nipples were cut off. Sister Flavius ​​must continue to be in trouble when he questions the male society he lives in. He even asks Jesus why all men are father, son, and holy spirit. Eventually, they join the Muslim leaders as their lover, and they release him. Here is where you can see more body than you can enjoy at the same time. But the tragedy is to come. She can prove a sweet vengeance to all, including the Duke and her father, but she finds out that the merciful Muslim treats her exactly the same. She's a woman, and that's all there is to it. I will not describe what the holy men of the Church have done to this hero at the end, but precede the torture of the Saw or the Hostel of Decades. <br /> <br /> Fans of Nunploitation will be delighted with delicacies, but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to spend.
