Although it was unlucky to hit the festival circuit here in Austin (SXSW Film), just as we were tired of things like Shakespeare in Love, and Elizabeth, this film deserves the audience. The inside view of the performance "Scottish Play" as actors called "Macbeth" in its production to avoid the curse is a sharp, efficient and stylish way to cope with the betrayal it plays. With a remarkably evocative result and appearance and sound much better than his small budget suggests, it's a quiet gem, not a world-wide but completely satisfying.
