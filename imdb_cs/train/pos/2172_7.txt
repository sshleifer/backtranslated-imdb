"Mad Dog" Earle is back, along with his sad moth Mary, and the tiny Velma hat. There are also Babe and Red, Doc and Big Mac, and even scenery-chewing Pard. The only missing thing is a good reason to reappear Raoul Walsh's High Sierra 14 years later without reconsidering the line or frame and doing it with the idea that we saw one or two ladders in the repertoire. (Instead of Walsha we get Stuart Heisler, we get Jack Palance, Ida Lupino Shelley Winters for Humphreya Bogarta, and so on.) The only change is that this time instead of black and white it's in Warnercolor; sadly, there are those who would improve this counting. <br /> <br /> I died a thousand times, may be useless? and lower? but at least it is not a transvestite; the story is still working on its own dubious conditions. Earle (Palance), fresh from a pen near Chicago, drives west to do a great job that was conceived by the crippling king Lon Chaney, Jr.? knocking across the mountains mountain resort. On the way, he almost collides with the Oakies family when he is killed with a granddaughter; death is worth, even if it finds it a lamela. When he arrives in the cabin where the rest of the gang opens, he finds amateur hotheads on his neck, just like Winters, who throws him (like pooh). Recharging time until he can hear the call from his inner man at the hotel, Palance (to winter disappointment) offers to pay for an operation that heals the girl's deformity, a gesture that gets worse. Then the surgical strike against the department turns into bloodshed. Palance moves up into the cool Sierra .... It's a pleasant story, competently executed, which lacks Walsh's distinctiveness, and his cast brought about in 1941, the year of Bogie, with this role, and Sam Spade in Maltese Falcon became a star. And one last heretic comment: You mountains look beautiful. <br /> <br />
