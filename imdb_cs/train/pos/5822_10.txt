Three Stoogs are always some of the many actors I loved. I like almost every one of the shorts that they did. I love all six Stoogs (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are fun and also the star of many other great actors and actresses, many of them in many short shorts! In my opinion, the Three Stoogs are some of the greatest actors ever and it's always the most fun comedy team! <br /> <br /> This is a good three Stooges short. It's funny and her cast includes Christine McIntyre, Symona Boniface, Gino Corrado, Fred Kelsey, Sam Flint, Chester Conklin, Theodore Lorch, Lynton Brent, Judy Malcolm, Vernon Dent, John Tyrrell, Heinie Conklin and Bess Flowers. Stooges played very well in this short version! I recommend this!
