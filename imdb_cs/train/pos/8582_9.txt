Love the characters and the story. Very funny with a lot of action. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer are doing great. I enjoyed the dynamic and comical interaction of Griffith and Career. Donald Southerland plays a very sympathetic, surprisingly sympathetic, burnt hit. All three actors are among my favorites and have them in this film made for special treatment. A nice addition to my extensive DVD collection. I highly recommend this movie. If you like ... Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Replacement Killers, L.A. Confidential, The Long Kiss Goodnight, The Abyss and The Whole Nine Yards ... you will love this movie.
