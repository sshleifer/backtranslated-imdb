I have to admit that I am at the top, I am not a big fan of "family" movies nowadays. Most of them, IMHO, are sentimental bullshit. But this, like TOY STORY, the previous Pixar movie, is a lot of fun. The two characters may have been a bit flawed (especially when compared to two ANTZ leaders, but otherwise this movie is better), but the rest of the film has improved more than that. The animation looked great, humor, though wide, was always good (especially I liked Hopper's line "If I did not give my mother my death that I would not kill you, I would kill you!") And the actors doing voices, except for two leaders, were all amazing (Denis Leary makes an animated film, what a concept). And just like everyone else, I loved the outputs! I hope the video has new ones.
