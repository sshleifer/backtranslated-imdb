I just saw the movie two days ago and I was filled with the expectation that Paris is my second favorite city in Europe, and in the eighties I spent a very romantic 18 months there. I was somewhat disappointed that most of this group of vignettes, though original and artistically finished, did not catch the "light" and beauty of the city very well. Romanticism is not enough! We did not see any trees lined by boulevards ... It was too dark, not just literally but figuratively. Some of the plots manipulated the viewer and seemed to be "flat" (the Marais sequence, the hairstyle salesperson sequence). Noble, good: the Mime sequence, the graveyard, Montmartre (though it was too much to understand the viewer), "Cowboy's" vignette and Sacre Coeur - seemed little and far, and I would like to see such a wonderful actor as Orlando Bloom be in something has demonstrated its originality more.
