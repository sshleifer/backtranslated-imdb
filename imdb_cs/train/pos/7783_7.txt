A young girl who has survived as a prostitute. <br /> <br /> The cheap cheater who wants to get a big score. <br /> <br /> In Thailand they meet. You may think, according to the opening titles, that this is a violent film, but it is also a story of love with two people in their own struggle to get money for a better way of life. This movie feels like an essay sometime due to its changing images but still refreshing. This story is about Eros and Thanatos. "It's not an original joke, but it's good," says the figure, and that's also true of this: We've seen a story, but we see that. Thailand appears in hot tones, the photo comes from one color to a multicolored place. And it captures the city as a cage of these imperfect people. There is also good use of music to touch events.
