This movie was a disaster in the Box Office and the reason is the innocence of the film, the sweetness of the story. The music was good, the story is very simple and old, but the presentation of such a story is very good, the director tried the best. Abhay is excellent and impressive and re-lights in his role, doing the best in a comedy or emotional scene. Soha looks so sweet in the movie. The rest of the star cast was just fine. Music and all the songs are good, Himesh is impressive as a singer. Do not miss this movie, its a wonderful movie and a good feeling for us. Abhay the best work to this day. I'll give 9/10 Ahista Ahist.
