The animation was great and the movie was funny. The two circus mistakes, Tuck / Roll, were very fun. If you waited until the final credits, you saw a very fun sequence of the movie showing the mistakes that pretended to be doing things wrong as in other movies, it was smart because it made the characters human and credible.
