First, the only reason people behave on this film is that they can not stand a few parts of a real story that is "altered". Well, guess what? Peter Jackson's film was not a perfect release. Good. It's a very beautiful movie. The backgrounds are beautiful and taken over by the well-known Tolkine artists. The film covers about half of the trilogy (Fellowship of the Ring and until the Battle of Helms Deep in two towers) and moves at a good pace. The vote is top and most of the characters look as I imagined. Samwise is a bit too ugly for my taste, but Aragorn looks amazing. The film has a great score that fully supports the movie. If you like good fantasy stories but hate reading (books are even better) give this movie a try, remember that it was done 20 years ago. Also Special Note: Peter Jackson's Adaptation The Fellowship follows almost exactly the same direction as Ralph Bakshi (Jackson has often said how much he admired Bakshi's efforts).
