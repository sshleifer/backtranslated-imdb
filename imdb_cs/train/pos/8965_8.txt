Made in the same year as "Vertigo," it's an equally charming movie, though in a much lighter vein. It's winter in the enchanted New York City: Kim Novak is a witch that spells James Stewart but is captured instead. Interestingly, Novak's rival is played by Janice Rule, which originated from Madge in "Piknik" on Broadway (a part Novak made famous in the film).
