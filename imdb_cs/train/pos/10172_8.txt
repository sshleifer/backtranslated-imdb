Friz Freleng's 'Rumors' is an excellent cartoon of the Private Snauf, which warns against the spread of the legend that raises panic during the war. Made like all short films of Snafu to show military audience as entertaining instructional films, "Bells" are extremely imaginative and develop a ton of ideas into its very short lifetime. When Snafu launches the reputation of being bombarded, he has a rumor that America has lost the war. This is greatly illustrated by a long, rubbery baloney and some strange, fictional beings who have returned to try to make Snafu increasingly terrible about his country's army. "Rumors" are inventive, fast and fun, which help to lag behind the rather strenuous messages "Get Away". It is one of the best shorts of Private Snafu.
