This step actually jumped me out of the chair in anticipation of what the actors would do! Acting was best, Farrah should have been Oscar for being wonderful. James Russo was so good I hated him because he was a villain and he played it great. There are not many films that bored me as such. The theater was great when Alfie looked shocked by her big eyes, when Farrah looked like a victim and you had spent her again. Farrah did you feel you were there, and you felt the same anger that she felt you wanted to hurt him, yet you also knew it was a bad thing. The film was on a roller coaster and you went up and down with each scene.
