I saw this movie back at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2005, and from the 14 films I saw there I think it is my No. 3 movie. I had an initial interest in having this Swedish origins confronted with many of my ancestors from the Norrland region of Sweden where they were filmed. I also grew up in the area of ​​a rural northern forest in America, where many small towns were very similar to this film setting. It's nice to see more movies that use rural sites like settings like Så som i himmelen. It was a very good film, and I'm sure it's a very difficult film that takes place with his big cast, but director Kay Pollock really did it after the director's ten-year absence. Helen Sjoholmová in her film debut as an actress was fantastic and I could look at it on a big screen. I really liked Michael Nyqvist in this well-rounded cast. I highly recommend this movie and rate 9.0 on scale 10.
