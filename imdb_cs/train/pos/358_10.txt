Purple's color refers to struggles for life and love that help those people who are hard hit by the struggle for life. Each character had a purple element in it. The film touches on love, lost, hope, hatred and triumph. whether she is a celie who has experienced hell and lost her sister, and Shug comes to her life to show her love again. Albert was not a man who tried Celie badly, Shug slapped his father and finally admitted, her stubbornness was good and bad, and even Nettie, they had emptiness and trouble in the movie, but eventually it was overcome, and that's a sign of good film. Good work for all cast and crew.
