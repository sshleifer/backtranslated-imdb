I refused to see this movie and I understood why it was not a big hit in theaters. "October Sky" feels and looks so good. And it is. All creations and emotions have previously been explored in other films - and perhaps even better. But even though it's known and resisted all Hollywood, this movie is winning and enjoyable at every turn. <br /> <br /> Sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of heart, mind and soul. Like Steven Sondheim's musicals, MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG stood at the top of his flat roof and hoped to launch his new generation ("What do you say, you say a miracle"), Sputnik has a similar impact on the young rocket boys of this true story. While the exhausted city dwellers of the 1950s deny the event, Homer Hickham sees Sputnik as his ticket to life in the mines. The spectacular direction and casting make the way of the rocket boy Homer and his friends fresh and new. Particularly these are partial stories about Homer's slow young teacher. A remarkable barrier is shown in their sensitive relationship. Also remarkable is the father / son supblot, who docks the movie. He played perfectly all around. Even Homer's mom gets his moment without clich√© or penetration. Her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and warm. "Myrtle Beach" says everything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The biggest video string I have scorned has, besides this film, a sign that you will love this movie or return your money. I once agreed with them. You will never look at the October sky quite the same. <br /> <br />
