He is a crazy scientist who creates half the shark - half of a man of the type critter on an uncharted island, then invites all his old business and academic friends to come and see his creatures (evil laughs), but in fact he wants his Sharkman to kill them! A lot of bad GCIs, slatted fence elements, and girls who are in tight t-shirts are following. All these monster films resemble a similar pattern, but this is a bit of a boost for people who did it, they had tongues firmly in the face), not to mention sexy babes. But let's talk about the sexy babes - some hot booties, in tight t-shirts that are deeply connected. One is at the bottom of the bottom, the other at the end. Thank you, thank you to the creators of bad movies! The conspiracy is full of fucking things, the guy rides in the jeep, kills it right in the tree, and then offers that all of the island flew out of the helicopter. Yeah, well, well, how do we think about it for a while? we will return to you. Sharkman is cheerful - either a terrible CGI, or the same comical person in a rubber suit. The mad scientist gives quite good performance; it's bad, that's his motivation, he does not make a justification. All in all, if you want a stupid movie FUN B, this one should do the job.
