This is a very cool and largely well-thought-out drama. I am very impressed with the film, not only for plotting and excellent acting, but that such a unique movie was made. Most movies that include a spy or a war are full of plain Brit speakers or a mighty battle, but not this. It's not about this kind of war, about the war between man and his position in life, the American spy in Germany, who acts as a criminal of evil that no one ever forgets. When the war ends, Campell thinks he will come home as a hero, but his real heroic attitude must remain a government secret. Upon returning to America, Campell encounters Nazi supporters, as well as Nazi hatred, and provides interesting conflicts, both inside and out. Dare more than pull the role, and fit into the conspiracy quite well for what he asks.
