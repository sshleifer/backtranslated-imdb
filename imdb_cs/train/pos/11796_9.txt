It is precisely because it is based on the most notorious mass suicide incident of modern times, that this two-part film from 1980 has produced film attention. The fact, however, is that it is a wonderful recap of the life of Reverend Jim Jones, who built the church into the virtual realm, and then encouraged him to disintegrate into the dirty cult in which the congressman and his escort were murdered, and 917 followers of cults committed suicide, that Kool-Aid was smeared with cyanide. It has been very tastefully, but intimidently enough, unlike the unbearably sadistic CULT OF THE DAMNED, GUYAN TRAGEDY includes feature films including Ned Beatty (like Rep Leo Ryan), Meg Foster, Randy Quaid, Brad Dourif, Brenda Vaccaro, LeVar Burton and Madge Sinclair. But it is Powers Boothe (in his first major role), who really stands out as Jim Jones. He actually GETs the man and his performance is riveting and cooling. It is no wonder that this film is still attracting attention after more than twenty years.
