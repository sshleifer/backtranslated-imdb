Lars von Trier Europa is a dignified echo of a third person, about America's arrival in Europe after the end of World War II, and finds itself in mysterious secrets. Jean-Marc Barr plays Leopold Kessler German-American, who refused to join the US Army during the war, arrives in Frankfurt when the war ends to work with his uncle as the sleeping conductor on the Zentropa railway. What he does not know is that the war is still secretly underway with an underground terrorist group called Werewolves who are targeting American allies. Leopold is strongly against any party, but is attracted and seduced by Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), a femme fatal daughter of the owner of the railway company. Her father was a Nazi sympathizer, but he justifies US colonel Harris (Eddie Considine) because it can help re-launch the German transport system. The Colonel will soon learn, or lead Leopold to be a spy (without offering him the option or the ability to think) to see if werewolves can make attacks on trains. Soon Leopold is imprisoned in the adventure by being involved with both sides of the conflict in mysterious and film noir-ish in a way where everyone and everything is not what it seems. It's amazing to watch a naive Leopold deal with everyone (his lover, terrorists, colonel, poisoning passengers, his unhappy uncle, even railway company officials who come to investigate his working ethic) before eventually overturning humorously and violently. The film is infinitely unpredictable. The film was stylishly shot, always taking place in the winter with lots of snow. Her image is black and white and shots appear randomly. Also the background of the screen showing pictures that count with photos in advance. Add Max von Sydow's hypnotic narrative and Europe will become a dream place outside of this world. <br /> <br /> This is now my favorite personal picture.
