Stunning ... It could be a bad attempt to remake the already created Omen movie, but he certainly enjoyed it. The last man he commented on is crazy, this movie was one of the darker music, Jerry Goldsmith alone, would be applauding this movie. <br /> <br /> Great recommendation to watch or buy this movie. I collect horror films and soundtrack, So listen to what I have to say, not the other idiot. <br /> <br /> There is only one thing I do not care about, ending. <br /> <br /> According to the Prophet, everything is inaccurate, including the final conflict, and he left it. But my conclusion is .... There are great movies ... and they should be seen before the Great Depression and the Democrats fall on us. Take the presidency too. That's what he signed ... Jacob Eder ... Farmer, with a master.
