Maybe I'm too generous with the rating ... but I just love this movie! I have seen it so many times, but every time I see it, I fall in love again. It's just a romantic comedy that will not become enormous or monumental. But I'm great romantic and this movie * is * romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins and Walter Mathau are so funny. Scientists laugh so much ... I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who did not see it. It's such a clean and good movie - and you are so rare! My 20-year-old brother loves this movie, so it's not just a cat. ;-) I recommend this if you have to laugh or if you are only lonely and need to * watch * romance if you can not participate yourself. It's good 'no!
