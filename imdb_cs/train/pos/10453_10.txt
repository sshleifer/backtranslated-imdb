While traveling by train across Europe, Americans Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet together and decide to spend the night together in Austria. The next morning, Jesse returns to the United States and Celine to Paris. <br /> <br /> "Before Sunrise" is one of my favorite novels, which is really one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever seen. It's a low-budget movie with a very simple and real story, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is perfect and the dialogues are amazing. The direction is amazing, transmitting the feelings of CÃ©line and Jesse to the audience. I just passed the revision number of 1000 in IMDb and I chose this significant figure "before sunrise" because it is a very special film for me. I do not understand why this film has not been nominated for an Oscar, with such a great screenplay, direction and performances. Yesterday, I've probably watched this movie third or fourth, and I still love it. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Antes do Amanhecer" ("Before Sunrise")
