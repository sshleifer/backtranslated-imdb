I've always wanted David Duchovney to get into the film industry, and he finally did, and he made me proud. This movie survived what I had hoped for. Duchovney played his character very well, he was able to keep up with something new, instead of playing Agent Molder, which we are used to. That's why I give him extra roles for his role, also because I did not see anyone else playing this particular figure. David was great, but nothing compared to psychotic Timothy Hutton. Brilliant performance that you will not be tired of in the whole movie because it will never surprise you. It has weaknesses and strengths and makes the story even more credible. I also liked the narrative, added a lot of work to the story and had some very unforgettable quotes that I still use all the time. This movie also had a murderous score. I recommend this to anyone who likes drama and does not mind my blood.
