This film caught me for a moment, partly because of the extraordinarily high score here on IMDb - an average of 9.0 with more than 300 votes giving him the highest rating of all the available silent films! How did I not hear about this movie before this site? Well, you can not always trust ratings. It is actually a very good film that has been well preserved when the subtle VHS conversion I have lent has been an indication - excellent acting by major leaders, especially William Haines as Brown, and a good location in Cambridge with gentle action shots in Harvard / Yale football match - but the story must look like a barbed chestnut even in 1926. The accused, egotised and charismatic guy goes to school and gets to the place, becoming a caregiver's self-sacrifice; I doubt people in 1926 found many, which was very exciting in the last few winding, the predictability factor is high. Yet it begins very well, and definitely deserves a memory, if not praising the heavens. Perhaps the previous 350 voters are mostly Harvard men ... <br /> <br /> EDIT Now 600+ voters and the score actually climbed to 9.2! Seriously, people, there is a ballot-stuffing - I will not explain to anyone why this is a better movie than "Metropolis" or "The General"!
