I was literally preparing to hate this movie, so trust me when I say that this movie is worth seeing. Overall, stories and gags are narrated, but the film has the magic and gentleness to pull it off. The gag, where Jason Lee thinks he has a crab, and trying to let his boss / future brother-in-law and co-workers see how he scratches is not terribly intelligent, but she sent me into madness. Very few film gags are high eyebrows, but it makes me laugh. As I said, the movie has charm and magic can go a long way. <br /> <br /> The characters are also nice. I have to say that I wish I could see more about the character of James Brolin because he was in the few scenarios he had appeared in him. Additionally, I admire any romantic comedy that has the courage to not make the character of a woman serving as an obstacle in the plot) the total witch. The character of Selma Blair is hardly accessible and there is never a scene where I thought, "Why does she want to marry her first?" The end is Hollywood-ish, but it could be a lot more schmaltzy. <br /> <br /> The cast is talented. I did not have a favorable opinion on most of Jason Lee's work. I just loved him so much in Kevin Smith's films that I could not help, but I felt disappointed when I saw him in these boring roles. And he never seems comfortable in these spectacular roles. Even in this movie she does not look perfect, but she contributes her own two cents and efficiently processes each scene. But I still miss his work in independent films. Julia Stiles again proves why she is so damn sympathetic. Of course she is a very beautiful girl with a bright smile that makes me faint but also has a unique charm and seems to have a good personality. In other words, her beauty manifests itself both inside and outside. I do not know the name of the actress, but the woman who plays a drunken grandmother is cheerful. Julie Hagerty also has a small part, and she's always nice to watch, which makes me get a better role. I loved her so much that in the "Airplane" and "Lost in America," it's a shame she does not have the same opportunities to want her skills. <br /> <br /> Do not be discouraged by terrible trailers and even more terrible box office records. It's a fun, charming movie. Romantic comedies are so predictable today that they feel that the genre itself is ready to be flushed out of the toilet, so it is always good to see among all these bad apples. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
