This film is one of the best of all time, surely in the horror genre. The classic atmosphere is excellent, the music is just as good as the movie and the killer is as scary as it can be! The actors are fantastic, RIP Donald Pleasance was fantastic like Dr. Loomis, made the film even better. Without it, the movie would lack an important folder. Jamie Lee Curtis is also excellent as our beloved queen quakes! Her innocence does not realize the real evil she is after her until she finds her friends who are very murdered in the house, which of course is one of the best scene movies. It gives tremendous performance. I loved this movie because it feared me terribly when I saw it in the early 1980s, and I'm still looking at it, because it's an amazing movie that just brings you to this world if you could be gutted like a fish on each step! The fact that this is the simple format of a mad man in a mask that escaped from a mental institution and was ready to kill everyone in sight without thinking that it is there is only terribly frightening and even more devoted to the film as an event, be easily fulfilled. We all know that unfortunately in this world there is evil and a mad man with a knife is certainly not an unusual, very worrying deep fear of all this. Death at every step. Halloween, of course, shows in the most frightening way. Horror should be credible and that's what makes the movie enjoyable. It's just a simple story that makes it a great and frightening atmosphere. Just like the wonderful story of Psycho, both of whom I adore, I think formats are the best horror they offer. For me, Halloween and Psycho are the best movies I've ever seen and I'll watch them all my life and never get tired of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.
