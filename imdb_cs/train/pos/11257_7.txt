Erotic cinema of the seventies was tame compared to today's triple X romps, which is good. Because there's a good story about naked rituals and sexual scenes. Of course, I wish they had some vampire effects they had at that time, and sex got into the story a little bit. Additionally, some of the accents were difficult to comprehend in time periods, but it is worth watching the unfinished version and then the modified version called THE DEVIL'S HLAYTING. But if you do not care about naked women dancing and having sex, it's not the movie for you. I really liked it and I give it ... 7 stars.
