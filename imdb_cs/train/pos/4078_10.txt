This is one of my favorite movies, PERIOD. I can not think of another movie that combines so many beautiful film features like this movie. This movie has everything: action, adventure, sci-fi, good, bad, and even some romance (without being an innocent "peck" on the face between Paz and Sheet). Maybe best of all, you do not have to be in Mensa to get it and enjoy a movie like you did in some of Miyazaki's films (I do not know about you, but I'm watching movies thinking). It's just a fun movie that will please everyone, so make a favor and go buy it. The only slick note is American dabing. I found Vander-Geek to be just annoying. But all is not lost, the original Japanese version is on a two-component set and it's rocks! Who cares if you can not understand the Japanese spoken? If you can read the second level, then look at the original Japanese record with English subtitles. You will not regret it.
