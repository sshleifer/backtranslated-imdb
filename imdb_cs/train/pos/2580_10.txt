I say that the domino principle is an extremely underestimated film. Anyone who has taken the time to explore our current history of the plot, jfk, rfk, mlk, g.wallace and in fact many others can only conclude that the author of the domino really knew what he was saying that the tucker might be lee harvey oswald or james earl ray or sirhan sirhan or arthur bremer maybe i john hinkley or timothy mcveigh.to mention the couple's convention scenario involving spies, big business and political murders is not really a fiction but a sinister part of our intricate existential history. Help us, but the principle of domino is more than the facts. If it causes a small loss of sleep, maybe it should not. , explore yourself.
