It's a wonderful movie that is so above-average that my wife, daughter, and I find it irresistible. The plot is simply crazy, but it "rings the truth" to the world of soap operas, in all its unrealistic improbability and impossibility. <br /> <br /> I especially enjoyed the performance of Kevin Kline and Sally Field. I'm no better than Kline at THICKheaded. The nature of the field is really a desperate need for attention and confirmation - and its almost bipolar swings in the mood - played nicely against the background of the famous Field (infamous?) "Like Me!" Exclamation of Oscar. People who can get such a large grain of salt are so scarce in this world. I think it's the only film I was not impatient with Whoopi Goldberg; I thought she was "in place" in every note she had struck. Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Cathy Moriarty and Elizabeth Shue were also top class. It's a great movie if you're in the mood to go for a ride and back!
