wow, how can I discuss this movie without tears? It was surely the peak of my year - my - life. As if the raptor's graphics were not amazing, the editors continued to use the same picture throughout the movie, even when the background really did not match the scene setting. Wow, what a genius. And while the movie is full of holes (for example, a couple of t-Rex clip clips, where the raptor should be and one key moment when Pappy finds a torture shop, he shouts "Colin is a girl!" And exhausts) I will never forget the shine that is Planet Raptor. Thank you Sci-Fi for another classic.
