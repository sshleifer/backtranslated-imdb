It's not well shot, well written or well done, but it has to be the most addictive show I've seen from Twin Peaks. Each revelation is timed so well that you have to see another episode to get any kind of closure. They even slowed the pace of the show, where they only reveal a small amount of episode information, but they seem to have just told you everything you wanted to know. However, some of the actors are just terrible, and some of the duals are totally brutal. Some characters are very two-dimensional. More experienced actors, such as Locke and Ecko, really excel at the actors who play Jack, Kate, Sayid and so on. The development of the show can also be very frustrating as the next episode does not need to show what preceded the previous episode. Unpleasant side charts have become part of a story that never tells you anything. However, the second season has evolved to the point where back storytelling reveals more about the island than before. Overall, it's great, but not perfect.
