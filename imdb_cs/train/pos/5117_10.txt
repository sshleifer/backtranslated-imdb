Very few films have had an impact on American culture as Urban Cowboy has. Thank God it was temporary. But UC is almost in its class itself as one of those films that when you turn the channels at 3:00 in the morning, you can not get rid of your eyes ... my best three are Animal House and Walking Tall BTW, but that's next to the point. I remember that the city cowboy hit the theaters and survived to have honeymoons open at every corner, men had sporty cowboy hats with penny moccasins, and if you did not know how in two steps you were considered a social crazy! Personally, I think it's a great movie. Travolta really surprised me at SatNiteFever's heels. Who has the silence. It is truly credible. The soundtrack is amazing. The pity that Charlene Tilton of Dallas' TV drama had destroyed John Lee's career had caused the guy to be just great. Scott Glenn as a metal former cowboy. And I have nothing against greaser ex-con cowboys semi-be one myself, but I have always envied what I feel is the biggest electric line of all time ... "Pack-at S * # t!" Something like Clint's "do your day. " And looking at him as Sissy around, it's the closest thing to see my fantasy Julie Roberts ... as I said, beautiful. 9/10
