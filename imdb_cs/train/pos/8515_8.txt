Cast was good and I thought it was a good performance by Christopher Lloyd, who I like from previous films. The film was a great family film, nothing that worried you to show it to younger children, a good story line, lots of laughter, carefree and pleasant. If you want to have fun without tears, it will pay for it. Kid pleasing, and not difficult for parents to watch one.
