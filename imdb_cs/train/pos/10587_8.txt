This film is not a slogan, despite production and its connection to Troma's productions. Dark fake for adults. The use is a theme of sugar cookies and one is interested in whether casting was not a prey to the topic. A strange film with an appealing vision: shadows and contrast are prominent. It's definitely worth seeing, especially from Warhol fans and stylish decadence. Through all cruelty and godlessness, it can be a shiny moral, though twisted.
