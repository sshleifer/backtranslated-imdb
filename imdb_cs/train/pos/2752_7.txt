Though the eight-day storylines seem to be doing a lot of time, the film still has a lot of sparks, secrets and symbolism that had the first film of Jacon Van Dormal. Although not as good as "This Hero", which will always be on my favorite list, the film is still leaving us with lots of emotions. Daniel Auteil, since 2001 without the taste "The Closet" reduces his part, is afraid to overcome (right so, the role could easily be destroyed if the actor was too dramatic). However, I felt that the part needed a bit more realism to focus on the character rather than the mere growth of the character. Do not go to this movie to expect the dark humor and unexpected bruises you've got from "This Hero" because you'll be disappointed. The film, however, still serves as a decent, non-defective film
