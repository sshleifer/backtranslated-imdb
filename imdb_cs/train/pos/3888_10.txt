This is definatley one of the best stand-up shows the pupils. AT ALL. Eddie is so far from the wall that I've been watching this damn show for almost five years and it's still rocking every time. Everything, from his big, wide physical comedy to the little back of his head, is a master. You do not have to look beyond this line "The word herb, you call the coat of arms and we call the herb because it is in it". Brilliant.
