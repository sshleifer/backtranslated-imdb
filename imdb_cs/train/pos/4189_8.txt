Richard Widmark is disgusted with this movie. It's a professional pocket. He was three in prison, but at the beginning of the movie he tries to do four. Thelma Ritter is a busy body that sells information to almost everyone. Jean Peters is amazing as the girl that Widmark feels. This is a periodic piece during the McCarthy era, when Red Scare ruled politics and was quite nice to this plot. What is unusual about this film is that Peters & Ritter are both victims of violent beatings at a time when women were seldom more seldom than sexual objects in movies. This is what makes this film noir, because women often have different roles in this type of film. The film is only 87 minutes long and was probably made by Fox as under the card for double features in the theater. Files show that it is a limited budget movie. The script made J Edgar Hoover a fool because patriotism received a short smile. Hoover wanted to change it. Instead it happened B under the card picture that was hit in 1953. The script and acting in it are better than the other great features were this year.
