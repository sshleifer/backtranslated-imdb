I really enjoyed this adaptation of "Emmy". I have seen it many times and I always look forward to seeing it again. Although it only takes 107 minutes, most of the new parcels and parcels were developed satisfactorily. All the characters are well-drawn. Most dialogues come straight from the novel without stupid jokes, which are added in the sense and sensitivity of Emma Thompson. As a foreigner I especially appreciate the perfect diction of actors. Settings and costumes were beautiful. I found this version fairly balanced with the 1995 "Pride and Prejudice" miniseries, but the producer and screenwriter were the same. Kate Beckinsale did a really good job that portrayed "Emma," which Jane Austen said would create a heroin that no one would have. She's snobbish, but she has just enough youth and inexperience to keep being nice. Mark Strong was also very good when he portrayed Mr. Knightley, it's not an easy part, I think, though he does not have the charisma that Mr. Darcy has demonstrated in Colin Firth in pride and prejudice. Even the final scene, which does not happen in the novel, provides the final end, except that it shows that Emma is cold and almost uncomfortable with Frank Churchill while in the novel she was thoroughly reconciled with him and even told him she would enjoy duplicity, if she were in her situation. A special deviation from fidelity otherwise depicted throughout the movie. Beauty is more beautiful and more complicated than other Jane Austen novels.
