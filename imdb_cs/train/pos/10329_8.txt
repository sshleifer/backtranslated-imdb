The three vignettes were grateful and quite nice. It was curious to see so soon be famous actors when they were very young. The performance and attention of the detail were wonderful. <br /> <br /> Observation. In the movie, it is not necessary for the source material to be in line with the current time to be interesting or useful. The "little morale" of the narrative is quaint (or coy) only in the eye of the observer - fortunately. Story content - well said - can overcome his time, subject or place. Ironically, there are quite a few contemporary films that today have not passed the conventions or top moms of today. Inserting the content of "little morals" - occasionally - could have a missing dimension.
