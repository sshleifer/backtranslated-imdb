After watching this movie last night at Sundance I realized that much of Nakata's style was first done in this film. Here we have many of the same elements of the RING series, especially the idea that the media is a source of supernatural. Instead of cursed videotapes, we have a spooky studio instead of the strange pictures that appear on the film. In fact, strange images appearing on the film instantly bring in a cursed videotape in RING. All that was missing was the obsession with the water that went through the later Nakata movies. The final scenes are quite frosty, with a little nod to Murnau, which opens with doors and the spirit comes into the room reminds me immediately of NOSFERAT. A frozen film that will think twice about going to the pier.
