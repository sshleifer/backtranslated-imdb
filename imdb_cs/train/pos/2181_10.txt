<br /> <br /> Artistically shot actors show their exact role. You will get a real feeling when you watch Lucienne step out of poverty into the most beautiful girl in the neighborhood. The point of the tragedy is to regain tragedy. Overall, I have seen this film at least ten times. And she says very well that the Prix De Beute Prize (beauty prize, Miss Europe) is MAJOR favorite in her silent film collection. Louise Brooks's expressiveness is perfect, and I recommend this film to everyone who appreciates the artistic beauty and tragic story.
