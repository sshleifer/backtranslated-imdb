The actors play beautifully, especially Kenneth Branagh himself. It's good that Robin Williams got the comic role of Osiric, otherwise it might be a little strange to see him in such a production. It's really great that Kenneth has decided to use the most detailed version of the text, which is definitely not too often ... Thanks to this, the audience can see the whole, not the selected part - the directors. Also - thanks to God, the film is in the classical form; NO to surrealistic fanfare! Though "Tytus Andronicus" was impressive, yet Hamlet is another story, at least it is my opinion.
