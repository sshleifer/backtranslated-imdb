Melvyn Douglas once again gives a polished performance in which this time plays the role of a detective who can not place love before duty and adventure, and the beautifully beautiful Joan Blondell (who, far from illiterate, as a reviewer, has written a novel about her early life) pleasant as his ever-loving valentine. It's almost a comedy, an almost thin film, almost a series, probably not. continuation. It does not reach the classic state, but has all the ingredients for fun for 85 minutes with an episodic but fast script, the subtle characters of the actors and the direction that keeps everything moving fast enough, so you almost do not notice that Williams (Douglas) is not exactly Columbo when it comes to detection. I wish there were other movies like this one.
