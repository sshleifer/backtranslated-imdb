A quiet, sweet and beautifully nostalgic film about meeting old friends and the surroundings of your youth with all the memories and problems and grief of your presence with you. A movie that feels good to you. All ingredients are here: old jelly, rivalry, friendship and loyalty. Thieves, night-coolers and all the other fun things we all remember from our summer camps. All the characters have the opportunity for a week to experience it again because the old camp leader is now leaving and wants to meet the children from the golden years in the camp. Everyone is now in his 1930s and in the middle of his career.
