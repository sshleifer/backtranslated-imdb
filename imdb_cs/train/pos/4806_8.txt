The new side of the story about Victoria and Albert brings to life director Jean-Marc Valle. Most of Queen Victoria's common ideas are a woman who has ruled for decades and lived her life in mourning. Emily Blunt is more than capable in the title role because it gives viewers a different perspective. It displays Victoria in her youth, ascension to the throne, and early years. Blunt's Victoria was fresh and restrained in the film. Her most powerful scenes are Albert (Rupert Friend) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). All actors will be released, including Miranda Richardson, who could be a role. <br /> <br /> Though it's not a story of dramatic arcs and histrionic "actors" moments, the story is still interesting to make it worth it. There are several historical freedoms that have appeared on the screen, the film strives to remain faithful to the relationship between Victoria and Albert and the social and royal structures of the time period. Scene and costumes are excellent. <br /> <br /> This movie will be most appreciated by those who make history, period drama, and Blunt and other actors. Heartily recommend. <br /> <br /> <br />
