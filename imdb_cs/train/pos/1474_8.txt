I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival. It's not as frantic as it sounds, it's a three-part document (each episode is 50 minutes) representing the Slovenian superstar philosopher / psychoanalyst Slavoj Žižek. Zizek takes us on the road to many classic films exploring the themes of sexuality, fantasy, morality and mortality. She was directed by Sophie Fiennes from the multi-talented clan Fiennes (she is a sister of Ralph and Jozef). I was a little excited even though I think it will be even more fun on DVD, because there is such a sponge of ideas to be exhausted. Freud and Lacan's analysis can be quite difficult to see that the whole series suddenly disoriented to the end of two and a half hours. It did not help me that poorly recommended coffee and holding the bladder led me to some uncomfortable feeling in the last hour or so. The only real problem with this is that Zizek chose films that were, of course, full of Freudian themes. He spent quite a bit of time on Hitchcock and David Lynch films, not exactly the finessers. I'd like to see him if he tried to support his theories by using a wider range of films, even if it's really me that I'd like to see part four and five and six. Zizek is very funny, and a part of humor was watching him as a lecture, as he puts himself in real scenes from some of the films he's discussing. For example, we see him in a motorboat on his way to Bodega Bay (from Hitchcock in The Birds) or in Bates's basement (from Psycho). Which does not say his theories are not provocative. Even when I disagreed with him, he certainly thought about the films a little deeper. That's what they're trying to achieve.
