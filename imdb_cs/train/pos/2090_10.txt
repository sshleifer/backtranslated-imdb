Here comes the term "classic film". It's a wonderful story about female bravery, courage and extreme loyalty. Poor Olan sold to her hideous husband, who for years learned to appreciate her. (Yeah, Right, PEARL!) Luise Rainer was a beautiful star who won the Oscar for her little role (and the loss of an oscar) in "The Great Zigfield" a year ago. It really did not show what, if any talent, had anything other than its exotic beauty. But in "Good Earth" it shows he can really act! Her beauty was erased and she did not even have great costumes. People say she did not show any real emotions in this movie. Like hell. Her character Olan is a shy and shy woman with an inner strength. She is silent during part of the film with only eyes and body to mediate her emotions. Example: those scenes during the fall of the city and when they were shot. If people say that it does not work well in this movie, you do not look! Paul Muni shows that he can act the same way. His character is not appealing to me. She never sees her for what it is until the very end of the story. Sweet loving and devoted woman and mother with her own beauty. The greatest of all, beauty from inside, like a pearl. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to see this movie, beware. You will see one of the best movies that created the Hollywood Golden Age.
