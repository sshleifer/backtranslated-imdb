Japan 1918. The story of 16-year-old Ryu begins with the death of her father. As will later be revealed, both of her parents died of tuberculosis. In this desperate situation, Aunt Ryus has agreed to marry a Japanese man in Hawaii who only knows of his image. Upon arriving in Hawaii, Ryu finds her new husband is much older than the photographer, and lives in very humble situations beside the sugar cane while he is working. Ryu is not used to hard work on the planet, and in despair over her situation in her new home, she thinks she will run away. He soon finds out that he has no place to go. The friendship with her, her female colleague, gives her new hope and strength. This film is based on real events between 1907 and 1920 when thousands of Asian women accompanied a man in America who knew only their image. This well-known picture is well written and acted. Location is breathtaking. This film also features Mifune Toshiro in his last screen as Benshi (the silent movie narrator). This film gives insight into Japanese culture here and across the ocean. You must see!
