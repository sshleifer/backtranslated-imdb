Twisted, bizarre, charming and cheerful! I could not stop laughing to watch this movie. Darren Stein presents films he made on family video cameras that grew up in Southern California in the 1980s. It's an interesting look at novice filmmakers and their motivation and ability to manipulate the camera. Manipulation is a strong word, but are not we all watching movies to be manipulated in some way or otherwise? <br /> <br /> From the very beginning I was amazed by the fact that the boys in the movies seemed to look without a shirt whenever possible. Later, Darren commented on her new homosexuality, and you can see her from the hints of early age (great advice!). Perhaps it was just the warm weather in Southern California, who knows? As a homosexual who also grew up in livelihood, it is great to see that his parents supported him and loved him and that his friends seemed to be captured by his emerging talent behind the lens. <br /> <br /> "Put the Camera On Me" offers a backward look back to the 80's unspoilt by commercialism. You will remember hair, music and fashion. I am the same age as Mr. Stein, so the journey back to the lane was welcome. His solo lip-syncing dance number is an invaluable, enhanced Frankie Goes To Hollywood T-shirt. The film deals with dark themes over time. Child Abuse, Holocaust, Nuclear War, Sexual Imagination and Social Dysfunction. No childhood is completely carefree, and the way Stein deals with these subjects is at least interesting and cheerful. <br /> <br /> Watch as soon as possible!
