Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann worked to make some of the best westerns ever made, and that's one of the best. The true star of the film, however, is the beautiful Canadian rocks that serve as background for the story. Some of the best films in film history. In all the five westerings that Stewart and Mann did together, the supporting roles were perfectly occupied. There is no exception, up to parts that can have only a few rows, the characters are fixed etched by these lines. <br /> <br /> Stewart is a cynical hard dwarf in this movie whose only real friend is his sidekick Walter Brennan. It's Brennan's death in the hands of the villains that make him want to finally free the golden deal from the evil guys, and by the way, take a bath in the process. John McIntire is the main villain of the work and he was an undervalued actor with a huge range. He could play stunning old coders, authorities, and in this case, particularly ugly and frantic villains. <br /> <br /> One of the best westerns ever.
