It's a great movie. <br /> <br /> I agreed to look at the knock on a cat and how it ended. I've never heard of it (Mike's excpet from friends). But it's great! Eve, Lake, and Paul provide amazing performances. Humor is consistently dry and humorous. Paul Rudd pretty much plays a microphone character from friends (which works great). Other characters are stereotypes, and the story is formal (I mean, we do not mention "Apocalypse now"). But the characters are sympathetic, the story is engaging, the soundtrack, the production and the direction all works well. <br /> <br /> In all the great movies that really deserve much more than it gets. Everyone has their own tastes, but I really do not understand one star rating.
