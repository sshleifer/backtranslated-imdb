We are a long way from LAURA. Dana Andrews plays again as a police detective named Mark, and Gene Tierney is a beautiful woman pursuing him, but nothing else regarding WHERE THE WINDOW LAKES reminds of a favorite sophisticated murder mystery. Instead of a deliciously sensitive dialogue, we manage to achieve a harsh and insulting realism. While the previous movie was in the top rows of New York Company, here we are in the low-rental district of dark streets, poor, cheap restaurants and crazy flats. Tierney, as beautiful as ever before, now works as a mannequin in a department store and lives in the Washington Heights (a "doll" quarter that once garnered a LAURY martyr McPherson). This time, Andrews Mark Dixon, an older, more sad, uncertain version of a cold policeman in a trench coat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> Like Kirk Douglas' character in DETECTIVE STORY, Dixon owes his fragile contempt to his father's criminal past. Where Douglas is just and blind to his own mistakes, Andrews is loaded with suppressed guilt and reluctance. He accidentally kills the suspect and covers his actions by trying to cast a suspicion of a slimy gangster (Gary Merrill), who he has been watching for years. Instead, the suspect is a good cab driver because he is the father of the dying and abused wife of Morgan (Gene Tierney). Dixon, in love with the wife of the man he killed, desperately tries to save his father without leaving. Among the new protagonists, Dana Andrews had this distinction: he was unable to look unintelligent. Even when playing average Joe, as usual, he always meets as unusually sensitive and receptive; more than the fact that his atmosphere too thoughtful about his own comfort gives him this scary - and terrible - quality that was his essence as an actor. He plays ordinary boys, cops and soldiers, but always with a tragic backpack to see and know too much. His conscience heroes are marked by exhaustion, guilt, inability to sometimes "illuminate". No other actor could well express deep anger, slow pain, agonized intelligence Mark Dixon. He also has a slight tenderness, muted warmth, and even a sad humor that brings his heart. It comes when we take Morgan into a regular restaurant, and for the first time we see the cold, brutal man who trades the eyes of a waitress whose sarcasm can not hide her affection and interest in him. When Dixon asks his partner for money to get a lawyer for Morgan's father, he adds, even though they have recently argued and Dixon hit him. There are no words of loyalty or about being a good man deep down, but we see it all in the tortuous silence of a man and the resignation of his wife when he passes some jeweler's pawns. Dixon's goodness hits other people's reactions to him as well as Andrews's deep-moving performance. <br /> <br /> Although Dana Andrews was a small star, he may be a quintessential forty. There are films that barely remove the cloak; with a thick box in the middle of the century, fortified by a fedora, a glass of bourbon, a cigarette he does not take out of his mouth when he speaks, appears to be imprisoned in the male ideal of toughness and dishonesty. While many noir romanticize a double hard man, WHERE SIDEWALK LIFE offer an incredible portrait of reality behind the facade, a breathtaking and melancholy exploration of the roots and the consequences of violence. Andrews was sad (he was the only one of three protagonists in "THE BEST DAYS OF OUR LIVES" who were not nominated for an Oscar, although his scenic performance is far more convincing than Frederic March's hammock, Oscar-winning drunk). Fortunately, Andrews appeared in some of the films that made him immortal, and finally, this little-known film that features his best performance can be seen as part of the fabulous Fox Film Noir series. This series, including several previously released titles (such as NIGHTMARE ALLEY and THIEVES 'HIGHWAY), suggests that Twentieth-Century-Fox could have the best recording of all major studies when he came to the movie noir.
