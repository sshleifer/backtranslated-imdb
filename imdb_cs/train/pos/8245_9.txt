Even without speaking a word, Billy Connely is amazing as a zombie ... Carrie Ann Moss as a "mom", even better. Zombie girlfriend? <br /> <br /> "My father left me to eat ... I never tried to eat Timmy." <br /> <br /> And I thought Dawn of the Dead was good. It's a bit like Plane Meets (Meat?) Night of the Living Dead Sponsored by Zomcom .. And do not forget about my coffins and Fido in Aloha shirt it's just cool! And yes, the social comment is too big to even commence. <br /> <br /> Sufice to say, it all works!
