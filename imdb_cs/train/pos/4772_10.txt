This movie is perhaps the most touching and uplifting movie I've ever seen. I'm not a religious person, but sometimes a great piece of art like this movie can give me an almost religious experience. One suddenly realizes that life really means. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that when I first heard about this movie, I was skeptical. I thought the conspiracy sounded furious, and I'm afraid the story will be trivial. But as a fan of David Lynch, I decided to do it. It took me about 30 minutes before I was filmed, but then I was completely lost. There is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie! I let the cinema feel like I really learned something valuable about life. It is not a typical film by David Lynch, and in some ways it was very surprising to film such a film after exploring the dark side of human nature for so many years. On the other hand, I'm not surprised to be able to speak with deep emotions and deep human insight, because I also thought he did it at The Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the most talented directors and I think Straight Story is the best. 9.5 / 10
