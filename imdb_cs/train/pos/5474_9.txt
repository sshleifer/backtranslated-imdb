The National Art Gallery showed a long-lost original lost version of this film on July 10, 2005. It restores vital scenes that have been released by censors after its release. The figure of a ladder, a moral good man in the original censored edition of 1933, is presented here as a follower of philosopher Nietsz and encourages her to use men to get to the top. Also, the end of the original of the original, which I suppose, is eliminated in the current versions of the VHS and the end is restored to its original form. A wonderful film of seduction and power. Let's hope this DVD will be released again for everyone to appreciate its great features. Look at that.
