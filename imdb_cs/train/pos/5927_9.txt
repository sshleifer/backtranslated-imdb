Stephen King movies are funny to me. I either really love or do not see them. Some fanatical producers (like Despair and Storm Century) did not like me. Some of the smaller ones, I really loved. Sleepwalkers is the one who really enjoys me and I regularly look at him. The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They are Sleepwalkers, shape-shifting creatures that, even when they look like humans, look like a cat like a creature. They are scratch resistant to cats and whenever they move to a new city they put traps to capture and kill animals. When they moved to their new city, they need to find a virgin, and when Charles finds one, he really falls, but his mother needs to feed her to maintain her strength. The story revolves around what happens to the girl. Charles will save or use it to save his mother. Although this story has an incest that some consider inappropriate, it actually plays a role in the story and is therefore not filled with the scandal in the movie. Like most of Stephen King's stories, it is located in a small town with lots of interesting characters. The game is not the best and it's not special effects, however, the whole thing tends to "gel" and is very attentive and pleasant adaptation. For UK Readers: This production has most recently been featured on BBC1, Sci-Fi, and Sky Thriller / Horror.
