I just can not see how brilliant is the pairing of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. It's like a movie does not require any more characters, because you can never be tired of dialogue between the two. <br /> <br /> Lemmon has already been in several well-known films such as Mr. Roberts and Flat, and Matthau was fresh from the Oscar to win for The Fortune Cookie (another Billy Wilder movie also with Lemmon). That particular film was not as big as this movie, because the story could not hold for so long (I think it was almost 2 hours). This takes a matter of two and a half hours, though the introduction of the events that led to Lemmon that ended in the Matthau apartment is long (this was the sentence). This is a minor bug and you have a wonderful time for the rest of the run. I have already written a comment on watching this movie and I will not go deeper into it. The reason why it's such a joy is probably that the film was made just as the innocence of American films is beginning to run quickly into oblivion. There are some sexual references but they are solved in such an innocent way that you could not even get "Well, I've never been ..." from the most violent man. It's a bit of fun to see the movie from a long lost era, and it was probably the reason why it went on because it did not work because you had Matthau and Lemmon saying a few f-words and it just does not fit. > <br /> Of course, now they are both gone and you can only be happy that you can still enjoy them in such a wonderful movie. I think the only male actor in this movie that's still alive is John Fiedler. Edelman died recently. So you have it. Simply one of the best comedies and movies ever. <br /> <br /> Add: I just recently learned that John Fiedler died, so I'm deeply sorry for all his fans. I did not mean any disrespect, and I'll try to be more careful about what I'm next crazy about.
