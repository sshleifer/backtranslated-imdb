It's probably a very good "sequel" better than the first live action film 101 Dalmatins. He has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and everything right! <br /> <br /> Cruella DeVil, who has some rather great therapy, is now a lover of dogs and very kind to them. Many, including Chloe Simon, the owner of one of the dogs that Cruella once tried to kill, does not believe it. Others, like Kevin Shepherd (owner of the Shelter Sheep Dog), think they have changed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the ball meter, with her partner, gave birth to three cute Dalmatian puppies! Little Pots, Domino and Oddball ... Eric Idle plays as Waddlesworth (hilarious macaw), Glenn Close as Cruella himself and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt (another baddie, the name should give a leash), it's a good family movie with excitement and plenty next! One of the falls in this film is that it has a lot of painful slapstick, but it's not as exaggerated as the last movie. It's also more fun than the last movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "102 Dalmatians"! :-)
