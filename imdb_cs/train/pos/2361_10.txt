I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and I also work in emergency care facilities. Over the years, I have seen people dying for hemolytic blood transfusion reactions, have participated in many conferences on haematopoietic pathogens, and have seen that several patients have been seriously ill with transfusion blood-borne pathogens. I have also heard several Jehovah's Witnesses who have been told to die if they refuse blood, and after 26 years in the field I have never seen it, so I left the question: "it is indeed inappropriate to refuse blood transfusion or the community is greatly benefited from the battle in this matter? "The problem for Jehovah's Witnesses is moral. "You have to abstain from blood" is not ambiguous. Thank you for taking this movie and admitting it.
