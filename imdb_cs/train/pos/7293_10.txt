What am I saying about such a beautiful movie? I saw it in Atlanta, in Georgian Dragoncon, when I think this is my capital. I'm very sci-fi aficionado and enjoy the action movies. It happened to me all night and was ready to call it the day I noticed that this movie is playing in the morning. It's not a sci-fi or action film of any kind. Let me just start by saying that I am not a fan of Witchblade or Eric Etebari when I was watching several episodes (his performances looked obsolete and robotic). But in this performance I really managed to fight. I think he really will win me. When I saw Cellular, I did not think the guy was acting too much. But his performance as Kasadya was just amazing. He was convincing like a bad demon. But it was such a deep detail of this character that I was absolutely amazed. Later I checked it online and found out that Eric was awarded the Best Actor Award, which deserves to take into account the best of his career and has earned my respect. Now I read about this fx and the production of this project and let me just say that I paid no attention to them (apologize to Brian). They were very nicely done, but I was even more impressed with the story - which I think is even more of a goal (seeing movies like Godzilla with huge effects really just turned off). After this movie I could not sleep, I thought it over and over again in my head. The situation of an abusive family is never easy. I showed the trailer to a friend on the internet and almost cried because it affected her, so she lived with abuse. It's a movie that I continually think and recommend.
