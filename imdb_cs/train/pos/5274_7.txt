Yes, I loved this movie when I was a child. When I grew up, I saw this movie so many times that my father had to buy another copy of VHS because the old copy was lost. My family received a copy of VHS when we bought a new VHS system. At first my mother was not convinced that it was a good movie for ten years but because we just bought a new VHS system she let me watch it. As I said, this movie is every little dream of the boys? The movie contains amazing surroundings, big muscular barbarians, beautiful women without topless, great bad monsters and jokes that you only get when you get old. So a few days ago I inserted the video and watched the film again after a long time. At first I was bored, then I began to think about how much I loved this film when I was a child, and I kept looking. Yeah, the experience was not as big as I remembered? The game is pretty bad, the story is pretty bad, the jokes were no longer fun, but the women were still pretty. Yes, I grew up. Although the film experience has changed for me, I still think it is worth 7 stars. You know good old times?
