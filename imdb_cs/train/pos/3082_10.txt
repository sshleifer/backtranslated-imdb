What is really sad shows that six degrees and brothers and sisters are the real reality of television, not that garbage that is nothing but a celebrated game show. I think there has been supernatural discontent over the last few years with the very premature abolition of numerous cultural shows. But with the more vocal Jericho fans (which I also like) and other shows, networks can begin to reverse this trend. I'm like everyone else, I do not support any new shows until they have a second season. I will then decide to watch and capture through DVD and online browsing. Until then, ABC lost me as a viewer for any new show.
