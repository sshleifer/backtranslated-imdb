True Classic. Beautifully shot and it was. It reveals the area of ​​Paris, which is lively and full of comedy and tragedy. Although the "Hotel du Nord" and the hotel itself still exist, it is not as gay (in the original sense) and joyful as it once had to be. The film gives birth to a past that has been lost, with sigh and bitterness.
