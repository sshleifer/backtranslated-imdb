I saw this series when I was a child and loved the details he entered, and he never forgot. Finally, I bought a DVD collection as I remembered. This should be dully, uninterested and intimate. The movie recording is incredible and the interviews are fantastic. The only other series I've agreed to is "Die Deutschen Panzer". I just wanted Hollywood to sit down and watch this series, then make some great war films. > <br /> Note. Brethren Band, Private Ryan Saving, Letters from Iwo Jim, The Flags of Our Fathers and When the Trumpets Race Are Some That I Would Recommend
