if you have a chance to see this movie see it. it is quite shocking and really reflects on so many important issues, but it is not a didactic one. in my opinion it's an artwork ... beautifully shot, great music of many styles, typically the impressive level of acting we expect from BBC Drama. Nathalie Press (convinced Natalie Press) is convincing in her role as a depressing teenager who uses a male classmate. Celia Imrie has this beautifully soothing quality that gives some uneasy stability to the action and the comfort of the audience because they know that someone out there is really "normal," but a real star as ever is Timothy Spall - surely one of the greatest actors of our time!
