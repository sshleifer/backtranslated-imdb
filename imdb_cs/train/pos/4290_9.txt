I think Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the best artists in the world. I do not understand why some people say it is not. Boring....??? Perhaps the one who said he's boring is because he's boring. She is a great actress and the movie was excellent. He has a lot of great ideas and great performances. The direction was great. I present myself in a French setting with all sophistication and perfumes, flowers, churches, problems, etc. When it comes to the nursery's store it's just amazing. Everything is great. We have a very good actress, beautiful, for a long time. Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect. I like him more than in my next LA SCIENCE DES RÃŠVES movie. And Eric Lartigau did a very good job
