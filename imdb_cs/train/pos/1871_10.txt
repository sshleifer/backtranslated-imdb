I was admitted at birth and definitely did not have the problems that Antwone Fisher had in the film, but I still share some emotions and this movie really helped them get them out and force them to act with them. I even realized that I had a "missing piece" and I am now looking for my birth. I screamed almost a day when I first saw it. Antwone's confrontation with a mother born who has encountered the father's reaction to his sudden appearance is strong for those of us who do not know what happens if we find our parents. And his self-confidence and self-confidence towards his mother and the abusers of his past were so strong. I could really identify with this fact and my need to tell people "yeah, my parents put me down when I was born, but I was interested in another group of parents and loved me and now I'm a success!" <Br> <br /> <br /> It has also helped my wife understand me and our adopted children who have tragically experienced before coming to our home. And it helped me to realize how bad our social system is. Remember last year's story about a "lost" foster child in Florida, and then about the story of Miranda & Ashley in Oregon, where SCF ignored several complaints about sexual abuse of the man who eventually killed her and a week this movie was launched, another story in New Jersey from three children who ignored the system. One died. The state apparently thought that the home they were in was fine because the guardian was employed (like a stripper) and "only occasionally" used heroin! <br /> <br /> There are just so many problems that are mentioned in this movie - and they are so well solved by the script and that the acting that Antwone Fisher should be the "best picture" candidate surely. Regardless of whether you are admitted or not, it is a heart-tugger that can not be ignored by someone concerned about children in our society.
