After being considered the official trilogy of Dirty Harry with The Enforcer (1976), it will be the last chapter of the series. Dirty Harry is back, older, dirtier and more agile than ever before from the original 1971 classic. Dirty Harry has in the past killed the killer of psychopaths, police watchers, and Vietnam veterans by terrorists. But now it's a new assassin, a killer who wants to return money when he shoots the attackers. Sudden Impact brings Dirty to Harry a new sense and a darker tone. Callahan is in a new murder case that is circling back to a woman (played by Sondra Locke), who was brutally raped along with her sister being traumatized. Ten years later he's revenge by getting rid of his invaders. Likewise, Callahan is enthusiastic when provoking the crowd's boss to a heart attack, whose crowd also hunts him. So, in order to let the heat fall inside the city, Harry is in order to take a vacation in a seaside town, but at the same time, the victim is raped in the city while hunting the attackers one by one. Harry is on the investigation and finds murders that are very similar because he's hiding on a killer trail. <br /> <br /> Sudden impacts, in my opinion, must be one of my top 10 revenge films, as well as being the second best Dirt Harry's filter, much better than the combination of The Enforcer and The Dead Pool. Sudden Impact has what the original Dirty Harry had, a dark tone with fun value. Do you feel so happy, punk?
