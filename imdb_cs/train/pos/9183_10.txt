This wonderful BBC television production in 1983 (not a movie, as written by others) of the classic love story "Jane Eyre," starring Timothy Dalton as Rochester and Zela Clarke as Jane, is the most beautiful version because it is the most faithful novel by Charlotte Bronte in concept and dialogue. <br /> <br /> Classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons; when filmmakers start to move with classical blood, then this classic is destroyed. Fortunately, the producers of this "Jane Eyre" approached the story with respect and fidelity to the original, resulting in a conspicuously addictive drink that is worth seeing multiple times, enjoying multi-layer sweetness and joy and tension. The performances are wonderful, the music is fine, even the Gothic house design and beautiful outdoor shots and set the right tone for the production. My only criticism, though tiny, is that this version, like any other version like Jane Eyre, has been ignoring the Christian influences that have shaped Jan's character and influenced her moral decision. In today's modern world, a woman in Jane's situation should not think twice, but stay with Rocheste after finding out that she has a mentally ill woman and is still married to her. "Oh, just divorce," she told her, or she would live with her. But Jane Eyre knew she was unable to cope with this life and respected. Why? This decision was based on the beliefs of the Christian faith he had taught since childhood, not from the brutal Calvinist institution of Lowood, but from the Christian example of a real girlfriend, Helen Burns, who was tortured rather than turned to the other face. Sometimes I would like to see that some versions show these effects a bit more in adaptation. The classic novel, ending in heroic letters "Yet Jesus Comes!" they should not get rid of the foundations of that faith.
