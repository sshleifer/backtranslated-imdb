"Read My Lips" tells of the strange symbiosis that develops between a common workman (Devos) and a workplace worker, a rough exon (Casel). As the film filters this unlikely duo to their idioms, they become entangled in the chilling unification of minds, each using its own selfish reasons with an extraordinary result. Good things for someone in character-oriented movies with strong psychodramatics. In French it is easy to read subtitles and a good translation. (B +)
