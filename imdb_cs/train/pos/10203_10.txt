I love movies and my own comics, comics are different from the movie, but I'd give it: 10 out of 10. It was amazing. If the movies are already awesome. I should have my children. And I'm a woman. Read comics that you will not regret. Yes, in this movie since Brian P. artist died, we do not achieve nearly as good artwork. I mean, do not treat me wrong, these people are great, but different versions for different people. Different strokes for different people, as they say. Anyone who does not happen to her is crazy or does not like women, or you know you're just planning crazy. If I could count on my fingers, how in love and how many times I read comics, I would definitely have my fingers drowned, but they're always fingers.
