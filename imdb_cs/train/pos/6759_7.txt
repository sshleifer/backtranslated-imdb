WHEN THE SECTION OF THE SECTION deserves to be a better-known film by director Otto Preminger, the man who gave LAUR to the world. And this time has the same stars: DANA ANDREWS and GENE TIERNEY. It has to be said that Tierney is not used here in what has a more supportive role, whereas the reflector comes to Andrews. He plays a hard, hard-faced cop who has been involved with a lot of robbers in an over-energetic way, by accident, killing a man in the process of his arrest. When suspicion falls on the driver of the cabin (TOM TULLY), she goes along with a murder investigation, but she starts to feel guilty because she is in love with a cabbie daughter (GENE TIERNEY). Tierney, by the way, looks a little too elegant for the girl she's been playing here, and she does not seem to fall into the backbone of the story. The story takes a grim curve as the investigation goes deeper and it turns out that the murdered man had in his head a silver plate from his service as a war hero. Eventually it will become a story of morality when Andrews develops conscience over his crime. It is fascinating as a film noir with powerful performances from strong supporting cast. Good entry into the noir area, heavily controlled by Preminger and played well by Andrews and Tierney, despite the slight upset of her character.
