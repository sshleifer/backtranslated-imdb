Music Albeniz is going through this movie. From time to time, it is played with original instrumentation (such as a piano but never full orchestra), but it is often reworked with various contemporary instruments (such as Guitar) and treatment (such as Jazz's Piano). Only occasionally is music the only focus of the film: the vast majority of time is music set to different dances, often flamenco, but not always. I guess there are 12? 14 scenes that are not associated with conspiracy. Not all scenes reach the height of individual viewers. In my case, about half reached the peak, although everyone else was in their own way very well. Those who worked for me made me aesthetically pleased with goose and meat; Eventually, the last scene was crying with joy. And in some very magical way, it will bring you deep into Spanish culture. If you do not like subtitles, do not worry. The film is practically wordless, although each scene carries the name of the albenized work. I see this very beautiful film sharply my complaint that virtually none of Saura's films are available on a DVD in the US. I am thinking in particular of his flamenco version "Carmen", a charming artwork that is available in Europe but not here (European DVDs do not play on US DVD players). That's a scandal.
