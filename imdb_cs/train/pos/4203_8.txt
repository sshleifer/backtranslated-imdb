This is another fierce and persuasive film by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s. This minimalist and fast-working director has something unusual about his older films - casting with stars. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley star in this film about a group of Communist agents who are trying to escape the secrets of America - and they stop for nothing to succeed. The film begins with Peters on a metro vehicle tracked by federal representatives. They know it's a link in a long spy chain. Unknown for all is the wild card in the equation - a small time pocket (Widmark) is also on the train and can steal the mystery Peters bears. Widmark thinks it's just another wallet he's pissed off - only later he realizes the seriousness of what he stole. Now it's actually Widmark - along with Commies and the FBI on his trail. <br /> <br /> Widmark and the others are exceptional and the movie is captured from beginning to end. Although it did not get top-level billing, it should be Thelma Ritter. This supporting actress may have had her life as a dove. She was rarely given the chance to act and I was overwhelmed by her ability to play a broken and sad old lady. As for the scenario and overhead to go, they are very good - but with one small exception. At first I liked the way Widmark and Peters were involved. It's one of the few times on the movie, you'll see a woman in her mouth in the square! Now it's hard. Later, unexplainably, they become amazingly close - too close to being credible. Yet, with such a great drama and such an effective Noir filter, it can be overlooked. Watch this movie.
