I liked the film, mainly because it was telling an interesting story, but the story that was narrated in the film seemed to be condensed from a much longer story. Because the book has more than 400 pages, it makes sense. It includes the time period from the 1920s and 1970s, in a fictitious South American country, also a lot to fit within the available time. I think it would be much better than a six-hour mini-series before it turned out to be a 140-minute film. Even though it's gloomy, the story does not miss much, it gets confusing. What is said is fairly well-known. One mistake lies in the fact that Clar's supernatural power appears inconsistently; either should appear more evenly during the course of the film or omitted. Two other mistakes (which might be spoilers): Esteban's ultimate return to the good becomes somewhat sudden and Ferula's curse seems to wear out, although the tone of the story suggests it should last forever. <br /> <br /> The game is great. Glenn Close, like the frustrating Spurster Ferula, is excellent. Jeremy Irons, as a brutal, self-inflicted person, is also excellent. Meryl Streep, as the main character of Clara, is great, though she is often even better than she was in this movie. There were also many well executed smaller roles. The biggest mistake is that the film did not seem to have a dialect leader; each actor apparently spoke with another type of accent.
