Still quite difficult, all the previous comments just described the beginning and detailed details. I feel the necessity to confirm that this is a family work, because Marina Vlady was also the wife of Robert Hossein and great jazz music was written by the director, Andr√©. Under these circumstances, it is no wonder that it was a really good thriller, he saw when he was released and immediately identified with music. The conclusion was flawless and maintained to the end. Robert Hossein, at the time, one of Europe's best players, was also able to feature as a top screen and director. He is still performing great theater performances with the preference of religious subjects. Harry Carasso, Paris, France
