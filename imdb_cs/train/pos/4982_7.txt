I love these movies "Baby Diaper"! Today you can not make a movie that is rich in cinematographic history. It's fucked and the movie was shot to make you laugh, which it does. As these children get to "act" I will never know. I think they are rare and the children laugh at me, but the others who shot the film, as shown by the naivety that existed at the beginning of the 1930s. You have to remember that just when the film industry was very young, the stock market crashed, global depression began and these films were filmed to interrupt the real world. The fact that you can see movies in five cents is beyond my understanding, but then the 25 cent dinner is also. It was another time with completely different mind settings.
