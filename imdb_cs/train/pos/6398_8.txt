"Inspiring" stories about the "triumph of the human spirit" are usually a big shake for me. The most surprising thing in MEN of Honor is how I enjoyed it all the time. The movie is as predictable and clich√© as it is, but it works. Much merit comes to the exciting performance of both potential customers. It's a perfect role for Cuba Gooding, Jr., who is very reluctant here. We had a lot to expect from De Niro and did not disappoint. Creates a dark funny portrait. Director George Tillman, Jr. went into the old style and comes with the winner.
