First, I would like to fix another review of this film, which said that the last Best Picture Picture Musician was "Gigi" in 1958. This is misinformation like the "West Side Story" won in 1962, "My Fair Lady" she won in 1965 and after that year she won the "Sound of Music". This means that this movie is absolutely fantastic! The story of the novel has been somewhat changed, but it is rather because of the limitations on the stage that they simply did not change for the film version. However, I do not mind. In fact, I think that all production is flowing better than a novel. I like Nancy, who brought Oliver to the bridge and later killed her in the apartment. The fine things in this movie are those that make me laugh. I love the moment when Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble begin to come out of the governors' office. The underscore for this moment is excellent. My favorite three actors for this film were Jack Wild, who plays the best Doder in any movie version of the story, Ron Moody, playful and humorous Fagin (this character is done much better than the book) and Shani Wallis, the most powerful and desperate version Nancy. The only reason I am giving this movie 9th place is 10th because of two big production numbers that are "Take part" and "Who will buy". I always hate if choreography in musicals should look like people doing everyday work and work. It looks awful and cheesy, especially when dancing at London Meat Co. You should perform choreographies regularly for these scenes. However, this film is a rare treasure that has remained with us, hopefully, forever.
