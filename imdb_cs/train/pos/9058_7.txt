I read a book in the 5th year, and a few years later I saw the movie. There are several differences: <br /> <br /> 1.Billy was oringinally supposed to eat 15 worms in 15 days, not 10 worms in one day until 19:00. <br /> <br /> 2.Billy is supposed to get $ 30 after eating all the worms. In the movie, after Billy has all the worms, Joe has to go to school with worms in his trousers. <br /> <br /> 3. Joe thinks that some of the worms are fake, but he does not have it at all. <br /> <br /> While there are changes, this movie is still such that kids will like it.
