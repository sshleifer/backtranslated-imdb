It was an adorable movie. A great movie when you need it. The story is light (it's not anywhere with the wind), but sometimes it needs this kind of plot. Funny and warm characters, fantastic acting and beautiful costumes / wardrobe. <br /> <br /> Parminder K. Nagra (also from the ER show) is in this role WONDERFUL. She is definitely a new shining star for Hollywood. Everyone should look at it, in the future they will be BIG. <br /> <br /> Also impressive was the soundtrack of this movie. Nice mix of modern and Indian melodies. During most of the movie I danced. <br /> <br /> We highly recommend that if the fun movie is what you need.
