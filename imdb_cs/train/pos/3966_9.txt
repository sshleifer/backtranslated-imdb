JAMES STEWART plays an FBI agent who began working with the agency before being called the FBI, and the story includes talks with Ku Klux Klan, Prohibition Era gangsters, German and Japanese spies of World War II, etc. The ever-interesting picture covers 40 years of history; far superior to all the films currently produced. Particular interest in older audiences familiar with Washington, DC. In the scene of about 20 minutes in the movie --- where James Stewart finds that Vera Miles is expecting his first child - the scene was filmed at Herzog's Seafood Restaurant on the former Washington coast, the only film in which this historical one will appear. Shortly after taking office, President Kennedy decided that Southwest Washington, 99% Black Quarter, was the eye and should be destroyed. A decree that adapts to its position of undisputed copyright is the whole area, including the popular beachfront restaurant, but without 3 historic churches; was reduced to rubble. Black people evicted from their homes moved as best as possible without federal help; Similarly, businesses were simply eliminated from business, little changed. Restaurant Row was transferred to the sidewalk and Washington had no seafront (restaurants, seafood, boats, etc.) About 10 years. As a lifelong resident, the Herzog Restaurant scene was the most important reason why this wonderful movie reappeared.
