There is inexhaustible hunger for movies about "basic training," so it's surprising that this person got so little notice when he was released for the first time. It looks like he will have a second life on the DVD / VHS. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tigerland is by no means equally great, there are some horribly clich√© characters (especially the NCO display for the return of Lee 'Full Metal Jacket' Ermey), but Colin Farrell's lead performer is an instant star. Charisma burn and the role an actor would kill to get.
