We saw vcr and found it fascinating. When I did not know anything about this true story, I thought, "Oh, no, P.Brosnan as American Indian (" red "Indian in the movie), what a bad choice" until I discovered the truth about the gray owl. The film does a good job demonstrating the dignity of these indigenous peoples and undermining racist myths about them. And Annie Galipeau, WOW, beautiful and very convincing as an Indian woman (I believe it is French-Canadian, will surely return to a well-known speech of such). Still, from Brosnan's secluded, bleeding style, he eventually arrives convincingly as a passionate and devoted man. The conspiracy is a bit weak when it demonstrates its conversion from trapper to animal. Good movie, we recommend.
