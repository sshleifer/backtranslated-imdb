In my opinion, this is one of the best movies ever shot in America and deserves every prize it won, and it's the AFI Top 100 list (even if it's shamelessly too low on the IMDB Top 250, this font). If you like acting of the highest caliber (Voight and Hoffman are an excellent match), well-drawn characterization and inventive direction, editing and cinema, you will love it just as I do. Schlesinger portrays the lively, always credible picture of the New York scene from the late 1960s and many victims try to overcome personal demons and survive in the midst of amorality, poverty and hopelessness on New York's 42nd Street. <br /> <br /> The filmmaking techniques they use here brilliantly capture the feel of the underground film movement of New York (and cities) and are nothing but brilliant. I've seen a lot of ideas (including fast fire, manipulation with breakthrough voices, drug / trip sequences, and the cartoon face that got through the murder scene to make anxiety and fear) stolen by other filmmakers. The relationship between Joe and Ratso is solved in such a way that he is considered an unusually strong friendship or his homosexual backgrounds. I think the director dealt with a gentle way of not defying censorship but rather focused his energy on the importance of a strong human bond in life, whether it be sexual or not. <br /> <br /> <br /> MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a courageous, moving movie of size, influence, and meaning that over the years has lost absolutely no impact, so if you have not seen it, you really have missed the true American classics. I recommend this film to everyone. <br /> <br /> Score: 10 out of 10.
