The closest, I once came to see that this was the clip shown at the Gerard Philippo exhibition in Paris about two years ago. I had no interest in remak, and when I got to the original state after more than half a century after its inception, I can only conclude that careless fences were deliberate, aimed at a long obsolete target. Hollywood has been practicing realistic combat swords since the 1930s, when the greatest of them all, Basil Rathbone, crossed the film with Errol Flynn and others, so the technique was available and so remained only satire. After some time you do not notice and dislike the Henri Jeanson Dialogue, which reminds Prisoner Of Zenda, both versions. Gerard Philippe certainly had a presence to lead such a role, and Gina Lollabrigida was probably better than Martine Carol, the second apparent candidate at the time. The print I saw was particularly bad, and at some point it was completely disintegrated, so maybe the DVD version would get bigger.
