As a long-time fan of Peter O'Donnell's greatest work, I watched this movie on DVD without great hope of pleasure; I really waited for the disarming of the remote control in fifteen minutes. But instead, I enjoyed this production and especially enjoyed and appreciated how the producers and directors managed to tell the story of Modesta Blaise. They have managed to prevent the (bad) film version of the books we are so familiar with, and instead have decided to focus on Modesta's life, which he mentioned in the novels. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm not a student of cinematography !: Yes, the film was filmed on a careful budget and time budget and maybe it shows ... but it spoils the audience's entertainment? In this case I do not think. Instead, we met one of the world's greatest heroes of literature and understood her abilities. As for casting: because in the unknown territory only the people who really care about it are Modesty a) Professor Lob. For me, they were absolutely trustworthy. Alexandra Staden, whom some have labeled as wooden and too thin to become an action hero, has brought Modesty and Coolness to the screen. (if martial arts were needed), but the most important is the personification of integrity, which is at the heart of the canon of Modesta Blaise. OK, so we all know that this movie was made to the basis of Miramax's claims to Modesta Blaise's character, it was done quickly and cheaply, but ... I can not wait to see the next production in this series by these producers - basic values ​​and characteristics of original stories!
