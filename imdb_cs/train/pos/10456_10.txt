This movie is not about the fun or about the movie you want to see. This film is a true manifestation of true love that can only come from God. One can not help but be deeply concerned by looking at this movie. We have several dimensions of love that contribute to the value of this film. There is a divine love for God, which is beautifully portrayed. God's love crosses the heart and mind, and lasts and is eternal. There is love in marriage. While the main character is struggling with his wife's illness, through God's love, he realizes that he loves his wife more than he can imagine. He knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated. Finally, you have love for your parent and child. Children in the family are gathered and realize that nothing else matters that love will prevail. Dear friends, love is not love unless it comes from God because God is love and love comes from God. Talk to someone and let them know you love them. Love has nothing good if it is not given to another. I pray that this film will inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees it. Amen!!
