In my opinion, this is the best performance I've ever seen. I became an instant fan of Eddie after I saw Dress to Kill, but I must say that I think it's his best job. But I would like to say that if you ever get a chance to go live with him. It's worth it! <br /> <br /> Most of the time after they've met a couple of times, the jokes are getting old. But I have to say that I have seen this show so many times that I have memorized the whole thing (which is, I realize it is a little sad), but every joke makes me laugh. This is a really good show. <br /> <br /> Dressing for Kill will never be old for me. I own it and watch it whenever I need a good laugh.
