This film was supposed to be better than the average action movie and they succeeded. This movie has spectacular cinematography with spectacular mountain snow and heights, Stallone is well suited as well as great performance, exciting plot and great performance from its main villain because he really shocks you in his evil ways. The film is not rated everywhere great because of the weak screen play.The plot and story crying for this movie make Stallone a strange special person, like Rambo or Rocky or Bond movie characters.They have decided to humanize Stallone's character in this one that's fine , but due to the plot style, it weakens the excitement factor.Also, dialogue was cheesy and carelessly condescending occasionally. The script should be more realistic and less "talky". Another weak point was unrealistic scenes. Movie makers should be more careful as snakes have hit and misses. The quality of scenes from the shooting sequence during the hijacking aircraft should continue in the movie soon. Instead, they decided to destroy a lot of shooting (ala "A-Team" TV series) once the villains put their feet on mountain topsy.This movie had a lot of time great potential.Crisper action sequence, better dialogue and other Rambo / Rocky style emotions / Stallone's determination to take this film to a higher level. I know it was not Stallone's mistake. The director's sense of purpose was to relieve Stallone's character and try to steal the film by recognizing his direction, which was not so great if not for his cameraman. He made a good movie though ........
