When do people know that some movies are made for fun and do not necessarily have to change the world? If you realize this, then expect to have a lot of fun while watching the "false road of Bill and Ted". It's a movie that's a lot of fun watching, Keanu and Alex, to make a great team on the canvas discover their characters from the "great adventure of Bill and Ted" with the even more "style" they had in the first film. It's not rocket science, but it's great for laughter, the characters are extremely happy and the story is so radical you have to laugh. Do not expect "deep and meaningful" just to expect pure fun!
