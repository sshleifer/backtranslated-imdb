This is a movie that will probably never have access to the main stream to the market because it does not provide the viewer with easy tracking. The story of the troubled Spike and his friend Heaton is not exactly Friday night, but he has his own unique edge and I find it fun. There are brilliant moments because the film was shot at such a low budget as when Spike inhale the aerosol. However, I really did not understand the relationship between Spike and Heaton, and to be honest, I had to spend most of the film to solve it. And I also did not like that most of the movie is spent with two friends talking and not really "action". It's a small movie that's complicated to watch and that's what makes it appealing.
