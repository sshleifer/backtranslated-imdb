I grew up in this movie and I remember when we and my brother played in the garden and pretended to be in Care-a-lot. Now, after so many years, I have to watch the film with my daughter and watch her enjoy it. If you are a parent and you have not seen this movie with children, you should just keep them in your arms and watch that you are excited about the caregiving bears and carefully! Songs, especially "Forever Young", are very sweet and unforgettable. Parents, I highly recommend this movie to all children so they can learn how enjoyable care for others can be! When all the waste is on TV, you can wake up your kids to get the right picture of life with such movies.
