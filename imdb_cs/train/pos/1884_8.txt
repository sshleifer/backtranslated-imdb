This is one of my favorite comedies at all. Not wanting to be justified in the heroic lifestyle of his hero, but to take on what is worth, not as trivial alcoholism, the film is just a lot of fun. He tells an unlikely story about a constant drunken, irresponsible 40 thing called Arthur, who is supposed to inherit huge wealth, but only when he takes Susan because he thinks she could do something about it. Arthur suggests, but then Linda, a waitress and a tiny thief, disappears. Dudley Moore is perfect as Arthur, the most beloved drunk in the world, whose antics are laughs a minute. It is true that Moore IS Arthur and I agree with those who can not imagine any other actor in this role. Ladies' works are also well-portrayed. Liza Minnelli sparks like Linda and her chemistry on Moore's screen is great. Jill Clayburgh plays Susan, the wealthy and more suitable woman chosen for Arthur. <br /> <br /> However, Sir John Gielgud, who portrays Arturo's sarcastic but moral butler Hobson, made this film literally. Obviously, these two had a great deal of affection during Hobson's long-term employment. Hobson is Arthur's best friend and supplier of unsolicited comments and advice. The most interesting relationship in this film is not Arthur's romance at all, but its unusual relationship with this humorous and, of course, always disagreeable servant. It's a valet that you remember best after the final credits are counted.
