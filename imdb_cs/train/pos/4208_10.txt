Every now and then, this movie, which no one has ever heard, is being filmed in a very short time with very little money and money, but everyone gets crazy and turns out to be surprisingly great. It also happened in the 1950s with lots of little films that many people have not heard before. There are really some unusual surprising little jewels from the 1950s that are worth digging. "Panic in the Streets" is another movie, like the one that comes to mind. Both are films that are not, in fact, similar to the usual genre films of their time, and are also produced with a limited amount of resources. I was really surprised how much I ended up like this movie. It was really a movie that has improved and improved. Like all old movies, it tends to start a bit slow, but as soon as you get into the story, it's the characters you've been experiencing with this movie. The movie really has a great story that involves espionage, though the movie does not start like this. It begins like a typical crime thriller with a touch of movie noir. But "Pickup on the South Streets" is not really a movie, so it will soon begin to adopt its own directions. Ensures that the film remains surprising but, above all, truly refreshing to watch. <br /> <br /> I also really like the characters in this movie. None of them are really good guys and all their flaws and mistakes. Really humane. In particular, it represents a great performance by Thelma Ritter, who even won Oscar nominations. It really has to be one of the biggest female roles I've ever seen. Despite its somewhat apparent low budget, it's just one big, original, special little movie that deserves to be seen more! <br /> <br />
