In my opinion, it is a totally romantic masterpiece of Disney. If you ask me, your stepmother (Lucille La Verne's voice) was really devilish. You will have to see the movie if you want to know why. On the other hand, despite the fact that she did a lot of household care, Cinderella (Ilene Stanley's voice) was a very beautiful lady. For me the landscape was beautiful, the cast was well chosen and the writing was strong. Before I wrap it, I would like to say that all those who have been involved in this film are doing very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this absolutely romantic work by Disney to anyone you did not see. You're fine, so go to the video store, borrow it or buy it, go out with a friend and look at it.
