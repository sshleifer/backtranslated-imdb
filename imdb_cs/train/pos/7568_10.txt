I saw it the last day at the festival and I was glad I was stuck for a few more days. Poetic, moving, and most surprisingly, funny, it's a special way. It's so rare to see directors working in this style who can find a special trait and humor in the hyper-real world without seeming to be precious or disturbing the balance. It can seem both improvised and totally controlled. I appreciate the comparison because these filmmakers really exhausted their influences (Cassavetes, Malick, Loach, Altman ... the usual suspects) and found their own unique style, but if you like modern directors in this tradition (Lynne Ramsay, David Gordon Greene) you are in a real experience. It's a wonderful movie and I hope more people get it. If this movie is playing at the festival in your town, go! go! go!
