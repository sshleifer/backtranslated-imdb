Kubrick once again proved his brilliance, now in a terrible-horror film based on Stephen King's book. Jack Torrance is a man of his forties, married, with one child and past trouble and alcoholism. Overlook Hotel in Colorado interrupts services in winter due to extreme weather and is a well-paid job for the person taking care of the facility during these five months; and Torrance, who was trying to become a writer, considered it perfect. But manager Torrance advised loneliness at this spot in the winter, potentially dangerous, and told him that a trustee in the past had gone mad and murdered his family. Even before they got there, his son Danny, who has an imaginary friend who illuminates him with the future (shining), knew that the place was not good and he did not want to go. Once installed in the hotel, it started well, but within a month Jack began to behave strangely, irritably and depressed. At this point we know something happens but I do not know when and how. Scary things happen, like the appearance of the two twins who talk to Danny and someone who has violently attacked him. They are not alone here. Later Jack began to see other people and immediately felt good to them as if they were his family; among them known psychotic manager Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that he has to kill his family because they are "intruders" at the hotel. When I received this order, Jack set out for a target, and many of the most awesome things I've ever seen happen. The end is spectacular and the audience remains interested and shocks until the last moment.
