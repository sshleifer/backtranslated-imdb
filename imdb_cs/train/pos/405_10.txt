I have been a fan of Xu Ke (Hark Tsui) for many years since school. This film is the best movie for years. I do not think that "action" is the right genre, though there are lots of events and KongFu scenes. Wait, did I mention that this is an ORIENTAL fantasy? please keep in mind that DO NOT use the Hollywood formula to rate this movie. And for that person who "acts" around, I do not blame you because you're still young and you need to know more about "culture."
