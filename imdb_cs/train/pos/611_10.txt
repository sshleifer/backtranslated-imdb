I believe that anyone who is ultimately responsible for creating / approving a trailer for this film has completely taken possession of it. NEVER I know he wants to make this film out of sight and everyone who really saw him (I know that) absolutely loved it ... Advertising campaign is shame / disaster / mistake. <br /> <br /> Open at # 4 for ... <br /> <br /> # 1-Rush Hour I did not see, average IMDb score 7.4. <br /> <br /> # 2-The Bourn Ultimatum, which I saw was a wonderful movie, but the third week out, the IMDb average score 8.7 (I deserve to say). <br /> <br /> # 3-Simpsons movie I saw, good movie, but 4th week out, IMDb score 8.1 (a bit high in my opinion). <br /> <br /> # 4-Stardust, average IMDb score 8.4 (lower than Bourn, but it was our 3 weeks). <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Should it be promoted as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasy / fairy tale and is not advertised as another fairy tale? That's bad :( Anyway ... Now that I'm fucking furious about it ... Awesome movie, go to see it!
