I have seen this movie several times in the comedy center. This movie was pretty good. It's an exciting adventure with David David's life, which has the task of taking King Ohtar to give the US a military base for balancing power in the Middle East. Some good jokes, including "Sunnygate". I also loved the final subject very much. He gave me a great political spirit. Ten out of ten was my rating for this movie.
