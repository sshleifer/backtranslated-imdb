This is one of those films that make better trailers than full-length feature films. The concept was really cool and different, the humor was unique, I just felt the lack of opportunity to put this punk into this movie. So many lines and gags were left hanging for too long, endless, and really did not leave me laughing. Wilson, Wilson, Farris & Thurman were great. Wanda Sykes was unusable in this film and needed more exposure and more opportunities to turn her figure into more time on the screen. 7 out of 10 for me, more of DVD rental. I've also been looking for some feel-good music video during the end of credits, something that has become a brand name for these romantic comedies, la Something about Mary, to meet my parents, but again, I was lightly feeling a little cheated by the fact that this COULD was a much better movie with a little more music and punchier punch lines. It seemed to me that it was RUSHED in theaters.
