At first I saw this movie without knowing anything about it. I just knew that Joel Schumacher did it, and that was enough for me. With a friend, we took a look at the Danish Film Festival, which is called Night Film Festival, which is a lot of different films, which after a few hours of the festival are specialized in shooting movies that would otherwise not be mentioned by Danish theaters. /> <br /> My friend and I went to see it and we were surprised how real it looked and that it really hit the string with our feelings, we were really caught in the conspiracy without being able to figure out what a great plus in our book. The film is recorded in a style that reminds me of the Danish 95 "Dogma Initiative" initiated by four Danish directors including Lars von Trier (Dark Dancer). In conclusion, the film really worth seeing that it gives a different look at how it was for the American GI Joe to come out of school and is expected to serve his country in a battle far from home. Also Colin Farrell is exceptional in this movie I have not seen before, but I can not wait to see more of it. <br /> <br /> Lars P. Helvard
