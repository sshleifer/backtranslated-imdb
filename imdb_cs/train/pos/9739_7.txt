I enjoyed watching this movie, especially because of Simon Pegg, who quickly became a solid box for comedy films. He is hired from his dead-end street in London when he publishes the work of NYC media mogul Jeff Bridges as a writer for one of his celebrity decorations. After paying his posts, he gets to the higher grades of celebrities to write hackdom ("seventh room"), where he gets to be a little celebrity himself. The story is very funny and Gillian Anderson plays an impressive supporting role as an advertising agent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> On the way to success, it will find the real meaning of love etc. <br /> <br /> The land plot aside, the movie was very entertaining, mainly thanks to Simon Pegg, Jeff Bridges, and Gillian Anderson. Kirsten Dunst was good as a love affair. The rest of the supported cast has done a good job. <br /> <br /> It was a good comedy that's worth being avoided in the theaters.
