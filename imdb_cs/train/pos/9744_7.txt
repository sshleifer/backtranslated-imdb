"Yes, Georgio" is a reckless and entertaining film / comedy that includes beautiful settings and beautiful music. It's not my favorite movie, but it's a movie I enjoyed more than once. Some reviewers have suggested that if you wish to enjoy Pavarotti, it would probably be better for them to pick up an opera DVD. Although full opera could be a better representation of Pavarotti's opera talents, operas often require costumes and stories that completely conceal the appearance and character of the person. "Yes, Georgio," Pavarotti allows Pavarotti to use his speech voice and display personality and character in a way that would not have been the operation. Many reviewers seemed to think the story was unbelievable; I do not agree. Huge talented people can be both self-sufficient and charming - enchanting enough to engage intelligent and beautiful people. In addition, people who differ greatly from each other often get a glimpse of themselves and positively evolve from interacting with people who drag them or are in a direction they can not choose. Georgio and Pamela become more open-minded parts in relation to others. Relax and let go of a visually and phonetically rewarding film with Pavarot at the peak of vocal abilities. The final scenes from Puccini Turandot stand alone for us to get there.
