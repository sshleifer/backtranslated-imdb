With movies such as "Wallace & Gromit" and "Chicken Run" under the belt, good people from the other side of the pond, Aardman Animation, now present us a bit of their twisted humor in the form of "Creature Comforts". <br /> <br /> Deriving from the short work done at the beginning of his career, "Creature Comforts" is a theatrical performance where conversations from the context are removed from the context and an animal of some kind is added. <br /> <br /> <br /> Aardman Animation walked across the country talking to people with harmless questions like: "Are you a liar?" and then speed up things a bit to ask about their sexual life. The answers, though seemingly boring and secular, are really quite fun when you understand that dialogues are at the forefront and animals are added later. <br /> <br /> How many of these animals look like the person who made the statement? One of the characters deals with what she's looking for in a woman: "I like it." is insect, Walking Stick. <br /> <br /> There are two dogs who discuss the smell and smell while they are sniffing at the poodle when they talk about the different smells of a woman. <br /> <br /> There are two birds in the cage. When the "wife" tells the litany that her health is, her long-suffering husband stands by her and says nothing. Though it may take a while for "Creature Comforts" to know that it's "legs" it should find a place on television for those who are tired of ordinary. While there is more reality show than Carter has pills for the liver, "Creature Comforts" is unique and definitely worth the attention. Some of the humor may seem a little rude, it's a clay that captures the attention of children (like the old Batman series of the 1960s, jokes are pretty good, kids do not get them) and these are jokes that are for adults.
