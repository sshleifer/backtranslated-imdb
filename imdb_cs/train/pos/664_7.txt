Crystal Stories: And everything in the house starts on Christmas Eve when Elizabeth (Mary Ellen Trainor) kills her husband Joseph (Marshall Bell), pulls her body out and prepares him to the well, but misses the important news bulletin on the radio that says , that the tortured maniac (Larry Drake) dressed as Santa Claus escaped from the local mental institution and has already killed several women with Elizabeth next on her list but has other ideas and tries to turn her seemingly dangerous situation into her advantage ... Tales from the Crypt was Season 2 Episode 2 directed by one of the regular executive producers of the Robert Zemeckis show and all over the house is a decent watch. Scenario Fred Dekker was actually based on the story that appeared in the comedy "The Vault of Horror," and was originally adapted to the film as one episode of the British horror anthology film Tales from the Crypt (1972), starring Joan Collins as a murderous wife here is Ellen Trainor. This particular version is good enough, but it does not do anything else or it's a bit too linear and predictable to be considered a classic. After only 25 minutes, it certainly moves at a good pace, the story is just about that macabre and generally provides decent entertainment. This time, the Christmas theme of opening and closing the Crypt Keeper (John Kassir) complete with the usual game. <br /> <br /> Director Zemeckis is doing a good job and there is a nice winter atmosphere with a touch of Christmas influence. There is not much gore, someone has some poker in the head, somebody's face is cut with a pillow, someone has a shoulder with an ax and there is some blood, but in general it is not such a graphic. The game in a small cast is quite good. And All Through the House is not the best story of the crypt, but it's decent, yet it's worth the attention, but after the comic book story & the original movie version of 1972, do we really need or even want?
