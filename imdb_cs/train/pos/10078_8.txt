It is a story that could have taken place anywhere in reality, under the right circumstances. Street entertainer takes the attention of famous opera stars and friendships. An aging entertainer finds / purchases a child who hands over his art. From there, we follow us in the difficulty of their demanding but free life along the river. On the way to the city, he performs and has a certain acquaintance. Despite times and influences, man is kind and good. In total, there are performances of the first, especially Xu Zhu, which portrays a street artist. The child (Renying Zhou) is beautiful and strong and keeps clear prejudice. The two protagonists, together with the support of the great opera singer, Major Lianga (interesting androgynous Zhao Zhigang), portray a very interesting story of forgiveness, sadness and love. Some have mentioned the remote similarities of this film with BA WANG BIE JI (FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE); but this movie can not stand alone, any similarity is at best remote. <br /> <br /> My only humility with MASK OF THE KING is the end. It was weak, clich√© and as gentle as the hammers. The audience was packed in the story why there was unnecessary manipulation? What a shame. Bring the fine film so far away just to get away from the emotional (and cornered) pathos. Frankly, this movie was good, instead of classical, it was supposed to be. In addition, KING OF MASKS is still very good at your time. I was happy that the Shaw brothers are still producing good movies. Highly recommended.
