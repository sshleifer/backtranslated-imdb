This game is very addictive, I played it an hour straight until late at night, but also the fact that you can not save the game when you are in the universe, contributed to it, I sometimes played to avoid losing some game data. So yes, "Freelancer" is addictive, but also quite faulty. I was also very bothered by the fact that you could not skip any scene, because sometimes you had to watch the same scene after a few minutes. A great opportunity for me to multitasking my e-mail or talking to my friends and other things when I had to wait for that scene to end. <br /> <br /> The story begins to promise, but you get more and more ridiculously. Also the game ends up pretty sudden, at least it did for me. It is quite obvious that they are hoping for the upcoming continuation. I do not know if there is a continuation of the works at this moment, but I'm sure I will most likely choose one once it is released. <br /> <br /> The game is very easy! Even for those who are not familiar with flight games. To be meaningful, every fool can play this game. Yes, some levels are fairly tough and require a lot of effort. It took me about 1-2 weeks before I could complete this game, which might be too short. But thanks God for the possibility of multiplayer! This allows you to continue playing short missions as well as a single player game once you have finished them. <br /> <br /> Although much of the mission is the same, it simply stays cool <br /> <br /> The graphics are good, but it's nothing revolutionary or anything else. <br /> <br /> Addictive game, but beware of her mistakes. /> 7/10
