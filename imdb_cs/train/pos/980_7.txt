The summary line above, which was spoken by James Cloud (Robert Preston) and his brother Tom (Robert Sterling), says all about it. Jim, AKA Kid Wichita, has a way to do things, just trouble, usually leaving the dead body where he was. He is not such a mentor, Tom, who imagined a younger brother, Jeff, who likes what he sees in Jim, especially when he defends his ranch against local Texas. <br /> <br /> Loans Begin 'Introducing John Barrymore Jr. Younger Brother "in this first performance It seemed a bit weird to me, especially when Jeff was almost instantly engaged in.Around eighteen at the time of this film, he has a disproportionate resemblance to Sean Penn.No stranger of personal and legal problems during his career, like the alienation of my family, I was curious to see if his daughter Drew Barrymore had ever seen this picture, and I'm inclined to think that I was also struck by the idea that Robert Sterling looked a little like Roy Rogers early in his career, he knew that Sterling had been in the television series "Topper" in the early 1950s, just because of his role in George Kerby, I thought he was out of place in the West, but it could have been, his character being encouraged by the ingenuity of his brother in trouble and provides some support for this less typical story. Small subplots are full, including John Gall (John Litel) with her son Sheriff (who Kid Wichita kills) and the marital conflict between Kathleen Boyce (Cathy Downs) and her husband Earl (who Kid Wichita kills). Chill Wills rounds off the main cast as one of Tom Cloud's hired hands and numbers in a somewhat predictable final. What is not quite predictable is how it will eventually end, and for this reason, the West gets the points behind the less traveled, and therefore is not as formal as a plot like a bunch of good brothers / evil brothers of the West. In combination with the eclectic casting of directors, it does not matter what I would recommend, even if you have to endure some jump cuts and careless adjustments that I have experienced with my copy.
