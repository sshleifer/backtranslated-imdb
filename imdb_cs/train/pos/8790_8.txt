Merry film. I saw this film at the Mardi Gras Film Festival in Gay and Lesbian Sydney, Sydney in 2002, and laughed from start to finish. The game was soft but very fun. I'm not entirely sure of the "real world", we can not get it here, but the film sticks out without understanding this show. Heather B steals every scene in which he appears, especially when dealing with his seldom speaking red star. Highly recommended. I would like to see that this will be released in the future on video / DVD.
