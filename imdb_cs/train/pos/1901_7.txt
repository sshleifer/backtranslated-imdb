It's hard to put your finger on it. In essence, I suppose it is a comedy about a drunken drunk who falls in love with a (relatively) poor girl she wants to take with the risk of his family denying. <br /> <br /> It has fun moments, romantic moments and moments. Dudley Moore is funny and somehow trying to develop her own character, Liza Minelli is a compelling foil that is appealing to him, but John Gielgud steals the show as a terribly sarcastic butler of Arthur. <br /> <br /> But great fun with an unforgettable soundtrack and ran for nearly 3 months at our local fleet.
