I really think I should do my case and have all (horror or cult) movie-buff and go to this movie ... <br /> <br /> I did that! -excellent: very atmospheric and disturbing and frightening ... <br /> <br /> It's incomprehensible how they could make such a jewel of a movie with a very low (reading - not!) - the budget they had .... <br /> <br /> Synopsis from the Web site: "One morning the old man walks into the woods looking for his nomad who seeks instead a child without parents and a deadly murder ..." <br /> <br /> this site (IMDb) is not a trailer, but I leave here a link to the pages of the movie itself where the trailer is quite disturbing, so go and check it out. .. <br /> <br /> www.softfordigging.com
