Okay, so I'm not looking at too many horror films - and the reasons are movies like Dark Remains. I captured this (surprisingly full-featured) DVD and scared me stupidly. In fact, I'm the only extra that I thought the DVD was missing was a pair of new pants. The next day I told someone about it when I realized that I really saw about 10% of it. The rest of the time I watched the pizza on the coffee table - nervous that my girlfriend would catch me if I actually covered my eyes. Several times I looked boldly at the screen, so I jumped so hard that I decided not to give up again. The film is solid and the situation of the characters was really urgent. The simplicity of the movie is what really caught me - it's just a forest, a cabin and an unused prisoner - and a lot of darkness. I was most surprised by the fact that, while it probably was not more than a million dollars, the make-up effects really looked the way it was! It is also obvious that it is a film created by someone with great love for film making. Sound design and music really took advantage of my surround system, like many movies in Hollywood have never done. I noticed online that LA Shriekfest received this film - a really great success, and I think the festival saw the clear talent of the creators - and probably much more of this film than I did. <br /> <br /> Increase the sound, turn off the lights and if you want to keep your girlfriend - order a pizza.
