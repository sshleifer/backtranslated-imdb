John (Ben Chaplin) is a lone banker who lives in a small town near London. Although he turned to the Russian brides agency on the Internet. She chooses Sophie (Nicole Kidman - the guy could be lonely and shy, but he certainly has a good taste, is not he?) And when they met, he realized he could not speak English. Communication is essentially gender-restricted (again, imagine what a terrible situation for that guy, you just have some sex with Nicole Kidman!). Two Russian friends visited her birthday. Then a lot of surprises will happen. I like this movie: it's almost impossible to be "labeled" at first. Is it a black comedy, action, thriller movie? I believe that all decisions are right. Nicole Kidman is as beautiful as usual and I am very curious about her Russian: does she speak Russian in the right accent or just pretend? Anyway, I thought it was a fun movie. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Isca Perfeita" ("Perfect Bait")
