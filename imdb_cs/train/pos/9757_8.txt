Richard Willaims is an animated god. He was defended by the direction of this producer film. The final product is a very uneven movie with a very complicated story, but some amazing moments of animation (such as "Greedy" by Emery Hawkins). Joe Raposo's recurring music will not help. It was made on a wide screen, so VHS does not show it in fame, we hope to have a DVD on a writing DVD. Still, it is worth watching some charming animation.
