I fell in love with this quiet action drama. Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could play so well. He was born out of childhood to know only about war and fight, and Todd (Kurt Russell) is thrown out of the planet after he was obsolete by a genetically modified soldier. <br /> <br /> The podium is set and another classic action action icon was born - SOLDIER. Not Rambo, not Schwarzenegger, not Bruce Willis, not Mel Gibson, not Jason Statham - Kurt Russell has this role and has become completely his - original, courageous and too human. I miss the fact that the sequel has never been done. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> <br /> http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
