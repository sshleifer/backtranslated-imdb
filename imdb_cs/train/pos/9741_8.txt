I was pleasantly surprised to discover that How to lose friends and stolen people was not as close to the comedy that brought me a trailer. I quickly became absorbed in developing the narrative and was still entangled. Moving more visual humorous content was, as I thought, in place. (I think I had the impression that I witnessed Pegg's attempts to really return the lost control "in real time" in this case). In other moments, it was time to share the main reflections of the main protagonists (ie Pegg and Dunst) of how the events touched and what led them to where they were now. All the characters were well occupied, to some extent interesting and in themselves, and generally quite decent. (All seemingly ruthless ambitions tended to be tempered by good natural resilience.) Fun, intelligently sketched, brilliantly controlled and well-engineered film that I strongly recommend.
