"Spaced Invaders" is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I do not understand why this film did not get better criticism, it's funny, harmless and sweet. I watched for the first time when I was 11 years old and I really fell in love with it ... Two days later I got it on VHS :-P So far I showed it to many friends and they all liked it but the film previously no one knew. I think this is the problem, almost nobody knows, so almost nobody can not enjoy it ... This movie has never had a chance, it's sad that "SI" really has the potential of a comedy like "Monsters Inc." or "Space Spheres" . Okay, a little disliked - What I really meant to say is that if you ever want to laugh off your head, look at it! Even if you do not care, it's worth watching! -> Prepare to laugh!
