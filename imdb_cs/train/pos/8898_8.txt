The 1960s is a great movie (I saw it all in one night) about the hippy movement in the late 1960s. Though the name would otherwise suggest, the first 5 years of the 1960s are not really important in this film. The main character of the film is Michael, a political activist on his way to the US against the Vietnam War. There he meets his girlfriend, Sarah. Michael's brother Brian goes to Vietnam to fight (what a surprise!). He returns from the war, and changes in "Tom Cruise, born on Thursday, July" look like and then into Hippy. His father is a pro-Vietnamese military type guy (that surprise !!). Michael's sister Kate conceived from Rock & Roll and escapes from home and is in love with San Francisco in the summer. The end is very poor (my father becomes liberal and everyone is happy) but I let this slip out of my vote (the rest of the movie is very good!). <br /> <br /> The performances of the actors are pretty good and the soundtrack of the movie is absolutely great. All the major events of the 1960s are in the movie, as well as murders on JFK and Martin Luther King, as well as great hippy protests, Summer of Love and Woodstock! Take a look at Waves "Woodstock Speaker" Gravy (what we mean is breakfast in bed for 400,000!) As a first aid at the Woodstock Festival! At the end of the 1960s, there was a beautiful movie about a beautiful decade! 10/10
