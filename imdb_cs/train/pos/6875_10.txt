When I was chairman of our college cafe, it was one of our work tasks to review groups and films for student activities. One of the best things to do in 1972 was Groove Tube. The initial assumption was that in theaters where television monitors were located across the audience, it turned out that Broadway was off-off, so everyone had a great place. It was supposed that the suit will change regularly - a Saturday Night Live, keeping the thing fresh. They decided to become a film for distribution. I believe the developers said it was the first time Chevy Chase was in the movie. He watched him go naked, even though the forests were blackmailed. Like many of my reviews before, it was Saturday night alive live than there is. I highly recommend this vid. I told my 13-year-old son about Kok Clown - He can not wait to get a copy!
