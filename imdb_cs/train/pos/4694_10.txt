If you're a fan of Airplane movies, you have to see it! Set in the 1920s and 1930s Johnny Dangerous has not only great actors but great lines. "to collapse the data wall, destroy the wall and destroy the data wall # @ $% # @ $." "You should not hang me on Johnny's hook" or "Sounds like Johnnys get laid down". It's definitely a spoof of James Cagney's old movies, and he's a lot to refer to. It's a great scene when Jhonnys goes after death and has a priest ready to escape. Listen carefully to the false priestly reading, it's quite funny. Another great scene is when Dom Delauis plays. Look at his reaction to Johnny after asking the Pope, he said a lot without sound. I recommend this movie to all who like to laugh or are old fans of the film.
