The film as a fun is very good and Jimmy Stewart is as good as Chip Hardesty, with well-executed teammates Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton. But the film, directed by legendary director Mervyn Leroy, was constantly scrutinized, and the approval of scripts, as well as every aspect of the film, to clothing, was carefully monitored and controlled by J. Edgar Hoover. Not that J. Edgar Hoover had nothing to be proud of. His leadership from 1924 to his death consisted of the best investigative services in the world. But in 1959, Hoover began to take care that he had been expelled and had begun gathering writings about powerful people to make sure and protect his little kingdom. And he was determined to ensure that no film about the Bureau showed even one wart. The films show only ongoing successes and glosses about the failures that have taken place and the role of the Bureau in witch-hunting in the early 1950s. Enjoy the story, but with your tongue firmly on your face.
