I lost my father at a very young age. So young in the fact that I have no memories about him. Over the years, I've been doing many things about him. One of these things was that he loved the west and watched Bonanz every Sunday night was an absolute ritual for him. I myself remember the end of the show when I was 8 years old when the show ended in 1973. Watching this show over the years will somehow make me closer to my long-lost father. It has all the right elements to make the show successful, laughter, tears, the edge of the seizure of your seat, and even annoy you. the memory of the original run of the show, came shortly after the death of our beloved "Hossa" Cartwright, Dana Blocker. One special episode and the end of the final credits captured Bloker's image and faded black and I can also remember my oldest sister with tears in the eye looking at it. I remember it as if it were yesterday. For my late father, who is not here to say it, we love bonanz. Before we live Cartwrights.
