"Foxes" is one movie I remember because it is a portrait of teens in the late 1970s. I'm exactly the age of Jodie Foster and I joined this movie. It deals with frustrations, temptations, relationships, and youth rebellion. The soundtrack is great with inspirational rock, such as "More Than Feeling" by Boston and sad numbers like "On The Radio" by Donny Summer. The music of my late teens. Yeah, I always remember this, even if it was not huge.
