In my case, I liked this movie because when I saw it, I found more than I expected. I think it's one of the few animated films that have been thinking about the themes even after a long time I've finished. He talks about death, vengeance, and hell in such a way that he gets to you like a blow to his face, and even appears to be suffering from dream dreams in the middle of the movie. That's what makes this movie so good: the ability, unique in Don Bluth (the director), to play with human feelings and make them love or hate characters. That and the fact that she has so many good characters, like Charlie and Ann-Marie, is that in a sad but happy end you have to say, "I have something in my eye" to hide others. Everything I said is just some of the good points in this movie. As for the others, you have to see them in your movie very sincerely. Don Bluth, thank you.
