Many contributors reported the age difference between Stewart and Novak. She was 25 and was 50 years old when the movie was released. I think this difference does not matter to a thrilling drama such as Vertigo, but it depends on a romantic comedy. We can easily understand, that is why his character would be attracted to her, but it is less clear why she would be attracted to him. The film still works as a light romantic fantasy. The scene he's looking at over the cat's head, her dark painted eyebrows and the sound of her buzzing and cats, is the real charm. It's a little shocking when the scene moves to the top of the Flatiron building and we see the age difference very sharply. As soon as she hugs her, she pulls her fingers in her hair, but stops her movement and just presses her toe to his toupee.
