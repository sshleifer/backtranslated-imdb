Robin Williams is doing everything to combine comedy and pathos, but he looks a bit breathtaking. Donald Moffat is well known as his father-in-law. Jeff Bridges, however, is great as a quarterback, and Holly Palance and Pamela Reed are amazing and carry the film over most of their harsh places. It's a nice time, but it's no more.
