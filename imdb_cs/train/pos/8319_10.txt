I was five years old when I saw this music movie for a family vacation in St. Thomas in 1977 and immediately fell in love with him. 27 years later, it's still an original inspiration for achieving my goals that I have done since then! <br /> <br /> This tragic story of the hard-core "backstage" of the entertainment industry in the late 1950s, "Sparkle" successfully describes the struggle of three young nurses seeking their place in the sun. This story could easily become the biographical tale of many young Australian artists about what could happen when things seem to be getting too fast and that role models are not available to help us. Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, the soundtrack carries a conspiracy with each song. Being exposed to situations that almost do not have the choice of a strong long-term decision to reach the ultimate sacrifice to get ahead, all three young girls, Sparkle, Sister and Delores, are the different ways when you have decided to achieve your ideal opportunity as your contribution to society. This movie could arise with the thoughts of creating "Dreamgirls" on Broadway and Mariah Carey "Glitter," 25 years later. As an original member of both shows, I have seen many similarities in both Sparkle stories, as well as "Saturday Night Fever," "Glory," "Flashdance," and off-Broadway broke the hit "Mommy I Want to Sing."
