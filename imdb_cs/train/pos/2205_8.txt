Your average gardening variety, psychotic nutcase, (brilliantly written by Stephen Sachs) will be reflected in the Dayton Hall University, which is closed for demolition, from a variety of young "adults" (a very busy term). (Daphne Zuniga makes her ignorant and unfavorable film debut here as Debbie, a bimbo who has a head crushed by a car!), Heavy corpse worth 10, OK make-up f / x by Matthew Mungle, a couple bloody murders (baseball balls, chicken wire strangulation, standard drilling through the head, such a scary thing), overcoming surprising distortion that was later copied to Intruder, Christopher's "Hellraiser" scary score) Young, mild smidgen from minty nudity female sex and incomparably incompetent directions from Jeffrey Obrow and Steve Carpenter (who also blessed "The Power" and "The Kindred"), this funny slice'n'dice of atrocity is spreading like a good offer of deliciously soothing and fun.
