It was a favorite childhood - I remember seeing it on TV and it was excited every time. Now that I am an adult and have my own child, I wanted to introduce him in this classic movie. We looked at it last Friday, and he liked it. During the struggle with Aboute with a giant spider, my son's son overcame and took my hands - it was really scared. "Will he kill a spider, Pop?" Just look, you'll see. He has no historical framework to talk about (eight years), so that Baghdad, under the grandson of Harun al-Raschid, could also be Oz under ozma. I think he really liked how many heroism and derring-ups were committed by a thief and not an adult king. In fact, if you deconstruct the narration of the movie, the king is a thief's helper, not a hero at all - which must be very satisfying for creative, adventurous young boys. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a timeframe - I suspect that at the time of eleven or twelve, my son finds out that it's dirty or any word that the next generation will use. The love story is barely one-dimensional - as the cynical friend said: "Why does Ahmad love the princess? Because the story requires it." The willingness of Abu to come into danger (repeatedly) for the helpless, lovingly affected king is equally unlikely. But to learn about such things when accepting flying mechanical horses, fifty spine grenades and the temple of the ubiquitous eye would be fatal in the extreme case. Satisfaction with the vision of the prophecy fulfilled at the top of the film is huge, just as the last shot of Abu triumphantly takes off on his (stolen) magical carpet, looking for "some fun and adventure at last!"
