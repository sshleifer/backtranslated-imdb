"Erendira" is a film from Mexico that is rarely spoken. The film exists only in low quality VHS format. It's a pity that this DVD did not release this movie. "Erendira" is amazing and gorgeous with magical realistic images. "Erendira" is based on a story from the novel "100 Years of Solitude". Erendira constantly dreams and cools the house of her grandmother. Her poor grandmother, played by Irene Papas, forced her to prostitution to pay for damages. The whole city gets a piece of Erendir, so to speak. Though the subject sounds harsh, the film does not use sexuality. This happens in a mature artistic way. The film also has some amazing costumes. Some of the unrivaled aspects of the movie that excelle are the origami birds that convert to real birds, and the golden orange with diamond in the middle. Erendira is an amazing film that can even humor. This is definitely a movie that deserves a special DVD release. As Espanol says, "Es muy muy bien !!! Excellente!
