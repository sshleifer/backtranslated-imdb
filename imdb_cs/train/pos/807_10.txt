Dear readers, <br /> <br /> The last battle between the rebellion and the empire. The second star of death is nearing completion, and when completed, it will be a doom for the Rebel Alliance. Luke Skywalker, now the Jedi Knight, returns from Tatooin with Han Solo and Princess Leia, now revealed as Luke's twins. He agrees to attack the Shield Generator on Endor's Moon Moon, while Lando Calrissian leads an attack on Death Star. Few know that the most important traps were laid for them, and the Emperor Palpatine himself personally oversees the construction of the other star of death. <br /> <br /> The return of the Jedi is my favorite of the original trilogy. He has action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic acting, marvelous combat scenes, and amazing music by John Williams. Mark Hamill is now ripe with the Jedi Knight, away from being a naive farmer, and in his place is the calm and relaxed Jedi who has decided to save the galaxy. Leia is still great in this movie, just like Han and Lando. 3P0, R2 and Chewie are doing their roles on T, while James Earl Jones is still the biggest villain of the movie: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid is also an excellent villain like the twisted and brutally ruthless Emperor Palpatine. The action sequences of this movie are incredibly amazing and sword fighting is serious and fragile. John Williams scores are still cool and improves the film by several levels. <br /> <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD Collector
