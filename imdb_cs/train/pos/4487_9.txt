"Fraidy Cat", the fourth of these cartoons, is good. At least I like it so I'm surprised it's mixed reviews. This is more a scary story than a funny story, even though it has moments of comedy. The atmosphere is dark and scary. Loss is another strong element. As for humor, it's mostly dark humor. <br /> <br /> In this short film, Tom listens to haunted radio shows at night and is terribly frightened because he is a ghost, something he believes. While Tom is afraid of death, Jerry watches everything and can not help, but laughs all the time. In fact, Jerry quickly finds a way to torture him more and more. Using a white shirt and vacuum cleaner creates a great "spirit". Tom lives the most terrible experience of his life. Although Jerry scared Tom for no good reason, the way the story was made ends in a ridiculous manner. In addition, there is no violence again because it is one of the oldest cartoons Tom & Jerry. However, I do not know that the joke from Tom's 9 lives is nearly vacuumed in the vacuum cleaner. When Tom finally finds out that it's all Jerry's scheme and that Jerry's fools out of him, Jerry is "caught in the cup" (he deserves to be discovered). Still, Tom has an unbelievable patience before the reaction. Angry looks at Jerry for about a minute. Funny is that Jerry invites Tom to laugh at him and takes about half a minute to realize that Tom is looking at him with a very serious face. Jerry tries to be funny, but Tom does not laugh. Overall, this is another, special and remarkable experience Tom & Jerry.
