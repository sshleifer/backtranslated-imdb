This heavy, often violent West in the Peckinpah / Leone tradition is surprisingly directed by Andrew V. McLaglen, whose predecessors (especially those who played John Wayne) were predominantly in the John Ford mode. It's surprisingly traditional (good guys / bad guys) and incredible up-to-date. <br /> <br /> Heston depicts the former captain of the Arizona Territorial Police, Retired for a Year, (Michael Parks) and is looking for ways to enforce law in the early 20th century on autos, telegraphs, telephones and rail. But he soon meets the threat of the past - the half-breed psob (Coburn) whom he gave more than a decade ago for a train robbery that killed four guards. In the subsequent shootout, Coburn's wife was killed; and so Coburn is the worst revenge. Includes kidnapping and finally raping Herson's daughter (Hershey) with him and his gang. The result is tense and violent persecution over the mountains and deserts of southern Arizona. LAST HARD MEN, based on Brian Garfield's "Gun Down", is in many places violent, including Heston and Coburn, and the rape scene involving Hershey and two Coburn gang members (Quadel, Paull) is probably as problematic as similar scenes in STRAW DOGS and DELIVERANCE. But it does not hinder the psychological approach of the film to the Western genre. McLaglen is able to handle a bloody storyline, and Heston's performance as an aging code was probably the best he ever did in one of his seventy movies. Coburn is especially cold-blooded and both parks, and Chris Mitchum (like Hershey's intended husband) is also doing good work. The music is decorated with Jerry Goldsmith scores of 100 RIFLES and the 1966 STAGECOACH remake, but it still works. Wisely shot in place in Southeast Arizona and using the Old Tucson set, THE LAST HARD MEN MUST soon be released by Fox on VHS and / or DVD. It is a western that deserves nothing less.
