Kimi wa Petto is a cute story about a girl who one day finds a guy inside a box that is out of her apartment one day. Decide to bring him back and fix his cuts. She then leaves a note to eat some food she did, and then go home because she had to go to work. When he returns home, he finds that he is still there. She tells her she wants to live with her as a brother or cousin. In despair he let him go, telling him that if he becomes her pet, he can stay. And as an animal he says he will have no rights, and will not do what she has told him. (not in the perverse way!) She agrees to her surprise, and since then she has been known as Momo, her pet.
