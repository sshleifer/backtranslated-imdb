For someone who remembers Jane in the Daily Mirror series, viewing this movie is a nostalgic exercise. In this context, it is amazing, but younger audiences would undoubtedly find comedy and would like to mention that actors are cartoon characters. The plot is also a bit empty for today's audience, but it reflects the naivety of the 40's and 50's very well. Jane, we need to remember, was part of the escapist fantasy of the war years, designed to strengthen the morale of the soldiers. It has given the double meaning of a "belt" in a career. The story has something to do with the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard. The theme would be familiar to readers at the time, a number of crazy Nazis confused by a few ruthlessly outraged Englishmen and, of course, in the African jungle. <br /> <br /> It's a must see for fans of Jane. For the rest of you, wet tools. <br /> <br />
