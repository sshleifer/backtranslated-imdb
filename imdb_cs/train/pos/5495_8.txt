One of the best documents released in recent years. Some points ... <br /> <br /> 1. Hugo Chavez was elected President of Venezuela in 1998, his support comes mainly from the poorer regions of Venezuela. <br /> <br /> 2. In 2002, Chavez was briefly postponed. At that time, the Irish creators Kim Bartley and Donnach O'Briain in Caracas filmed a documentary film about Chavez for British television. Their film deconstructs the coup and its consequences and traces electrified history going on, outside and inside the presidential palace. <br /> <br /> 3. Chavez wanted to free Venezuela from the free market policies imposed by the United States. Although Venezuelan oil was already owned by the state, it was run for the private benefit of executives who chose to replace Chavez. <br /> <br /> 4. Although it is the world's fourth largest oil supplier, Venezuela remains flooded with poverty, literally sucking its resources from foreign multinational corporations. <br /> <br /> 5. The document begins by introducing Chavez for the first time as president before the coup. It focuses on its popularity with the poor and its various policies that have proved to be popular with local workers in the working class (education plans, distribution of oil revenues, democracy, etc.). <br /> <br /> 6. Chavez was a great advocate of education and printed thousands of copies of the Venezuelan Constitution encouraging children and adults to study and understand them. <br /> <br /> 7. When Chavez came to power, he immediately pledged to redistribute oil gains. This, of course, made the oil companies nervous. <br /> <br /> 8. There was a media war. Six private television stations immediately began to oppose the state television station. They challenged Chavez's motives, mental health, and sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> 9. Without media support, the coup could not succeed. The film clearly shows that repetition relies on media to disseminate information and that messages can be easily made. Under the guise of "restoring democracy", the opposition silenced the state television station, dissolved the National Electoral Commission, the Supreme Court, the National Assembly, and took control of the army. <br /> <br /> 11. Money backed by a military elite (sponsored by the US and the CIA) organized a passage to the presidential palace to make a coup. Snipers were shot by fans of Chavez, but private media stations modified shots, so the reverberation seemed to be focused on a march that was in fact safely diverted. <br /> <br /> 12. The police set off to fire against Chavez fans who are still bleeding along the streets. <br /> <br /> 13. Chavez, held in captivity, refused to step down. Of course, the media / government lied, saying she resigned, but Cabinet members Chavez told the truth to the international community, which eventually got a message to Venezuela via cable television. People rose and pushed for the return of the president they chose to replace the constitutional referendum. <br /> <br /> 8,9 / 10 - This document is too short in an hour. However, it is a fascinating piece of journalism and deals with the form of "media war", which rarely touches. He does a great accompaniment to the "Battle of Algiers". <br /> <br /> It's worth a look.
