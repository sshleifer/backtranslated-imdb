Well, that could be one of the funniest movies of all time and Sandy is giving out the tour! Unfortunately, her career never failed, but she will always be remembered for her three first shots: "The King of Comedy," "The Dallas Doll," and "Without You I'm nothing." She brings to different personalities from New York socialite to Diana Ross to create a biting and jolly critique of popular culture in America. Sexy and wild, soft and sensual, philosophical and melancholic, convinces the audience in every scene and she is actually "really nice." Check out this (if you are not from Iowa), you will certainly enjoy it!
