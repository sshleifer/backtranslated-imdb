Documents of this kind are often very indignant. It seems that this film accepts all opinions and lets the viewer decide what to do with the information provided. Sadly, what conditions these poor people have to work on, this film does a great job pointing to the ugly side of sweat shops. Mardi Gras Movie: Made in China was a good way to show the world how something as small as beads for celebration can affect the lives of so many people in another country. I had to watch the movie for the English class, where we spent the time talking about sweat shops and how some people try to remove them and this movie helped get rolling theme. It was a great, very informative film and I would recommend that someone see it, it opens your eyes.
