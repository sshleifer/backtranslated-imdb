The film begins with a bunch of dead men who move around in individual cells and await their inevitable encounter with the death of an electric chair. Then our "hero", called Tenshu, took his chair, lit it, and then ... is still "alive". AHA! It gives him the chance to choose some spooky soldiers who look really cool: Either we turn you on until we make sure you're really dead or you can go through this door and take any fate ahead. "Our hero says yes to variant 2 and then begins a real story, building on another type of cell (very high tech and very large) where he finds another friend who has also managed to survive the electric boogie-ride.In voice in the loudspeaker tells them they have the freedom to do what they want if it happens in the room It sounds a bit suspicious but the two men accept: What else the two men do not know is that they were put together to awaken the internal urge In fact, unknown background scientists are gone until they decide to kill each other, it sounds weird, but it is all the more important, it will not be revealed, and so it remains unknown. <br /> <br /> But do not worry, it's unknown to attract the viewer to watch more of this pseudoactive movie because it has a completely different approach to the question: How long can you stand with a man who is SOB and you kill him and would you gain freedom? The first lesson, in essence, attempting to awaken your interest will slip out without you knowing it. Then it becomes a rollercoaster ride with WILD Matrix action scenes with a touch of individuality to make the comics from which the film is based. The film is really strange, so normal cinemas can not see it normally. However, the story is fascinating, music is fantastic, and actors are doing their bit (some more than others) to make the movie really unique. If you should be so happy that your cinema or video does not mean that everyone is trying to make major movies and make huge money. <br /> <br />
