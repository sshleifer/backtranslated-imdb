This is the one in which little Ruth Gordon plays the type of mysterious author of the mystery of the murder of Agatha-Christie, who seizes her nephew with marriage to safety. Gordon believes he murdered her niece, and the young man is dying of suffocation as Gordon travels back and forth to New York City. He manages to leave traces, scratches on a few black vaults, and improvised and well-hidden notes. Columbo enters the case, instantly suspects it and solves the mystery by simply using his supernatural mystical intuitive abilities. Oh, and Mariette Hartley is on hand like Gordon's secretary and the future blackmailer. Hartley is, in my opinion, the great daughter of B. F. Skinner psychologist. I'm not sure her ancestor has anything to do with her attractive stomach, which is shown during the dance stomach sequence, but I always admired Skinner. The murder is well-handled. It's a good conspiracy, and none of the artists or crew have anything to do. But the outstanding figure here is Ruth Gordon, just a skein of five feet high. She was over 80 years old and looked at her. There are times when you almost teeters, but she constantly radiates spell. Her acting is idiosyncratic. You can never be sure when it's serious, or when it's giving Columbo and the audience. She also gave some good lines. What humor comes from Gordon. Columbo does not have any of his frequent comic moments. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a nice job for everyone involved.
