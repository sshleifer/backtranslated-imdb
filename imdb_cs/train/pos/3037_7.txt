"MacArthur" begins and ends with Douglas MacArthur, Gregory Peck and Alma Mata at the American Point Academy at Hudson. We see how fragile 82 year-old General MacArthur gave an opening speech to the 1962 graduate class on the honor of serving their country. The film culminates in a nearly two-hour glimpse of General MacArthur's brilliant and controversial career that begins in the darkest hours of World War II on the besieged island of Corregidor in the Philippines at the beginning of Spring 1942. He said he would leave the island for Australia before, before the Japanese army finds it. General MacArthur, for the first time in his military career, almost failed to obey a direct order from his senior President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dan O'Herliha. He feels he will have to leave his men in their highest hour of need MacArthur reluctantly, along with his wife and young son, did what he was told only to interest him in reminding the war. It was the reason that his escape from the death or capture by the Japanese led General MacArthur to use all his influence to acquire the FDR two years later to launch a large invasion of the Philippians instead of Formosa. he backed his promise both to the Filipino people and the thousands of American prisoners they left behind. He will return and come back with the power of the US Army and the Navy to support their promise! Within two years until the Philippine Islands invasion, General MacArther, South Pafific in a number of brilliant island hop battles that isolated and suffered hundreds of thousands of Japanese soldiers hunger. The general has suffered much less US military loss than any other Allied commander in the Pacific War! <br /> <br /> In 1950/51 in the Korean War, General MacArthur achieved his most famous victory and the worst military defeat. After exhausting the progress of the North Korean army in brilliant and perfectly executed, invading US Marines suffering less than 100 casualties, invisible invasion of the left hook at Inchon, General MacArther felt invincible by sending US / UN forces under his command over the Yalu River, Communist Red China . He told his subordinates that he was facing the threat of a massive land attack by Communist Chinese troops, General MacArthur, but he pressed as long as this attack did not take place by the United States and the United Nations Armed Forces on tapes. The uninterrupted waves of Chinese Red Units have forced the United States to stabilize with its own life in the Big Bug Out in 1950, leaving all its equipment behind the North Korean border and even leaving South Korean capital Seoul! This proved to be one of the greatest military disasters in the history of the United States, when US forces in the Korean War lost a record number of thousands of lives on the first day of November. 29/30 1950 - Communist Chinese invasion! Shocked and humiliated in what he allowed, mainly because of his own arrogance, it happened that MacArthur went into an offensive not against the advancing Communist Chinese and the Nocorian Force, but his own commander and chief of the president. Harry S. Truman, Ed Flanders, in which they do not have the courage or the courage to do what to do: Start the invasion of China's nuclear weapons if necessary to prevent his soldiers from crossing the Korean peninsula! For Pres. Truman, who picked up General MacArthur's garbage when he was running out of his mouth in his head, driving the war by not going all out, just like MacArthur wanted to be the last straw against the Red Chinese! On April 11, 1951, Truman unceremoniously rel. Gene. MacArthur from his command as the highest commander of the United States / UN forces in Korea! Over. Truman's bold, but very unpopular decision, too, when he did not do the MacArthur war strategy in general, prevented the Third World War from fighting with an ally of the Soviet Union-Communist China - which at the time - like the US - had an atomic bomb! Over. Truman's controversial decision to pop up a very popular General MacArthur also cost him his re-election in 1952 with his votes so low - in the mid-20s - that he retired - in March of that year - from the US presidential campaign! <br /> <br /> At a time when the political and military climate in the world changed in how to lead future wars, General MacArthur's misfortune was. With the horrors of the nuclear war, now, in 1950-51, it would be a national suicide as if General MacArthur wanted against the Red Chinese, which could very much affect the nuclear holocaust that would flood not only the USSR and Red China, but the whole world! It was an important fact of a future war that General MacArthur had never taught, because the A and H bombs had not yet been invented in West Point. Back to 1962 we now see that Gen. MacArthur, after completing his opening speech at West Point, became an older and wise soldier, just as he left his American military, an older statesman in his sense of war and utter vanity. One thing that General MacArthur taught at an early age from General Douglas MacArthur Sr, who had been his lifetime, was that a soldier like himself should be the last war - a problem among peoples. This is the soldier who must fight and die in it. It continued with the advent of the nuclear age for a lifetime when Gen. MacArthur finally realized how right and wisely his father was the winner of the Congress Medal, like himself.
