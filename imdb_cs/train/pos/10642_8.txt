I just saw the retention night and I liked what I saw. It was a great fun movie. Dolf looked great on Bike. He also looked good in this film as compared to his other recent films. It is now in pretty good shape. The story was fine and the other actors were also successful I would not say this film the best but its still good film. But he also had his share in the problems. The first was the way the bullets flew everywhere and even when they were fired at a point of empty range, they missed the target. They should show that PPL escapes bullets better. Another problem I had was the way the students broke through. I do not know in which school students can swear by the teacher's oath and even in class. The third problem was that bad guys had very little. They should be more bad. The last problem was certainly the fact that the file looked jolly, but it was due to a small budget. Overall, the film was a good movie. I loved it. I would recommend others to look at them. P.S. Now run the DEAD cop. (Some of them were cool too) <br /> <br />
