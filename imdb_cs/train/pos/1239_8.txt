I think the movie was pretty good, all the while it adds to my "classic collection". I believe I've seen other posters that resemble some people who choose it to be just a movie. Perhaps some of the more esoteric points contradict "logic," but a large number of religious affairs received "on faith" do not benefit from the scent test. If you accept any faith you sign up for, you can definitely accept the movie. It's just me or someone else noticed that the Aja-Yee Dagger is the same obsessed knife Lamonte Cranston had so much difficulty in controlling the "Shadow". No mention of this in the movie trivia section for one movie here (IMDB), but I bet the dollar on the donut is the same thing.
