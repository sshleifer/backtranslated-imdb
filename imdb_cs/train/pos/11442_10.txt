<br /> <br /> Because I am not a poet myself, I have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this document. The trouble-free movement of Goldsworthy, which shapes the beauty of nature into your own work, is breathtaking. Be careful that you hold reeds together in a rack that hangs out of the tree for a few minutes close up while talking about your work and then receives a paycheck when the camera cuts wide shot. Be overwhelmed by working with it, and then realize that little when a mild breeze runs across the web. Genius Goldsworthy seems to know no boundaries, because his inspiration is nature itself. It is a substantial change of nature, where its work, though complete in its own sphere, is all.
