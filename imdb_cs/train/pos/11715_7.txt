This is a cute little horror spoof / comedy featuring Cassandra Peterson aka Elvira: The Lady of Darkness, the hubbest horror hostess of all time. This was supposed to be a pilot vehicle for Elvira and was so successful that it was won by NBC. They were filming a pilot for a television series that would be a busty black babe, but sadly sit-com never did it around the pilot phase because of his sexual links. But this movie is very funny. Elvira is the current Chesty Morgan and Queen of Unicorns. This film was followed several years later by the unbelievable "Elvis Scary Hill" that was to take Roger Corman's old films, but falls on his face. Watch this movie instead of a much more fun experience!
