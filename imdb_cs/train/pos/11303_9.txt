The first Visconti film has all of its visual perception and flawless technique, accompanied by impressive performances by Massimo Girotti as a handsome drifter and Clara Calamai best, as a fabulous, furious Giovanna. Remake several times as "The Postman Rings Twice" but never better. I can not believe this was the first male movie! It shows somebody's trust in the zenith of his career.
