My first performance on "Whale Music" was the Rheostatics album I bought around 1993. I read notes and the band said the album, which remains a significant place in its collection, was inspired by the Canadian author Paul Browning. <br /> <br /> I picked up the book a few months later and devoured it! Wonderful reading! Since then, I've read a book many times, every time I find some new element of Desmond and his desire to finish the whale music. I found the film in 1996 on video. I did not have a lot of good experience with the Canadian film, but it worked for me. Claire's role might be different, but overall, I think Paul Quarrington's vision has been transferred from the book to the screen. Maury Chaykin gives moving power as an isolated genius. The film deals with family relationships, love and finding someone who understands. I would highly recommend "Whale Music" not only to music fans, but to anyone who ever lost something or someone, and tried to find a way back into the world.
