Let's truncate a long story. I loved every minute. Rich fantasy in the real Arabian night style. There's a bad magician, pretty princess, genie, and everyone lives happily after all. Modern Hollywoond certainly has one or two things to learn from this classic. Wailing: Special effects are quite dated (loved Sabu with djinn legs, though!)
