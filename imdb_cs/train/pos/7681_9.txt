Sexploitation of the child is one of the most serious problems our world faces today, and I was afraid that any film on this subject would be directed directly to scenes of a sexually explicit nature to shock and disturb the audience. After seeing "business" and "Holly," one movie made me really want to see a change in international laws. The other felt like a bad attempt to cry for five minutes with emotional music and strange suicide. <br /> <br /> I do not believe that this question becomes Hollywood's tear-jerk is a useful or necessary strategy to be taken and I have to praise the Holly brand for unfortunately being forced by these children withstand. The "business" fell apart between serious and stupid scenes that included the death of a cat that came after the pictures that represented the children being forced to commit some horrific acts. I found out that he is not addicted and sometimes insulting. If I wanted cheaper laughter, I did not register for a movie about child trafficking. <br /> <br /> For anyone who wants to watch a strong movie that actually means something that I would propose to save money on a cinema ticket for the Holly release.
