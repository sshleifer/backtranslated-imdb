The sudden effects are 4. from Dirty Harry and one of the best features of these films is that they really do not qualify from one film to another. So, Sudden Impact gives you more excitement over the life of Dirty Harry Callahan. This time, Harry tries to resolve a series of murders on vacation. Harry is always at work, as it seems. Clint Eastwood plays Harry when he plays all his actions, slow, deliberate, and fearless. As the first of Dirty Harry's film to be filmed in the 1980s, the sudden impact is a bit out of the 70's that features the first three films. This does not mean that the quality is less. Bottom Line: Surprise with intensity and impact, sudden Impact is another good addition to Dirty Harry.
