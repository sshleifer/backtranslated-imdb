I bought a DVD set on Amazon.com's recommendation based on my other interests. They reached out with this nail on their heads. I remember watching the show when it was on TV, but she always wondered what happened to her. Ten years later, it's like watching for the first time again. Lucas Black as Caleb Temple and Gary Cole as Sheriff Lucas Buck are great together, although they are somewhat rivals. Almost Representative Good (Caleb) and Evil (Sherriff Lucas Buck). I have never really understood exactly what Lucas was supposed to be, but let me just say, he has some special abilities that I do not think would have been granted to them. He can ring phones, write them up, or even cause emotions to change man. However, there are several episodes where he really becomes a good man in spite of everything. Overall, this is a great series that, like many others I can think of, was canceled before my time. (IE Point Pleasant, Threshold, Nowhere Man and SeaQuest DSV only a few names). Steven King The Dead Zone seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to be doing it. There's nothing suitable for watching on TV. This is because everything that deals with Christianity and Satan is considered offensive and must be immediately taken out of the television. So I'm going to buy DVDs and watch shows that should still be on TV, but they've been introduced to television by religious fanatics so we can watch "high-quality" shows like Family Guy and American Dad and The Simpsons pile of crap).
