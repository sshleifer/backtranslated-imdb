This movie from 1939 tried to make use of the much better Michael Curtis film "Angels with Dirty Faces". As Ray Enright directs, the only interesting thing is how these kids redeemed compared to what's happening with youth in today's American cities. The film is worth seeing just for the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan who showed they are well paired together. Dead Ends have bigger parts, because the conspiracy focuses on them rather than the older ones. <br /> <br /> It is curious how arson was used in the same way as some cautious landlords in New York in later years. It was the fastest way to convert property around without having to deal with the social problems it created. Today's climate with so many weapons is a new reality. Young children from the story looked more like pranks rather than criminals. How times change!
