A slow but beautifully rendered story of the American Revolution. Griffith's narrative seems to be much less difficult than in his earlier historical epics, and his work in the table is fully integrated into the action. Lionel Barrymore is a complete pig, Neil Hamilton is poor but delightful, and Carol Dempster is ... well, Carol Dempster is wrong with Griffith at this time, but he is not often enough to slow the pace and drama. <br /> <br /> Note that the trivia for this movie says it originally came in slightly more than 2 hours when it was first released, but there is no cut that runs for more than 90 minutes. However, the release of the DVD was introduced at a slower rate of fps which increases the tension and brings it back for just over two hours. <br /> <br /> Far better when it comes to telling the story than audio versions such as PATRIOT. While not so good at Griffith's best league, like WAY DOWN EAST and BROKEN BLOSSOMS, it's a great way to spend a few hours.
