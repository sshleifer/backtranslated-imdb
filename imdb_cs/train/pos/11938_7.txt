I like movies like that for their spirit, no verbs intended. It's a decent and clean film about a baseball team that lags behind and a young fan wants to win because his daddy cripple said that's the only way he'd come back for him. <br /> <br /> The spirit glowed in two ways: a funny cast with Danny Glover and the young Joseph Gordon-Levitt and the heavenly hero Al taking the dynamic form of Christopher Lloyd. It's an energetic film. It brings you to the smile and really engages you in the sport. <br /> <br /> This is my catch. the only thing I miss a little is these sports movies that will turn you into an unexpected fan of the team. There is nothing wrong with that. I find it strange that I should leave the movie when I think angels are strong, cool, when my true loyalty is, like that, in the Toronto Blue Jays. It's interesting, really. If it is just a movie about a kidnapped child team, then it's okay.
