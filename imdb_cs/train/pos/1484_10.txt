"CASOMAI" was the last movie I saw before the wedding just last year. <br /> <br /> It was also the first movie I searched after I was married because we promised to offer a copy. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's not reality except fiction. To those who wrote that priests like "Don Camillo" do not exist in real life, I recommend them to visit my priest Pe. Nuno Westwood, in Estoril, Portugal :-) <br /> <br /> For all the others, I would encourage them to see this movie before and after "I am doing!" day :-) <br /> <br /> Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal
