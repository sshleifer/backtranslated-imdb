My favourite movie. Oscar-caliber work of all involved, both before and behind the camera. The script is perfect and, unlike the novel, is working on the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs quite satisfactorily. Carefulness with which other prominent figures have been attributed is a tribute to writer Peter Barnes and intense visual beauty should be awarded the Oscar for director Mike Newell and cameraman Rex Maidment. That's Josie Lawrence's best work by far, and changed my mind to Joan Plowright. When I watched this movie at least 50 times, I did not find any error in it. The music of the famous composer Richard Rodney Bennet is a miracle.
