A well-done story about the spirit that will give you lungs and some beautiful fears. The story is slowly developing, creating an atmosphere until you are ready to see the woman in black. You will not forget her when you see her. No gore, no knives, no hockey masks - just a well-built story that is best seen at night with the lights out.
