Bottom line - the best romantic comedy ever. This film meets what all the great movies are doing: creating the world and the time we want to visit again, and making us happy that we are part of the human race. When I was blue, this movie lifted my mind and made me laugh (and that is still true in many ways - always fresh). All actors are in the highest form. Characterization is so dead and the characters are so well together that you forget the actors (usually with Matthau, Robbins and Ryan). Supporting cast is always brilliant: Fry ("agae", "total pygmy package"!), Jacoby & Saks & Maher (three theoretical physics as "Greek chorus" - "Time does not exist" "something we can run from NJ" , Shalhoub & Whaley (Robbins Chief and Associate at the Petrol Station) and Curits (Eisenhower - how many comedies does Eisenhower have?) Don You miss this overlooked treasure.
