I loved this show from her first broadcast and I always enjoyed watching each episode every week. Conspiracy, characters, writing, special influences were excellent! After that, the science fiction channel once again stuck and canceled a very entertaining and well-written show. I say I'll bring it back, I know all the actors will return. I would suggest buying a DVD, that's it. I hope sci-fi executives get the word about these comments, and realize they need to be more involved in their audience. I see only one show on this channel, (Ghost Hunters), but I'm pretty sure it will soon be canceled.
