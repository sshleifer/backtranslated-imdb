I went to see the movie that awaits a pleasant relaxing time in the theater with her younger sister. Instead I had to really control myself to convince her that I was not afraid of it. In many ways, there is still a child's story, but a scenario that has plenty of potential. It could be one of the most awesome movies if planned for another audience.
