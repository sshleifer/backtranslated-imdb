I'm quite a fan of most of the films that were based on Stephen King's books - this is one of the most awesome and memorable. I just finished it when I repeated it for the tenth time, and I still like my heart and scary. <br /> <br /> The scene where Gage is at a certain collision course with a monster truck is one that excels. And "no justice," which little Miko Hughes told her at the end, is a touch of brilliance. <br /> <br />
