Rohinton Mistry is a multilayered novel that seemed impossible to adapt to the screen, but the resulting film is full of passion, emotion, humor and patos. The story is somewhat slow, but there is always something on the screen that captures the audience. The film perfectly captures a precise time and place with accurate precision. All the actors are Indians - little if known to the "Western" audience - but they are happy to look, especially a girl who works very convincingly. Do not be deferred by title and summary of songs - this is a movie that appears on the big screen. We have something to learn.
