On the winter day, December 28, 1986, two men at the age of 14 hired a movie. "Hmmmm, Police Story, looks interesting," "Who's Jackie Chan?", "He never heard of him." Two hours later, after watching the movie in shame, we wanted to know more. 16 years later (and heavily from his pocket from JC!), The film still catches me like no one else. Okay, maybe I have that weak spot because it was my "first" (Cannonball Run does not include !!) JC movie, but it's a great movie. It has all the classic elements of JC, Action, Humor, Action, Heart and ACTION! Some comments state that it is dated, it was made in 1985, of course it is dated! But then it must Jaws, Casablanca, Singin 'in the Rain and The Godfather !!!!!! Without movies such as Police Story, where would be Hollywood action today? PS set standards, many scenes have been stolen for use in other movies. To truly realize this, you have to see it on a wide screen, otherwise you like a movie (yes, it actually falls off the bus around the corner!). If you have not seen it yet, see this movie now !!!! <br /> <br />
