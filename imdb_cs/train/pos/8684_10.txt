This is one of the first and best Columbus, starring Robert Culp and Ray Milland. Robert Culp appeared on another Columba, as well as several other villains, including Patrick McGoohan, William Shatner and Jack Cassidy. Ray Milland also made a later appearance. Ray Milland is convinced that his beautiful wife, played by Patricia Crowley, has a matter, so we hire Culpa to investigate. Culp is on the side of the blackmailing company, so he gives Milland a false message and threatens Crowley with real if it does not pay. In Culro House, they get into a huge fight and murder. Enter Culumbo. <br /> <br /> Culp does everything he can to get Columbo out of the trunk, including a job offer, but Columbo is from him from the start. <br /> <br /> Excellent episode.
