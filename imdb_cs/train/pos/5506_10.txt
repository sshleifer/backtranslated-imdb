I can not fully understand why one of the "reviewers" has given this document "0" other than for political reasons. No, the film did not spare the two sides of the story, but then one film in favor of Chavez against the tide of propaganda against it should be seen as an attempt to balance the narrative overall (especially when the history of the CIA intervention in Latin America in fermenting civil unrest - the Google archive and B. Covering the clearly false scenes of Chavez fans who shot in a non-existent opponent in this country and elsewhere. What's most amazing about this film is the fact that filmmakers stayed in the presidential palace all the way, even if the coup - documentary - pictures of the coup on both sides !!!
