Wow ... I do not know what to say. I just watched seven pounds. No one can scream like Will Smith. This person is very pleased with the variety of human emotions. This movie was skillfully and beautifully finished. We rarely find such intense humanity in Hollywood. It would be comparable to the words "Pay It Forward" and "Crash" in terms of the light and dark show in such a rough way. He definitely takes a long time with you and gives you a lot of thought. I have a deep love and passion for movies like this one. Most often it is a "bad end", but rather a seeker of truth, which includes emotions, raw life, and something more than the smooth one all around. So I do not mind a bit of pain at the end. True, life is not always happy. Sometimes it just is not a happy end you think it should be. Many people were able to live a happy life, even though the love and life of one was lost. If you are someone who looks a little deeper than others, you will love this movie!
