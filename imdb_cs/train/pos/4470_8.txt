Similar to "On The City," this sailor musician on the coast of holiday does not fall into later classics in terms of tempo and quality of songs, but has his own charm. Kelly has three fabulous dance routines: one with Jerry, "Tom and Jerry" a cartoon toy of glory, one with a little girl and fantasy sequence where the Spanish lover is determined to reach his mistress on a high balcony. Sinatra, playing Kelly's shy, inexperienced friend and Grayson, a woman who serves as a love interest for both men, does most of the singing. Iturbi offers fine piano games. In almost two and a half hours it's a little too long for a light musical instrument, but it's not dragging.
