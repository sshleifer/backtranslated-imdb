Personally, I completely love this film and a novel (first I read the book and decided to see the movie). First of all, the story is truly original and unique. Also acting is great and I love casting. Judd Crandall (playing Fred Gwynne) perfectly fits his role and really sells it. There are also several hook lines thrown there (Idk if they were to be rusty), but they really relieve the mood and provide a good laugh. Maine's atmosphere is really a perfect place to shoot this movie and it attracts you all over the film. Not only will you love her, but you will want to see her again and again, I recommend 100% fans of horror !!
