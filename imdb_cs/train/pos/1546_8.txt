I've seen this movie before or before it was released 36 years ago (1969). Although I can only recall now that I realized it, I wanted to see it again. Parts that I remember right or wrong include mustard gas in the trenches and Suzie Kendall as a German spy offering some sexual favors at the back of a closed truck to get military information from him. The musical score was incredibly memorable, and the emotions were mixed in the Gone With The Wind league and I would like to hear it again. There must be some commercial or copyright reason why this movie is not available. Someone knows why? I doubt it has to do with a lack of quality or interest.
