Bruce the Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, the average person who feels that God will spoil his life. God confronts them and shows Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, someone with God's power can get worse. Bruce the Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first class and looks at home because God and the actor bring the story well. Jokes are almost always on target, though sometimes they attract a little too much on Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the film really portrayed God, not only that, but also a black man. I thought it pretty good, especially with brilliant Freeman. There are some merry scenes, such as the opening scene of a cookie, others lacking a slightly but still good movie goal. 6/7 of 10
