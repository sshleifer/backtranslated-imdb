I do not think I have to tell you the story. This has been said for years and years. So I will share my feelings. I first saw Cinderella when I was five years old. Since then, I have been a child of Disney in a good way. Animation now seems childish and old-fashioned, but now it's part of her spell. Now at the age of High School Musical and computer-generated images, people seem to have forgotten the genius and magical nature of early Disney films. Fortunately, I was born before, so I was introduced to this classic. And it seems to me, no matter how old I am, I returned to the five-year-old VHS watch. Which is Disney's real charm.
