"Bend It Like Beckham" is a film that was very little in the United States. This was probably due to the fact that the film was heavily British in dialogue and terminology and was much engaged in football (football here), which some may have problems with the relationship also in the US It's unfortunate because this film is absolutely fantastic and deserves a lot more coverage here. I think the essence of the thing (after the dream) is something that many people can concentrate on, and eventually "Bend It Like Beckham" is a film with good attitude and inspiration and really good acting. I was not too excited to see this movie at first, but now I regret not seeing it earlier. I highly recommend this movie!
