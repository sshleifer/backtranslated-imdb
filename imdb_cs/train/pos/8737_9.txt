Critically people say Antz is better. Antz is a good movie, but I enjoyed Bug's life a little. I do not remember the Pixar animation, other than the two Toy Story films, that I laughed. The animation is pure, the story is original and pretends. Voice transitions are what this movie does. Dave Foley is a serious ant that gets into trouble. Hopper is a great character of always beautiful Kevin Spacey, like Haydn Panettiere as Dot. There is also British support from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I could go on and on. The script is fantastic, fun and sometimes even touching. It misses the social message of Antz, but what we have is rock fun. 9/10. Bethany Cox
