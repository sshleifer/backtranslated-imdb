I suppose JEDI is now chronologically considered a very "last" entry into the popular saga, and it's very good, as well as some of them. I liked how this sequel went straight after THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and I appreciated the maturity of Luke Skywalker as a character (and also Mark Hamill as an actor). When they heard so many negative things about Ewokech, they were not that bad. I loved the exciting persecution in the woods, and I felt that with this chapter there were many good emotions. The end (with some new additions, I suppose?) Successfully merges all 6 chapters into a fantastic story of fantasy. I know that many true Star Wars fans hated George Lucas for the changes he made to the original films but were relatively new to these films late in life and did not lose what I did not know yet, I think these 6 films work perfectly as a whole. Oh, and she was missing - Carrie Fisher looked very delicate in her clever clothes.
