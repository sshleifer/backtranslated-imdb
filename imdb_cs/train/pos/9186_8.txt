The disturbed male magazine photographer Adrien Wilde (who plays with great intensity Michael Callan) has terrible nightmares in which he brutally kills his models. When the beautiful ladies start dead again, Adrien is afraid he might be a killer. Writer / director William Byron Hillman combines a calming story with a steady pace, creates a reasonable amount of tension, brings a couple of cruelly effective moments of wild misogynist violence (one woman who has a plastic sack with a rattle over her head lighting), gives a refreshing focus to nicely cartoon and eye-catching true characters, other reasons all in the world's most likely everyday world and fills things with a nice smettering of delicious female nudity. Jana Pettetov√° as sunny and charming love interest Mindy Jordache, James Stacy as Adrien's macho double amputation brother BJ, Seymour Cassel as Adrien's psychiatrist Dr. Frank Curtis, Don Potter as Adrien's fetish gay assistant Ludwig, Pamela Hensley as a devil detective Sergeant Fountain, Cleavon Little as Police Chief, and Misty Rowe as a Bambi Sweet Bubble. Polished cinematography by R. Michael Stringer is an impressive, occasional use of a breathtaking panoramic aerial shot. Jack's sinister score scores also makes a trick. Ricky Tessier as a crazy barman, Sally Kirkland as a skirt shooter, Kathy Shower as the wild female wrestler BJ in the ring, and Frances Bay in one of her standard roles for an old woman. Strong and pleasant picture.
