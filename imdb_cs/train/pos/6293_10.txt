Buster is absolutely glowing in this episode, the only vehicle I've seen at the end of a career that has enabled him to make the physical (and silent!) Comedy that made him famous. He still has the shock of hearing his deep voice in the series - his voice is the only thing I do not like about Buster - but his ability to accept pratfall is still unmatched. He even even repeats some gags he used in the early two Roscoe Arbuckle rehearsals. My deepest gratitude, Rod Serling, for introducing us to this episode and for Buster's genius being full. He did not have a lot of time (one episode) to do it, but that's a touch to the greatest genius in Hollywood.
