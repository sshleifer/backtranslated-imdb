A refreshing "lost" jewel! Through effective dialogue combined with excellent acting to create characters and engage enough to take care of what happens to them. The figures of Douglas and Widmark are realistic heroes. Palance is his usual evil presence. Widmark wins a fist fight scene, a 60-second car ride with a "logical" end and a long hunt on foot that disturbs the penetrating sequence of persecution of contemporary Hollywood. You know how it is likely to end, but tension and interest are maintained all the time. The end of persecution is one of the most realistic you ever see. The movie seems to slowly slow down in the middle, but it remains to reward it.
