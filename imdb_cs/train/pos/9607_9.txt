This is a movie that should be seen by everyone who is interested in being affected or suffering from a eating disorder. It is a surprisingly accurate and sensitive display of bulimia in a teenage girl, its causes and symptoms. The girl plays one of the most exciting young actresses in the cinema today, Alison Lohman, who was later so magnificent in 'Where the Truth Lies'. I would recommend that this film be shown in all schools, because you will never see it better on this topic. Alison Lohman is absolutely exceptional and one is surprised to be able to show the suffering of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder. If the barometers tell us the pressure of air, Alison Lohman tells us the emotional pressure with the same precision. Its emotional range is so precise that each scene can be measured microscopically due to the trauma gradients, a scale of growing hysteria, and despair that reaches unbearable intensity. Mare Winningham is the perfect choice for playing her mother, and she does so with enormous sympathy and a number of emotions as smoothly tuned as Lohman's. Together, they create a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators that resonate with each other. This film is a great success, and director Katt Shea should be proud of it. The only reason why you can not see it is if you are not interested in people. But even if you have the best movies about nature, it's the end of all animals on a sharp edge. Bulimia is an extreme version of how a soul suffering can destroy your body in a madness of despair. And if we do not agree with people who suffer from deep despair, we are dead inside.
