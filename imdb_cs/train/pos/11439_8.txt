OK - when it comes to 2 versions of this movie. Two people - John Korty and Bill Couterie (George was just a producer - he did not actually have a movie in the movie) - only "helped with money" - the "adult" Bill Couterie. John Korty did not like or disapprove of this version (as it was behind his back). Thanks to Ladd's films under the film, they did not publish this film and threw all their advertising cash on "The Right Stuff", hoping they would drag them, ... and it was not. So this movie never had a chance. When Twice got on the cable (HBO) - they showed Bill's reels, and John threatened to sue if it had already been shown (did you notice how the "adult" version was too long?). Showtime has a "clean" version. The version on the videotape and the laser disc is a version approved by John (who holds more power than Bill). It's a pity, really, because the adult version is really better and makes more sense. However, it is very dubious that it will sometimes be released in this release on DVD (or any other format that would be without a bootleg). I apologize for everyone's disappointment. I know all this information because I have been president of the Twice Upon Time Fans (still has many movies - used as a "adult" version) but was stolen - only to have a partial copy of HBO now. 8 star for adult version - 5 for "clean" version. Any other questions you just ask.
