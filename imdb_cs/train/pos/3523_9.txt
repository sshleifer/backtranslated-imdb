A bizarre and great combination of talents between director Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines as a secretary who was trying to save her boss from an electric chair by watching the mysterious "phantom" woman and Franchot Tone as a crazy and murderous sculptor. There are also some fascinating smaller parts that Elisha Cook Jr plays as a drummer as well as other characters that are part of the conspiracy. If you're used to see Raines in healthier areas, you can avoid overboard, especially in scenes with Cook. Franchot Tone also plays someone very different, and although it is not a convincing part, it acts phenomenally. While the plot is too elaborate, the film has a real atmosphere and is very interesting.
