I have seen this film at the International Film Festival in Brussels. I also met the director of the film. I heard Ed Wood wrote a story in 10 years! I'm sure he thinks it's his masterpiece - his triumph. Well, if you take the movie seriously (like Mr. Wood), it's really one of the worst movies you've ever seen. And that's fine. The big joke I woke up in the early morning is that he does not even try to be a decent film. The film does very, very well. The script is full of nihilism and anarchism - a lot of black humor. Billy Zane's role is excellent. You see, it's either high art ... or low garbage. <br /> <br />
