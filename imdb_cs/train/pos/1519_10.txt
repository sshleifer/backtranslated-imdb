Because these movies are ominous, you have to realize that they have to have fun. The film focuses on a house that strangely conceives everyone who lives there. The inhabitants were: the author of Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott (with hair!)), Who pursues one of his own creations; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), who is a bit closer to a wax statue; John Reid (Christopher Lee), whose daughter's cuteness is apparently a facade; and actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee), on the verge of getting a little too much in nature. The "house that shed blood" is really worth seeing (well, the stars Peter Cushing and Christopher Lewis). Besides being pure, there may be some undertones: it could question the question of real horror or supposed horror. As in The Shining, we can ask whether the house / hotel itself remembers past events. And if nothing else, Ingrid Pitt (like Paul's Star) is HOT HOT HOT! By the time she was released, she also starred in Countess Dracula and Vampire Lovers (also with Peter Cushing). Perhaps she - like Barbara Steele - will only be known as the queen crying, but will mark my words: HOT HOT CREAM IS HOT! I'd like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele in some kind of thing. I think the only weird scene (so to speak) is that Denholm Elliott is wearing a pink shirt and a fluffy coat. You read it correctly. What kind of name is Denholm? Oh, okay. Very cool movie.
