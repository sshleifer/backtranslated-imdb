I shouted my heart out and watched this movie. I have never suffered from any eating disorder, but I think it must be a real picture. Alison Lohman is great! It expresses these feelings amazingly well. My teenage years have returned so lively. Anyone who has been through a difficult time as a child or adolescent will be able to relate to this movie. I recommend everyone to see it! <br /> <br /> Music is great too - Now I've discovered Diana Lord. I'm also looking forward to seeing Alison Lohman in the White Ol√©ander because I'm sure he is perfectly suited to the role of Agnes.
