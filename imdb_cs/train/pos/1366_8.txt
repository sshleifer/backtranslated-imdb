Am I the only one who saw the connection between the discussion of Camus' myth about sisyphus and the life of Mary? in the Camus version, one is condemned to spend eternity on a giant boulder that he has to roll down on a hill. unfortunately every time he gets to the top, the boulder slides and ends up at the bottom to start. Maybe his wand is in his eyes, I'm not sure now. in the film loses life trying to fight for life, unfortunately every time he gets some ground he falls and loses everything. the case would be the party that throws where it gets drunk, insults its falafel lover and is practically attacked by liev schrieber. if you question this theory, note how this scene ends by trying to climb the stars while the books fall away, preventing it from progress until it finally ends. the next morning when he wakes up, he's still on the stairs, never reached the top.
