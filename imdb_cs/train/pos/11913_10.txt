This is a great movie for fans of female filmmakers and women's events! I think Sue Price did a great job in this movie series (Nemesis 2,3,4) and turned out to be a great warrior. It has a very distinctive appearance and the will of iron to withstand a strong nebula (Nemesis 2). Although not a great value film and Sue Price's acting skills best suited to life, the movie was in itself something of a wonderful, precious gem for fans of female body action events! Some parts of Nemesis 2 have been copied with other famous science fiction films, such as Terminator or Predator, but that's no reason. It means that A.Puyn shot in this film a very talented body builder who gave all the energy and body talent to show us the best he could do. I really liked the film and watched with such enthusiasm Nemesis 3 (somewhat boring sequel) and Nemesis 4 (a much more interesting sequel than 3). What a pity it did not appear on DVD :-(
