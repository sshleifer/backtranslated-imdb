I loved this movie and I am one of the older people who do not enjoy it or it seems. No, this film is not deep - who cares? These kinds of movies are never. But strangely, there is a message. It is that each of us has the potential to be what we want to be. Parker Posey is great in this movie. I always thought she had some face similarity to Katharina Hepburn. So it's great to see that Hepburn and Posey have been filming Hepburn's The Desk Set. All the librarians, especially those who have a sense of humor, should see Party Girl. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 8. This is not a great movie according to film standards, although there are some nice shots in it. But it's incredibly charming and fun.
