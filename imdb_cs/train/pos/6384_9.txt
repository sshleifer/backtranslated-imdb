It is written in stone that Disney animations simply had to be musicals. Right? Where? Show me. Because I find that this experiment is much more enjoyable because it does not include Disney's five-year standard hockey ride. <br /> <br /> While the story was not as fascinating as it could have been, it was still quite good, pleasant and adventurous. I was hoping a little more, yes, with regard to the subject, but this film is not a bitter disappointment or the total failure it was charged to be. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation is average, but the dialogue is quite convincing, as well as the story line, the plot, the partial conspiracy and the amazing creativity I found in this production. I will refrain from describing the plot as it was done and done, but this movie is well worth seeing if you are a fan of fantasy. It's, in my opinion, the BEST Disney Animated Long-Term Movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
