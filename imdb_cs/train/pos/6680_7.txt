That was different, that's for sure. Check out the cast! Talk about oddballs. William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were stars, although many actors almost share the spotlight, in this chant of superhero-wannabees. The most outraged Paul Reubens of "Pee Wee Herman" glory. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of humor, lush colors and no peace. It's a pretty fun and light comedy that has nothing but wicked characters, everyone wants to be heroes and Superman, Batman, Spiderman, your name. They have talent in strange areas, however, that real heroes do not (and do not want!). It's stupid, but you know it's happening. It's also a movie that you can watch in installments and in fact there is no continuity. It's a long movie for one so hectic, so you can relax here and it's okay. The language was twisted so that children could also enjoy it. In fact, I do not remember any oaths, except for who's in the theater next to me who still said, "What a stupid movie?" I thought it was fun for two hours, but I'd rather watch her on DVD and take some breaks.
