Last week I rented Zero Day from my local video store. I never heard of the movie and I had reservations about it. Just from the view of the box, I knew that the film was an indie film, so quality would be less than a traditional film. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that when I finished Zero Day, I immediately started from the beginning again. The film clearly followed the basic outline of what happened at Columbine High School in April 1999, but what I was thinking was how credible two main actors were. When I first watched this movie, I was not entirely sure if what I was watching was the actual tape left by the Columbine shooters. At the back of my mind, I knew that what I was watching was not real, but at the same time, acting was so convincing that you still had to tease your head. <br /> <br /> The film is disturbing? Absolutely! Are you going to look at the things that challenge you because of the movie? Probably. I think what most people will be worrying about is that they really will have feelings for two main characters, Calvin and Andre (played by Cal Robertson and Andre Keuck). Why is it problematic for some people? Calvin and Andre plan a high school massacre. I know for myself, I felt great sorrow for Andre and Calvin. I had empathy for them because their lives came to such a terrible point. They lost so deeply the cracks that they started on a road that could be stopped if everyone around them noticed how they had succeeded. <br /> <br /> Zero Day is a phenomenal movie. It gives you a close and personal view of the events that most of us will ever see the conclusion in the news. He lets you think about life. And it leaves you confused how people get to this point. A week after I saw this movie, I still think about it. For those of you who have not seen a zero day, keep in mind the following: The movie is independent of little or no budget, and the movie is shot on the camcorder. The material in the film is disturbing. This is not the mainstream of Hollywood, and it's not a happy ending. <br /> <br /> But if you can put everything aside, Zero Day is a movie that will hold with you and maybe help you open your eyes a little.
