"Screaming in the Darkness" is a cinematic cinematic film, scary and unbelievably provocative. The true story of Linda Chamberland, who witnessed a terrible sight in 1980 when she saw her 3-month-old child being brutally taken from her family tent while camping in Australia. Azaria (the child) has never been seen, and the result of her terrible disappearance has caused real life madness all over the world. Meryl Streep the perfect justice of Linda's role as she always does. But the only thing that helps "Shout in the Darkness" never fades is the brilliant direction. Really inspired and accurate view of this mysterious case, tears bring in the eyes. The concept is nothing less than frightening, and then you are left scary, but also inspired.
