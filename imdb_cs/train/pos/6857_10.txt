"Dressed To Kill" is one of the best thrillers ever made. His acting with sex and violence makes this adult film. Brian De Palma again proves why no other director is responsible for using the story telling camera. He controls many scenes without dialogue, and he tells a lot of his story, precisely using his visual and Pino Donnagio is a great result. Filmed in Panavision, the film MUST be seen in a wide-format format, while De Palma uses the full width of the film to tell his story. Cropped on the video, "Dressed To Kill," is hardly the same movie. Strong performances from games, great direction, and perhaps even the highest quality movie scores ever written, make "Dressed To Kill" to be seen.
