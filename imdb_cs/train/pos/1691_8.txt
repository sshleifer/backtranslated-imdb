This movie is fun and suitable for all ages. It's definitely family fun. Casting does a great job, playing people in the Midwest City of Big Bean, Illinois. Where we have to assume nothing will happen, because the excitement (pre-invasion) of the decade is the new (and only) exit ramp from Interstate. The site seems to be appropriately boring and totally unlikely for the Martian invasion. But these Martians are totally inappropriate, even though they are well equipped with an arsenal of appropriately abusive and deadly weapons ... including one Martian eradication set! Mars of the dead move their lines and cast only the right accents, so that viewers and locals want to help them ... leave the country. J. J. Anderson, who plays a very young Halloween duck carnivore, has only great lines. Watch this movie for love and fun; thought-provoking is not. But it is delicate and pleasant.
