The Sentinel contains a kind of milling path and tight / mysterious cliches, but it is raised with some good and tense stimulation. These stories are mostly going through as many permutations as we can carry, so what's left is how good acting is, how smart the setup and bad guys are, how well the main fence is created, etc. ... so Sentinel does a solid job with regard to content. Michael Douglass and Kiefer Sutherland maintain good sound on screen and attitudes. Eva Longoria (the first time I saw her on the screen) brings some satisfactory support. The whole affair of the story is totally unlikely to be a little overtaking, but it deserves it. It is worth seeing if you like this genre.
