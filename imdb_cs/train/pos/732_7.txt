Well, I finally caught up with Rock 'n' Roll High School, almost 30 years after it first became a half-time film sensation in 1979. (Latecomer, I'm probably first to see this new summer documentary, "Patti Smith: "Sometime around 2040!) And no, the movie does not feel dated a bit, and yes, it's worth waiting. It's a very high energy comedy that offers lots of great music and surprising moments. He tells the story of Riff Randell, famously playing P.J. Soles and the battle she and her classmates at Vince Lombardi High are reluctant to rebel against Togar's new repressive director. (Danny Peary in her book "Cult Films" quite accurately describes Mary Woron's performance as "Evil Arden"). The typical teens versus the story of "Establishment" is enhanced by absurd humor (those exploding mice, mouse, Hansel and Gretel's monitors) and some really exciting melodies. Riff is, of course, the most popular fan of the original band The Ramones, and this band prepares the baker's dozen of his greatest tracks during the film, including five at the concert, which is a total explosion. Indeed, looking at Riff furiously dancing on "Teenage Lobotomy" on this explosion may be the most amusing moment. And the initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee, and Marky in her Ramonesmobile, and later by the mocking of the street singing "I Just Wanna Have Something To Do," is quite exciting. The film ends with an explosive confrontation that I would imagine was the wet dream of all children in high schools. Fun stuff really. On the side of the note, Ramones was one of the loudest bands I've ever seen at the concert, so I was very amused to note that the DVD for this movie comes with optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired. How many aging punks found these headlines there, I wonder ...
