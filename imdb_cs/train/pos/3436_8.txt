Endless letters ended in a different world and found themselves in the back of the post office. Here Alice can land in the hope of finding her lost father. What she finds is the blatant soul of her boss, Frank. Silent little Aussie flick that came and went to the cinema. Now you will find her in the deep dark corner of the video rental shop, shaded by fifty copies of this dreaded film GODZILLA. It's a shame because it turned out to be a satisfying film that told a courageous story with strong simple shots and effective performances from both sides. This film succeeds when Garry Marshall lost another crazy letter office DEAR GOD (1996 - USA) and approached the brilliance of not only the bloody Kevin Costner but also the PO JE JIANJU (1995 - China) show.
