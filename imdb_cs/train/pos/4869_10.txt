Not for people without a quick mind or a drop of Balkan blood in the veins. If you do not have one, you can not understand it. And if you do not understand, you can not enjoy it. :) For example, if you think Picasso is the name of a Citroen car, probably, if you see a Picassa painting, you'll just walk around it and decide it's the garbage of a street painter. :) So do not judge before you try to understand it :) Finally, I think it is for everyone with an open mind. Still my N1 remains The Shawshank Redemption! And remember that not all things can be placed in frames. Because there are things in this world that a frame just does not fit.
