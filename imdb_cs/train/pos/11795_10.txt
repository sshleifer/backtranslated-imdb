I will never forget this movie or the events that led to Jonestown in Guyana. It looks so tragic, but it has to be said. Powers Boothe give a spectacular performance as Rev. leader Jim Jones from the unknown, until all madness. He would get him the Academy Award easily if he was released in cinemas. It's a kind of mini-series that you will not forget. You will not forget the image of the cult brutality, control and obsession of its leader. His rise and fall and the threat from the outside world to destroy what he considered paradise. Mass suicide is scary, almost unrealistic for every imagination, why so many people (900 +) volunteered or surrendered Jones's commands. They do not want to make such mini-series where we stay open and hungry to know what happened to others.
