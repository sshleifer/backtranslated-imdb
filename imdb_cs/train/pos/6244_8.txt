Every country that has a working film industry has some sensible (and perhaps some crazy) artist who makes movies that you can fully understand when you're part of this country. I think Hundstage is such a movie. You see the lowest level of Austrian society, dirty, upset, strange, hateful. But they still have enough money to afford fine tuned cars and big houses. And they definitely do a lot of special things that may seem "normal" because they do it all their life. From a normal human perspective, you can now easily watch the film and be disgusted or fascinated and watch a fine piece of art film in Austria. But if you live here and know people, Hundstage is a tumor of society. A society that spreads crazy every day, creates its own rules that no one else understands, throws the social system out of the inside. And you see people. Sitting in the park and standing on the opposite street, queuing in the same line. You may meet them in a bar or disco that you can visit. Maybe you even work with them in your work or you live next to your house. You start to hate them without knowing exactly why. You try to escape - but you can not. Maybe you'll end up like them. But it seems "normal" to you because you are doing it all your life ... Life is not so clear, though Austria is one of the richest countries in the world. He has beautiful people ... but some are ugly. There are a lot of hard working people who try their best things ... but there's also some riding on the back of the others and destroying everything that Austrian people have built up to date. Very pessimistic film.
