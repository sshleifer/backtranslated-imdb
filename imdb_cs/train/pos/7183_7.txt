It's the perfect family viewing series. We gathered around TV to watch BBC America. It's the current version of Robin Hood and appeals to both children and adults. Our teenager and tween-ager both sit with Mom and Dad and look at Robin's next exploitation. We can not wait for the next episode to be broadcast weekly, and are happy to see "On Demand" for free. The wardrobe has a place of today's fashion. Every story has morale. It is funny. Violence is not exaggerated or unnecessary. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with John Williams feeling. It's an old world story that revives the new atmosphere of the world. <br /> <br /> There is so much waste on television from nasty 'realty' TV to pointless violence. You should do it for what it is, and it is an updated "Robin Hood" that can not be compared to the film remorse Errol Flynn. This is a gem that looks forward to everyone. Parents who are concerned about their children who watch too much violence will love Robin's lost taste for war and bloodshed. It's Robin Hood, who would rather try to justify his way out of disagreement than to fight. Marian Girl is also an attractive model for young girls. Rather than standing up and doing nothing, she takes her own role in helping the poor by being a "night watchman." The Sheriff of Nottingham is brilliantly superior to the top wicked, just as she should be a sheriff and looks like a cross between Billy Joel and Tim Curry. Guy Gisborne plays an extremely handsome actor who most women wished not to pose as a bad guy. <br /> <br /> The only question we have is "Where is Friar Tuck?"
