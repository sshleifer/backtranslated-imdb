This movie is amazing for three main reasons. She is aesthetically beautiful. I absolutely loved it. Throughout the film, a bold colorful theme appears with extraordinary costumes and picturesque sets. Photography, which looks very expensive (and probably not), completes the look. I always look forward to the stories about unreacted / lonely groups who are joining and becoming a family. Sometimes they fall into a clich√©, but this is not the case. This group of actors really portrays well-defective, yet immensely sympathetic figures. Alan Larkin is the best (between him, van and road movie theme, I could not help but remember your favorite movie Little Miss Sunshine last year). I discovered Fabrizio Bentivoglio, a very interesting actor, and occasionally I was a bit upset by the performance of Til Schweiger. The opening scene, all the scenes where their tricks are disturbed, are very fun. Throughout the movie there is a mixture of humor and emotions. I really like the end. And, of course, it's the subject of a magician. A good magician will make an audience look where he wants to create an illusion. Which is exactly what the film director does and that's why they call it film magic.
