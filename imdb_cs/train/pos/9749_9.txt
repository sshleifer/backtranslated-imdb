I watch this movie with my mother when I was in high school many years ago. I certainly did not care about the opera at the time, but changed my mind. I enjoyed this movie very much and since then I really enjoyed the opera. I even bought some of my CDs. Who cares about what his acting skills are, basically played himself, which was adorable. He was so charming, so charismatic; I honestly wanted to embrace him. I feel very sad to criticize him so hard. It was so true, he did not accept the people who pushed him around or judged him for his actions. He deserves to be respected and admired for his talent. It will surely be missing !!!
