The title of this movie does not make much sense until you see it in traffic because it's the sound that slows down the young man when he works with his imaginary cart, which is what he does all day. And it's just one of the many special characters in this surreal and sometimes tragic story about a group of poor people in Japan. There are two drunkards who trade with husbands, there is a man with the desire to be an architect and his young son who sends to ask for food. There is a wise old man who seems to be the pillar of reason in everything that is happening around him, and there is a businessman with some serious nervous tik that has a woman who interests him (and everyone else) like dirt. <br /> <br /> There is no particular conspiracy, it really is a lot of stories that move between each other, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic. Overall, I thought it worked quite well, and I've been dying for a long time to see it only on the basis of its description. I was not even disappointed and would definitely recommend it. 9 out of 10.
