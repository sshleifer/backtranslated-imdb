One of the things that interested me most about this film is the way in which characters and their related history evolve in the summer. I suppose the writers wanted us to be interested in characters without forcibly feeding their characters. A prerequisite of using art and craft design and furniture design was a unique theme and / or analogy of what families / siblings are going through in life. The complexity of having twins serve as a substitute father and even a husband added great tension to make this film emotionally interesting. Also, although the story was not one that the masses could directly relate to (ie Jews / twins / family businesses), the themes are fairly universal because each family has black sheep in it. That was very plausible.
