FAST: Ralph Nader, Gloria Steinem, Alan Arkin, Richard Chamberlain. DOUG: When we were disappointed with the original "Tarzan by human drunkenness," we found amongst classmates and historians that the second film, "Tarzan and his Mate," was the best in the series. It is true. I have a huge kick from this movie. Johnny Weismuller returns as the home-swinging beast, an animal-fighting wild superhero, and Maureen O'Sullivan assumes his role as a totally fantastic lady who loves Jane (who for the first time and for the first time carries a two-piece outfit). In my review of 'Ape Man', Jane was quite thrown at her obsession with clothing and constant shouting, but she had redeemed for me. Do not make a mistake: O'Sullivan is the star of this movie and Jane is the most capable character in the cast. He acts as an ambassador between Holt and Tarzan, can work perfectly in the jungle and together with animals, and she knows how to keep the angry pride of lions when out of the bullets. He even has his own jungle cry. The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible. She had trained him fully. Cheeta is pretty charming and takes Martin's cigarette. This conspiracy is mostly a pretext for Tarzan to fight the hottest jungle animals, especially lions, crocodiles and rhinoceros. Effects, though always visible, are much more dynamic and cooler, and they complement action closely. And you can not talk about this movie without talking about the bathing scene. I can only say yes, she's naked. Very exciting things. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Wow. Just wow. When it comes to dirty pre-coding action / adventure, nothing holds the candle "Tarzana and his mother". The inevitable continuation of Tarzan's apes is a kicking, violent and risky jungle. I doubt there will be another Tarzan movie in the future that will have no prisoners like this. It would be hard to find the complete scene in this movie, which would be approved by the code, or Animal Rights-approved for it. The terrible violence does not even wait for a happy couple to appear in the jungle before he pushes the boundaries of today's adventure films. And after T & J entered the picture, there are plenty of early morning erasures and frantic afternoon cruises. You see it yourself if you do not believe me. I love mainly Maureen O'Sullivan in this film. In the first film, Jane looked like an inconsistent walk, just as the writers just did not know how to portray such a figure. But here she is a great precursor for young women from later cinemas. Though he still needs Tarzan's help to get her out of the most jams, he does much more than wait for him to be saved. Her personality is perfectly believable for a woman who lives (relatively) comfortably in the jungle all year round. I looked at it with my mother and I showed her how much Jane Tarzan had "trained" her, as Jeff Foxworthy had said. She's absolutely monkey on her coffee and she's calling. Although there are many optical effects throughout the movie, there are still plenty of Tarzan hair and beast predators that are actually done (mostly). This and men dressed as monkeys are much more convincing this time. ** SPOILER ** The film culminates when the jungle explodes with the shocking orgy of animal kingdom violence that leaves Tarzan and John the only two people still breathing. Though the couple set out to sunset, they will meet and win, I can not imagine how this story will look like the next safari who will hear about the previous group of people who found Tarzan and Jan. ** END SPOILER ** One of the things that still worries me is the smooth, Johnny Weissmuller's cordless point and a nice cognac. In addition, it is a pre-code action-adventure that is absolutely impossible to miss. The Last Movie: It Happened One Night (1934). Another movie: Twentieth Century (1934).
