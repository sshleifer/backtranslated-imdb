It's such a joy that I was following this interesting project. So refreshing and educational. Not only for filmmakers, who can find out what can be achieved in 5 minutes of the screen, but also as an audience who may not be so prepared for so much love in such a short time. <br /> <br /> 20 short films about love in Paris are unique, but some of them, as expected, stand out. I thought Tom Tykwer (Natalie Portman) was the best segment, though they made me smile in the same sense. <br /> <br /> I clicked on "spoilers" to read them enough spoiler. Just look at it. Do not read what I'm writing, but watch the movie. <br /> <br /> And smile.
