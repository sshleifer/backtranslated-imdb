New York playwright Michael Caine (like Sidney Bruhl) is 46 years old and fades quickly; as the movie opens, Mr. Caine is the latest playable flop on Broadway. TV reviewers liked Caine and drunk. Traveling to the Long Island Railroad Caine in Montauk, his place of residence in East Hampton. Finally arriving home, Caine is delighted by the carefully worn-out wife Dyan Cannon (like Myra), unfortunately the high-strung heart of the patient. There, Caine and Mrs Cannon discuss the new game "Deathtrap" written by young Christopher Reeve (Clifford "Cliff" Anderson), one of the former Caine students. A couple believe that Reeve's "Deathtrap" is a hit needed to revive Caine's career. <br /> <br /> "Trap is set for a badly funny Who'll-Do-It." Directed by Sidney Lumet, Broadway's long hit Ira Levin is not too distant from its beginnings. The cast is pleasant and the stories are still surprising. One thing that did not work (for me) was the conclusion that ended; surely it played better on the stage. "Deathtrap" is a fun movie that looks back; performances are dead - but in a later look, Greetings Reeve giving Caine on East Hampton Rail Station should be simplified to smiling "Hi". The place is not actually East Hampton, but the windmill and pond look similar. A very love scene is shocking. But the game was so good, "even a talented director could not destroy it." And Mr. Lumet is not disappointed. ******** Deathtrap (3/19/82) Sidney Lumet ~ Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth
