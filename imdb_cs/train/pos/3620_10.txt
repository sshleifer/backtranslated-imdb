I just saw this movie tonight, at night. It was great!! I am a great fan of sports movies and it was there as one of my favorites. Dennis Quaid was great. (Oh, by the way, Mr. Quaid, if you read it ... my sister lives in Austin where you live ..... and she should buy you a drink once ... well ... she put you a little ... but she did not want it !: C) [not that anyone would believe that ...]) ALWAYS, it's a great movie. Anyone who likes a good sports movie should go out and see! :C)
