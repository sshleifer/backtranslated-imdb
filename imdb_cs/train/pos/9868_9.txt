This is apparently aimed at the same market as Monsters Inc. and Shrek, but is different in its less cartoons feeling (despite the deliberately cartoons of the lead creatures). The story is not one that ends up wearing a huge moral face (it's more like pulling it on the sleeves of a shirt), but deciding to just tell a story about relationships between different "animals". You know the result, but you can not help to get inside. The characters themselves are far more than their voices (the benefit of less famous actors doing voices), unlike most Disney movies. They are well rounded and utterly believable, strange. Group dynamics are brilliantly presented and the revelation of character and peculiarities are gentle and pleasant. You will find that you have rooted them much earlier than you wish. <br /> <br /> The animation is great as you would expect and you will pray for the opportunity to go to the icy film in the movie. You will fall in love with the character, especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and his desperate attempts to bury his walnuts. I started to ask for mandatory goods, especially a polishing toy, just to be disappointed the next day when I could not find anything indefinitely related. Which, strangely, makes the film even clearer. <br /> <br /> Better than Monsters Inc. or Shrek.
