SPOILERS <br /> <br /> According to Jean-Paul Sartre, "Hell is other people". In "The Odd Couple," Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau show just how accurate it can be. Like Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, Lemmon and Matthau created two good friends who chose to live together. As soon as they both slowly become more accustomed to each other more and more frustrated, they laugh quickly and quickly before Felix leaves, so Oscar changes and clearer individually. Jack Lemmon as Ungar is absolutely awesome as a neurotic, cleansing obsessed divorce who cope with life as the only man. Walter Matthau, as opposed to Lemmon's character, is just as good as a writer who just wants to play poker to make money for his baby. <br /> <br /> Lemmon and Matthau are magnificent in their chosen parts, depending on the beautiful scenario of Neil Simon and at the same time because they work well as a team. As two friends who are naturally different in lifestyle, though similar in relationships with ex-wives and children, these two, late, great actors create a partnership that is virtually impossible to recreate. It was so great that the world was screaming for something similar that two years before Matthau's death and three before Lemmon, the characters reunited in the lower continuation. This idea, even if it followed Hollywood's irritating obsession with the sequel, may have worked to a certain extent, but at the same time it would never have come close to replicating the genius of this original film. Finally, it is not really possible to say anything else. With an amazing script, full of humor and laughter, the creators of this film have already hit. Although the most important part of this film is the casting of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison. "The Odd Couple," with his traditional soundtrack (which even won the "The Simpsons"), is an excellent screenplay and is a genius leading man, a tribute to the film and a history feature.
