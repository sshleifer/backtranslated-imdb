I did not expect Val Kilmer to make John Holmes convincing, but I found out that I forgot that it was not a porn legend. In fact, the entire cast in this tremendously underestimated movie has become an amazing performance. As some have said earlier, look for a file of two disks and look first at the "Wadd" document; it will give you a lot of backgrounds about the story that will be useful in awarding the film. Some people seem unhappy about the LAPD video from the crime scene that is contained on the DVD. There are several reasons that could be included. One of them is that John Holmes's murder trial was for the first time in the United States, where such a recording was used by the Prosecutor's Office. If you do not want to see it is easy to avoid; it's clearly labeled "LAPD Crime Scene Footage" in the menu!
