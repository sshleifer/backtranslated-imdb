One of Cary Grant's most enduring comedies is Mr. Blandings, who builds his house of dreams. Though by size, it would be the dwelling of today's Senian mansion. Still Cary had fed up in the advertising field, even though he had a devilish time trying to come up with a slogan for ham with the trade name Wham. popular was the lack of housing in years after the Second World War. Returning veterans of the war claimed to be eligible under the GI Rights Act, which also included housing loans. The problem was that they were literally not enough to satisfy demand. At around the time when Erik Hodgins and the film were so popular, the Congress was approved, and President Truman signed the Taft-Ellender-Wagner Housing Act, which was the first to be made by the government for construction. <br /> <br /> I had my uncle and aunt who at that time built their home, which they began to move in the early 1950s. Like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy, they had two daughters trying to get out of the inner city of Rochester. Their place was not as big as a house in Connecticut with eighteen rooms, still living there for the rest of their lives, as Cary and Myrna most likely did. Of course, it was expensive and the cost is enough to add up and up, threatening to send Cary to the cleaners. Cary and Myrna also have Melvyn Douglas offering counseling, usually too late. It is true that she is sweet to Myrna, and Cary knows it. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy's role is simply extension of Nora Charles. If you can imagine that Charles moves into the country, and William Powell, who has the headache of Cary Grant, the film will still work well. <br /> <br /> Blandings Builds His Dream House still works well as a comedy because the situations are universal. And this review is dedicated to my uncle Walter and Aunt Kate who have lived together in a dream home for over 40 years.
