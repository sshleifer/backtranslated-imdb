Although it was not without his mistakes, this drama was appropriate to show around Easter time. It reminded us of our spiritual self and showed that behind our facades they often hide our deepest suffering and experience. There was a lot of fun in the drama, not least the rap teenagers who provided a better musical accompaniment to the drama than a rather bad background sound. The acting was excellent and Timothy Spall was great again. The climax was very satisfactory, somewhat simplifying. Timothy Spall's "dismissal" of his suicidal wife is trustworthy and reflects the feelings of despair that were present in a teenage girl who hurt herself. The distinction between graffiti and the Muslim was pleasant, but less believable. It was a gorgeous drama that left me and my husband fell down that it was well spent in the evening. Congratulations!
