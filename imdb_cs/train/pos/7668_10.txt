I loved this film for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is absolutely amazing in it. He plays the role of a modern wizard on the handle. (A is absolutely adorable.) 2) The film helped inspire the role-playing game I'm looking forward to, Mage: The Awakening. I showed it on various Larp parties and it's always a big hit. D & D loves and Jeff squeeing aside, it's not exactly a masterpiece, but it's well done and thoroughly enjoyable. The story is quick and engaging in its simplicity, the special effects are quite good for such a low budget and the scenario without being stellar was not too bad and cheesy in all the right places. A good way to spend the evening.
