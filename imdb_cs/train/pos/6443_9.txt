Yesterday I watched this film for the third time. A few weeks ago it was recommended to me. I have never seen them, nor did I notice them, because they fall (so typically) in the "Swedish film" category and those who have emerged (like me) with productions in Hollywood tend to be skeptical of foreign films. Shit, what a paradigm shift! The film touches me because it just keeps its hope that humanity can change better. The Swedish village is a model for all areas on earth where people live together - guided by religion, misunderstanding, lack of courage, predictions, masked brutality, but also the ability to have fun, meet, sing ... externally trigger to tear the masks of all (who keep one) and let them feel that we are all human beings only, with the desire to live our own lives. I can never stop to see such stories because it keeps hope as described above. The five minutes that feature the story of Gabriel's song including her performance is one of my movie events! Thank you, Kay Pollak just in these 5 minutes, which made me happy!
