Generally, I like something light and fun, so I should not be able to appeal this movie. But it caught me from the beginning. The story of family choices and challenges seems to be obvious, but it raises the question repeatedly: "What if it was my family? My choice?" I cried and laughed when they did, because I really felt what people felt, It was difficult to watch places, but it was harder to turn away. The story is true and life is sometimes difficult to watch! It shows what movie makers can do without sex, violence or special effects: a good story is a good story in itself. The best and most unpredictable stories are all true. Just like real life, you really do not know what will happen next, or why people do what they do!
