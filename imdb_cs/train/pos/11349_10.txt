This movie may have a dubious pedigree because it was made for television, but it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. The film and actors have received several awards. It's breathtaking, fascinating and absorbs you completely. The story of persecution for the murderer in the Iron Curtain by Russian people who are willing to risk their careers to try to save the lives of future victims would be a compelling story if it were a fiction - but it is a seemingly true story. I highly recommend.
