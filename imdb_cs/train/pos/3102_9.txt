In the summer I saw The Bourne Ultimatum with a friend and, wow! I've seen the first two movies and I liked them, but the Ultimatum I loved. Matt Damon played Jason Bourne, amnesia suffering from a CIA agent on the run, trying to find out who he is. br /> <br /> As I said, I loved this movie from start to finish, no plot of holes, slow scenes, everything moved correctly and fit well with other films, but in all senses it was much better pieces, car watching, actors and effects I've seen in the action movie all summer, (surprisingly due to Spider-Man 3, Pirates, etc.) But I was not just action in this movie, Jason not only kills and runs. My soul and viewers feel for him, so drama is included. But it does not slow down. Of the three-year-olds that came out in the summer, it was the best.
