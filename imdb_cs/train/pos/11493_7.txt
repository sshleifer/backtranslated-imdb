Unborn is a pretty good low-budget horror film that uses fears associated with pregnancy. It is very well performed by always good Brooke Adams and b-movie James Karen, although the supported cast is relatively average for the b-grader. Gary Numan's music of all people is also good. Henry Dominic's screenplay is quite intelligent for such things, though it's something about mysogy. Rodman Fender's direction is simply adequate and some unnecessary cheap damage. If you are a fan of Adams, whose film career is not nearly as famous as it should be, look at it; it's great, as always.
