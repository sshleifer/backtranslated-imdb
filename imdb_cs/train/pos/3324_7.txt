Some have mastered the difficult task of merging sport with romance. In fact, sport and romance combine as oil and water. So successfully put together two on the screen ... well, that's about the equivalent of splitting the atom. I never thought it might be. I will be the first to say that I do not like romantic comedies in general ... but I like sports and most of the movies about sports. This movie was a pretty good mix of these two. As a baseball fan, I can really appreciate comedic suffering, when Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Falon) is a furious Boston Redsox fan. Anyone who knows anything about baseball knows the Babe curse that has plagued Redsox for 86 years and knows how little baseball is Redsox fans. Farrely's brothers did a great job capturing it and doing it for a good comedy. It was a very good movie that could appeal to many.
