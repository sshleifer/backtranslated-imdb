Undying is a very good game that brings some new elements to the tired first-person genre. He tells the story of Patrick Galloway, an expert on occult and impressive fighters, summoned by a friend to his estate in Ireland to investigate some strange fainomenes. The game is based in Ireland after the First World War, so do not expect to find weapons such as chainguns or rocket launchers. All weapons in the game can be considered antiques, but the real fun in the game is its spells and system. Our hero is ambidextrous so he can use both hands at the same time: casts spells with his right hand and uses weapons with the left. So you can shoot and spell at the same time, which, as you know, is very fun and unique for this game too! The graphics are great and can work very well at the P.C's average performance. Design levels are also cool and atmospheric. Most of the game turns around Covenant and Chateau, but there are many other places waiting to be discovered as you progress. Thanks to the talent of Clyve Barker, the game has a great story and plot (something very rare for the first person shooter) and I said in front of a great and very scary atmosphere, voice acting is also good but not excellent. But the game has two major mistakes. Above all, it is quite linear, so when your mission says, for example, to go to that room, all the doors in the house will be locked away from those that lead to the room of your mission, it can save you time, but it limits your freedom of exploration. Secondly, the fact that all weapons are antiques may not appeal to most fps players who are used to high-tech weapons. As for the difficulty, the game is very well balanced. Most of them are moderately difficult, but sometimes it becomes more difficult, but not frustrating. Overall irregular is a great game. Definitely one of the best fps out there.
