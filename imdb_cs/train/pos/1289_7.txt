First, the film is a genius artwork (film). The story was full of surprises, a small kid pretending to be an adult inheriting one million dollars and how he spends it. I mean how this is destroyed. Walt Disney has really overcome this time. Comedy is usually awaiting, but sometimes it's unexpected. I think this movie was fine or the movie was okay. She also teaches a lot about wise youths and I am really wise and a little time-savvy trousers. But it will also upset it. How the hell can a guy get that guy to the hot police and his father let him go freely. It's like the killer gets free for ten years. If I did, I would get myself with a "staggered jack" (a huge stick that sticks when it really fits on the bench). The kid is really lucky. Back to the story. The filmmakers really knew what they were doing when they shot the film, but it still is not perfect. The game was good and bad. The boy and the woman did not have any chemistry or father, but the brothers were excellent. "The special effects on the other side were lame, plus this movie is not based on reality, I hated it and loved it at the same time.
