Karen goes to the Japanese house as Emmy replacement nurse, a strange woman who sleeps in the day and waking up at night. Karen goes up when he hears the sounds when he comes across a terrifying spirit. They will learn the secret of the house. <br /> <br /> It's very scary! The scenes are shocking and scary! The characters are good. Settings are scary. I love the whole conspiracy! The end was shocking! I paused on the scene where the little boy so loudly devoted himself to the man who found his sister upstairs, and I was shocked. This is the worst movie I've ever watched. I did not see the Japanese version. I recommend it to fans of horror. 10/10 and 5 stars!
