The movie is fine, it has moments, the music scenes are the best of all! Soundtrack is a real classic. It's a perfect album, Let's Go Crazy (good for the beginning, because it's a great party song and a very up-tempo), Take Me With U, The Beautiful Ones (probably the closest R & B on this whole album), Computer Blue (somewhat angry anthem towards Appolonia), Darling Nikki (one of the funniest songs at all, it vaguely makes fun of Appolonia), When Doves Cry on this masterpiece) I would die 4 Baby, I'm a star and, of course, Purple Rain (a true classic, a very good end for this classic album) The film and album are both very good. I recommend them!
