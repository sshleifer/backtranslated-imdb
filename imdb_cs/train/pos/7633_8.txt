Reading various external reviews by Roger Ebert and other well-known film critics makes me hesitate to admit how much I like this movie, even though I have only dubbed the Japanese video version. <br /> <br /> It seems that many critics think it is a minus that the idea of ​​the story has been used before, most great in great "It's a wonderful life." For me, the great premise is a great prerequisite no matter how many times it's used, and I'd like to see more films with this particular premise - a disgruntled man who gets the chance to get a new look at his own life through a bit of "divine magic." I suppose people and critics of more intellectual bending are not so intrusted in the story, but I do not go to the movies to criticize them with the laptop in my hand - I'm going to the movies to get into it and let me take me where they want. <br /> <br /> If you are sentimental like me, you will be well rewarded by seeing this picture. The performances are excellent throughout the movie and the movie was very well-occupied. An excellent choice of music. Michael Caine is great as a sympathetic bartender. Jim Belushi does a great job as "average Joe," a guy who cares if he did not do his life the way he should. Linda Hamilton, always outstanding, is back in place as a loving wife. Jon Lovitz has fun as usual and even surprisingly moving moments in "Mr. Destiny". No, "Mr. Destiny" is not "It's a wonderful life," but who says it must be? In his own terms, "Mr. Destiny" is a pleasant, well-worked, fun and moving movie. I've seen my Japanese dubbed video several times, and I'm sure I'll see it a few more times. If it somehow makes me "low," so be it! I'm just glad I did not expect any "Mr Destiny" reviews before. I suppose I should have the courage of my convictions and give the film nine or ten stars, but I could not help, but after reading all the critical reviews I had doubts!
