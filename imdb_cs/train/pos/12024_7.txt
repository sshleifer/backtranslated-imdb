The good thing about this movie is that it stands alone - you do not have to see the original. Unfortunately, this is also the biggest drawback. It would be nice to include some original characters in the new story and see how their lives evolved. Sinclair, as in the original, is excellent and provides the film with the best comedic moments when trying to deal with embarrassing and embarrassing situations, but supporting the cast is not as strong as in the original film. We must congratulate Forsyth for a daring attempt to move the character and create the original sequel, but the film is finally defective and lacks the warmth of the original
