True fans of the film will love this authentic film. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the trolls who mark this movie as one star and call it unreal. While I do not have backgrounds or come from protagonists' backgrounds, I spent many years working in low-income and working class areas and felt that acting is very realistic and represents how teenagers behave. I do not know what is the basis of other commentaries that the film is "unrealistic". The dialogue is great. <br /> <br /> The low budget of production did not bother me a bit. I felt natural lighting improved the character of the film. Emphasis focused solely on the story and character's evolution, not on a glittering Hollywood background or melodrama. <br /> <br /> I totally bought the motivation and reaction of the character. The game was believable and impressive for both new and non-actors. If your idea of ​​a good movie is Transformers or Fast & Furious, then skip it. If you like a dramatic drama, you'll see it. <br /> <br /> (As for the negative commentators who are "trolls": click on their names and you will see that most of them have no other reviews or just negative reviews.)
