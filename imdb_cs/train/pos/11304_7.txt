I'm not sure what kind of circumstances director Visconti has decided to make James Caine's novel "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (I'm not sure even by Viscounti's acquiring book rights), but the resulting film is certainly interesting. It's not the best version of Cain's story (I prefer the 1981 version), but thanks to the excellent Visconti goal and Cast Clary Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple), it's a must for noir fans. Visconti combines neorealism with annoying sensations with great effect. But the film is not perfect. My main complaint is that the movie is too long for her own sake; the story is moving very slowly (I do not think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think film noir works better with a short duration. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors who are interested in the viewer. Anyway, just as I like this movie and remake, I think no one has made the final version of Kain's highly praised book.
