All of our reviews begin with the following information. My wife and I have seen almost 100 movies a year in the last 15 years. We have recently been honored to receive movie IDs for life at any time and free of charge! So we can see what we want anytime. It follows that CRITICS is counted as ZERO. Your local critics or national critics like Ebert do not really differ from you or from me. The only difference is that they write about the film and are forced to see hundreds of films, whether they want it or not. Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your money for two hours of fun, which is good enough for us! WE NEVER ever listen or read critics. We are only interested in our friends and those we know are the same as we do. That's good. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good. not only good, but very good. Critics are a lot of fools. Just because it's nudity and tongue, it hates it. It was worth the ticket and that's all you can ask for. It is not right? Each film can not be nominated for an Academy Award. Sharon's stone is wonderful and she does a great job in the movie and mystifies me what critics want hell to do
