As a child, I thought this movie was great. She had animals, she had beautiful music and her favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. Now I still love this film for various reasons. He has well-trained animals through various pieces and scenes that look great on the camera. It has a beautiful, well-written musical instrument that fits perfectly into the scene, with the exciting fast melodies and the main motif of the heart that still makes me cry. Even if people are rumbling. And he has a favorite actor Michael J. Fox. <br /> <br /> Based on the book, it is a story of three pet pets, a smart, overly confident and highly paternal lab with the name Shadow, humorous and gruesome - yet clever - a cat with fear of water named Sassy and the street intelligent ridiculously curious and a slightly neurotic bulldog, Chance. Three are taken to a friend's farm when their family disappears. Needlessly and uneasily, pets break out and plan a trip over the Sierra Mountains to the journey of their lives. Great way. So what, maybe home is just across the mountain. But what if it is not? <br /> <br /> I'm suggesting Homeward Bound for people who like three amazing actors that provide voices for lead figures and for someone else who ... yeah, they all go out and watch.
