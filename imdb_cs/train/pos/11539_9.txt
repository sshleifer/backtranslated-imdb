ODD CUPLE is a classic film version of Neil Simon's most famous play about a television journalist named Felix Unger, an obsessive, neat, angry man with his best friend, Oscar Madison, a sports writer, and his wife, Frances, throwing him out of the apartment . Still divorced, Oscar takes his best friend and regrets him from the moment he does it. The classic comedy Neil Simon first came to Broadway with artistic artist Felix and Walter Matthau, who played the Oscar. Jack Lemmon takes Carney in a film version with an unforgettable performance like Felix Unger. Lemmon is not only funny, but so vividly real that he brings melancholy to a thief who is Felix Unger. Matthau, fortunately, had the opportunity to re-create his role as an Oscar, a unique gem of a comic show that provides all-round laughter. This combination of Lemmon and Matthau proved to be comic gold, which was again visited in nine other films. With both of these actors no longer with us, viewing this classic becomes more far-reaching, but no less jolly. Simon's game was nicely expanded for the screen, with a silent prologue recording the winning Felix's suicide attempt. Supporting actresses include Herb Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haines and David Sheiner as Oscar comrades and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as Sisters Piedgon, the blind date of Oscar and Felix. Of course, he later became an excellent television series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman, but nothing like that is the original. Joy from beginning to end.
