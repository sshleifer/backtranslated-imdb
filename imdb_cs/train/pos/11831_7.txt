Despite the amazing and breathtaking animation, it's probably one of the most unstoppable Disney movies I've ever seen, and I often hate Disney movies. The spirit is a wild stallion that has been repeatedly misled either by cavaliers or Indians, who both try to "break it". The Spirit ends in conjunction with the Indian, and that's a story in a nutshell. With the exception of the beautiful animation of horses, neither I nor my five-year-old have been much inspired or enthusiastic about this film. It's ironic that it's called "Spirit," because the ghost is what this movie could use a little more. The special thing was the soundtrack, which was pleasant, with compositions by Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer. And although this movie is marked as G, you will probably have to explain what it means to "break a horse" for five years. I did it. <br /> <br />
