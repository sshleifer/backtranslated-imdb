I saw this film as a child on Creature Feature when I lived in New York City. It was a pretty scary movie, though not as good as Horror Hotel. I bought this movie on DVD and it's different from what I remember, because the DVDs I bought are a few scenes where the actors speak in French and / or Italian and there are no subtitles available. Then the other respondents respond in English to what was said. Totally weird. Also on the DVD box, the names of some actors are written differently than IMDb. In addition, this film is different in that the character Elsie takes her dress and provides naked shot in one scene and in another scene, Julia tries to force Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) to twist her by pushing her to the bed and she kissed her while Steele resisted. This scene existed in the TV version, but it was greatly modified. I wonder if there are any other shots that could be incorporated into remestered ultra-editions? It seems sad that some of these old low-class classics were knotted into bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions. Where are the main cassettes and all unused shots? <br /> <br /> Aside from the first boring twenty minutes before Allen is delivered to the castle, the rest of the movie is pretty good. There are not too many special effects (but Herbert's face is good at Julius Clubs). The scary atmosphere and the strange, exotic and seductive look of Barbara Steele make the movie much better than it should be. I can honestly say that if it was not in this movie Barbara Steele it would be a big zero. Makes the movie ten!
