I rate the best of the Zorro captains. An exciting music score adds a strike to the exciting game on the screen. There is an excellent supportive cast and a mysterious villain who will guess you until the last chapter. Reed Hadley does a great job like Don Diego and his alter ego Zorro. Last but not least is the great director Whitney and English.
