Another Downey must see! If you are an obsessed fan like me, you have to look at this movie! Alex Finch, 22-year-old Yale grad, realizes that the life that has just come is life that left 26 years ago. Alex is the reincarnation of Louie Jeffries, a lawyer who has happily married Corrin (Cybil Sheppard). Louie is killed on her annual anniversary when hit by a car. He asks that he return, only this time in the body of Alex Finch. Enter Robert Downey Jr., a lot of confusion and a lot of laughter. Although this movie is 15-year-old, it still wonders if it is really such a thing as a re-incarnation. And if so, how often do you meet the same life after life. I do not know the answer. But I know you have to see this movie. It's a turmoil, and Downey looks cool in the tux. This movie will believe you in love, and true love never dies. It is simply recycled.
