This film is NOT about fighting cats and mice, as stated in the next note. It's a cat that has exhausted 8 of 9 lives and now lives in fear of losing the last. The cat is nervous all the time and fears death, and hence the name "frady cat". The Fraidy of Cat's previous lives persecute him as spirits who are from different times in time and constantly trying to kill him, but he is most afraid of the ninth life, represented as a 9th-shaped cloud, and illuminates the bolts. very old, but it would be fun for kids if you get a copy. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie almost every day as a child: o)
