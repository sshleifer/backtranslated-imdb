This work is remarkable in its accurate view of teenage life at the time of its realization. Although this is a generalization, the parents of the time were too self-sufficient to be true parents, and those who were at home tended to be too distracting from the real problems their children were facing. <br /> <br /> This film teaches us how to let go, even if it is painful, and makes it a sweet, melancholic, but informed style in which Foster talks philosophically about the feeling of pain in life. I loved the scene. It was actually my favorite scene in the movie. Switching from a funeral to a wedding meant life was going on as we had to. Baio is skateboarding over the goons package and outrunning is supposed to show us the difficulty time is going through, and we wanted to go through them in better times. The whole metaphor "," and the procession of life, is present throughout the film and serves to give us hope. <br /> <br /> I like this movie, although I often do not see it, because it tends to make me melancholy. They should not see small children and probably only those who were raised in the 70s and 80s would like it. Rated 7.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br />
