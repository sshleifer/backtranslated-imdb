Finally, I wanted to see this movie in the cinema. I saw the movie Fritz Langa on the video a few years ago. I hoped the ideal projection conditions would have their magic. <br /> <br /> The conditions were perfect in Cinematheque Ontario. First-class full-length printing. Intertitles in the original Gothic German script with contemporary English translation, accurate without being too literal. Live escort of the piano. Ideal. <br /> <br /> The magic of the movie has been sparkling for a while, but I eventually succeeded, at least for me. This film has no real relationship to the Wagner ring cycle, as I already knew, but some do not have to. Wagner adapted the 13th century. He did not move for his own purposes. Part I of the epic episode of Fritz Lange - "Siegfried" - has many that will be known to listeners to Wagner. Kriemhild's revenge is the story of Siegfried Kriemhild's wife, her marriage to King Etzela (Attila) Hun, and her desire for vengeance against Hagen and Gunther, the new Nibelung, for the murder of Siegfried. The spectacular conflict in this movie is likely to evolve and spread in Wagner's myths to his Götterdämmerung, his Twilight of the Gods and the end of Valhalla. This film stays on the ground. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is spectacular. The massive sets compete with Cabiria's cabrio (1914), which inspired Griffith's "Intolerance" (1916). Their decorations set a new scale in barbaric splendor. There is a huge occupied scarred, harrowing Huns and Art Deco Burgundians. And battles. Battles that never end. <br /> <br /> Kriemhild is very successful in his revenge plan. She can destroy her. Her loyalty to her martyred Siegfried apparently does not stem from love or devotion, but from something closer to psychosis. Lady Macbeth shouted, "You do not know me here." She knew she was emotionally unprepared for what she needed. But Kriemhild does not show any normal human emotions, and nothing will happen with the female principle. She is already "filled with the cruelty of cruelty" to borrow Shakespeare's phrase from the very beginning. Margarethe Schön and her director explain it. I do not want to exaggerate, but the glower is practically the only expression that sometimes "animated" Kriemhild's face. It is the end result of one night. It's obviously deliberate, not just a bad acting. <br /> <br /> What we have on offer is a one-dimensional sketch of the revenge Fury. Some may consider Kriemhild to be a powerful hero. I just see the movie as misogynistic.
