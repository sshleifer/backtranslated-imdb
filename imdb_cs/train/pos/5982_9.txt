One of my favorite movies. It has everything - a swing soundtrack, courtesy of Eddie Clark, ex Motorhead, a lot of action, lots of laughter, a totally absurd conspiracy and the most stunning stereotypes of the 80's as characters. Eddie, a nice guy who wants to stay alone to be different, Leslie (as wet as they come), Nuke (burning rocks), Eddie Mum (pathetic), Roger (geek), and Ozzy as a preacher (sure there is in America?) . Then there are boys (rich, bad and stupid) and girls (loose, futile and stupid). What more can you ask for? Well, first there is Sammy Curr, a rock star, an amalgam of every 80's that you can think of. And what about the rocket burning the guitar? Then there is a scene where Sammi pulls the old lady through the TV screen and smashes her. What is Roger doing? Why do you drop it off as if it did good? My favorite scene is the place where Tim Hainey gets his long reward from Sammy over his wet finger in the plug - a spell! If you were rocking in the 80s or you just love ridiculous movies like me, then check this out. It is available on DVD and very cheap (trick or) to treat yourself.
