After a roughly 7-year rock trip to NBC, it was decided to make just one last installment. The series was in the bubble a few times because it did not have numbers that would qualify it as a buster TV clock block. She always had a strong hard core of hardcore followers. <br /> <br /> It was almost as if the series with the whole title "HOMICIDE: LIFE IN THE CENTER" (1993-99) was a kind of "Mr. In-Between" series. It was too big to be canceled, but too small to get the "Rabid Ratings Ravings" case. <br /> <br /> During an uncertain hold on Friday nights, they showed some of the best and boldest Artistic Hourly Dramas. There, I said it artistic, artistic! But please do not forget that we think artistic but not just false, demanding, pedantic, politically correct sermons. When it was finally certain that it was the end of the line for "HOMICID"; this super episode was prepared as this 2 hour TV movie. <br /> <br /> When we look at all the events in past seasons and the show of regular characters, the producer team came out and gave us what turned out to be a great mission. OUR STORY? ?????. When we joined the story, we find out that the commander of the Baltimore Homicide Unit, Lieutenant Al Giardello "pulled out a pin", left the job. But "G" is not ready to really retire - still retiring. So instead of the rocking chair about the fishing rod, we find that Al runs for Charm City mayor. While in the city, several stops and campaigns, the former detective lieutenant attacks the bullet. Live, but in a comatose state, is taken to the hospital. <br /> <br /> The news is spreading fast and as if officially summoned, we find all of the detectives from the Baltimore unit that we saw at the fair and who offered them their services and help. There is a great encounter of all these former and contemporary gumshoes as they play and watch all the lead and the possibility of leadership. The producer has found a way to deal with those who died earlier in bringing their memory into the story. They managed to answer the long questions and even introduced some unfamiliar here. The whole story shot the series in a very satisfying and original way. But at least for the moment we leave it as "classified". <br /> <br /> When shooting everything in a clean, small package, this TV movie will surely get our confirmation. As for the classification "THE HOMICIDE MOVIE", we need to give her A or A +, even. But no matter what degree he is here, he did not go as high as a typical weekly episode.
