Now this show looks like most other shows of its kind since the mid-1990s, but the only thing is that it's different, they're using in this comedy and action comedy and maybe a bit of drama as well. Personally, I thought it was a good show, I do not understand why they would cancel it. The good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive since 1997. My hope is that the WB returns a show or even make a movie that I know is going to be impossible, but hey it will not hurt to dream, right? By the way, I would recommend if you did not see that you will find the DVD of all 13 episodes because the characters are great, the stories are good, the comedy is good and the whole show is just great.
