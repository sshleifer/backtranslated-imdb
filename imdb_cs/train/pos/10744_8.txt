The events of September 11, 2001 do not require a special human interest in the training of a firefighter rookie or the progress of two French brothers. In my opinion, it would be better to let it go. I think the directors tried too hard, maybe they thought the events of the day needed the story as a background. The comment of one of the police officers - "this is not invalid Disneyworld" - is appropriate. However, it is a convincing tracking to display events. Movie makers were in the right places at the right times, no other footage of the day matches what they shot.
