When I first got my N64 when I was five or six, I fell in love with it and my first game was Super Mario 64. And I loved him! The graphics were great for time, good plot, great odds, and above the best I heard in Nintendo. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the plot completely, but I think Princess Peach was kidnapped by Bower and Mario must save her. The game is getting 120 stars from the curse in the castle. Everybody had about five or six challnges to get the stars. There are secert parts of the castle where you can get more stars. But of course you've defeated Bowser. * I think there are three levels to Bowser defeat on * Starts with characters. Mario is the main character, and he gets useful advice from Toad, so he's basically one of your only alliances. I have heard that Luigi and Yoshi are in the game towards the end. The main villain is Bowser, and there are plenty of other characters like Boo and Goomba. The characters are really great. graphic arts? People say that the game is more important than graphics and I fully agree. But with great conspiracy is great graphics. That's especially the time. I have a lot of other Nintendo games like 007 and their graphics are not compared to Super Mario. Bright colors, great effects and amazing sound effects. I found the graphics in watercourses very good. Now to Bowser's World, he has the best graphics in the game. <br /> <br /> Now it's music.This is my favorite part of the game. It grew when I played it at a young age, I would like to leave the game all night, so the music would put me in bed. Especially music by Jolly Roger Bay, which was peaceful and beautiful. There are others who are also great, especially in the worlds of Bowers, who are the ones who hold me the most and I am the favorite. <br /> <br /> This game was my favorite last time as a developing player and I love it. This game gets 10/10 or ***** (5) / ***** (5) PLAY GAME!
