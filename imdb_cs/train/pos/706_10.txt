I have to say that I wanted to see this film for a long time and I was not disappointed. The effect of Dominic Monaghan is simply fantastic. As part of the insomniac myself, I can relate to how the story unfolds. I have never experienced such a thing, but some watchful moments overlap sleep and it can be scary. It was a great movie worth every penny. I hope one day I can work with Tess myself, it would be a tribute even beyond the borders. I can recommend it to everyone. Maybe not young children, because they can scare themselves. But if you are as insomnia as you, you will understand the world, the secrets and the fear. You will love it. <br /> <br />
