This game is fun and has a plot that you can really expect in a comic book. Spider-man was bordered by a mysterious cheater. The city is overtaken by strange gas, and symbions like Venom and Carnage appear all over the city. Who is behind these crimes? Could it be Doc Ock? He seems to have turned a new sheet. Venom also does not seem to be involved because it is simply ticked out that Spider-Man apparently has a rather good photographic opportunity. Good kamee from other heroes and lots of villains later Spidey reveals secrets. Fight is basic, it is not difficult to collect, fighting bosses is rather fun. You can choose comics, run out of the web and it's a bit fun to go through the city. But this is also a weak point. Swinging is not all that great, because everything you do is across the city, as Spider-Man ostensibly attacks his network in the sky. You do not have too much maneuverability of web-slinging either especially compared to Spider-Man 2 movie video game. This happens, however, for bad swing with other elements, especially the story. So be ready to see Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus and Carnage for one wild action driving package.
