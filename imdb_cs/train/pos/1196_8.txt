During the summer, I watched several movie shoots of this film, resulting in only two scenes in the film. The site was Sylvan Lake in Black Hills. Bring the car, stop the car, etc. So this young Dakota was looking forward to seeing the movie and was not disappointed. The local herd of buffalo was destroyed, so shooting was real. (yes, Doris, the animals were wounded during filming) I think the end was copied by Jack Nicholson in Shining? A great Western / social commentary from the 1950s. It should be in the same class as High Noon for a real Western drama or used as a social statement like Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Without A Cause for the 50th Youth.
