For a long time in my life, I did not like this movie, or I liked this film but not so many others. I was looking at it recently (sleeping, funny) and I liked more than I did since I was less than 6 years old. Now I appreciate it more, as with the other Disney classic I've watched recently (including "Dart Beauty" and "Pinnochio" or whatever you call it). <br /> <br /> Now I greatly appreciate animation, smart "Disney" plot, mouse humor, expressed emotions and plot. Animation is very well done, it often seems like you are anywhere else and watching them. Animation also shows well the background styles, including the city (which is shown twice in a short time). Disney turns it from the original fairy tale in a surprisingly good way, by spraying smart twists like mice that make clothes and a key part (mostly I do not like Disney movies if they are not like the original story, but I did not bother with this too. the necessary changes to make it a good Disney movie and I often do not think Disney has changed the book in some of her films well). <br /> <br /> You know the story already, Cinderella is a girl who works for her terrible stepmother and sister. She goes to the ball with the help of her fabulous godmother and loses glass slide ... <br /> <br /> It's a lot of film to be watched with other people. Immediate family is not good enough. To enjoy it, I recommend watching it with friends (and a close family if you like. :-)). <br /> <br /> I recommend this to people who like Disney at least a bit, people who like fairy tales and people who like mice. Enjoy! :-)
