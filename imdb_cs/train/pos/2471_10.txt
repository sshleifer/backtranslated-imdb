I have never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before I heard, but I had a Shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue. My view of the film may be somewhat biased because I have never read the game before, but I got into the movie. Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers ever to live, and the story of Hamlet is certainly one of his greatest achievements. But now for the movie ... <br /> <br /> I find that all the actors in the movie have a firm grip on what they say and so they have been able to formulate well. Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet is nothing compared to Kenneth Branagh and the King. The thing I liked was that it worked very well as a "movie" and not as a game you are studying. You do not have to be rich with Shakespeare to relate to the entire village of Misery that you have to go through. I would recommend this movie to a wide audience. <br /> <br /> That's my two cents.
