"Panic in the Streets" is a relatively unknown short film by director Elie Kazan and was made in front of his classic masterpieces such as Streetcar Named Desire, Nafr√≠ge and East of Eden. Kazan had already won the Oscar in 1947 in front of this film, so he was not completely unknown at the time. Still, "Panic in the Streets" is mostly a movie that went under radar. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this movie is the Oscar winning script. It has a very good concept and excellent thrilling thriller material with crime smell / film-noir elements. The dialogue in this movie is also absolutely spectacular and gives the film a feeling of reality and credibility. Cast is relatively unknown (especially at the time he was released), but still features Zero Mostel and Jack Palance in one of the first film roles. Especially Palance acts like a tough gangster boss with a very strong face. <br /> <br /> At some points, the film is a bit tense. The film starts very well, but after the start, the movie slows down and does not always make the right decisions as to the pace and perception of what the story is about. <br /> <br /> But "Panic in the Street" remains a perfectly viewable movie, largely because of its strong screenplay and strong dialogue that makes the movie believable. For fans of the thriller genre, it's a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
