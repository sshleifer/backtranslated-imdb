Any adjustment on the screen of the John Grisham story deserves a traditional Hollywood approach, and Robert Altman is the last director to go to the mainstream. But this sud-fired pot-boiler is pretty good. While it's not among Altman's best, it's definitely not among the movies he's done that let you scratch your head and think about what they think. Altman leaned his hat with a mysterious thriller with anarchic stimuli before, in his 1973 film The Long Goodbye. "Ginger Man" is not as good as the movie, but he's pretty good on his own. Kenneth Branagh is a tiny lawyer who finds himself in a murder wound after contacting a client (Embeth Davidtz) who helped protect her from his father with the helmets (Robert Duvalle). The film takes place in Savannah, Georgia, on the arrival of a tropical storm that gives the film a suppressed atmosphere that I liked very much. The twists and turns towards the end of the film become more fragile and stronger, and Altman turns out not to be the staging adept, but overall, the film is not a bad addition to Cardinal Altman. Robert Downey, Jr., Daryl Hannah, Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen. <br /> <br /> Stage: B
