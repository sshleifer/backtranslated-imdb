I'm glad someone shot a movie about how hard it is to risk your heart a second time. Or third. This movie is exactly what she promises to be - beautiful, fun and gives you this good feeling around your heart when it ends. The story may not be too imaginative, but there are millions of ways to tell this story and have not yet been used. The cast is perfectly selected, although Scott Wolf does not look like an eight-year-old father, even when he has a suit. So the sparks are in all the right places, supporting the cast is extremely supportive and although you could probably predict the whole movie you would not want to switch the channel. It's just the right kind of entertainment for Sunday night.
