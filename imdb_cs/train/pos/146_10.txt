I got to the end of this and almost screamed: "No, no, no, no! It can not end! There are too many unanswered questions! what head ??????? "ARGH !! Then I read that at least two members were occupied, and I must say that I know it probably will not be in line with Lars von Trier's vision, but I'd like to look around alternate actors to see the end that was planned! It would be hard to find someone who would play Helmer because the character deserves it. Helmer, the doctor you love to hate! I think I've seen on the screen a more self-comprehending, non-killing, self-centered character! But I could ignore the change of actors ... I just have to know how it ends!
