It is difficult to combine this film in several ways. Everything works really well here. casting, acting, screenplay and cinematography are first class. The viewer is a moving, violent story of love and human redemption. There is a lot of sharp technical and technical merits for criticism of the film. There are some tactical mistakes, and as discussed on the boards, the end is lacking realism if one is consistently formal with the CIA agent. However, I made the end much more agile due to the fact that, rather than following the pragmatic approach of the CIA agent, Creasy basically praises his soul for the ultimate without considering the consequences. Just like Jesus himself, Creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice, whether it really makes a pragmatic sense or not. In any case, I realized that Creasy is getting rid of conventional bourgeois morals and only once covering bad people in his methodical effort for justice, which in fact leads to redemption for both himself and for innocent. <br /> <br /> In any case, this film is very attentive if you have ever attracted the genre. Outstanding soundtrack, great writing, flawless casting and solid performance over the entire surface make this movie the highest 100 (or better).
