I had a chance to see this movie recently. I believe it will be in Canada sometimes on Mother's Day. If the theater is near you ... Go! It's not a funny feeling-a good movie-it's more about the goal and the movie you think. The director does a great job of character development - he lets you in the heart, mind, and hurts Hagar bit by bit. At first, her attitudes and behavior do not make much sense. As her story unfolds, she becomes someone you understand. As in life ... understanding brings empathy. I find that the end of the movie is decent - especially when it opens its heart to the young man in the hut near the lake. Hagar's relationship with his two sons is painful - and reflects so much of our own experience in this world. Her youngest son, John, who is full of life and adventure, brings the viewer to the very edge of his seat - and to a raw feeling that is so authentic and rare. It's fun to see Ellen Page in this movie. She's very different from the young woman she's playing in Juno. It gives me even more recognition for her acting skills. If you love her in Juno, you will love her in the Stone Angel. Of course, Ellen Burnstyn is like Hagar. There is probably no way to express the power to act as strongly as the actor's ability to forget you about any other character they've ever played. I never realized Ellen Burnstyn during this film - I always thought of Hagar. She was thinking about her character - hook, line and platinum. Kari Skogland's capability to capture this renowned book by one of Canada's most expensive authors is impressive. She famously brings to the screen both the stoney and angelic parts of this intricate woman, the Hagar - the angel stone.
