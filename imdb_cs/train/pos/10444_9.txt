Sweet and charming, entertaining and sad, writes less but meaningful, "Before the Sunrise" (1995), the third film, Richard Linklater, is dedicated to anyone who's in love, is in love or never in love but still dreams and hopes, to find her. It is one of the very rare films that are equally interesting for children, their parents and even grandparents. It seems to be a very simple little movie without spectacular visual effects, car pursuits or long and uncomfortable sexual scenes. Two young people in the early twenties will meet on the train two students (American tourist Ethan Hawke, who after summer returns home in Europe and French student Julie Delpy, who goes to Paris to take part in the Sorbona course). They are immediately attracted to them before they start talking, they leave the train in Vienna where they go all night. They talk and fall in love. That's it, that's the movie. It could have been boring and stupid, but instead it's a wonderful, believable, smart and moving romance that improves with every view (at least for the viewer). The high praise and my sincere gratitude belongs to the director and writers who delivered two charming figures, excellent writing, always interesting and funny dialogues, two amazing performances and a magical atmosphere that fell in love. Julie Delpy, who looks like Botticelli's angel, is great in showing an intelligent, independent and incredibly attractive young woman.
