Bela Lugosi appeared in several of these low-cost coolers for Monogram Studios in the 1940s and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the better ones. Bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them, and then extracts of fluid from their body to keep their aging wife look young. After the reporter and the doctor stay at home at night and find out that she is responsible for the death of the bride, the next morning they will report these murders to the police, and a mad scientist is shot dead and falls dead shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> This movie has almost everything: scientists' assistants consist of old hags, hurricanes and dwarves (her sons), storms and spooky passages in the Bela house. Bela and his wife find that they are sleeping better in coffins than in beds in the movie. Corpse Vanishes is worth seeing, especially for fans of Bela Lugosi. Great fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars of 5.
