Michael Keaton is "Johnny Dangerous" in this takeoff on gangster films in 1984. Maureen Stapleton plays his sick mother, Griffin Dunne is his DA brother, Peter Boyle is his boss, and Marilyn Henner is his girlfriend. Other stars are Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo. Keaton plays the owner of a pet shop in the 1930s who captured a child who stole a puppy and then tells him in retrospect how he came to own a pet shop. He turned to thieves at a young age to make his mother's pancreatic surgery ($ 49.95, special this week) and began working for the boss of the crowd (Boyle). Johnny uses the story "Dangerously" in the world of mobs. <br /> <br /> There are some merry scenes in this movie, and Stapleton is a revolt like Johnny's little mother who needs to replace the organ in the body at any time. Peter Boyle as Johnny's boss gives a very fun performance as well as Griffin Dunne, a direct arrow DA who will not play a ball with a crooked Burr (Danny De Vito). Like Johnny's nemesis, Joe Piscopo is great. Richard Dimitri is distinct as Moronie, who tortures the English language - but you have to hear it before reading it. What makes it funny is that it all makes an angry face. The film gets a bit tired but it's worth seeing and Keaton is amazing as a good boy / bad boy Johnny. For some reason, this film was underestimated when he was released, and just like Keaton's other gem, "Night Shift," you do not hear much about it today. With some performances and scenes that are real gems, you'll find Johnny Dangerously extremely enjoyable.
