Bugs life is a good movie. But to me it really is not compared to movies such as Toy story and so. Do not get me wrong, I liked this movie, but it was not as good as the story of toys. The movie has visuals, laughter and more that the Toy story had. But the movie did not feel as completely as ... I do not know, but I thought it was still a good movie. <br /> <br /> Bugs life ... I do not mean it, it's a movie I do not remember. I've seen it years ago. Of course, I have not seen Toy's story for years, but I still remember it. I did not have to review this movie, but I am. I put it up, though it's not exactly the best work Pixar has done. Life bug: *** / ****
