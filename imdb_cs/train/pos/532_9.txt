Charming, romantic, innovative and fun. The visions of this extraordinary film are almost unrivaled, surpassing the well-known "deadly romance," such as Ghost. While we know intuitively that Peter and the Jun will find the ultimate luck at the end of this long stairwell, joy is on their way. The morale of the story is, of course, timeless: love conquers all. But the struggle to achieve this victory takes place in the celestial arena with a gloomy look and breathtaking nobility. With more than 500 suitably dressed accessories depicting different ages and cultures, the vision of the directors of the sky remains unforgettable six decades later, until the time of the CGI. Still, for all the space scales, Powell and Pressburger knew the basic truth: the best story is solved at the smallest level. Surprisingly, the definitely romantic aspect of the "staircase" is captured with ultimate simplicity: spring tears, preserved on petals of roses. <br /> <br /> This movie, as well as the story and the ensemble itself, is for ages.
