I remember this show because it was a regular tour of Saturday night. Sabrina is a young girl who moves with her aunt who turns out to be a witch and she is one. So Sabrina must learn to control the power and use it efficiently. She also has to solve the school's evil opponent named Libby, her ditsy best friend and friend Harvey Kinkle ... The show was fun and entertaining. Saturday nights were fun for a 10-year-old boy ... and made him laugh out loud ... And flirted with 'Libby' ....
