I bought this movie a few days ago and thought it would be a pretty nice movie. But when I put it on the DVD player, I was surprised very well. James Belushi plays very well as Bill "The Mouth" Manucci. But above all, Timothy Dalton plays very well as a sheriff. The "end" scene in Bill's house is very good, good camera, nice dialogues and very good acting. Bill "Mouth" Manucci stole $ 12 million from the mafia. Together with his wife, she lives in South Carolina in the witness protection program. But the mafia is watching him and wants $ 12 million. Bill can trust a single person he knows himself.
