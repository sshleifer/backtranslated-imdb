This timeless proverb will sound in this movie and in my heart. I've been waiting for so many years to see this eternal story! I'm probably not ready. It is possible that my sensitivity would not be much appreciated. So thankfully I welcome it in my soul with joy. My respect and admiration for PAUL MUNI was long. Its now a legendary luminescence. But now I have finally discovered the invaluable gifts of wonderful talents LUISE RAINER. Oh, how many faces can she talk like her? Some said it was happening from her quiet years, and this well could only be her speech, it is sufficiently eloquent when it gets a chance. She earned her Oscar very much. <br /> <br /> This movie is in epic in the most classic proportions. All components are the same, necessary and perfect. Naysayers may leave if they wish, but they would avoid stories that remain with one's lifetime. A GOOD COUNTRY enriches one way it does not expect. But all of this will not come with the joy I have done. But I can only hope that this film will be remembered for many years. <br /> <br /> Do not miss me with just the technical information about the main players race. These are the expectations of modern times when we possess absolute perfection. But I will allow millions of newer films to tell the story of PEARL BUCK with such agility, strength, conviction and grace. If a modern artist dared to recreate this masterpiece again, I warn them that he will never come up with the aromatic aroma that still comes from the core of this narrative. Time does not disappear, nor will it improve its size.
