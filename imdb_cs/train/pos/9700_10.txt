Somehow this film will be refreshing, bitter and thriving. Stars like Tony Shalhoub (from Providence) bring a story to life. The story itself is inspirational. We see a desperate, up-and-down life through the most innocent eyes that you can imagine: a bird. Paulie begins her life as a child parrot given to a little girl (Hallie Eisenberg, also known as the Pepsi girl) with a speech barrier. While learning to speak correctly, Paulie. Unlike most birds, however, she can speak and understand everything that is said. Military father does not like bird, so it is sent to the pawnshop and bought by old artist Ivy. Teaches him ways, etc. When he travels across the country to find Paulie's owner. The film continues with several fates of fate until Paulie stops working in a laboratory where he is finally hidden in the basement and found by a Russian guardian touching the story of a bird. the plot is in line with a simple, metaphorical theme, which is the language of the gift and the curse. I would like to say that the soundtrack is stunning. The beautiful blend of flute, digital base and horns enhances the film to a point of pure ecstasy. Focused camera angles and breathtaking scenery make the story even more beautiful. And as a final remark, puppetry is completely believable. (Unlike star wars where Yoda reminds Muppet) This movie is one of my favorite films, with the additional remark that my recent four-year-old parrot died recently. Overall, I give this movie **** of four stars, two inches up and a big hug.
