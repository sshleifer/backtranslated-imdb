Neil Simon has a lot of work to do, but he's an odd couple who carried him with glory. This movie really works. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthaw have great chemistry. Cast support for this movie is also stellar. <br /> <br /> They live together with two men from opposite planets. Scenario of this situation happiness with humor. This has already been done in some forms earlier. This is the one that brings it all in a very good package. Simon did some other decent job, but this is really his best job, which allowed the rest of his work. It's hard to imagine Simon's never going.
