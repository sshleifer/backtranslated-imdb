I was in France around 5 March and I like to go to film festivals. I knew about this Cinémas d'Amérique Latine de Toulouse, but I never got to it. I decided to go and then I caught Cero y van 4. The film is amazing. It does not affect me, as with Mexican users, because it was French subtitles, but it's still shocking. This film is a satire about urban violence, about kidnapping and crime on the streets of Mexico. It's a rough portrait of the city. From the metropolis. Secuestro Express, with the amazing Mia Maestro, which was also a satirical satire but with a more serious tone and I think yes, some connection with Cero y van 4. What kind of redemption and how much is it too much? The man in the fire, who was tremendously powerful, was not even a satire, but a crude portrait of the streets of Mexico. Or it's like The Brave One. The film that will shake you and hit the guts very hard. It's like the usual suspects, has some plot and turns, but it makes it even more trustworthy. Verdict: A movie that shocks and leads to the fact that there is no security on the streets. Stunning dialogue, impressive direction and stunning performances. Cero y van 4 is a movie that you will not soon forget. It leaves you trembling and stunning.
