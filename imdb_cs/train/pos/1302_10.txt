Often, the band is gathered for a reconcert concert just to find out that they just can not get together. Not here. This concert is from scratch to the end with a shot of brilliance. These three musicians apparently gathered and planned and planned what was needed to make sure it was not just a nostalgic bash satisfying one's ego. This is obvious from the beginning, even before it even enters the stage. Many faces in the crowd were not born when these guys first played. From the first song they capture the old magic, which was a cream, 3 men, 3 instruments, no agitation. Clapton, according to his own acknowledgment, said he had to reach this concert because there were no keys, synthesizers, etc. So we see it in his best. Ginger Baker demonstrates why so many drummers today speak of him as a bubble guru. Jack Bruce is great. They really did manage to put together a piece of spells that will endure the test of time for many years to come. This is for me 10.
