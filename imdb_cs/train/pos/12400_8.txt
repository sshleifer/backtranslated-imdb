This is the second Animatrix short, and the first is what can be called "artistic". It contains many links, metaphors, and symbols in a dense amount of material, especially with a run time of 9 minutes. I have heard some complaints that it is "anti-human" or trying to hate man, "machine sins". I do not think it's true; It only uses robots to show us that as humans we are not particularly receptive or openly thinking of someone other than ourselves. I would say it does a great job. The story is good ... it plays as a historical documentary that tells of what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy. So they keep clips from fictitious reports and the like. Music acting is very good if there is not much. The animation is nice and the use of colors, despite the usual realistic styles of drawing, facilitates smooth transitions and other surreal images. It has several bits of violent violence and disturbing visual imagery as well as a little nudity. The disc contains comments, not in English, but subtitles that are worth listening / reading. There is also a well-done and informative processing, based on both parts, so I would advise you to watch it after your eyesight on the next. I recommend it to anyone who has the universe of Matrix and / or science fiction in general. 8/10
