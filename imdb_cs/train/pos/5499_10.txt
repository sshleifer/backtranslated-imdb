I had no idea what the film is about. As soon as I remember this situation, I received the information that was presented in the media: a confused event around a doubtful personality: Mr Chávez. The film is a revelation of many facts, wondering if something like that has ever happened. I assumed that the protagonist was Mr. Chávez, but all who came to the picture <br /> <br /> was important and ultimately the reality of this entelecha: the people were huge. Thank you, Kim Bartley and Donnach O'Briain. <br /> <br />
