It is well known that when Gene Roddenberry first brought Star Trek to NBC, the original pilot episode The Cage was rejected because it was "too brainy". When the series was given more chance, Roddenberry thought it would be fun to set the events of the rejected episode as a canon and so it was written by The Menagerie, which has a unique distinction between the continuation of what was at that time a hostile episode. This time, Kirk and his crew, rather than discovering a new planet, are at Starbase 11 and are visiting former Enterprise Commander Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney) now terribly disfigured and paralyzed due to an accident. Pike joins his space ship successor, waiting for an unpleasant surprise: Spock, who served under Pike, actually hijacked the ship and set the direction for Talos IV, a planet that is out of bounds (punishment is death) Pike and Spock's last visit there 13 years earlier. Of course, he is a logical figure, Spock turns away and organizes a martial court to justify his actions. There is no need to say more about the conspiracy, because the rest will be played in Part 2. What really impresses is how Roddenberry creates a connection between Cage and the rest of the Star Trek universe by coming up with some sort of memories (say more would be too much) which will allow everyone on and off the screen to see what could have been from Trek that NBC did not break the original project. It is especially fun to see Jeffrey Hunter (who could not go back to The Menagerie) to play Pike as a more serious captain than Kirk usually, and Nimoy's early days as Spock, whose personality was not yet fully established: it's only time in the whole series that everyone the popular Vulcan is spontaneously angry. In short, not just a great episode of "secrets", but also treatment for those who can not be bothered to tracing The Cage in its original form (available as part of the Season 3 package).
