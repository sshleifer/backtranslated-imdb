Grinning at a hotel in Kuwait, I happily crossed the canal that showed it at the very beginning. The first Canon Pachelbel brought a stump to my throat, then the look at the Tiger Moth (which my grandfather, my father and I all flew) produced a slight humidity around the eyes, and then Crowe's name was totally impressed. I was interested in this film, Crowe's performance (again), the subject (and yes, what debt we owe), how various issues, flight sequences (also my father flew Avro Ansons) were solved and solved, the story - and, as another contributor , Crowe's High Flight recitation. I do not rate a film for someone but separate from my wife for four thousand miles, like an ex-army officer who was deployed in a few wars and as a private pilot, I admit to crying several times. Buy it, rent it, pull it off, stitch it, borrow it or steal it - but watch it. PS Did I notice Bristol Blenheim (in yellow training colors) on the ground? It looked like a two-engine twin-303 Brownings in the dorsal turret.
