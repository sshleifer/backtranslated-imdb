I was 15 years old when this film was on TV. When I was in Texas, I understood the boredom and monotony of teenage lives. This movie touched my sensitive teen heart and remembered it sincerely in the last 12 years. I recently saw it in 2nd, 3rd and 4th place thanks to the LOVE channel. I still cry because the film reaches and touches my inner confused teenager.
