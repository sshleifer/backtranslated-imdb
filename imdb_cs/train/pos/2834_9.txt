I have not seen a lot of German comedy, but if this movie is something that should happen, I'm forced to see more! A simple but effective action takes two very different people on a trip from Germany to Italy after Eva, the unemployed mother of two, finds out that her artistic husband has a relationship with a wealthy lawyer's wife. I will not let anything reveal, but what is the result of a very entertaining series of events with a perfect conclusion. My interest in the international cinema has widened since I first saw this movie. I recommend it to everyone (any adult ... do not let the inclusion of young children be deceived into thinking that it is a family film) who love comedy - even those who are not familiar with the language.
