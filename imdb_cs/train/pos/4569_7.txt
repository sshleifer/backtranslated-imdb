DANIEL DAY-LEWIS does a remarkable work in playing Christy Brown, an artist who grew up with cerebral palsy but managed to have productive life, successfully tackled his disability and became a respected artist and writer. <br /> <br /> The film is very difficult to check - or even watch. Fortunately, I had headlines to capture every spoken word that would be impossible if I saw a movie in the theater. While I think this is a courageous work that deals with a difficult topic, I can not say that it's a kind of movie that I would like to look at more than once. Still, my attention was given to the story-telling device, the flash framed in the present we see, Christy is honored for his accomplishments before we see the memory of his youth and his efforts to communicate with the people around him who have certainly given him loving care. DANIEL DAY-LEWIS is certainly remarkable as a wanderer who falls in love with a therapist (FIONA SHAW), much to her mother's fear that if love is not reversible, his heart will be broken. There's a painfully long scene in a restaurant where he's confessing his love to himself in front of the others, and then goes into furious rage after drinking too much. BRENDA FRICKER does a great job when his mother, his father and sibling boys, try to keep the roof overhead until Day-Lewis gets successful with his work. It adds Day-Lewis performance as a warm mother and shares many great moments with her. A richly detailed story about the family that stayed together in the most unusual circumstances, with an emphasis on the period of detail in each film of the film. Both Fricker and Day-Lewis have won the Oscars, but HUGH O'CONOR and RAY McANALLY are also excellent. O'Conor is Christy as a boy, and McAnally is a father who spends too much time in a local pub but loves that little boy. Summary: Elmer Bernstein's music is an additional plus factor. It's a lot worth, but it's definitely not a movie for everyone.
