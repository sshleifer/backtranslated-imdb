I am surprised that no one was supposed to be making a movie like this before. Horror is often the most effective when it uses a real unpleasant feeling as a topic. And no one (except Steve Martin in the Little Shop of Horrors) likes to go to a dentist. Tooth eruption was performed earlier (see, for example, The Marathan Man), but it brings terror to the suburbs. The story revolves around the dentist, Dr. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen), who descends into madness. Now our dear doctor was not at the beginning playing with a full deck, but because of jealousy and obsessive-compulsive disorder he starts to question those around him. Spiraling physicians are a bit close to what we see in the character of Michel Douglas in Falling Down, but with horror. <br /> <br /> Scenario and direction of the horrific characters Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna, his witty great stream. Also playing a policeman, Ken Foree is always welcome. Now I believe that this film will not work without a totally fantastic performance by Corbin Bernsen. When they really saw him in LA Law earlier, I was thrown off by his action. <br /> <br /> Continuing The Dentist 2 is also worth watching, but slightly below par compared with the original one. <br /> <br /> TTKK's Bottomline - Funny movie with some scenes that make you crazy, hanging
