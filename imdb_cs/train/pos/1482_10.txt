Best movie about marriage and family. This is a very interesting reflection for couples who come to the dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and family. This decision could be better or worst in our lives and our children's lives. The real intrusion or help of "friends" - or kata if we leave -. The real roles of families: they can help or destroy us. A mad priest who is probably not too crazy to say what can happen according to statistics and reality. A couple who thinks in a "special" marriage lives a painful story in their own future history. Who likes a contractual marriage? Nobody when the priest tells his own history? if they leave the future in other hands unless they know CO is marriage. That the problems are true, that life requires real engagement, guarantees, everyone. That the real victims of the divorce are children with a real name? Andrea in the movie - or the name. That abortion is just an easy exit: sadness, regret and misfortune will be after abortion. The fact that the state and social security are increasingly thinking about the real problems of families. Baptism of "friends", infidelity due to the weakness and despair of Steffania, because Tomas lives his life as if he were alone. Perhaps someone could think that this movie is a pessimistic movie, but not. Steffania and Tomasso, in a deep heart, love a beautiful marriage and family, if not why they like marriage? A real and beautiful marriage depends only on the couple: about each of their decisions, about each action in their life. A family can be a place where everybody feels loved because he or she is just a living one. The script is awesome. Performances are great: Steffania and Tomasso, almost an almost cynical priest! Great direction and scenario. Camera color and control are excellent.
