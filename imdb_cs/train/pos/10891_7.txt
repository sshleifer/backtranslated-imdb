You can survive the surviving Christmas. I thought the TV version was a little modified. I like Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, an adult family who is willing to pay a complete alien. Valcos play James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, daughter. Drew is lonely around the holidays because he does not have his own family, so he rented his family to the suburbs of Chicago for a quarter of a million dollars. Bill Macy, whom I remember best when I played Maude's husband Arthur, is hired to play Duda, grandfather. When the whole situation collapses, the truth can be painful. The Valcos household falls apart from Drew's situation. Drew's rich girlfriend and her parents will be surprised to visit. You can not buy what you want! Performer and writer are average, but the first picture captures it to the final stage.
