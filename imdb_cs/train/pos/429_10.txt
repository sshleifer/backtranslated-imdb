It was about 50 years from the making of the novel and mysticism. The only two films I can attack are "Enchanted April" (1992) and "The Enchanted Cottage" (1945). Both films use beautiful actors that are not stars. In both films, all actors gave their best romantic performances. "Appreciated April" is about four English women after the First World War who are unhappy with their lives and are looking for luck in Italy on vacation. It's amazing "Enchanted April", which was created in 1992. It looks like a nice classic.
