Stardust Another Guarded Review (originally written June 15, 2007) The marketing machine has just begun for this (yet no place?) So I doubt most of you have heard about it. In fact, I did not even (somehow). When I got the broadcast, I thought it was another codename and really feared it was Transformers, one of the films I want to see when it's not working, so I enjoy it 100% as a mere lethal movie viewer. It turned out that they were not Transformers and I was sure when I was like a "Neil Gaiman movie". What is it about? In short, it's Gaiman's tale of a boy and a fallen star. More than that and I would distribute the plot of information that is (a) breach of the contract, and (b) spoil your fun. If you really want to know what's going on, go buy a book. He has a reputation, Gaiman may be a writer. <br /> <br /> Do not know what to expect in a movie can be so enjoyable if the surprise is worth it. And for sure it was. This screening was "odd" by not only film critics, but also exhibitors (rarely mixed screening) and local sci-fi / fantasy people. So you know the expected audience, right? I mean, with this crowd and Stardust I knew what to expect. Oh how sweet I was. Yes, it's a fairy-tale written by an author known in a comic book. But it was not the Lord of the Rings. It was not another Lord of the Rings (hem, Eragon). It was much more confidential than all this. But like the Lord of the Rings, it was a film of humanism that sells fantastic qualities. It's definitely a romantic story, but a generous splash of humor. And the humor is such as Shakeism. It's much more than a dramatic comedy. Before I go on, do this thing in the overview. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, efficiency is good. It's always hard to say more than fantasy movies, but I believe there are significant wonderful roles. Michelle Pfieffer is not sadly one of them. She plays a villain and does the job. Nothing special. Rupert Everett was a real blockbuster. That's a big villain. Peter O'Toole is, well, Peter frickin 'O'Toole - which is amazing. Ricky Gervais is perfectly occupied and shows why. Robert De Niro seemed to have a great deal of affection. But when he wanted to deliver the goods, he did it. And Charlie Cox (who?) As a leader, he was surprised by a person I never heard of. Claire Danes. Claire Danes. Claire Danes. I always had a mixed opinion with her. It can be great, and then it seems to be missing a mark. That's the first one. And he is literally the star of this film. Sure, her accent falls back and forth. And yes, it's not as good as it can be when Cox is not on the scene. However ... well, you will see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Special effects are dimmed but they have reached, and only significant, where they should be. The best flying ship yet - sorry Potter. Direction is jolly and flowing. Cinematography could be better, but not every film in New Zealand. Everything else is the upper limit. <br /> <br /> And now that it's done ... <br /> <br /> ... writing. Oh, writing! Neil, you devil. In today's climate, it's hard to do something original and you start asking at first. Kingdom, a dying king, a boy who can prove his own worth, witches, ghosts, search (or three) - what's new? But Gaiman's story brings you with his superficial knowledge just to deny it all in a sweet original story about the boy and his heart. And even if you suspect everything is happening, you will be interested in the third act and - if you are me - you find yourself in an exciting climatic confrontation and hoping for the best. Finally, you will find that this story, this movie, is what all fairy tales should be, but too often they are not. Fantastic and real. (I wish I could talk about Septimus vs Tristan, but I will not destroy it for you.) For those who read the book, rest assured, that's right.) <Br /> <br /> Those I talked to , had the same impression. A great movie for all ages you can enjoy and a new {STOP} for this generation. The block fills up after the movie stretches because you might expect it. You will know whenever you are out. I sincerely hope that Stardust did not get lost between the sticks. Even if it was, it would be a pleasure to push all the people I know. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You have forgotten to add the revelation {WITHHELD}. I'm a couple of years late, but ... "A great movie for all ages and a new PRINCESS BRIDE for this generation." Maybe a little noble rating, but I'm still convinced that for years to create now, there will be the same "Oh, I love that movie," the answer to this, as is now for the Princess of the Bride.
