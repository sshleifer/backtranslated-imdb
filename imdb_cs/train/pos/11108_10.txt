Well ... maybe my favorite TV series at all. Call me the mail, but the show shows violence, mafia, sex, gambling, drugs, etc. And you already earn points in your books. Combine it with what surpasses everything you've ever seen on a small screen, add overhead that fits vintage cinemas, and above all the writing that blows the mind (and a few brains on a long journey) and you have it quite difficult to compete with . First of all, there are two actors, James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano, and Edie Falco as his wife Carmela ... as for Gandolfini, he fits his role in so that words can not express unless you have seen him yet as tons yet to see! <br /> <br /> I can go on and on about every character in the show, psychological gloss, grabbing scenes etc. but you will not be able to stop me so I can only say it's the only show along with Seinfeld that I'm able watch over and over again from start to finish and finally look forward, more.
