Warning! Spoilers ahead of us! SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I saw the film in German so it might be that I miss some traces. Despite the weakness in the plot, it's the movie that came to me. I really enjoyed playing Lexy Doig. Sometimes I thought she was * Camille. But I can not stop thinking about what happened to Bob, Cassius and the child. I believe that after being initially put to Bob, she finally ended up with his love and regret what happened to his brother and was forced to lie to him. Otherwise, it's a little weird to wear your baby and love her. It's up to the spectator to make a decision - and I do not like those endings. Dean Cain was as good as ever before, Eric Roberts .. Well, I saw him better, but worse. I believe that the film is a crime story rather than an analysis of human relationships and reactions in unexpected situations. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I liked it very much.
