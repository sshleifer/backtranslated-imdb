Whenever people ask me to name the most frightening film I've ever seen, I've always answered "Black Noon," and no one has ever heard of it. <br /> <br /> The weekly age of 13 when my parents went out for the evening. As far as I know, his only one was once shown in the UK and unfortunately not available on DVD or VHS. If anyone can track a copy, let me know. <br /> <br /> If I were to watch it again, it would probably be a great disappointment, but in my memory I was always a particularly disturbing little movie!
