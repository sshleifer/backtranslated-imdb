So, Fox pulled the plug in the middle of the dramas / secrets ... How do we get it? They expect us to invest our time in our new shows, when there is a real risk that we will never find out what's going on? Why were not the remaining episodes recorded in the US? They were broadcast elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Hey, Fox! Are you listening? It was a great show, but they let us hang out. If you are going to introduce a new drama / mystery, explain at least the conclusion before the middle topic suddenly ends. Every time something like that happens (and it seems like you've done a lot - that is, Fox), there are more who "will wait and see" than invest their time. This means you will see an artificially low share of the share and a more probable end of the series. See? It's a vicious cycle. Do not leave us down ...
