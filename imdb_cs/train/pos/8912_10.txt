I have read many comments on this site that criticize The Blob for being cheese and / or campas. The film was misused for amateur acting and weak special effects. What would you expect from a group of people whose only experience was to produce Christian Shorts for low-budget, locally produced (Valley Forge PA). Let me tell those too critical reviewers that this movie has never done so serious. This should be evident from incorrect thematic music, accompanied by silly lyrics that played over the initial credits. For what it was supposed to be, this film is excellent. I have seen a couple of recent ultra low budget attempts, Blair Witch Project was one of them who has absolutely no hobby or intelligent idea for their plot. BWP was a pure excrement. Blob, on the other hand, was well thought out, well written and totally entertaining. The scene where the old man encounters a meteorite and attempts with a heap of piles inside with his wand was greatly done and really scary. The scene in the doctor's office with Blob, which was slowly moving under the blanket on the shoe while consuming the old man, was a horrific movie. Finally, I love this movie. I'm inviting someone to take $ 120,000, blowing the dollar's value today, and filming the movie anywhere near as fun or as successful as Blob. It just can not be done. TIME! <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading this review.
