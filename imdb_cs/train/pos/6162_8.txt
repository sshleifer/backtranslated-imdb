I loved this masterpiece, and honestly, I also found Mary Poppins (though I like Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke) to be silly and sweet. Angela Lansbury plays my character to perfection, and I do not know why people think this film is distorted. It was magical and it was fun to watch. Every scene had a certain charm when you got to know the characters better. You really see how this small common family learns to connect each other despite age and differences. I thought the characters were well developed, especially Charles, who was in The Age of Never Believe. Mary Poppins can be more popular and loved others, but this little jewel will be the one I will always love and love.
