The idea of ​​filming a movie about the Beatles is a criminal idea because no production can capture the idea of ​​real historic Beatles. Then it is the best attempt not to restore the past, but to create an illustration that works best with other available Beatles materials. That's exactly what Birth Beatles offers to us, a simple story we know without any extravagant. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILS here on <br /> <br /> warned that not everything is accurate, as some graduates of the Beatles could expect. The Beatles are seen in songs that were barely compiled by then. The Beatles feature "Ask Me Why", "P.S. I Love You" and even "Do not Bother Me". Beatles-graduates should see that if the Beatles just sang the songs they actually did in Hamburg, younger audiences may not know the Beatles they've learned to know. From the original Hamburg Repertoire, only "Johnny B. Goode" and "Love Me Tender" by Stu Sutcliffe are preserved. The guys playing the Beatles in this production barely look like originals, but the rest of the movie still sees the film because the film is pretty accurate for the rest. The guy who plays Lennon is doing it well and the rest of the band is not bad either. Brian Epstein is great, and when Pete Best is out of the band, he is probably the most memorable scene in the whole movie. Also, as a bonus, you will get the original Cavern club in the movie.
