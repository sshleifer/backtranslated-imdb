War Inc. is a funny but weird movie. The actors are sympathetic, the film is also nice, but I do not know how to describe it. I'll go to this land later. It's a movie with some weird casting possibilities. Except for John Cusack as the hit-man we saw years ago at Grosse Point empty, which I liked. <br /> <br /> Here we play Hilary Duff, a Russian pop star named Yonica Babyya or something like that. Her character is strange. There is a scene where the scorpion holds down her trousers. And hits on Hauser (Cusack). At the end there is an abbreviation consisting of two characters. That makes sense. <br /> <br /> This is the only casting choice I'm into. The cause is simply weird. The whole movie is weird. But sometimes incredibly entertaining and never bored. Here are some of the best actors. Without Miss Duff. It's not great. But here we have John Cusack, Marisa Tomeii, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley. Look what I mean? This is the story of a hit-man named Hauser (Cusack). He is sent down to some middle east town to give a hit to the oil man Omar Sheriif (not actor). In an attempt to deal with his personal problems, he must help the wedding of popstar (starring Hilary Duff). And she falls in love with the news reporter (played by Marisa Tomeii). But there is something about popstar. Hauser is disgusted. There is a scene where she sings the song to him and then throws. Twist at the end of the film reveals the kind of why. The thing I tried was that I saw how it came. But that does not matter. It's a weird, fun and fun comedy. I love most actors. So, really, how could I not recommend it? <br /> <br /> War, Inc.: 3.5 / 5
