I thought it was a totally charming movie. The story seems to be John Wasser's thinly carved autobiography: Pecker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong is well-headed, but his grandmother, Mink Stole (cheerful actor) and all the people of Patty Hearst have the best performances. I think reviewers are basically the basis on this path. They seem to take Pecker's worst awards for his work as a gospel when I think the film quite clearly states that he is a truly promising artist.
