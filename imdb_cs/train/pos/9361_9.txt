Kingdom over my (titled song) is a movie that will surely bring tears to every eye. It was a moving story of a man (sandler) who lost his family in an attack on the World Trade Center in 9-11. A few years later, he goes to an old cheadle which he does not even realize because of the post-dramatic stress resulting from the loss of his family. The two of them wake up their old friendship and Cheadle's character, Johnson, realizes he must get Sandler's figure, Finemann, some help before it's too late. <br /> <br /> It was the first movie, the time. It is worth watching and after seeing it, I'm sure the viewer will appreciate their family much more.
