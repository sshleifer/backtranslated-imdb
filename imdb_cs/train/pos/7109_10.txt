First of all, start with the negative points: 1) In the story there are huge, obvious totals and questions that are raised that will not get where the answer is coming; 2) The film is not for all people, so awkward viewers will be restless and begin to bend during the film. Paragraph 2 above is important because the movie is very quiet. In the older type theater (like the one I went with) you can hear the sound that goes through the project occasionally. I loved it. The film does not leave you busy music or effects: it lets you think about what's going on. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of rhythm that creates an atmosphere that is fascinating and totally pleasant. The same kind of atmosphere was created by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut. Not everyone. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to cinema fans because the cinematographic work is amazing. Those who come out of the story-only movie will be totally disappointed. It's a kind of story that you need to connect to your mind. (My version is pretty darn cool, but probably pretty off-track!) If you're going to catch a movie, there's one very cool part: when two cops talk to each other on their cell phones. The perfect sound effect that instantly puts you in the picture. The hat switches off to the person who thought it.
