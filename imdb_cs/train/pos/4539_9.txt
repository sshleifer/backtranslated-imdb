Acting is pretty good, but for the people in this area in the 1980s and now they are Detome car mechanics, it's a great movie. I even work with a Japanese supplier so this movie is even more fun. Jay Leno showed his age last night at The Tonight Show! It looks pretty young ... 17 years ago. The open scene, with Woodward Ave, seems great. <br /> <br /> Leno also owns some bad cars **, it would be great to see the remake of this with its modern collection. I'm sure the blown Veto in the opening scene was his own car. <br /> <br /> Typical 80th film. Watch it and enjoy it. No computer generated bullshit!
