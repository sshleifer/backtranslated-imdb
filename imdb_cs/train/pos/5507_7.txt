I would not be surprised if SÃ¶derbergh was pressured to dissuade Cuba as being graphically corrupt. Just repeating a few statistics will not do that with a younger crowd. Still, the first part, which is almost shot in the jungle, captures the feeling of this place, especially when crossing the mountainous areas of Cuba. Del Toro liked the interpretation of Che Guevara. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, has also done a great job against everyone. It is clear that Soderbergh does not look at these people, but it is also obvious that their case does not intend to "yanquis" away from the recent past. Some of the more important historical aspects are inconsistent with what I read. In my opinion, Castro did not recognize the Soviet Union until all the attempts to join the United States had been exhausted. But it is all right in other aspects, especially when it comes to expatriate looting, when the island was about insurrection. The country cash register was empty.
