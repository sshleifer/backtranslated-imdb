The first time I saw this movie I fell in love with it. Atmosphere has attracted my attention above all. I was expecting a gore fest, but instead I watched a very intelligent killer clutter with my head on a frosty soundtrack (currently it's actually my ringtone in Moment: P). The fact that I could not foresee when to kill and when it disappears is an important plus in my book. I've predicted horror movies. Now, I know the story has some inconsistencies, but if you are like me, you will not even notice it until the movie can get out and you fold in bed as a witness of the movement of the masterpiece. Finally, as I have already mentioned, soundtrack is timeless. It's one of my favorite theater scenarios so I was very happy to hear that Rob Zombie is leaving untouched in his remake. When I talked about a remake, I read a very extensive article on it, and now that I know Mr. Zombie takes on John Carpenter, I have a lot of hope for his acceptance of this classic. This movie is great for anytime you want to spank your spine, but it's a perfect addition, opening time, the finale that you call the All Hallow's Eve marathon. :)
