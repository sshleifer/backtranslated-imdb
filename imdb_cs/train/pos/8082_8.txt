It's been a long time since I was following this LOTR. I'm currently looking for a copy to buy. Bakshi's work is a totally original work. The visual elements are full and sometimes spooky. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages? Sometimes the movie is confusing or confused. There is one or two times when slow crawling occurs. But overall - buy this movie. It's great for kids, adults and collectors.
