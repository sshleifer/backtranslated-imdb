For the first time, I watched this movie when I was a child and it's the only time in my life that I remember putting my hands on my face and eyes in utter horror on one particular scene. I remembered this again with an interview with my friends and I immediately bought it on a video with great hesitation that I could add (I found my surprise only on the US site when it was made in England!) When I did it watched my reactions again, and my surprise was almost the same, out of horror and fear, and my heart did not damage so much. This is, in my opinion, the SCARIEST film ever made, the Hollywood movies look like a little pony and a trap (miserable), forgive the game. What is amazing is the power of this movie and on the uni, when I watch about twenty my co-workers, I have never heard so many screamings, blocks as well! Even the view of the video brings the fear of the God that appeared to me on that particular scene, and let me feel that I will never ever walk alone in the dark !!!!
