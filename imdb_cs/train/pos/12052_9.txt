I've seen it on TV so long ago that I can not remember when it was, but it still looks like one of the most horrible and most distorted films I've ever seen. There is at the same time a delicate but intense fear of a woman in black lurking at the edge of the frame, not quite clearly visible, so you feel (like a lawyer hero), you are not sure whether it is just fantasy or not. It's also one of the few movies that really made me afraid to keep watching. "Production values" are hung, good films are about the director's ability to create an atmosphere through film, actors, places / sets, music, attention detail and ... imagination. The real gem.
