I always liked Johnny Concho and I wish this movie was on VHS and DVD. Frank Sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances in his career in this. <br /> <br /> When I first meet Frank in the title role of the film, he is the brother of a notorious shooter who is currently out of town. The brother is struggling with fear in the heart of the city, and Frank will use it to prevent cities safely and safely in his shadow. Only Phyllis Kirk has a feeling for him. She is the daughter of composer Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams. William Conrad and Christopher Dark come to two other militants and Conrad is killed to kill Sinatra's brother and he comes to his city to take over. They humiliated Sinatra and drove him out of town. Kirk watches him. Overnight, Sinatra will change from punk to cowardice and become a person looking for some type of spine. It's a great performance, almost as good as his Oscar nomination at The Man With a Golden Arm. It's a shame that for some reason it has not been seen for years. <br /> <br /> Two other performances are Keenan Wynn as a former gunner who has become a preacher to help Sinatra find what he needs to build Conrad and the Dark. And then Conrad is in what I believe his career is a role on the screen. It's a thief of incredible malice, the pure evil of incarnated walking and talking on the silver screen. However, what I like about Johnny Concho is the unforgettable climax of Conrad and Dark. Let's say I believe Johnny Concho is MGM's answer to High Noon and the basis for what you do when evil causes the breaking of all laws and order.
