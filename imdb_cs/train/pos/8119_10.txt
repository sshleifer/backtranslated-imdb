I think the introductory 20 minutes of this movie is perhaps one of the most exciting movies, with a brilliant music score working to build up the tension on the shattered peak. What this movie is doing in the 1930s, I can only imagine. "This time," he said at the time, "A miracle came to the screen." Look at it and be surprised.
