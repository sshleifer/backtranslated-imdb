This movie is pure Elvira and shows her on her chest ... I mean the best! The story (written by Cassandra Peterson, Elvira alter ego) is inspirational and captivating and brought to life by Elviro's joke and spell. The viewer gets the chance to see Elvira in a whole new light when he struggles with the prejudices of the people of Fallwell in Massachusetts (where she traveled from Los Angeles to attend her reading of her great Aunt Morgany) and this time she is trying to help long-time teens who were matriarchal Chastity Pariah and the rest of the city council stripped of fun. She also has to deal with her attraction to Bob Redding, the owner of local cinematography, and another woman (Patty) who also has an eye on Bob but is not as fond of his love as Elvira. And later in the film, she faces the complications of coming from "a prominent metaphysical celebrity" and the witchcraft accusations she brought, meaning it will be burned on a trash. Elvira can be both sexy, so vulnerable, streetwise and naive in this movie, while jogging at jokes and delivering off-beat lines with double meaning. This film is inspirational, because it shows the message never to give up and you always try to follow your dreams. Eventually, Elvira's dreams finally come true, which is the best thing that can happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman. I've seen this movie countless times and never ever show up! There are no unnecessary scenes, and I find myself interested in the whole movie. The review will not be fair to the current movie, so let me just tell you please watch it because it's one of the best movies you've ever shot! Meanwhile, I wish you dreadful dreams! "
