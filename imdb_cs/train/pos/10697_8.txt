Modern, original, romantic story. <br /> <br /> Very good acting both Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Miss Kidman does a nice job imitating the Russian accent. Ben Chaplin is also good as a shy, boring clerk. For men (and some women): Miss Kidman looks fantastic and very sympathetic. I forgot what a beautiful woman she is. It's not hard to imagine John falling in love with her. Some unexpected turns in the story are good for the tension. Although I was hoping it would be a happy end, the last part of the film was a great surprise to me. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: A good movie. <br /> <br /> Les Pays-Bas: huit points.
