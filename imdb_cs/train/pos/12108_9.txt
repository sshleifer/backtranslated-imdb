Yakitate! Ja-pan (translated as fresh baked Japanese bread) is the story of a young man named Azuma Kazuma and his way to creating perfect Japanese bread or Japanese bread or Japanese bread and for the Japanese to be recognized throughout the world. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's just outside. In fact, Yakitate! Ja-pan does not really concern bread, but the reaction that comes after the meal of bread, and the pun which comes with the reaction. The series is nice because of this game. From popular anime titles such as Naruto, Detective Conan and Dragon Ball, to films such as The Matrix and Lord of the Rings. It's all. So, what makes this title different from other titles of the same genre, such as Cooking Master Boy or Mr. Ajikko? Well, unlike the others who use cooking for world domination, Yakitate! Ja-pan is a pure comedy. Sure, there are times when the story turns into drama or even murder, but the comedic atmosphere laughs at them. You will laugh at your own gaze in the sky. Look at that. Just remember that it's also a fiction, though some of the bread here is based on real bread, eating home made Japan # 2 will not turn you on Super Saiyan or turn your body on rubber.
