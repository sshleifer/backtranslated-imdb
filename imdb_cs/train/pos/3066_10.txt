Everyone loves or hates this movie. I'm going with love. He is so well shot and is acting so well. Beautiful. This film is designed for people who appreciate well-designed films. If you are not a fan of good movies, of course you would hate it. But if you like the peaks of acting, photography, story and development, look no further here.
