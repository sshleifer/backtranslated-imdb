This is the Noir movie of "B", and my voice reflects its membership in this genre. I saw this movie yesterday in a cinema on the left bank of Paris where he opened a two-week film run. The movie has some mistakes, yes, but too many delicious elements to be ignored. As the previous reviewer noted, the drumming scene is incredible! (B-movies could peddle where A-movies were forbidden to enter!) And the story is interesting. As for the Franchot Tone, however, he pleads not to disagree: for me it is suitably mysterious; just the right shade of spook. It must be remembered that there is some German expressionism here (director Robert Siodmark, who came to Hollywood during the war), so the exaggerated air fits into this film. At least he does it for me. However, it is a delightful Ella Raines who, in her third credited performance, kept this viewer interested in the whole film. The "Friday Girl" type, with a strong resemblance to Gene Tierney, is a wonder she did not become a household name. But she is so good that I just ordered her other movie ('Impact') from the Internet and I can not wait to see it.
