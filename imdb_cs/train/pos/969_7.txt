Miike is making a childhood adventure film that resembles an Infinite Story. It's actually one of my director's most favorite films. Even the worst Miike is better than many good movies and the Great War Yokai has a lot to recommend. It is at least as loud and unpleasant as most American children's films. Maybe I think the kids themselves will find a lot to enjoy them (DVD contains English oak), but like all the movies, Miike can move very slowly. That means you have some strange inequality, where there is sometimes a loud action sequence, and the next scene will always drag on, as the characters say. The story itself is not very good, and the incomplete Miike's incompetence raises his ugly head. Most of what I liked came from the technical side of things. It must be Miike's most expensive movie and it looks fantastic. "Yokai" are Japanese ghosts and come in all different, fantastic shapes and costume designers, crew of special effects and all the others involved in the designs have done great work. I saw a Yokai Monsters (Spook Warfare) movie, 1968, and the monster monsters you can find have been transformed into more credible entities using the latest makeup and special effects. I especially liked the look of one of the bad (or girls), Agi, who sports a dark eye shadow, narrow, white clothes, white hive and whip. He plays by the way Chiaki Kuriyama, whom you may remember as a teenage henchgirl Lucy Lia in Kill Bill: Vol. 1. The film's hero plays Ryunosuke Kamiki, who gave voices to Miyazaki's Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle.
