Just like the gentle giants making up the other half of the title of this film, Michael Oblowitz's latest production is graceful, but it's also slow and coarse. The last trip of the producer "Mosquitoman-3D" had the same problem. It's hard to imagine a boring shark movie, but somehow they did it. The only thing that Hammerhead has to offer: Shark Frenzy was that it's a passive animatronix, which is always fun when dealing with wonderful worlds beneath the ocean surface. But even that was acceptable. Poor focus in some scenes seems to be amateur production. Thanks to dolphins and whales, this technology is full, but unnecessary. Cloud scenes and too many details of giant filmmakers do nothing to exploit IMAX's stunning capabilities. There are too few scenes of any depth or variety. Beware of these amazing creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the field of cameras, so there is no contrast to the depth. Michael Oblowitz tries to watch the steps of his father, but when you have a Shark-Week on the cable, his introspective and boring treatment of subjects is a constant disappointment.
