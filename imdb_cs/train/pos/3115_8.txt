First and foremost, speaking like no fan of the genre, "The Bourne Ultimatum" is a breathtaking, virtuoso, great action movie. Secondly, it's silly little cartoon super heroes. </ br /> <br /> Thirdly, the film bears a complex and important point that criminals become criminals themselves. No reference to Abu Ghraib or to a branch executive constitutional attack on constitutional rights, none is necessary. The latest in "Bourne" in the hands of Paul Greengrass 2004 "Bourne Supremacy" and last year's "United 93") is a significant success that was probably detained but not really diminished by the inevitable excesses of the genre. <br /> <br /> "Shot" addictive adjectives and a description of physical perception: more than an hour from the first slide, the viewer apparently retains his breath, pushing back on the chair with the power of inexorable, worldwide scorching, utterly exciting intervention. There is no crash, no change in rhythm and movie pulling, yet it never becomes monotonous and tiring as some related music videos do in a few minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> > <br /> Matt Damon is once again inevitable, irreplaceable Bourne, the deadliest of the CIA agents, this time taking over the entire agency in search of his identity, past, and mysterious agency program that transformed him into a killing machine. Nothing like his quiet, heroic Edward R. Murrow, always stunning David Strathairn, is a filthy top agent who opposed Bourne as he tried to hide some illegal "brutality" policies. /> Joan Allen plays what seems to be Good Cop against Strathair's Bad. And Julia Stiles is an agent who comes back to help Bourne. the combination of the Greengrass direction and Stiles' behavior results in a surprising impact of mostly silent character, its lack of communication, and a blank expression that is more interesting than a mile of dialogue. It's so good that "The Bourne Ultimatum" gets away with an old man's battle against the world, this time stretched to ridiculous excesses, as Bourne blocks the limitations of geography, time, gravity ... and physics in general. (Can you fly back from the top of the building? Why not - it looks great.) All this "real" magic - jumped from the ground to the ground within seconds to come in some unknown place exactly as, when and how it goes - extraordinary effects and superheroes unlikely drawings. And yet the only clueless pedant would allow the "facts" to interfere with the fun-based fantasy ecstasy of Bourne.
