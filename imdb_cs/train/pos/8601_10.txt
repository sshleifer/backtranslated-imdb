My observation: Vamp clothing at the end is breathtaking and exquisite, exotic and fantastic. Jeanette did it well and even got to naive Nelson. The ship that hit his balcony served him well. The costumes of his female mafia have been designed surprisingly well, especially according to today's standards. 1942 Costume designer did a great job. The main theme of the song is really beautiful. <br /> <br /> Watch out for negative posters: 1942 was the Second World War; Pearl Harbor happened a year ago. The US has just emerged from the Great Depression; he needed to go out and spend the hard earned money to avert singing, dancing and yes, fantastic fantasy. Despotic dictators have tried to exclude RL in order to get rid of freedoms. Thank God, the public had these fantastic films conspiracy line to attend. Movie motion was privileged in those depressed times. When you, negative posters, become actors or even movie stars, then you have room for discussion and criticism. Jeanette's and Nelson's films stand in the test of time. <br /> <br /> Beautiful angel wings on a real angel. The RL wings at the party are not so hot, but great on Jeanette considering the SL. <br /> <br /> Beautiful singing by Jeanette and Nelson, as always. The Jeanette dance was pure pleasure. <br /> <br /> 15/10
