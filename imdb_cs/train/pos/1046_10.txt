Probably my favorite film, the story of selflessness, dedication, and devotion to noble things, but that's not a sermon or boring. It just never gets older even though I've seen it 15 or more times in the last 25 years. Paul Lukas's performance brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis is pleased with one of her very few really sympathetic roles. Children are, as their grandmother says, more like "dressed little things" than children, but it just makes them more fun to watch. And the slow awakening of mother to what is happening in the world and under her roof is believable and surprising. If I had a dozen inches, everyone was "upstairs" for this film.
