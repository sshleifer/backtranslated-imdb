A charming, humorous film that has a solid quality everywhere. I have recently seen the filmmakers of this film. It was so nice to see this film as opposed to all the dirty horror films I see every day. And so much I thought I'd write. I'm not sure if this movie goes to theaters, but I hope it will be. It's a nice movie that you can see with friends, its magician and some funny jokes. It was amazing (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf), the direction was pretty good (it was not a movie that had to be exaggerated). That really makes this movie perform, I think it's writing. It was like Neil Simon, Seinfeldish, and the doubt between the characters is smart and has a nice rhythm. As an aspiring screenwriter, I notice these things! (I'm a dork). However, a really cute movie I recommend.
