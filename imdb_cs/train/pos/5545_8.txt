**** Includes Spoilers **** <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of horror for many decades. Just when I think I've seen all the great ones, another will appear to surprise me. I have never seen this movie. It was such a delicacy, outside the beaten track ... not just the way to the ferry boat swamp. Here was a horror film that appeared in the 1940s and dared to try something very different. A pretty girl is (fearful) fearless to change and rescues a man, including a man she loves from a monster! How is it for a twist. This girl was the opposite of most of the women in the movies of that time, without shouting in her own shadow, without fainting in fear and without running away from the leaf. This gal was not afraid to live alone in a remote cottage far from other villagers. Not only that, but the place was on the misty swamp that was said to be scary. The hell even sticks to the grass swamp outside ... like a regular Ripley version of 1940. No snake, gator or creepy stranger could bother you. Books on early feminist films should include this overlooked work. <br /> <br /> See if you are a fan of me, like those of the gorgeous atmospheric classic B / W horror films that they made only in the 1930s and 40s. And make sure you wear a neck of gelatin skin for protection.
