A beautiful, free-flowing, often lyrical film that drives you, sometimes smiles, even though they are really shocking events on the way. One is interested in the way women are treated, and in the end they seem to be doing well, and it is a lot of thanks to all those involved that so many potentially disastrous scenes work very well. This is probably the best performance of Depardieu, certainly his most natural. Jeanne Moreau plays brilliantly in what must have been a very difficult role and includes energetic sex scenes with several boys at least half an age. Miou-Miou is beautiful all the time and again has very difficult scenes. At first, it looks like a dirty and dirty misogynist rant / romp, but as the story and characters are told, a much smoother and more sincere picture appears. Ultimately, this uncompromising and courageous film requires respect.
