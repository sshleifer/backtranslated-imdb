Again I went through a cheap video and picked up this movie for $ 4.88. Thirty-five percent of the films I find in the trash are pure bullshit (I think terribly persuasive), but half the time that turned out to be surprisingly good. This movie is much better than I expected. I found it very impressive, although it was obviously amateurish. Direction is nothing special, but the story is interesting with some good thrills. I expected it to be a comedy, but I was not too disappointed. For thriller, this film is surprisingly adventurous. There is no bloody violence, no stupidity, no nudity, no sex. These films usually require all four elements. The value of PG is deserved - not as "sixteen candles", where the word "f" is used twice and there is a short hate scene. I just want romance between Corey Haim and his love interest could develop more. The film tends to be heavy and potentially good subplots are pushed aside. Instead of developing chemistry between these two people, we will end up with a careless three-minute assembly of their romantic efforts. At the end, kissing ends, but it's so little chemistry that seems to be forced. "Dream Machine is not a jewel, but it's a good and pure fun, it's quite forgotten - mainly with unknown occupation, except for Haima - but it's much better than you expected My score: 7 (out of 10)
