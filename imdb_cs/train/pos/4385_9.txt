What can be said of a film that has one of the darkest, most nihilistic, and sometimes very strange - I'm not going to call "sympathetic". In the history of Cinema I will call "charismatic" villains and the best fight with the sword since then Flynn and Fairbanks have been in their bloom? This is epic about stubborn, sometimes foolish, incredibly courageous and honest men fighting for his honor and freedom against tyranny. I loved it. John Hurt and Tim Roth were great villains. Jessica Lange was very moving, gentle and sensual.
