Excellent family film ... it gives a lot to do it ... There is nothing wrong with this movie. Everything is just perfect. The script is great - it's so ... real ... such things can happen in everyone's life. And do not forget about acting - it's just amazing! Just look at Frankie and you'll know what I was thinking ... This picture is real I can not - miss!
