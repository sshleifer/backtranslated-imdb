Canadian filmmaker Mary Harron is a cultural gadfly, whose previous films have revealed the artistic surplus of the 1960s and the hollow greate of the 1980s. With The Notorious Bettie Page, he points to his fierce eye in Fifties America, an era covered by the moral justice of Joe McCarthy, experiencing the onset of sexual awakening that would lead to the free love of the next decade. Harron and her co-author, Guinevere Turner, obviously do not care about the standard biopic of the sexual symbol. It is a film about the underground icon of the time and how its pure, indomitable sexuality has revealed both the predatory instincts and the unclean thoughts of culture untouched by the beauty of the naked body. If the details of Betty's life were all that the film was concerned about, why should it end before its most tragic period begins. It is clear that Harron is more and more interested in America's attitudes towards sexual images. Together with the fearless leadership of Gretchen Moll and the amazingly atmospheric cinematography of W. Mott Hupfel III. She achieved this goal admirably and held the mirror of the past while the audience examined her own "enlightened" attitudes of the 21st century to the so-called pornography. How America is killed under new conservatism is a movie that is needed more than ever.
