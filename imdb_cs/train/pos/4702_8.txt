If this film proves only one thing, Keaton is, he has always been a comic book in his heart, even when he's avoiding bullets, heading for an electric chair and getting to the wrong end of the information tower in prison. <br /> <br /> But "Johnny Dangerously" continues to do even more. In the 1980s, the ZAZ boys (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker) were the top of the world of genre spoofs. But there were several pretenders on the throne. This time, Amy ("Fast Times at Ridgement High"), Heckerling tries his hand with an incredible number of television writers behind the scenario (go and check). <br /> <br /> This slap-happy slapstick spoof of the 1930s is a cops-and-gag collecting movies casting almost every loop cliché and even adding a few clichés that did not exist back when. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> and every other actor in Hollywood, who happened to be in the immediate vicinity. You will be surprised how many faces you will know. I know I was. And jokes? When they begin, they will come quickly and furiously like a machine gun. At the beginning, there are plenty of people who are counted at the beginning, with the strange dark sand of Weird Al Yankovic. But you have to watch when they get loaded again. And it must be reloaded too often. <br /> <br /> Everybody tries to seem to have fun and I laughed a lot of time. In the end, however, there was plenty of time to think about how certain scenes could be more fun - it's not usually the best thing to think about after watching a comedy. But for a slow night when there's nothing good on TV, pop in "Johnny" and get ready for some "dangerous" serious laugh. Eight stars. Look at "Johnny Dangerously" ... do not be "bastidge".
