But it's a little funny, at least if you grew up on Weird Al like me. He is a mercenary about his life and career, he starts with a superstar and goes back to discovering his origins. In some places it is uneven, but some segments are still very fun, especially when it goes to Japan. Although it is not so emotionally textured as lost in translation, and does not find love, however fleeting, he captures in the bottle the bizarre cultural melange that is in Tokyo's street life. Perhaps the weird Al is not considered to be the confidential cultural commentator who is; maybe some rose with some other name would be just as sweet. Still, it's a fun movie.
