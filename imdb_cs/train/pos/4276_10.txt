At first glance, it seems that Who sings there is an absurd and excellent comedy? with the only unusual, quiet and slow movement: what a mistake! <br /> <br /> Beginning with two singers in the desert landscape, then the bus and the wonderful part of the actors hiding a jewel! <br /> <br /> A staggered story and a fake rhythm bring you to think, yes, it is comic, but it only lets you guess it will be a fine kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Not at all: very funny instantly, dark, delicate cynics on others, its development will surprise you throughout the story? Very ingeniously and cleverly presented all the characters are important and the actors give them a full life. And what's amazing is based on deep observation, great handling of the camera and has great meanings, and in fact everything, general direction and how the details are presented that just forgets that it's a movie: it's like watching a kind a human society you do not know yet, shot by a friend behind the camera <br /> <br /> And you are the one behind him. It's simple and just extraordinary! To misunderstand me; in no way does it mean script, image quality, musical score has a kind of amateur journey, no, no! It's a great art! <br /> <br /> Because the flow like a river? From high up on the mountain, down to the sea, with all sorts of land and waterfalls on which the real river faces the sea? from little to mainstream. <br /> <br /> This metaphorical image I've used is the best way I can find out to explain all the charm that Who sings there. For me, I look at the hammer again: just an exceptional one ... I saw that the director was the one who created the Chat Blanc / Chat Noir, which I know is silently famous? But as I have not seen yet, I had no idea about this gentleman. Other reviewers wrote dithyramic comments on this movie, I totally agree! <br /> <br /> The European eastern cinema is not well known because it is seldom translated, but I am lucky to have this copy in the original language with good English subtitles. Everything in all: Deep, tasty and exceptional ... <br /> <br /> For fast and empty explosive types and lovers of special effect avoid it at all costs, it can be too gentle and good for you! <Br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But if you are interested in different genres and / or classics, I think you will not regret this, and if you buy a good company in your personal DVD library than you deserve big names like Billy Wilder, Lubitsch or Sacha Guitra among some of my top directors. At least for this movie! <br /> <br /> *** The film is never really good if the camera is not the eyes of the poet Orson Welse ***
