Zombie 3 has an interesting history. First of all, it's a continuation of Fulchi's hit Zombie 2, while Zombi 2 is, of course, a marketing idea that would make people think it's a sequel to George A. Romer, Dawn of the Dead, aka Zombie. Are you confusing enough? Basically, none of the movies have anything in common, but who cares when they make money. I think Fulci himself started taking care of production halfway through Zombie 3 when he decided to leave. Bruno Mattei was brought aboard to help pad the film with other scenes to prolong the run. <br /> <br /> Zombie 3 Plot is your typical zombie fare. Scientists are developing serum on an island in the Philippines, terrorists steal him to unleash the plague, and the zombies run amok. Scientists want to create an antibody while the army is aimed at mowing everyone without prejudices. There are also short inserts from Radio DJ that preached how we treat the planet. <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked this movie. I have heard terrible things, but I find that this Goofyan dialogue is quite pleasant. The film seems to be an attempt to raise awareness of pollution, a corrupt military, a man playing god, etc. I feel like it was a serious movie at one point, but it turned away strangely, probably when Mattei came on board. <br /> <br /> In addition to breaking off other zombies, it was very much like Romero's The Crazies. You hear a radio DJ breaking the good news: "If you see men in white suits and gas masks, go for help." This, of course, is played on pictures of men in white zombie shooting. Later, they steal the scene from the Crazies where one of the ordinary, uncontaminated people is killed mistakenly. Gore Factor is quite good in this with zombie hordes around each corner. How's that cool? Allow me to calculate ways? 1. Zombie Birth 2. Flying Zombie Head 3. Zombie Birds. 4. Zombie without feet swimming in the pool. My favorite zombie was a pumpkin at the gas station. He was a bad ass and almost ruptured the entire building and tried to kill the girl. Favorite quote? When a sergeant insists on zombie cremation, scientists are asking, "Do you not think that as soon as the ash is in the air, it falls to the ground and contaminates everything?" Sargeant responds courageously, "You're talking sci-fi right now." He also continues to mention the "sci-fi" that scientists have said even at the end when everyone is dying. Extras: Gallery, stories and interviews, most notably with Mattei, where he insists on 40% of the scenes, but you can not remember which of them or other significant details. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: You must see for fans of the Zombies and Fulc. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.com/HorrorYearbook
