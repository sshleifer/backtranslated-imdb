This movie was very fun, I could not stop smiling as I watched it and you watched it twice in 2 days! The film is exceptionally unique in its humor and visuals, both amazing and parallel to other (more serious) film jewels of Natali Cube and Cypher. I have become a huge fan of Vincenza Natali since looking at Cypher and everything he has done is very interesting. A very nice film about this movie is the music and "lost" characters Dave and Andrew, portrayed by David Hewlett and Andrew Miller (co-author of the story), actors I like very much. Also cool are the X-Box Dead or Alive Fight (you can even see Dave playing Halo at the point) and Andrew is an amazing guitar solo among many other things. Everything in all the great feeling-a good movie about friendship. You have to see it!
