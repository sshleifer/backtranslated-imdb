... that the Bette Davis version of this movie was better than the version of Kim Novak. In spite of all the other comments I have written here, I really prefer Bette Davis, although the Novak version has a continuous story line. However: It seems to me that Davis Mildred's raw emotions are more suitable for a gay girl who can easily become a prostitute. And these are the raw emotions that make up * a part of what the poor doctor falls in love with. It has emotions of despair, failure, "otherness" - strong emotions that it suppresses. On the contrary, Davis Mildred shows her emotions immediately and without criticism. Does not feel despair, failure or "otherness"; Rather just survives as a poor Cockney woman in Victorian times. Novak's portrait was more vulnerable to Mildred than Davis, almost throughout the film. Davis Mildred was never vulnerable until she needed to see a doctor and ask for help. And when she curses her - the way to keep her body and soul together and constantly use her love for her - she probably unleashes the most passionate refusal of the holy saint before you ever saw on the screen: "I died my mouth I washed my shoulder!" Novak's vulnerability was excellent. Davis realism was monumental. <br /> <br /> IMDb votes agree!
