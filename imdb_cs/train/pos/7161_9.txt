He loved the movie. She loved two families going through history. The only question is, when Sam is killed, how does his family continue? Is she the son of Madame Zeroni and Zero is to be related, but no mention of other children? Hmmmmmmmmm. Did he never mention any other child or wife before he spoke to him and fell in love with the teacher? Maybe she had a baby before she started kissing Kate Bandit? Even with mistakes in the movie. I just loved it. The game was great. You are not sure where the story is with Sir Marion, who is at the end, but his character is even more fun. The second "counselor" seems to be for children, but of course perhaps not so much. Poor Ranger had to have a really spooky childhood to be so bad when he grew up.
