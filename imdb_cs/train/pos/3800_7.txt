The world of Dragon Hunters is a world that is attacked by 3D gravity. Planetohyds, bits of buildings, and strange flat plants float in the atmosphere, while land is falling to most characters, is nowhere to be seen. It's a world that reminds of an endless story when Nothing came to eat the world away. <br /> <br /> It's a bit weird, a villain here is also a World Gobbler. This time it is a huge, fiery dragon with fiery eyes. The heroes are a large, yet quiet, warrior, an unpleasant and greedy helper who manages the business side of a duo and a strange unnecessary animal. They are joined by the worst little girl in the world who did not die to my disappointment with a terrible painful and perhaps an early death. The animation is great. Voices and sounds are top-notch. It is a shame that the story is as simple as one can imagine. They go to stop the World Wand, they immediately get to him, beat him. End. No real character development or stories will change. Nor those I'd expect from a plot with such a conspiracy. Bottom Line: It's a cute thing you could watch, kids would probably enjoy it, but that's all about it. No depth of this world (toy intended).
