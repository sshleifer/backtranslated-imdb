This interesting documentary tells of a remarkable story about an expedition in which blind Tibetan children can meet in the Himalayas; but also a personality conflict between two remarkable people. On the one hand, Erik Weihenmeyer, the first blind who climbed to Everest, and the team of (seen) climbers who lead children. On the other hand, Sabriye Tenberken, a blind woman running the first school for blind Tibetans who agrees with the expedition, but then has doubts about how she goes. At a certain level, Sabine simply does not understand the burner philosophy (with emphasis on the summit); He is probably right in identifying a mismatch between the objectives of climbers and the wishes of children, but its certainty in its own right makes it a difficult person, especially because it has an effective veto. In the background of this (reasonably well-buried) conflict, we gain insight into the lives of the children themselves. I liked the film even though it brings a message that is clearly designed to be uplifting - though it describes the argument in detail, the film somewhat relentlessly tells how amazing all those who are involved in it. However, with this assessment, it is difficult to argue with this assessment even if the audience is somewhat stubbornly presented.
