We should have more films about our Native Americans. In particular, I think it would be right to use genuine real Americans. I know this Archie Belaney, who played Pierce Brosnan, did a great job of showing this character because he was an Englishman. But my proposal to Hollywood is that you're putting in more American Indians and never using someone else. Sioux Nation has been placed on the rear burner for too long. Their poverty is a shame to our country. I am convinced that our country should return Black Hills to Sioux. We will ask Israel to return its lands to the Arabs, but we do not make any effort to do the same, we should be ashamed of us. We have to practice what we preach!
