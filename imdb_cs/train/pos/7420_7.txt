Although Kris Kristofferson is good in this role, who would not want to see Elvis Pressly? With drug addiction and falling from the highest glory, Elvis's agent may be scared to be out of the movie, it was a mistake. That would be a perfect movie for Elvisa. Even though the soundtrack is far from amazing, Paul Williams and Barbra Streisand do a decent job of creating an original soundtrack for this "period" piece / musical. A somewhat love story, it's more about the fall of grace and the gift of redemption. Like most tragedies, the hero of the story has died. Also, Gary Busey is once again perfect in not so perfect a role.
