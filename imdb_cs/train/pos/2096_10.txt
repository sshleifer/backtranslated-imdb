With the advent of IMDb, this overlooked movie can now find audiences interested. Why? Because here, the users who are looking for the double winner of Oscar, Glenda Jackson, find her "Return of the Soldier" among her credits. That's what the Oscar winner Julie Christie can do. Ann-Margret fans can click on the title, just like those who look into the career of great Alan Bates. Not to mention the added bonus of the movie supporting heavyweights Ian Holm and Frank Finlay. Any movie with so many notables in it is rewarded with IMDb, since cross-references are taking place here. So why is not this movie on DVD? Are not the producers aware that the Internet Movie Database is a marketing gift for such a film? And "The Return of a Soldier" is definitely the gem that awaits discovery. Get with him, people.
