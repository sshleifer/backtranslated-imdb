People who say this film badly are those who do not understand the movie first. These are people who love film crazy movies and are unfavorable to any film that did not play Leonardo DiCaprio. Wilder Napalm is a neat little movie that may seem strange and maybe stupid at first, but what is missing in the plot, more than it actually happens. One thing, especially about a movie that amazed me that it's music that plays a big part. Those students of film music will notice how important it is in the film, both in the movie Vida and Wilder, and in the background. Wilder's theme, Vida theme and Wallace theme are all heard in the introductory sequence and it's funny how some of the lyrics are playing. For example, in a scene where men sing the "Duke of the Earl" is Vida and Wilder, when men sing something like "She's My Girl" and then goes to Wallace to give him something when men sing "It's My Girl" cleverly shows tension between the two brothers. There are so many small complications in the movie as this, and while it looks like a flop outside, a real student of the movie notices how good this movie really is.
