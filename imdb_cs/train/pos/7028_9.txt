I saw it as a previous viewer by accident, I saw it twice. I really enjoyed, no silly thoughts that did not cause the news just fun entertainment, good songs, good characters and just a good feeling of the film. We highly recommend to those of us who enjoyed the movies and did not dismantle them. Great fun for the whole family here. I did not realize that Rosie Alvarez played Vanessa Williams, she was great and very sad. Songs like one boy and one last bisexual are really nice to listen and tap the feet to make Jason Alexander a complete contrast to his character in Pretty Woman and is very good. Tyna Daley still keeps in mind from Cagney and Lacey, and her voice and accent still reminded her. Overall, I just loved it and would try to buy it if it is available
