Dragon Hunters must be the best-looking animation I've ever seen. It was a jaw. The film is about pairs of rogues looking for some cash, their weird, hairy blue dog that gets rid of the fire, and the girl who dreams of becoming a knight, and they are sent for a journey to go to the ends of the earth to kill a bather, an incredibly immense dragon. But honestly, it does not matter what the film is. Because it's a delightful splendor. Gravity in this fantastic world is different, so blocks of architecture and spheres of land float in the middle of cathedrals and castles and villages alike, and there are forests of floating lily pads. The world is so creative, so beautiful, with any subdued story. The world looks like a set of beautiful pictures. The monsters are also visually stunning, like a dragon fire formed by a bunch of bad red bats. Some of the plot are not too original, just like the main protagonists who want their la and Mens farms and never seem to be able to do that in the world; but gorgeous graphics, some seriously sinister scenes, and emotion-making dialogue make this film a spectacular one.
