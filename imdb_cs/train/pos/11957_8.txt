Big Woody Allen? No. Good Woody Allen? Definitely. I found out that he and his visitors were in the theater, and often in the best Woody Allen lines we had heard. The aging Allen has created a suitable role as Scarlette Johansson's "father" ... well, something like. Some said Johansson was playing "Young Dianna Keaton." I dare to disagree. He plays Woody's dialogue, which always has a very similar feeling in comedies ... like Woody Allen's comedy. That's fine for Woody's award to us. She definitely made Woody's dialogue much better than the young cast of her latest Melinda / Melinda comedy. Some can find Woody's humor tiring, but for those of us who love him when we do it right, we look forward to the next.
