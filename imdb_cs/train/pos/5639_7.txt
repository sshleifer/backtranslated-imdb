I read other reviews and found it to be a comparison of real-life movies (such as What it means to get into a music school), Britney Bashing, etc., etc. So we'll focus on the film and the message. > <br /> This movie I rated 7 out of 10 ages 8 to 14 and for family film. For the average adult man .... 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I like pop / rock music, I am 45. I know of Britney Spears, but I never realized she actually sang Stronger until I did not read credits and reviews. I did not recognize her poster on the wall, so I did not have to worry about "self promotion". I'm watching movies to be entertained. I'm not interested in casting, lighting, producers, directors etc. What is a movie and I am enjoying it. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for a message. The biggest epidemic in the world is low self-esteem (a completely different story), so I look at this report because it's a matter of interest. The film is light, bright and vibrant, great for children. I find that the Texan sound has begun to disappear all over the film, and of course, there are just so many ways to pass the waiver / not give up the message, so yes it was a little predictable. Great news, though ... should be more of them. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great family film, but for a guy who looks at himself, get Hannibal.
