I first saw this movie when I was about 13 years old. It has been broadcast to me and in many ways it still does. But I'm less inclined to think of it as an accurate historical work. It takes a tremendous amount of effort to investigate and relate to racism - and therefore fails to recognize that the strongest weapon against racism is to understand it at the very heart of those who commit it. What, on the other hand, is the dichotomy - on the one hand, the beech and woods in the 3D panoramic rainbow visible - on the other hand, the two-dimensional figures are portrayed as indisputable helpless evil. All this is a great movie story, but it worries me that people see the portrait as "accurate".
