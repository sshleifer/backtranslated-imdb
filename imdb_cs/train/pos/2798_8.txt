Jess is 18 years old, very clever and wants nothing more than playing football when joining a local team she must again and again lie to her parents because they would never approve of her pursuing her dream, want a dear Indian boy and learn how to cook. <br /> <br /> Bend it Like Beckham is a very fun feeling, a good movie that does not have to be deep and complicated, it's as good as it is. Cast are very good and play very well their roles, the story is simple and predictable, but it works perfectly and the script is very realistic and very fun.
