I think this movie is brilliant. there are many reasons why these are some of them 1) a good deal with Tom and Tyler 2) a brilliant machine gun that was a piece of shine 3) I thought the end was a good twist because I never expected that everything would go to Sam Mendes. as well as these 3 points, the film's film look is also good. I was a film student at college and I studied this film in great detail and it was one of the best films I've seen for many years. I would like to say a big thank you to all the people who participated in the film. finally, I would like to say that the best scene in the movie is a scene with a machine gun where John Rooney kills, it's just a pure brilliance when shooting the scene in silence until John Rooney says, "I'm glad you are," it's much better like this I think because the viewer creates his own sound and the sound is totally different for every viewer. <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading this comment, written by Ross Kirk at the age of 16
