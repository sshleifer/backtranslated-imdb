This night listener is better than people generally say. It has weaknesses and seems to be undoubtedly a genre identity crisis, but I think its spooky atmosphere and interesting achievements are fulfilling it. The whole thing feels like one of those fires, "It's been a friend of my story" of ghost stories. One big complaint about the film is stimulation, but slow and sometimes unpleasant stimulation is intentional. Everything that unfolds in this film is well maintained in the realm of possibilities, and real life is just like "no"? So there are no crazy endings or earthquake detection, no "sample" scenes. Thank you Heaven. You have to get into the zone while watching this movie, forget about your reservations and your expectations of what makes (conventional) good movie. Williams is not amazing, but he easily meets the story's needs and his character is about to be somewhat general ("No One") because he's Everyman, the avatar we enter into the story. Performance Toni Collette should be nominated for an Oscar (though he might not win). Try it. Quality and content in itself, The Night Listener is definitely in the top twenty percent of movies that have been released these days.
