The updated version of the story, which was transformed in 1938 into the film of England (The Return of the Frog) about the police pursuit of a master of a criminal known as a frog because of a tooth, such as getting up (bulging eyes, etc.) Who Wears. <br /> <br /> One of the great movies of Wallace from the 1960s is a little fun fun. Brightly influenced (or influenced) the restart of Dr. Mabus, it seems that Frog is a villain rather than a thief master. While it's not the best of Wallace movies, it's worth seeing. It would be an interesting double feature with an excellent older movie. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 of 10.
