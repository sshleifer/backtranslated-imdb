I really think people are wrong about this. First of all, I consider this short film to be very fun and interesting. I just took it for what it is. I think tensions and secrets are subtle in looking at observers. One more thing that interests me is that the viewer gets instantly, even if the story is not clear, just the hints and pauses and emotions played by the characters that give you the impression of being the story of everything that is going on. Nobody else would have done better than Lynch. That is the essence of lynchianism at its best. Sure, I agree with everyone that people who start looking at it with the desire to have fun without any really imaginative work from the viewer will become disappointed. And all right. Lynch is not about it. At least that party is not Lynch. The one who helped make Lost Highway / Mulholland Dr. is fully inclined and people who just expect to have fun as if they see something else will simply not have what it is. My opinion is that the Dark Room is about empowering your animal nucleus, your instinctual self, by giving you the means (image, sound, situation) that you instinctively react to. It is not a joy of any kind, it is about getting the desired reaction. And this, my friend, is pure art.
