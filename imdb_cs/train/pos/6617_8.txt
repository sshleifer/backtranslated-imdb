Animations always seem to be marginal. In Japan, this may not be the case, but in Europe and much more in the US the animation is wearing a big fat brand "KIDS". France is probably one of the most comic-liberal countries that is home to classics like Tin-Tin, Asterix, Lucky Luke, Valereon and so on (if you have not read it yet, they are not late, they and they do not have a nude-stigma DC or Marvel) that a natural film such as appears in France. It suits my predisposed image of French as an artistic, anti-US oriented and talented filmmaker. Fortunately, there is also a "dark scanner" to suppress that view - it seems that art is largely international. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as you may have gathered, Renaissance is artistic and french. If you are a normal person, you get scared. But it is not necessary! Underneath is a cool, elegant cel-shaded look is a good thriller and a good movie overall. That was one of my worries for this film. It's so easy that you transform a big animation into a trick, like Sony & C: they do with their Pixar rip-offs. I was expecting a miserable, sometimes boring and very unpleasant film, but fortunately, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I would also like to use it for neo-noir stuff, but it was good that it was useful at this level. NOTE: I saw a French oak that was okay, as I saw. English may be more interesting with Craig and everything. <br /> <br /> Last Word of Praise Animation. It was amazing. Futuristic, well-worked, nice camera-work, intelligent solution (Eyes looked very good, which is hard to do) and so visually amazing I felt how they exploded "It's so damn impressive!" Again, I really like animations and I appreciate the effort that the studio postponed, so my verdict is a bit distorted. A good movie as well, definitely lives for a "trick".
