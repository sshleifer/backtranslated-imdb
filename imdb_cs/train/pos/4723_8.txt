He really enjoyed this little movie. It is a moving film about fighting, sacrifice and especially friendship between different peoples (the child actor who plays Miki is especially good). Throughout World War II, there are so many great impersonal films that convincingly said that the little story is a true departure from the norm and original. I also add that this movie is far boring, far away! Of course, the horses are amazing and breathtaking scenery. For anyone who really treats your pet as a family (I'm doing it), you'll find this movie particularly enriching. We recommend movie fans looking for something a little different.
