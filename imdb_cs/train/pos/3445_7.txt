First, it was BRAVE. I've seen irreversible and understand comparisons. But I can not begin to understand the people who attacked this film. I see how the end may come from extreme, but I would lie if I did not say, I wished that every person who ever forced a woman to sex deserved exactly what Jared had gotten. On the contrary, it does not solve anything or do anything better, and the fact that the film will not pretend to be what I appreciate. <br /> <br /> The commentary before this called a pathetic movie and said, no adult would stick. I certainly did. I'm 24 years old. The way the film stretches makes me realistic. People have become so used to pastoral eyes and fast charts on the screen that if you ask them to concentrate too long on a single brick at the foundations of the film, not only do they lose interest in scouring what was built and they call garbage. When in fact it's their lack of patience and understanding that they need to fine-tune and not the result of a creative mind like Talia Lugacy for years. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson displayed insensitivity to self-destruction without error. I think she portrayed Maya before and after the attack with great ease and the transition between the two is an act I rarely saw well. Often, like the "youth-oriented" films mentioned in the previous comment, the effects of rape are depicted as extremely manic and impulsive or terribly depressing, isolated and lifeless. Dawson, in my opinion, can make a balance of so many survivors sinking: drone-like existence in a waking state, working some dead-end jobs to survive (and distract) and then overindulging in bad habits to get lost in the haze of substance abuse rather than face what sobriety it brings. <br /> <br /> I thought this film was right and I appreciated it finally showing people a different view of rape. So many people let the end of this film be absorbed in the middle and at the beginning ... I believe Maya's face during the negotiations was over ... not the act itself ... not the revenge or the significance behind it ... just her face ... <br / > <br /> Thank you
