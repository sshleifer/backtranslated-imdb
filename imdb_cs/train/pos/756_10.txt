I have to say that although I despise these fairy tales, I am shocked, I am a girl, I feel I have to express my opinion. I saw Dirty Sanchez before I saw Jackass and I thought he'd overcome Jackass in terms of programming. Story lines and interviews are linked to create more interesting shows. I saw a few minutes of Jackass's movie at night and he could not believe how bad it was, everything just put a joke into jail for a joke without a relationship between anything. It had to be the fastest and easiest show ever edited, the shocking amateur. While drinking the twists is not really my thing as far as a major entertainment show, Dirty Sanchez is from the Jackass League.
