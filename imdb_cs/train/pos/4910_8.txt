This very good movie is cracking with tension. Meanwhile, the piles are high - Police and Public Health Officer Widmark, holding off criminals who do not know they are carrying the epidemic before the outbreak of the epidemic in full? But the smaller elements of the conspiracy show the tension in each scene - between Widmark and the captain of the police, among the poor boys playing Palance and Mostel, between Palance and the dying death Palanca mistakenly believes is the subject of the offender because he has been smuggled into some valuable commodity Widmer and his wife and the basic question of whether the public is better informed about the dangers or hiding the situation to prevent a panic attack in full. The film is beautifully shot by Kazan, in a remarkably well choreographed long shot in place in New Orleans, ending a stunning culmination when Palance escapes as a rat from persecutors, docks, and warehouses. The commentary is excellent, probably the best I've heard about cinematography, framing and clipping, production design, casting of non-professional actors in small roles and irony and parallelization on the plot, such as a visual seminar on film techniques and film noir in general. Check it out once to enjoy the movie yourself, and if you're interested in filming, secondly with a commentary on learning.
