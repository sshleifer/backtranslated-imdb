Since I first watched, "Piedras" is a personal favorite and one of the few pictures I could actually watch over and over again. A large screenplay portrays the lives of a heap of women (all of them linked) with deep understanding and sensitivity. Ramón Salazar achieved a perfect film in directorial debut and proved to be an effective director of actors. <br /> <br /> But not all the performances are excellent. Of all the leading ladies ranges from the average (Najwa Nimri) to the very good (Vicky Peña), but the standing ovation should point to the newcomer Mónica Cervera, who convincingly plays the retarded daughter of Antony San Juan. Enrique Alcides is irresistibly glamorous as a girl's sister, and there are nice little turns from Andrés Gertrúdix, Geli Albaladejo and director Ramón Salazar himself. "Piedras" is beautifully written and shot when I saw that I was moving so I could not stop thinking about it all the days. I highly recommend.
