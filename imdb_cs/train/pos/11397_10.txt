Timeless musical gem, with Gene Kelly in top shape, the stylish direction of Vincente Minnelli and gorgeous musical numbers. It's great fun from start to finish, one of those movies that people smile watching and say they "do not do like them"! But they never did that. A 25 minute music climate without any dialogue is one of the most beautiful in the movie. Movie spell, clearly derived from the heart and soul of all involved. You must see!
