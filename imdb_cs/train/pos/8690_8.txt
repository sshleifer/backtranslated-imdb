Alain Resnais films are truly miraculous that they are not really edited due to continuity, but instead it seems that the shot ends right where memory has been edited. The love of death is sometimes a silent existential drama and a round-creative magical realistic movie, and in both ways, the audience is interested in a whole new aspect of Eros / Thanatos ... or maybe they are creating a new relationship, Agape / Thanatos. <br /> <br /> The beginning is like a bizarre surrealistic horror film. A woman desperately runs the house while a person dies in bed - killed or what happened? Soon, this tension will dissipate when a doctor comes and speaks the dead, but from there begins a newer, strange drama: the man wakes up and, after being dead, the woman and the man fall in love with really tragic consequences. Meanwhile, their friends, who are both priests, follow and subdue their own debate about the nature of love, faith and devotion. Resnais always looks like he has some equipment to make these kinds of stories work, and what his movies are so amazing is that these devices always work. In this case, the Resnais intersects scenes with snowflakes that fall on an exciting orchestral score that disappears and bleeds into further shots that continue the story. This film, which is regularly captured in this elegant side, develops a rhythm that is not very different from an epic poem, and from that moment I have discovered strange memories of Dante's divine comedy, despite the lack of direct reference in the film. Resnais is known as a very poetic filmmaker, but it spreads around the kineopoe structure to something that gives the viewer an introspection that has the ability to bring to the surface some special memories. Memory-telling, Resnais creates. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
