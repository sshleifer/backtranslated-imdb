This interesting Giallo extends a typical but still thrilling conspiracy and a really sadistic killer who obviously likes to hunt his victims down before he kills them cruelly. Emilio P. Miraglia, also made a very interesting "La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba" (see also my commentary on this), the film starts a bit slow, but in all, no time is unnecessary by unnecessary partial drawings or sequences. /> <br /> This film is a German-Italian co-production, but it was released in Germany on a video only in a version adorned with a 15-minute plot under the silly name "The Horror House." At least murderous scenes that satisfy every gorehound are completely intact and the viewer still gets the motive of the killer at the end. But the Italian version, which contains all the shots, is still a matter of course. <br /> <br /> Convincing Giallo with mandatory twists and red ingredients, "La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte" fans and slightly superior to the above-mentioned other Miraglias thriller.
