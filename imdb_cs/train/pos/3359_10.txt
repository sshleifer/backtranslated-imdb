One giornata particolare is a film that makes excellent use of enclosed spaces. In these blunt, empty spaces, the audience sees the emotional turbulence and stormy explosions of two leading figures, Ettore Scola. Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two frustrated individuals, deciding to come together for a few moments of their childless lives. It's a part of the sadness associated with the narrative, which makes us believe that people will have parties with characters close to them. All men would really regret the nature of Sophie Loren. women would certainly cry their hearts to Marcello Mastroianni's existential situation. Discussed sexuality is also one of the key questions of this grim, sad movie. Most characters are confronted with questions about their own sexuality. One giornata particolare can not be called a homosexual film, although it was nicely depicted that the homosexual chap is well mixed with women. This is a film for which Italian director Ettore Scola has created a fairly good mixture of facts and fiction. His idea is to show how the arrival of Hitler changed the destinies of ordinary Italian people. Marcello Mastroianni was great about Marcello Mastroianni. He acts like a real man who does not ask for sympathy. Surely he accepts his destiny and prepares himself to face the worst of his short but meaningful life. The true work of cinema !!!
