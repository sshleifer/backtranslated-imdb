Now it is one of the greatest successes, one role Jack Hulbert in 1931 split into two for the Band Waggon Askey & Murdoch radio team. It boasts a great courageous player who listens to the game of all that's worth, especially Askey of course. History was provided by Linden Travers, Herbert Lomas melodramatics, and Richard Murdoch pragmatism. The group of rail passengers was stuck in a lonely country railway station overnight more than negotiated, scary trains, spectral carriers, hairy sausages, and Arthur trying to entertain them all. His contempt with all falls between side division and threateningly boring. When the formula works, it's very good, but sometimes it becomes very fanciful and forced to make the movie look more dated than it is. But those damn treacherous fifth journalists - thanks to God, which Britain does not have today! <br /> <br /> Finally, a nice harmless movie, to welcome back to the TV screen as an old friend, but if you were to be shaken from the beams, you would probably be very disappointed!
