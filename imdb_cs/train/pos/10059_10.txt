This film is the best movie ever. I can not remember when I pulled the tears for the last time. with tears in my eye, I admire this film. It has all the elements that must have a good movie: Excellent dialogues, music, acting, story / story. A story of friendship, courage, affection, and loyalty between the street masters known to the mask king and the little girl who sells as a boy in the Sheriff's Bazaar. The little girl liked to be his granddaughter and the king of the mask liked his grandson. In fact, they were not usual. Each scene they had was invaluable. Working with the camera is flawless and treats you. The game is inspired. Xu Zhu was excellent as the mask king. Zuzana Zhou "Doggie" looks nice and very well played her character. Zhigang Zhao as Liang Sao Lang was great. He played a very useful and nice figure. If you do not have this movie, try it once, watch it.
