Every child has a movie that he gets into the VHS when he has nothing to do or when there is babysitting around. This was the movie for me. I can tell you exactly, I have seen it at least 100 times, and I can say it's a good movie for children / family. > <br /> I still have a cassette, I did not see it in 5 years, but maybe I'll get this week and I'll be a kid a day. <br /> <br /> You just love the care of the bears and their messege. <br /> <br />
