I thought the movie "I do not" was fantastic. In the past I watched Rob Estes at "Suddenly Susan" & "Melrose Place" and Josie Bissett at "Melrose Place" and liked to see them together in "I Do not Do". They have great chemistry together (I think she got married in real life it helps!) - in the movie they are both widowed with children and a career and fall in love and try to join their already busy chaotic families together without dropping the ball. Of course, he stumbles but keeps it together, which is what works and educates the family. So many people talked about this movie - all good! - and that movie left us more. This would be a great series - attractive for many ages! - it would be so nice to see real life on earth, a family show like this that shows the reality of so many of our lives today - instead of so-called "Reality TV," that all stations are stunning us for days. Somebody tells the ABC family that they have the beginning of a new series!
