The big problem is where to get started because this film needs your attention in the next two hours and you better not have to miss a few minutes to get the coke because there is a danger that you can not follow. But there is also a pause. Bruce Willis has to get into the timemachine to find out some antivirus for the virus that caused the animal to rule around the world in 1996. Some mistakes first end in 1990, then in World War I and how confused it may all look Terry Gilliam comes with what must be one of the most intelligent scenarios ever. This ex-man of Monty Phyton knows exactly how to say the brilliant SF stories and his cast could not be better, there's crazy Brad Pitt (his performance in the asylum is memorable), and the great Bruce Willis who proves he's more than some Schwarzenegger , they want to be. It's a movie that you can watch over and over again, because the script is so weird and complicated (and yet you can watch) that every look gives you another surprise. One of my great favorites.
