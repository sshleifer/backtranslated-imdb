... Hawk Heaven for fans of French cinema and French French Screen Actor / Actress. In their worst situation, it is a pardon, actors are beginning to talk about other actors, question the validity of acting as a profession at all, etc. Even though it is best, it is the famous celebration / mission of some of the best actors currently working . From a simple assumption - Jean-Pierre Marielle's demand for water to be ignored in the restaurant - Blier rotates in all directions and allows French cinematography cream to remember her stuff even before the camera even gives a nod to those who are no longer around (Jean Gabin, Lino Ventura), including the father of director Bernard, one of the great pianists of the French film, from which a celestial call is made at the end of the film. Discursive and prolix, yes, guilty as accused, but also something of wine pleasure.
