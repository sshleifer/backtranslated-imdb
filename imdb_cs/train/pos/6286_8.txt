in 60 seconds. where I started, keeps you in a movie with some good action and some cool cars. people say it's not a good movie I'm not sure it has some cheese parts but what the action movie is not. I gave him 8 of 10 causes of action and comic relief if you like Rock or Face Off before this movie is alright in your alley cage batch of good work alongside one of the most under rated actors in my mind Del -Roy Lindo. I think sometimes some people search for films, sometimes you need to sit, enjoy the movie, and ask yourself if they do what they are doing. which means that when it comes to an action contract. if they are trying to make a movie to change the way movies work and try to win every award from their good, right? I think they did an action movie that went off to give it a chance and you will not regret it.
