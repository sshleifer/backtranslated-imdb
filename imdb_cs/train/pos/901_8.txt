Well ... Vivah is a pretty good but typical film Sooraj Barjatya. It shows different aspects of Indian families, wedding ceremonies, etc. The film is more than good but not very good. <br /> <br /> The great plus point of the film is direction, music and Shahid and Amrita (especially the last scene). The film begins with a common factor in Indian film --- A girl not loved by her stepmother. The story is a bit of a movie, but it's good, so good that the movie is a blockbuster. <br /> <br /> The minus point is the common story of Bollywood. Overall, I would say it's twice, you have to watch the movie to see typical Indian family values ​​and loving love!
