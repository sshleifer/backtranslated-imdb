Well, I admit that the casting in the movie is really weird - part of it is due to the conspiracy, but I still had some trouble knowing that Pierce Brosnan plays this lead (though he really did a pretty good job). <br /> <br /> It is based on the true story of an Englishman who lived with Canadian Indians in the early 20th century. He claimed to be mixed Indian blood. In fact, he was so successful and well thought that people came from all over the world to hear his lectures and were taken to wilderness trips - even though he was not an indian of mixed blood and all his knowledge was from books or fake! The film focuses on what happened when a scam was discovered. The acting and setting was great and I loved the movie (as soon as I stopped believing Brosnan). She did not have a widespread distribution - probably because it was pretty cerebral - not Bond's film or romance - it's a really special film about a remarkable man.
