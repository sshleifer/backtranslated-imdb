An amazing film full of great undervalued performance and a sharp, intelligent dialogue. The film, in fact, makes it different that there is a lot of sadness in the whole sense. The story is highlighted by issues, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, the fear of losing work in a world where it had disastrous consequences. Most of all, it originated in a world that no longer existed since it was disturbed since World War II. In fact, the film is barely comedy if you compare the percentage of serious scenes with comic scenes. Still, it's funny - listen to Margaret Sullivan's fierce rejection of Jimmy Stewart and watch his painful expression by answering that her notes were a remarkable mixture of "poetry and anger." It's funny, sharp and sad at once. Notable success and one of the ten greatest comedies on the screens ever heard.
