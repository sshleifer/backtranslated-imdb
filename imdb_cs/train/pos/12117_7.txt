Although this film gave Davis a map because of her great performance as an illiterate waitress / prostitute Mildred Rogers, this film is generally unsatisfactory for me. The game is really fine. What I can not comprehend for my life is how or why Phillip, a sensitive and well-trained young man, will continually abuse this constant, constant dish towards him: We regard our naive tolerance as ridiculously unbelievable in certain respects. Yes, I know he is a sensitive, introverted intellectual. But Davis is such a poisonous witch that no one who would cultivate it would tolerate her attitude or action and make it credible. Davis is amazing in her role: yes, she can go overboard in her histrionics, but it's a vividly creative portrait of how you look at it. It's a shame she did not play a gangster mint. Her figure would be completely believable as a tramp between low lives!
