This criminal thriller is a bit like a movie noir, although it changes the context from the post-war to the cold war and has something relatively decent about how to say about humanity. In the movie "Pickup on South Street", the police are good boys, the criminals are real boys and the only enemies are "The Commies" who are ultimately separated from benevolent people by being emotionally personified, driven by genuine care for their own value as it is shown in constant still images that hide the movie. <br /> <br /> This film revolves around characters. The characters of this film are rather unique and detailed: Skip a pocket that is able to look at any danger and sometimes while browsing through its own property; Moe informant who is just trying to save a spectacular funeral but who can capture the heart and respect of almost all other characters (and spectators); Candy, a badly named innocent girl who thinks she's doing government work and does not fully understand the conspiracy she's involved with; and Joey, a former friend of bad Commie Baddie, who is trying to hide everything from everyone, and ironically the worst person who does it. Take a lot of colorful supporting characters (for example, a guy with chopsticks and cops) and "Pickup on the South Street" treats you with a wonderful personality while hunting mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilms. > <br /> --PolarisDiB
