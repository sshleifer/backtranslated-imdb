This early film Anime was a good film I once caught on Science Fiction when Anime was really popular in America and not the class catastrophe that an adult swim claims to be on a cardboard network. I sincerely think it has less in common with being less popular and more with the fact that people would rather buy DVDs are watching episodes uncut on the internet. This movie probably did not have so many cuts, and the voice work was fine for a dubbed movie, even though I would rather watch the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use some rather annoying voices for children in dictation. This film features a young boy boarding a train called the Galaxy Express, hoping to build on a planet that has the technology to transform it into a robot. He wants to become a robot who will avenge his mother, who was brutally murdered in the hands of a robot who hunts people for fun. During their adventures, they become friends with various train workers, as well as a woman who resembles her deceased mother, a beautiful woman named Matel who, like most women in Anime movies, has a secret that can either be really good for our young hero or really bad. He goes from planet to planet as a train does a different stop and he runs into a space pirate named Captain Harlock, who apparently played in his own animated series, so basically Galaxy Express takes place in this universe. Overall, a very good ride with somewhat strange and unexpected ending. It will be a sequel, but it was not as good as this, but the end was a bit more than the end.
