I'd give this show ten out of ten if it was not for jokes. People are so damn sensitive that they are sad! So quickly, we show "racism" of shows and jokes, but they say so ridiculously sexist, dying crap as "good, rain, some of these other performances make these jokes much better because at least they have hot women." So disgusting. Funny jokes are great because really, who takes the abortion anyway seriously? At least I'm not a son * born. I have heard that Reba McEntire and Sarah Silverman are working together to make a film about the sisters who are on the road together. Talk to the movie of the year!
