This is by all categories the best movie I've ever seen. Forget about Hollywood - their movies are always absorbing - it's art! Moon Children's story begins with Keim - a Japanese vampire who does not feel what happened and lives in denial. His desire for ultimate death leads him to Mallepa, where refugees from several Asian countries live. Here he meets Shoem, a street-based sergeant. From there, the film is an intense experience based on the visual and emotional parts of the film. She has everything; you laugh, cry, angry, excited, sad, happy ... I never touched the film the way this movie does. And the actors are amazing - I've never heard anyone speak so many languages ​​without it sounding weird. The great remark of the editor for the creation of this masterpiece ... The last comment on this great film lies in the fact that Gackt (former Malice Mizer singer) and Hyde (vocalist from L'Arc-en-ciel) are playing excellent roles such as Sho and Kei. I am amazed how Gackt can change the way he speaks and acts according to the age he is in. <br /> <br /> This must be seen. If you never see any movies, look at Moon Child, Crow (Brandon Lee) and the newly released masterpiece Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children. Everything in their native languages, of course!
