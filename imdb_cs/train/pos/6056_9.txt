Super Speedway makes a great demo of your new DVD / bigscreen / 5.1 channel audio. IMAX takes you directly to a racing car where you drive at speeds that resemble driving sequences in the Grand Prix (if it appears only on DVD!). I like to watch it over and over again. The only minus, and why I did not give him 10, are some of the driving sequences seem suspicious, as if the movie was accelerated. The soundtrack also requires a bit of suspicion of infidelity - everything you hear in a real car is the engine. You will not hear swooshes when you go under the bridges.
