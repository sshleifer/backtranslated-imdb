Oh, the Kelly / Sinatra musical. So known, right? Yes, but this is not the one you usually hear. In this city. But if you stick to it, you may learn something. Well, probably not. In any case, Anchors Aweigh tells the story of two sailors on a three-day or four-day holiday. Joe is "Sea Wolf" and Clarence, a book type, asks Joe to give him a "lady." Now that the molluscs are raised, only a small Donald gets home. That's where they meet Susie, the temptress, the lake. I'm just kidding! Clarence falls in love with her. At least he thinks so. Is right? Or is he crazy? Or is it simply mismanaged by the company? Find out all this and more when you look at {trumpet fanfare} ANCHORS AWEIGH! <br /> <br /> If you want to see that Kathryn Grayson is something different but sweet sweet, try Kiss Me Kate (1953).
