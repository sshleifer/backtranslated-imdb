He loved the movie. I even liked most actors. But for me, Mrs. Davis's very bad effort of accent, and her stiff acting, really makes the otherwise compelling film very difficult to watch. Sure, if any other modern actor played the same role in the same style as Ms. Davis, they should laugh at the screen. I really think she was making this call. Now if she had Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman's wife, I would have enjoyed it much more. I think I just can not get Bette Davis. I have always thought of her as an actor who plays "no matter what role he has". A possible exception is now Voyager. I'm sure many of the other reviewers will explain this carefully (and I hope civilian) details of how I'm totally wrong in this direction. But I'll keep watching the movies in it because I like stories / writing / supported cast, but I'll always think of different actresses who could do a better job.
