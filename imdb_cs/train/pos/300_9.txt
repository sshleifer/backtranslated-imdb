With the various Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras scattered after the cast and the crew "everyone laughed" is a very family matter. If you add the fact that B. Gaszara and Miss A. Hepburn had a short, but passionate affair in the previous picture, almost a private film made for the enjoyment of the participants, and that the entertainment of the wider audience is only supplementary considerations. If all of this likes herself for her very pleasure, you will be pleased to hear that Mr. Bogdanovich is doing well with this particular danger and bringing a sweet and somewhat innocent "I love the NY" paean, which is also an altar on which we can worship the ethereal beauty of late Miss Hepburn. Do not think it's her picture. Mrs. Gazzara admits to her most self-realizable in all the scenes. The conspiracy - the detective agency is too involved in the affairs of its clients - is of little importance, it is the performance of two leaders who dominate the film. Bogdanovic's triumph is the way his camera seems to love his actors, from "Targets" onwards. There is a glow of each of his films, which only special artists can make from an inanimate piece of optical instruments. Miss Hepburn is especially benefiting from this love. A further insight into his work can be gained from reading the published collections of his essay on stars and directors, especially "Who the hell is that about?" He recently was left in bookstores in the UK. The soundtrack to "everyone laughs" differs from the concert of Louis Armstrong in New York in 1947 to Sinatra on Earth in Latin, as eclectic as the city he portrays. Mr. B, the painting of the "Golden Boy" was certainly stinking, for that is the nature of the movie, but it is also certain that one day it will be restored, and when that day comes, "everyone laughed," it will be recognized so well.
