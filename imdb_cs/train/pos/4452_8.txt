Do not do a labyrinth. This is a wonderful scary movie. This was a diploma work for writer / director JT Petty. He did a great job of having me on the edge of the seat. I never knew what to expect, and for the crazy horror movie it's Nirvana! The film concerns an older man who lives in a separate cabin in the woods. One day, when looking for a cat in the woods, he's witnessing a child's murder, is not it? He's angry about the rest of the movie. What is most unusual about this movie is that there is no dialogue until the last scenes. I find it interesting. The writer will manage to grasp your senses and give them a constant tug. Let this film go, you will not be disappointed.
