Take a pinch of GOODFELLAS, mix it with BOHATY, add some Roman mythology and a lot of low-impact comedy, and you have SOPRANOS about the crowd clan from northern New Jersey. It's as fun as a match. I'm not the biggest fan of this show, but I admire the very complicated Tony Sopran, who is James Gandolfini, a psychopath with an occasional flash of conscience. I also came to admire the contributions of people such as Gravely Dom Chianese as a confused but murderous Uncle Junior, silver hair Tony Sirico as the ever-confused Paulie and the very beautiful Edie Falco as the duplicate, hard-like nails Carmela Soprano. Violence is sudden and graphic, body counting is constantly rising every season, but it is often the smallest moment that is most important here. Look at Paulie and Tony's nephew Christopher (Michael Imperioli late LAW & ORDER) as they get lost in Pine Barrens and settle down on a bitter cold night in an abandoned trick, both convinced they have it.
