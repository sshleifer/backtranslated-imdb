Featuring a fascinating performance by Will Smith and a storyline that is harder for your hearts than a middle-solo rock guitarist, "Seven Pounds" passes through the previous director's collaboration with the actor (The Pursuit of Happiness), which I also loved. Remember the name of Gabriele Muccino, because some of his films can skip without notice if the actor connected to the project is not that high profile. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to find Will Smith soon, I put two and two together when she calls her own suicide in the first scene and the scene when the character of Rosario Dawson is introduced as an incurable heart but I still think, that writer / director made the right choice by giving bookends (bookends are the first and last scene) in this way, is the source of urgency and tension in the film and gradually found out how exactly one can be led to that final sacrifice and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between Smith and Dawson's character flourishing and developing, he always knew in the back of the mind what was for these unfortunate two. <br /> <br /> One of my friends, with whom I saw the movie, thought Smith's character might have a divine gift and I understand why: his performance is almost angelic when he is in the presence of his seven elected, otherwise he could to be harsh and frightening, and when he is full of the weight of his situation, he felt too much and he completely disintegrated. It's a pretty versatile performance. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can not forget the mention of the reconstruction of the crash scene, which was really quite amazing in terms of cinematography paired with music. Put it on your list.
