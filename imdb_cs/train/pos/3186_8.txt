I find this movie very pleasant. The story is simple and easy to digest, humor is light and clean, and because a story that involves a mistake in identity is quite common, I found out that I'm looking forward to seeing this story tell the story. It turns out to be very nice. The performance of women's leadership is admirable; her portrayal of an innocent, naive girl trying to make some white lies to David's sophisticated role was very charming. I also know that Vera is dancing very well. I found myself attracted to her fingers when she was hopelessly and flawlessly assured of the stage. For those who have enough of today's films filled with shame, you will enjoy this movie thoroughly.
