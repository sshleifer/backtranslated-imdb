I've been watching "Elephant Walk" for the first time in about 30 years and was interested in how similar a story line is to a remarkably better "Rebecca". As others have said, you have a sweet young thing that has become an enchanting and excited master of the estate just to find that her marriage is threatened by the inevitable recollection of a greater than a living, yet deeply damaged, relative. You have a strict and disagreeing servant, a crisis that either joins a pair or inevitably tears them, culminates in the fiery destruction of a large estate. Meanwhile, the "Elephant Walk" also owes some of its spooky jungle atmosphere to the "letter," Bette Davis Love Triangle set to Singapore rubber plantation rather than Chinese tea plantations. Maltin gives "Elephant Walk" only two stars, and IMDb readers are not very nice, but despite my predictability I liked it. Elizabeth Taylor never looked prettier, and Peter Finch does a credible job as a very good man who can not get rid of the influence of her slave. Dana Andrews - popular in "Laura" and "Best Year of our Life" - is useless as Elizabeth's frustrated admirer. The real star is a bungalow, one of the most beautiful interiors in the history of the film.
