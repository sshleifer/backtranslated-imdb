The first of Tarzan's films, staring at John Weissmuller. This conspiracy is already summed up, so I will not come back to it again. You just know that the actors who played Jane and Tarzan were born for the role. If you have not seen this movie and you only have modern Tarzan movies as a link, you are missing real treats. It does not matter how far we have come to the making of movies, makeup ... Nobody ever played Tarzan like Johnny Weissmuller. He was and was Tarzan.
