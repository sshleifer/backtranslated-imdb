Hello, this little movie is especially interesting for artists, filmmakers or music makers or visual artists because: <br /> <br /> One can feel and explore David's touch / style directly from a short piece of relative simplicity. <br /> <br /> You can see the rhythmic spacing of frames, pans and sound elements. <br /> <br /> As a simple film, this creature is multilayered. For example, there are some sounds that drone all the time while others appear (though subtle) at certain points to support certain shots. <br /> <br /> You can also see several types of pan: some go up and down with a slight return. There is a diagonal pan. Sometimes, sometimes and again, you can zoom in. <br /> <br /> Lightning and the composition / layout of the elements in the space are, as usual and of course, the work of the painter / artist. This can also happen in this dirty room. That means: a person can make a great art by simply arts to place the look / view and composing the scene. Then come the forcelins of visuals: like digonales, parallels, etc. Degrading light and color, though without too much research for textures as in large productions, they are also fine. It's a sketch of an artist ... Everything is not counted, but it is done with an inner feeling and this feeling gives David a touch / feeling like any real artist.
