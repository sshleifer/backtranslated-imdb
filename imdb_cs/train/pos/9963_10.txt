I saw this movie when I was a little girl. And I always enjoyed it. Sure, the graphics are compared to the others, but in the seventies it was great. I only saw it in the original Spanish version, and I thought it was amazing. This is how I remember that my Christmas was with my family - magical. Santa Claus was amazing and I could not wait to come back every year. <br /> <br /> If you have a child / children and speak Spanish, bring them to watch this old-fashioned version of "Santa Claus". It's a different version than we are used to today, but who says there is only one way? It's a fun movie you can watch. Teaches kids good or bad. I do not know how the English subtitle version is or if English is, but Spanish is the best. Enjoy and enjoy! Feliz Navidad!
