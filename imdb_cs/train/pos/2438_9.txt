It was a gem. Wonderful acting from the leaders of Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady and all the supported cast. The film discovers a subject that does not only concern Irish and Irish history but many communities around the world and many marriages in these communities. With intensity and sincerity, the film shows how religious beliefs and traditions led the wedge to a loving and passionate family. The title "Love divided" could not be better captured. Although it was a true story, and it's happening in Ireland in the 1950s, seeing how the whole village erodes and starting "pogroms" reminds me of Russian history. Intolerance and prejudice are still too strong in the world and unfortunately they are deeply hidden within human nature. As in the film, Liam Cunningham's character writes: "Hate was always there under the surface." It was interesting to follow the moral decisions that people make in this story. Also, the character of the Catholic priest and what happened to him at the end of the story was quite meaningful. The story, however, gives hope that the love of two people can conquer everything and love makes us better, stronger. Liam Cunningham's character goes through the transformation throughout the story and becomes the person he always wanted to be. Again, acting is top-notch. The story is fast. The Irish landscape is just as beautiful as ever. Highly recommended.
