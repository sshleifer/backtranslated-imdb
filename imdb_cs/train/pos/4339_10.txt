This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I feel very touched by the theme the film intends to say. One sentence that is still on the mind is that "history repeats". Life is what the film shows: when people are young, they do not seem to understand their parents, their husbands; people have every excuse for not sharing the most pleasant time with the children until late; people always have to work hard to support the whole family, but they can only neglect the subtle feeling of their partners; people are always changing their perspectives in different phases of their lives; people can always be forgiven if their heart is full of love for their loved ones; nothing is more important than the relationship of blood that people share in this world, and it is never too late to talk with your people about what they feel at the bottom of their hearts to achieve a better understanding between themselves to end sometimes, they should not be sorry or sorry because they keep their words and there is always hope - a new life. Actors and actors are fantastic. They understood the intention of the director perfectly. The film charm lies in my effect bringing to the face a handsome and wonderful combination of cheers and tears.
