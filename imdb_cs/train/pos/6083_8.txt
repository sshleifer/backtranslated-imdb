Brian Dennehy, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantalino and best Jeff Fahey, all in one movie. Wow is all I can say about it. These are the four most underestimated biz actors and they work together beautifully together. It's like poetry playing each other and emptying their natural ability to look as if they've been the best buddies for years and filming. The film itself is fine and one that can be quite intense to see for the first time, and the four stars help re-watch-ability to a large extent. I can not describe how it is good to see Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahey together on the screen, the biggest moment is when they look at a few at a distance and fill the vocals themselves, almost bringing tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> Good movie, great acting, go. Why? Four words: Fahey, Dennehy, Paxton, Pantalino.
