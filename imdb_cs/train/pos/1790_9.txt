I love this movie and it's a great example of family threats, romantic love stories and a very sad story. Everything was so perfect and excellent in this movie. It was such a great mix of actors and actresses and with some laughter and much crying this film deserves to win a lot of awards. With reference to a beautiful screenplay, and even though I would be related to a notebook and family stones, it was much more cunning, sad and brilliant than these movies. The evening tells of a love story between an old woman who dreams of her younger years, and her two daughters stay side by side while she is not well. The story that is dated back is so strong and I was great sitting on the edge of my seat. You really know all the characters and eventually I wanted to watch it again. It's a terribly sad and live-made and filmed movie that's really unique, and everyone should see it as it's really amazing. All the shows are amazing and the film captures your attention from the very beginning and never leaves. I loved it and I'm so glad I watched it was a really amazing movie ...
