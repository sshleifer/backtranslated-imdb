The film Kongwon-do ui presents him with a relatively intimate view of meaningfulness (as well as general insignificance) in the life of various Koreans; Empty people are looking for ways to fulfill themselves, enjoy the escape of nature. From the beginning to the end of the film, we observe mistakes of different characters; we learn about their shortcomings and their desires, about the complexity captured in human life (and yet the superlative simplicity of humanity). Although the film is moving slowly, it may be very contemplative. He does not find any ideas but allows thoughts to appear about himself, allowing conceptions to be revealed. The film ends as suddenly as it begins, and one really understands the meaning of loneliness that love is often the act of selfishness and the many mistakes we make. It's a look into everyday life, very good and beautiful. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for action or intense drama, it's not the movie. However, if you have honest, original and meaningful movies that are not forced and glitzy, it's a great movie you can watch.
