This one has a lot to do - Sinatra, Styne, Cahn, Pamela Britten - and a smaller amount of peat - Iturbi, Grayson - plus some humor - Kelly. It was Sinatros' first real film, where the producer spent a few dollars and saw it on the screen (previously appeared in two low budgets, Higher A Higher and Step Lively), but if they relied only on Sinatra tubes and Grayson's deep six plus Iturbi ego -the shutdown of piano spots would be left with a much stricter movie and a better presentation for Sinatra. How is the heavy score in all of his songs from both duets with Kelly - We hate to leave, I begged her - to his solo, which makes the Sunset, the magic of you and I fall in love too easily. Despite this Step Lively, he remains the best Sinatra musical of the 1940s on the tenth budget.
