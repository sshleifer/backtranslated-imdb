The "ladies man" suffers from a common problem among films based on "Saturday Night Live". And that means the sketch, which usually lasts in five minutes, will not be so good in ninety minutes. Though this movie laughs, like Tim Meadows as Leon Phelps, a 70-year-old sexual maniac, and Will Ferrell as an obsessed husband occupied by Leon. So this movie is fun enough, but it's not "Wayne's world"!
