Despite what the others said (* cough *), it's my favorite movie of all time. I do not know how long I've been waiting for it, but once I finally did, I immediately fell in love. Sure, it's weird, but it just makes it more exciting. For those who do not know, Moonchild is one of the first films of Gackt and Hyde. They did not do much, maybe 3 or 4 peaks. So give them some credit. We all know that Adam Sandler was not the best. I believe they are doing some special situations there, but despite that, I seem to find the best points of this movie, emotions and not. That's why I gave and always give this movie 10 of 10.
