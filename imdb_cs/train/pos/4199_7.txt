The only thing about this movie that scares me is that the DVD is so expensive. It's too little for my budget, or I would buy it because the film is a good example of the movie noir ... and I look at Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelm Ritter. <br /> <br /> The Criterion creates great DVDs, but sometimes the price is a little too much. This is the case for an 80-minute black and white, mono sound movie that is good, but not exceptional, cinematic. The story is a story (as opposed to visual actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a pocket (Widmark) unintentionally ends with the spy microfilm he holds when he suffers Peters's wallet. (say it three times!). All but Peter are believable in this film: Widmark, cops, US agents and communists, and especially Ritter as "Moe," an informant. She and Widmark are the stars of this movie. Peters does a decent job of playing a cheap flores but loses credibility before he falls in love with Widmark at the first meeting, even if it is a shame to her. Only in the movie world! It's bad, because the horrible romance part of the story dares it. This average movie noir, which means good, but not big, and definitely not worth it for $ 25-35. At this price, we could do much better in the movie noir market.
