Drew Barrymore is always a great performer and her great performance in this movie, where he plays a very complicated young Gal (Holly Gooding), "Missed Parts" of 2000, which ends in New York and travels to California and shares the apartment with the new George writer Newbern (Patrick Highsmith), Far Harbor, 96. Holly is starting to do many special things and she is trying to find her brother in a psychiatric institution after killing her father. If you look close enough, you will actually see that Mother Drew Barrymore appears in her real life as her mother in this picture. If it was not for good acting Drew Barrymore and George Newbern, this movie should only be seen in Halloween night! However, it certainly has a surprise in END !!!!
