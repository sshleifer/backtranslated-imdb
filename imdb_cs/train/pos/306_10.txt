Well, I saw "everyone laughed" when she appeared in Europe in 1982 and still had a vague but precious souvenir. I just saw it on the tape, almost twenty years later ... Bogdanovic really has a hearty immobility over his characters and kind sympathy, which is hard to feel too. Outstanding comics and actors, good lines everywhere and for everyone, and nice editing. I laughed and smiled all the time. Just like us all, sometimes. Go get it.
