Kazan's early film night earned Oscar. Some of the reviews here come in extraordinary detail and length of the film and its symbol, and it evaluates it very well. I almost see where they come from. But I prefer a tighter approach to the long-forgotten movie, which seems to have been shot virtually without any budget and quasi-style. The Pneumonia epidemic is relaxed in the streets of New Orleans and is a military practitioner (Widmark) and city detective (Douglas) to hold the main carrier (Palance). The film is moody, shot in black and white and makes very good use of space. Widmark is as beautiful as usual. Forget symbolism (the crime equals sickness and illness equals crime) and just enjoy pursuit. It is not always easy to watch such a film because we are well in this new century because it is a special style that was very short-lived (after World War II until the early 1950s) and it is unlikely that it will be interested in an occasional film observer. For those who are watching for the first time, go to the end. It's different and I honestly do not know how they shot some of them. I can say that it probably took as long as the final film, like the first 90 percent of the film.
