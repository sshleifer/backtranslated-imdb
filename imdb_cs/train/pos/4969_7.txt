It's amazing to see that Shane Meadows already has an international influence - LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDANT shares many themes with A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS: indefinite class identity over work, but rather below center, unheded father, abandoned urban environment, adult sense of failure, barely concealed fascism that leans modern urban life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But if Meadows is a formal formalist, Mariage trades with paintings and his coolly composed, wonderfully surrealistic, monochrome frames serve to distance from dirty and rather bleak objects that, like Meadows, from high to tragedy within seconds. <br /> <br /> There are long-haired and clich√©, but Poelvoorde is a convincingly mad, ordinary man with ordinary ambitions whose attempts to implement them are hatstand dangerous; while the individual sets - the popcorn / pidgeon explosion; the best marriage after death and the dead - handle despair to catch apparitions.
