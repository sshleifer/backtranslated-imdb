I like old movies by Burt Reynolds. They are more fun and better than any other movie together. They could stop making movies after "Cannonball Run 2" but I think how they might know it would not be better anymore? Man is good at this movie. Burt Reynolds must dress like a chicken and drive in a race car a lot and the rich Loni Anderson is at hand and looks extremely hot eighty way. Burt and Loni, it was days! I had this magazine with Loni Anderson's ads for the vacuum cleaner. I certainly loved this ad! In addition, there's one part in the movie where the spectators on the racetrack are upset about what Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing and shows that one of the spectators bends and holds his finger on his butt to show his disappointment! So I laughed, almost died at night! If you find this movie, hiring it! And then never look for another movie, because I tell you right now: it makes no sense.
