Curly Sue is 6 years old with hair abundance and life as a drifter. She and her father Bill (Jim Belushi) try to survive in the streets by being small time artists. In Chicago, Bill decides to jump in front of a car in a costly parking garage, while Curly will scream about litigation and traction to the intended victim. It happens to be a very upscale lawyer named Gray (Kelly Lynch), who is rightly horrified at what she has done. Not only do the fraudsters make some cash but spend the night in Gray's plush apartment. Even Gray feels he owes them more, so three of them are hanging together for spell. Gray knows just lucrative law and nothing about life. Who should teach her better than Bill and Curly, the savvy experts on life reality? But all good things have to end and there is no life for a legal expert and a few scammers. Or is she there? It's a sweet and funny movie about unexpected. Curly is certainly fun as Shirley Temple, but of course much nicer. Belushi gives a rare touch of performance when it's on his luck and Lynch is clear as snooty but a soft touch lawyer. John Hughes, as a writer and director, once again shows us a magical touch because the screenplay is alive and unpredictable. Just look at Curly and Bill to get Gray out for the night, no money and see funny results. Are you looking for happy endings, long promised and finally delivered, with a few uncertain moments between them? This is your custom-made movies.
