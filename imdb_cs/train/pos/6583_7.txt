This long episode consists of stunning surprises, thrillers, secrets, and fears about the battle of Sherlock's intelligence against Charles August Milverton, who is the main blackmailer. This is an excellent long run of the Jeremy Brett-Holmes series. In the film, the usual Holmes cannon appears as Inspector Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson, although no Moriarty, but the biggest villain, Charles Augustus. It's a real jerky yarn with intrigue, excitement and tension, including an exciting final twist. It's a special Sherlock movie, but we find Holmes fall in love with servants, kiss, cry, and even rob. This time, together with an episode of "Scandal in Boheme" with Irene Adler, it resulted in the one that Holmes is in love with. Top Brett's performance, he is next to Peter Cushing's best Sherlock TV while the cinema is forever Basil Rathbone. Brett acts as an inconsistent, noisy, shameful sleuth. Here Dr. Watson is not a comic, botcher and clumsy friend personified by Nigel Bruce, but he's a clever and cunning partner well-acclaimed by Edward Hardwick, the perfect contrapuntator Brett. Casting is a truly magnificent, special mention of Robert Hardy as a sharp resentment. Hardy, now a famous role as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter, is a veteran of a forty-year career and several accomplishments such as the 10th Kingdom and Winston Churchill. In addition, side actors with amazing performances appear, including Nickolas Grace, Sophie Gordon, Serena Gordon. The film has a colorful atmosphere, the London Street and the Baker Street are well-designed. Стетелика е много функционален филтър, Cest contributions contributors, tellers position курс.
