After the AFM distributor interview appeared at night "Whacking", I must say that I was absolutely impressed. The audience laughed at the whole direction. Unfortunately, every territory was already sold so I did not have a chance to buy a movie, but I really believe it will be a big hit both at home and across the sea. I agree with the note that "Whipped" should not be built as a male "Sex and City", mainly because, unlike "Sex and the City", "Whipped" is a satire of dating that is never too much of a serious concern. "Whipped" moves entertainment in relationships so that most sexual comedies do not dare. The film I filmed in the AFM also had a conspiracy and story than "Swingers", "Clerks" and "Sex and the City". "Whipped" never slowed down and provided the audience with a constant comedy. Amanda Peet's performances and rest of the cast were all rock solids, which made the movie more impressive in terms of budget.
