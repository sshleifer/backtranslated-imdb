This is one of my favorite kung-fu films and is considered to be one of the most popular Shaw brothers in the late 1970s. The story is interesting and twisted, the characters are cool, each with their own style - toad, snake, lizard, etc. The action is limited compared to other Chang Cheh / Venoms movies, but what's interesting with different styles of kung-fu views from different characters. I recommend this film to those who think that all Shaw brothers, especially the films of Chech Chu are the same, most of his films mostly focus on 10 tigers and Shaolin vs. Manchu. This film is compared to fresh air.
