I never fail to amaze and disturb the evil that has been world-famous in the history of the world, and the Catholic Church in the twentieth century seems to be standing at the very top - considering that the wisdom of history and modern times should have some exhausting effect. Divorced love is the story of a true family that manifests itself in unconscious intolerance and prejudices by all in the name of the non-empty Church doctrine. At the beginning of the film, we offer a view of the bucolic life in a small Irish village where Sheila and Sean Cloney happily married two young children. Sean is a Catholic, and Sheila is Protestant, but she does not have any problems with her children raised as Catholics. There are no signs of hostility between Catholics and Protestants in the village. Loving and loving relationships soon fall apart when Sheila expresses the desire to have her older child attend Protestant school. The local priest is defending himself to ban this "sin," and soon Sheilain's husband and the entire Catholic population of the village turned against her, just like her dad, a local dairy farmer. Sheila in kidnapping and despair of kidnapping her two daughters and escaping from the area. <br /> <br /> Special attention should be paid to Orla Brady, who plays Sheila. It gives an extremely powerful performance in which the viewer is drawn into an emotional trauma in which he decides to reject the wish of a husband he deeply loves to express his keen desire to become independent of the pressure of this device. On the same basis is Liam Cunningham, who plays Sean, because he gives a realistic portrait of a man who is not nearly as complex as his wife who is torn between her love for her and the influence of church and community. If it was fiction, this movie would be an interesting and interesting movie. Because it is true, it will turn into a terrible tragedy. In real life, people and villages have never fully recovered from the events that took place there. It took almost half a century before the Church recognized its negative role in these events. Although Sheila and Sean have lived in this area, they have never fully recovered from what religious leaders and their fellow citizens have done to them <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> the whole race, or simply just torture and murder, we humans certainly have the ability to use religion as a strong negative force in our society.
