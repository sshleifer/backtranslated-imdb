I really like 101 Dalmatin when it was released in 1996, now 5 years later I experienced 102 Dalmatian in 2001, I thought it was fantastic, but I think 101 is better because I think it's more fun , more humorous, and the film was based on the same story as the cartoon version (one hundred and twenty-one Dalmatians (1961)), and I wonder if there are any plans for 103 Dalmatians. I hope so, maybe yes, maybe not, all Dalmatian fanatics have to know if in the future there will be 103 Dalmatians.
