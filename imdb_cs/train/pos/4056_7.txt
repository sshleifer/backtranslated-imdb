He saw it on SBS TV here in Australia the second week, where he was called "Laputa: Castle in the Sky". I had headlines and I think SBS provided its own, which was as good as usual. She just looked up at Wikipedia "Laputa" and confirms what I thought ... The floating island of this story is taken from Jonathan Swift's classic "Gulliver's travels," which was published at the beginning and end of the 17th century. Anyway, it's a fascinating Japanese fairytale, speaking a voice. It's good for little kids, I think, but it's running for just over two hours, so it can be too long for some, though not for adults like me. The story is about two kids trying to find the legendary floating island that has a castle on it. Children are not the only ones looking for this island. They have pirates, army and spies looking for an island and trying to capture children (Sheeta, the girl, expressed by Anna Paquin and Paz, the boy, expressed by James Van Der Beek) to help them find that the graphics are spectacular ... occasionally photorealistic, especially scenes from stones lit by a flashlight, or beautiful scenes of bright, sunny days with white clouds or mist. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
