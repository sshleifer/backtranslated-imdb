Ronald Colman gives an electrifying performance like Tony John, an actor on Broadway, who can not separate his life backstage from Shakespeare's Othello, the character he plays on the stage .... Two important scenes illustrate Tony's dilemma. The first one is in Max Lasker's office. Efficiency is a matter of talent for a practically minded Lasker. But Donlan, Tony's friend, does not agree: "No, no, when you do it, as Tony did, it's much more to be done by someone else every night ... so completely, the whole system is not affected." The next scene appears in the waitress apartment of Pat Kroll. Tony says her name is Martin. Thank you. And then he says, "Or Paul, Hamlet, Joe and maybe Othello." When Tony begins to try Othello, we learn that even if he tries to keep his real life separate from scenic life, "his life and the battle begins." Realism against imagination. "He can not keep the two separate: Pat is Desdemon and he is Othello , and he mistakenly believes he is unfaithful to them ... Their murder ... Colman's bravado performance, in a difficult and difficult role, won the Academy Award for Best Actor Award in 1947. Oscar nominations for Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin for the Best Original Screenplay. to Milton Krasner's Atomic Cinematography.
