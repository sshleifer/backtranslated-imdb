The events of September 11, 2001 occupied their shadow at this Oscars ceremony with a one-minute silence before mounting in memoriam, and there was little that everyone was singing all the dance comedy extravaganza we could expect to receive, but that was by no means bad . Entertainment was more or less limited to LOTR with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, and that was it. The rest of the performance was taken with clips from the nomination and I must admit that it was really more enjoyable than the exaggerated songs and dance figures we have seen over the years and Whoopi Goldberg was by no means a bad moderator unlike the very esoteric David Letterman a few years ago and one- minute silence for the victims of September 11 was breathtaking and dignified. As for the awards, New Zealand was absolutely robbed. FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING went home with four smaller awards, while Beautiful Sense reluctantly raised most of the major awards, except the best actor to go to the hard-guy New Zealander, but instead went to the All American nice guy. The only Oscar prizes I agreed with, except for those presented by FELLOWSHIP, were the best actress and best actress, and the two good calls.
