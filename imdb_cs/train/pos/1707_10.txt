This movie is not for everyone. You are either clear enough to get it, or you are not. Fans of science fiction films, who are not too serious about the film, will enjoy this film. I recommend this movie for those who appreciate spoofs and parodies. Everyone I recommend to like this movie. If you like Monty Python or Mel Brooks movies, you'll probably enjoy this. Voice features are made in the lingual face and one-time flying fast and furious.
