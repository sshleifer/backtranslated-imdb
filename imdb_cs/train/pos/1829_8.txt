What a fun movie? Ives is. It reminds me of the type of film created during the 1940s. A classic story, rounded characters and a story that is neither dramatic nor clearly complicated. In fact, it's nothing. The story of Robert Lewis Stevenson - here for the screen - reads like Jane Austen for men. We get a story that has romance in the heart, but there's also a lot of fun: a battle (in some cases), jailbreak, mistaken identity, a sword, and the most fun line I have heard for years: "Only in Scotland will the guests be announced on behalf of masked balls. "There is a lot of joy, difficulty, and not a bit of heart, as Saint Ives tries to fight and find his way back to the family and the life he hardly knew. Cast is an absolute star with too little to see Jean Marc Barr totally perfect in the title role. Anna Friel is a refreshing delight, because the ingenious Flora and Miranda Richardson almost run away with the film as her wise and world-famous, they were there and seen-it was all Aunt Susan. Richard Grant provides comedy relief of the highest order. It's not the biggest movie ever seen, but its spell is undeniable, and the whole movie is brilliant with the energy that melts with life.
