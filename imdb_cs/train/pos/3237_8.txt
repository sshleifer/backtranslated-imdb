After my experience with Finland for a little more than a week, I would say that this film very accurately describes the nature of Finnish society. In particular, I know the phenomenon of young couples with a child who have serious problems because I was in Finland when I was personally exactly the same. Relationships and problems of people, the fragility of marital institutions, drinking culture, unemployment and the growing problem with money are very well presented without any subjectivity or exaggeration. a film that does not have to be easy to understand and interact with each other, but the common big picture is nevertheless enriching. Not all of the stories are exciting or profound, but as has been said above, the big picture does not stop delivering a sense of "real life" and captivates the viewer. I feel in a quiet moment: What is happening in the life of all these people on the street? That's what's going on. Movies like this are good for your imaginative power. It would be safe to assume that this film could relate to life in many countries, but above all it reflects Finland as it is and quite damn well. One note about acting: Being a fan of Finnish cinema I am, I have never seen any of these actors on any other film, but I found acting in this position next to the perfect overall. Perhaps it is not a masterpiece, but a very good test of the entire crew. I'll take care of the future issue of the director and cast .. 7,5 / 10
