The last hunt is a forgotten Hollywood classic western. The theme of genocide over the killing of buffalo is present in other films, but never so wild. Robert Taylor has a role as a obsessed buffalo and the Indian killer is his best performance. In the 1950s, your mom left you and your friends away on Saterday's matin√©e, usually featuring western or comedy. But it was bad to let a young man watch psycho-dramas such as seekers and the last hunt. Let the children for several years before you show them to movies with suppressed sexual sadism and intense racial hatred. Why did my mom fail to censor these films? Because they featured "safe" Hollywood stars like Taylor and John Wayne. But the climate scene in The Last Hunt is as scary as Vincent Price's mutation in The Fly. The mythology of white buffalo, part of the texture of this film, was later torn apart by other films including The White Buffalo, where he plays Charles Bronson as Wild Bill Hickock. It laughs here that Bronson played the Indians. Today, a large herd of bison remains is located in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. In winter, hunger brings surplus animals from the park to Montana, where Indian Indians from India are harvested under the US Treaty that precedes the Lincoln presidency. Linclon signed the Congressional Act, which allowed the Continental Railroad and started the defeat of the buffalo.
