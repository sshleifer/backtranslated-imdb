Kristine Watts (Molie Weeks) is split, missing her lover; she is unable to overcome her love for him, which has been lost in the past. She hires foreigners (Douglas Davis) and gives a list of his mistakes to fix things with him. But time is irreversible and sometimes pain treatment is a tragic end. The first point to impress in "The Cure" is stylish cinematography that alternates black and white. A brief and sharp script is able to create a tragic and grim story of love with an unexpected plot at the very end in less than eight minutes. The soundtrack is beautiful, but the volume is a bit loud and is related to the fact that English is not my native language, at some point I needed to repeat the words whispering the narrator. Unknown actress has a spectacular performance and is incredibly beautiful. I hope I can see her again on the screen. Last but not least, the debut of director and writer Ryan Jafri could not have been better. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): Not available
