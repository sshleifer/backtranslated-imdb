SPOILS. As with other posters, I felt the end was a little awkward. I would like the crew to return to the earth after returning to life. I suppose the writers predicted this problem by starting a Voyager on terrestrial sequences at the beginning of the episode. (Of course, the time period has been erased, so it's all wrong.) I liked Admiral Janeway's death for the Voyager crew. As fans, we get our cake and eat it by Janeway both making a final sacrifice and living on. I admit that the scenes of Janeway and her older interview were bizarre and they could easily get to the camp. Fortunately, Mulgrew (a) pulled him out.
