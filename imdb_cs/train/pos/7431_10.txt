I was and was very entertaining in the movie. It was my favorite film in 1976. In the 1970s I was raised, I was so fond of the appearance and behavior of Christ Kristofferson. Of course I'm not a film critic, but for the time I thought it was very good. I really like combo Streisand and Kristofferson. I thought they worked together well. I have seen the film many times and still love the two like Esther and John Norman. I'm a big fan of Kris and I see him together when I can. What a talented singer singer, not to mention actors. I've seen him in many movies, but still think back to star Born.
