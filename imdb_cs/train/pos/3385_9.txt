Soylent Green I found it a great movie. <br /> <br /> If you like Logan's Run, you'll like it. <br /> <br /> Yes the movie is old and there are no special effects and some that acting may somewhat best be described as "cheese" but the story is great. The story of how the world can be and its impact on society is very horrible. <br /> <br /> In the end, the secret was not a secret, but the story unfolded easily and correctly. The closest modern equivalent would be "Dark Angel" in terms of how the US is seen as a third world country.
