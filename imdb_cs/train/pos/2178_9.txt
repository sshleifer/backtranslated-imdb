With plenty of sunshine, fluent light and shadow that filter windows and rooms, watching shots moving to crowds with handheld camera, fast editing and extreme close-ups, photography is a matter of this interesting, artistic, finished film. The movie begins with a bit of a fluff about the beauty contest. The film begins on a warm Sunday in the local pool where we meet the beautiful Lucienne aka Lulu (played by Louise Brooks) - a little cut in front of the gawking men by the pool, soon deciding to enter to represent France in Miss Europe beauty contest, much to the desperation of her very jealous , blind fianc√© (really very unpleasant). By approaching the track, ten contestants will appear in swimsuits while the winner is selected as the contestant who will receive the longest applause (I was thinking that girls can not walk slower to extend their length - and thus suppress - at the parade pier ?!). Lulu soon chases the prince and maharaja, but her crazy beau does not like the attention paid by other men or her adoring public (I think he simply wants her in his house, cooking his food and not out of sight, is it?) Louise Brooks is beautiful and charming, her presence helps reinforce this film, but it is really the way of photography that interests me most. A little distraction is a strange dubbed sound that's a bit off. The print on this version looked very bright and full of lovely contrast. While watching this, I tried to overlook the sound problems and visually watch the film and I thought the movie was great, which is worth seeing.
