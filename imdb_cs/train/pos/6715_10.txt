I liked to watch "Sabrina, The Teenage Witch" on ABC TGIF Friday night. I think it was one of the best performances on TGIF. My friends and I met every Friday just to watch this show and we never missed an episode. My favorite character was Salem. It was adorable and fun. I also liked Sabrina's friend Harvey. It was HOT. I think Melissa Joan Hart also played a good witch. My favorite episodes were "Sabrina Through the View" and "Hilda and Zelda: The Teens Years". These episodes were great. <br /> <br /> Overall, this show is really missing. I hope one day ABC will bring a new episode. I give this show to 10/10 stars.
