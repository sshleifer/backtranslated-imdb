I have no idea what people are complaining about. I saw this movie yesterday and I really liked it. Stone has once again delivered a great figure. She was as good as the first basic instinct. He still has these smart but complex answers. Though Sharon can be 48 years old ... he looks amazing! I do not care if she's fake like Barbie. It looks good and it is. Basic Instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first. Sex, violence and a great end that lets you think and talk about it for hours! Half of the people who have commented on this movie have not even seen. So do not listen to them.
