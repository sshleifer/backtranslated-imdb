It is very easy to qualify this movie: "PURE MASTERPIECE". This opinion is formulated for the following reasons: the performance of the actors, seem to be citizens of that time, 1100 B.C. Perfectly adapt the characters. The second reason is that the poetry expressed by Homer in his poem is well done by production. Among other narrative choirs, they give a special atmosphere that makes us party to art publishing. The third reason: the reconstruction of the decoration is absolutely perfect in the Mediterranean areas where the action of the poem appeared. And especially the emotion is at the meeting. I repeat my award: "PURE MASTERPIECE".
