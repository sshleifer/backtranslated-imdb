This document was interesting, but it was also long (it takes a total of 225 minutes), like Ben-Hur for a long time. But if you do, it is for you. But only if you have a passion for a movie like me. Because Martin Scorsese is my favorite director (alive and maybe even at all), it's quite fascinating, especially if you know the style of Scorsese's works. Because you can understand where he gained his inspiration for many of his films. It's not the best documentary ever, but it's a jump for Scorsese, which is always good to watch. AND
