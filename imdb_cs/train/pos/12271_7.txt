Talk about the blast, "Trampa Infernal" has the best initial credits! Besides musical tones that are perhaps slightly inspired by the legendary theme of "Friday, 13th" (Tsh-Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha), the names of the leading players disbanded in giant syllables will appear on the screen. A promising intro of a totally dark Mexican slasher / backwoods survival thriller and it gets cooler every minute that passes. Two extremely competitive and testosterone overloaded paintball enemies call each other for a perfect conflict in the dirty bar. According to a newspaper article, there is a wild bear in the nearby forest, which has already killed several hunters trying to catch him. The challenge is that the one who kills a bear will be declared the ultimate macho hero with the largest set of spheres. Upon arrival, however, it quickly becomes clear that they are not against a bear, but a confused and totally manic war veteran with plenty of weapons in the sanctuary and numerous fighting tricks that are in his sleeve. After decades of tame and derived American slasher, this Mexican effort of the early nineties seems very refreshing and lively. The formula is simplified, but effective, the leading characters are likely and the confrontation with the sadistic killer is relatively tense. Maniac had to be a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers because he also uses his own gloves with sharp knives and a white face mask. The murders are pleasantly ugly and barbarous, which I really hoped for, because of the amazing start-up sequences mentioned above and the wasting of unnecessary blood. Setting up forests and especially camouflage traps are joyfully spectacular. "Trampa Internal" is a Mexican slasher / survival sleeper hit that is highly recommended to fans of this genre.
