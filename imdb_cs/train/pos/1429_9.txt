I loved the way the COUNTRY is made. Her photo is incredible, editing must be an exciting challenge, and Patrick Stewart's voice is PERFECT. In addition, his music and sound editing make EARTH observation a deep experience that you do not want to miss. You are indeed on the way to a place where you would never end yourself. <br /> <br /> And though I was initially surprised by the laughter of the audience, as we see the animals in their daily struggle for survival, I could never laugh slowly. Nature seems too impressive. But rather than the need to laugh, I left the cinema with a deep question: "How about 200 years of industrial revolution can destroy natural systems that have been thousands and thousands of years?" <br /> <br /> On this question you will understand how I he felt bitter and helpless after I saw the COUNTRY. I felt the immediate need to change the world, to help all these animals in their struggle, to avert the changes we have seen in recent centuries, and to stop global warming at once (all that is not an NGO activist!) ... /> So I immediately visited the web site at the end of the film to find out what I can do to save my fantastic planet (and polar bear) from its depressing fate. . (www.loveearth.com) I was a little disappointed when I did not find any direct answers to my questions. Still, it was very interesting to learn more about the movie and about the fight that the crew has gone through. I hope that what will become my energy use will do so. I do not know how to shorten the distance that polar bears have to swim to reach land before drowning or attacking animals that can not be defeated in their exhausted state ... Inspiring film is it, but I let the cinema very happy.
