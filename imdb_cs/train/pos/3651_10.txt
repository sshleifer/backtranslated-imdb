Pandora Clocks are among the best thrillers you've ever read and it's one of the best thrillers you've ever seen. The very faithful adaptation of John J. Nance's novel, which had a terribly realistic script in the novel, is even more here. <br /> <br /> Despite being made for television, it's the first fun. The cast is great and slides into the characters of the novel so well that you think they read a novel. Richard Dean Anderson moves out of Macgyver's shadow and gives his best career. Jane Leeves plays a great role as an ambassador's assistant in a role that proves he can be a great dramatic actor. Daphne Zuniga is great as Dr. Sanders, and despite the character of being a man in the book, he works incredibly well. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and the rest of the supported cast are top-notch and fit to their novel counterparts throughout the letter. There are changes in the story of course (including a slight change in the conclusion), but these changes are for better compared to the novel. This plot is realistic and very credible as its performance has become the best airplane from the original film from the airport. Production values ​​are high, and although special effects may look as good as 10 years ago, they work well. The sets are great, especially at the CIA headquarters and in the Oval Office, which show that the filmmakers have spent a lot of time to get the job done. It does not matter whether you see it first and read, then read the novel or vice versa. You just do not have to regret the four hour loss of this movie and how long it takes to read the novel. It will leave you breathless.
