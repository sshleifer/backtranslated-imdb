An amazingly strange film with plenty of folds for pretzel bags. Parker Posey plays Fay Grim as a sexy, vulnerable, loving mother who may or may not be what she looks like. The story is very distinctive and the dialogue is skillfully underestimated. Suggestions of humor and intrigue, none of which exceed the characterization, Posey pulls so well. The supporting cast is stellar. Disadvantage? This movie needs your full attention, almost to stopping the movie and storing notes. Posey has more sexual attraction in her eyebrow lifting than most actresses have throughout her body. She is worth it, even if you do not understand the disruption.
