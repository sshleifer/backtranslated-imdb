This series got me into Deighton's font and genre when I was younger and I love this story story. I disagree with the above comment. From what I've read in the past, it's not Holm's performance that led Deighton to refuse to release the serial, but the butcher, which all three books got on the screen. A big example is the transcription of the border crossing, which ended Samson's career in the field. The scene is not in the book, the figure who died in the minefield, was never in any book, and the transition to Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany, not the Polish border. The whole story is a fabric. Changes in the file likewise damage the integrity of the story. My glance at Holm's performance was that he portrayed Samson's disoriented personally during his wife's murder, and I think he behaved well when he showed an aging field agent who was desperately trying to bridge the class gap. Samson both pays for his father's idealism and suffers because of his influence on his life. As Clevemore remembers, he was educated that would probably lead the department. I think the actual loss of performance is a consequence of physical appearance more than anything else. Holm is tiny compared to Samson's book - a physically impressive man capable of using his size to make a presence.
