Great 90 years! Parker Posey is wonderful in this nightlife story in Manhattan, which requires so much money. Posey gives amazing performance as a librarian and night crawler. That's a good, light movie on Saturday night before you go out. Rock music, clothes are out of this world, the screenplay is fun and the actors do a great job. Purchase Value: You can do it in this world if you try to do it, just find your niche. I believe Parker Posey is a PERFECT actress for this kind of character: young, wonderful and broken. (You have to watch the movie "Clockwatchers"). If you look at Party Girl, you have to have a good time. Enjoy!
