It's a color film slasher. That's about it. <br /> <br /> It has a mysterious element that SCREAM has become so popular in slasher films, but I've never been interested in such things. Finding out who the bad guy is is not interesting because the traces are just as misleading. Death scenes were inventive and gorey, bringing memories of 80th horror movies as 13th Friday. <br /> <br /> Another nice thing about this movie is that it's hard to pinpoint the surviving girl, unlike SCREAM and IKWYDLS where it was obvious. <br /> <br /> People who do not like movies slasher do not like this movie. It's so simple. I really enjoyed it and I'm going to watch it again while I'm waiting for more. <br /> <br />
