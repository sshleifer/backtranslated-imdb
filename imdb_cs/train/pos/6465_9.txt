Based on Soviet features preserving the thing inside and the island character of a small Swedish village, this film develops all of its characters well. he drove greatly, acted and sang, brought tears to many eyes and smiled at all. Let's hope he finds distribution in the United States. <br /> <br /> If you can, look at it!
