I would just like to say that it may be interesting because I'm a producer on the film. However, I will retain some sense of dignity. The film star, Oscar Ovies, gives starring performance as Jeff Grinderlin, or a hypochondriac who spends more time worry than livelihood. It impresses with its character, which really allows the viewer to join him by often expressing his mind and feeling of a cruel comedy. His mother, played by Christine Haber, is a permanent support beam that will break apart without him. His friends also lend their hand in Jeff's life, often making choices for him rather than allowing him to use free will ... which often often neglects. <br /> <br /> Writing is excellent and the conversation revolves around scenes from Kevin Smith's film with half as many boo-hoo festivals as Ben Affleck. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera is a bit at some points is bad and the sound could also take advantage of the support, but the performances radiate tiny details. It is also supported by a beautiful soundtrack with local talents and an exceptional composer. <br /> <br /> Overall it was a delicacy. Rare jewel, among many jewels.
