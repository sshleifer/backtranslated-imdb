A comedy about a girl who has to learn to be responsible for her own deeds. As she had the power of magic, she often used to try to help her loved ones or herself, often leading to literal play, which are often disastrous and always humorous. The program began with Sabrina's adventure in high school in the fictional city of Westbridge, which is located near Boston, Massachusetts (unlike Greendale in a comic book). In later seasons, Sabrina graduated from high school and enrolled in college, then went on to try to live alone and keep working in local newspapers. After completing her comic roots, Sabrin's wedding concert was over, although she eventually left the wedding and fled Harvey. Many episodes included Sabrina as encountered by natural or supernatural means popular real-life music artists of the time including Coolio, Violent Femmes, Backstreet Boys, Phantom Planet, Davy Jones of Monkees, Britney Spears, Avril Lavigne, Daniel Bedingfield, Hanson, Eden's Crush , Savage Garden, N Sync, and Ashanti. The Nature Story, the band Melissa Joan Hart's then-friend (now husband) Mark Wilkerson, appeared in an episode in 2002.
