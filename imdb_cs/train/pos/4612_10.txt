Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar and Yvonne De Carlo are playing in this fun, funny movie. Late Fred Gwynne is really gorgeous as Herman Munster, who lives with her grandfather, Munley (Al Lewis), wife of Lily (Yvonne De Carlo) and his son and daughter. Sid Caesar is cheerful as the owner of a wax museum, which has a whole section devoted to the Munster family. When the wax figures of Herman and the heirs begin to terrorize the city, everyone blames both. The two must now erase their names before it is too late. You will laugh laughing just like me.
