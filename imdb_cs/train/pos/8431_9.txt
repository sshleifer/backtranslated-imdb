] Have you seen this movie? Have not they even heard about this movie? I would not be surprised. One of the few truly "independent" films made over the last ten years, no studio has had faith in the picture and has never been raised for larger distribution. Independent Cinema Films gave BOESMAN and LENOVI a very limited run, with virtually no promotion, and most major film critics did not bother about it. I think a one-act film, one apartheid game and its influence on two individuals never had a chance at today's market - and that is the loss of the intelligent film lover. both Angela Bassett and Danny Glover deserved a nomination for Ocsar (as well as a cameraman), but the film got such a small fanfare that I can not even blame this academy. This is a movie that is demanding, provocative and heartbreaking, and actually requires the audience to meet its own conditions. Taking this into consideration, it is definitely not a film for homeless entertainment. Director John Berry does not wisely try to dress Athle Fugard. Sure, we get some broken memories and some breathtaking scenic shots, but the movie version of BOESMAN and LENA remains a story of two people living in inhumane conditions. <br /> <br /> Stripped of their basic human rights, Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett) have no one to attack, but each other. The third character joins them for some time (Willie Jonah, awesome in an extremely silent role), but the film focus never gets rid of the subtitles and what happened. Bassett and Glover give courageous performance as a broken couple, a performance that simply can not be improved. Firmly and brutally stimulating, intellectually and emotionally, BOESMAN and LENA deserve to re-discover the home video. Hands Down, Best Film of the Year 2000.
