I'm so glad I saw this video in the store. I was looking for some happy movies and it turned out to be a real jewel. I loved the fact that the film, which is a nice story, was not about a beautiful twenty years; rather it is a story of some beautiful sixty years that used to be twenty people. It's a good, well-written and well-done story with a fabulous World War II music band. It's also a beautiful surprise for Scottish castle lovers. I let myself smile and was ready to watch again, which I did several times before I allowed it. I recommend it.
