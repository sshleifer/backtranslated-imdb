This film does not need the Catholic Church in the best light but tells a story based on real events. Unfortunately, everything in life, including religion, is not all pretty and pink. Sometimes people and groups do things that seem the right thing at the time, but in retrospect they do not look as good as they once were. "Love divided" tells the story of the family, yes it includes religion, but it really is a story about the family and the ability of the family to stay together, no matter what suits them. This film is also based on real events that do not say that this story, scene by scene, is true, but if you were looking at newspaper articles from this time period, you could see that even churches were not interested in this way, which was useful for the family. Both churches are captured here, the Catholic Church being the first to enforce such a family order and not responding to the violence that came with it, and the Protestant Church to tell her mother that she should only listen to her husband and priest and not combat. In this case, both have left this family. I think the film has a good job in showing that this fight is both in the church and in the family. In any case, the form or form does not fit the Catholic Church, on the contrary, it shows how one incident can change the direction of the ideas of this religion and how one person can have much more effect than himself.
