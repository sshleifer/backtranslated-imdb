Los Debutantes is the story of two orphaned brothers who moved to Santiago from the South after their mother died. Confidential and Streetwise Silvio, an elder brother, gets a job that works for the owner of the crazy strip club after the naive took the viktor for his 17th birthday. Because Silvio blooms under the direction of his boss, both brothers get engaged in the sexy and manipulative mistress of the owner, Gracia. As the film unfolds, the characters are redefined as we begin to see the subtle and clear ways each manipulates another. The film is well made, with good cinematography and fast pace. It's also pretty sexy, with lots of nudity and quite explicit sexual scenes. It now uses the popular technique of stacking different scenes from different perspectives, from the chronological sequence. Many people hate such movies because they do not understand what's going on - Memento, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and many other good movies using this device. The conspiracy itself is nothing new, there are elements of Heat, Pulp Fiction and many other good movie noir. As the different layers are revealed, our understanding of the characters and their motivation develops. While the conspiracy may be somewhat clich√©, it's also smart and entertaining. I would call it a funny movie that would interest me, but nothing unforgettable. I have not seen many films from Chile, and it's always interesting to see movie legs from other countries. Other than renting, if available, but do not go to sleep if it is not.
