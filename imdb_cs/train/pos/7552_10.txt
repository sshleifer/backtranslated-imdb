CAT SOUP is a short anime based on the legendary Necojero manga. She won the Best Short Film at the 6th Fantasia Film Festival and also received the "Excellence Award" at the Japanese Media Arts Festival. When his little kitten Nyaak's soul alienated Death, she and her brother Nyatta embarked on a bizarre journey to get her back. In the surreal dreamscape of the other side they meet many fantastic characters and remarkable, often disturbing adventures. CAT SOUP is an anime like nothing you've ever seen. It's Hello Kitty on acid! It is very original, amazingly beautiful and has a great sense of curiosity and lyricism. CAT SOUP is very surrealistic (there is no dialogue) and sometimes cruel and cruel. So it's more anime for adults than for kids (it does not have to understand!). A great way for those who have the opportunity to see this absolute masterpiece. You must see!
