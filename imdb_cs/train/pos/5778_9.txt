Despite its budget constraints, it's a great movie, proof that efforts and imagination can overcome the lack of cash. An opening in which cave pictures seem to show how at least some dinosaurs survived the ages of human beings is a handsome red herring. Then the meteor arrives in the lake and causes the heat to cause the hatching of the frozen egg of the dinosaurs (perhaps cave painting suggests that this is not the first time such a thing happened). When a prehistoric animal appears, it is a well animated Plesiosaur, which soon causes disappearance in the local area. Okay, it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still a real fun for monster lovers.
