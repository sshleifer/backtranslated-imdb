This is an example of a fairy tale! The villains are completely evil and the heroes are refreshing. Danes, Deniro and Pfieffer are great as well as a new actor who plays the role of Tristan. Excellent performances, splendid spells, fun and dramatic and perfect fairy-tales make this movie absolutely wonderful! I'm not sure that all content is suitable for younger children, but for the older audience, there are plenty of merry fines! Thoughts do not do this movie righteousness! My fianc√© and I were quite skeptical, but we were so excited that we got a chance on this movie, I just hope I assure someone on the fence about this movie to try it!
