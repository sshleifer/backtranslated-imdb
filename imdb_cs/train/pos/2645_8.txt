No films have captured the attention that this one has. You see, I wanted to watch this film for more than twenty-five years. The only time I've seen was like a teenager, which may be the year he was released in 1977. What I remember from the film is that he touched those deep emotions so deeply that there was still a total desire to watch again. The intrigue of this film provides the human element father / son with searching and searching surely touches every human soul who watches it. Why this movie was not taken out of the repository and displayed as often as many other films with less depth, I do not know. Postscript: The received copy of the movie and after watching it was pleased to see that my memory is valid. Ratings reflect the film's content. Would you like to watch this movie on DVD because it saw that the 1977 production on the used VHS tapes took on the overall quality.
