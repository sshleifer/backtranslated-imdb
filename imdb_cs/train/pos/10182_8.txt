good film, good music, good background and acceptable land. but the main point again like his films, the man is the best idiot actor and can convert dust to gold. nana patekar. this may be his second best performance after parinda (others may disagree). even if other films are not far behind. one man who will never disappoint you. <br /> <br /> A good movie even though I think shahrukh was the luxury that this movie could do without. you can see in your movies, others are very trying to reach their heights and get out of their skins. but this guy is really something that's fine. The movie is cool, the music and direction are great, but a little thin, but the screen is playing and the dialogue is good again. must look.
