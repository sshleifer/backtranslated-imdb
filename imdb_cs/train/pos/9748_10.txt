I saw this movie when it came out when I was 17 years old and in the classic rock scene (I'm still) ... I never liked the opera because I hate the soprano voices, but it all changed. He was adorable in the movie and had such a wonderful voice. <br /> <br /> I heard about CNN that he died pancreatic cancer tonight at home, he will be missing and he will surely have left his mark on this world. I hope to buy it if I find it, watch it and enjoy it. * smile * Maybe I should go to Amazon.com and check out before it's sold out.
