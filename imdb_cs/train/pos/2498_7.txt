I picked it up in the box "Danger After Dark" and watched it just because of my interest in the performance of Hyde and Gackt. I expected it to be a horror film that was a huge gore-fest and a very bad dialogue. What exactly is what it would be if it was in America. Instead, I was interested in the good character development and the way Sho (Gackt) develops in the film as a human. The acting skills of the two stars were surprisingly good because they were not professional actors and the director did a great job with all of them, set him in the future minus flying cars and holographic billboards. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the performance of Taro Yamamoto was very surprising. The only other movie I've ever seen is Battle Royale, where Shogo Kawada plays, and in this movie seems to be the opposite of Shogo. Toshi is bright, lush and hyper, which serves as a kind of comic relief with his anger. Shogo was a big hard man on an island he killed without thinking about it. So, beware of his performance, if you're familiar with Battle Royale, you'll be very surprised. <br /> <br /> But do not leave the summary on the back of the box because it's not really a vampire movie. It's just a movie with a vampire. The fact that the character of Hyde is a vampire is almost a basic factor of what is going on in the foreground, and you will love the last scene. At some points there is a really moving picture, shooting is really great. It's definitely something you'll pick up at the next Blockbuster meeting.
