I recorded it at the premiere at the Sundance Film Festival and was in Awe above the absolute strength of this film. It is about examining the psychological impact on our brave soldiers who are joining the army, hoping to protect and serve our country with homage and that our government will take care of it. The film details the psychological changes that take place in the training camp when the soldiers turn into "killers for their country" and into the war and the subsequent effects come back home. It also portrays the effect that killing has on human psyche. He thanks the soldiers and never criticizes soldiers as opposed to other films, but criticizes a system that is not prepared and does not provide all the physical and psychological needs of the veterans returned. <br /> <br /> This movie is strong, moving, emotional and thoughtful. It is a challenge for armaments to support our units not only by sticking and sticking, but by actually listening to and helping to promote a change in the way their health and well-being will take care of the end of the killings. <br /> <br /> Best Film Festival, **** / ****
