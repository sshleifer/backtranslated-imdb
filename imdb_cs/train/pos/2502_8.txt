This movie surprised me! I never heard of Hyde of Gackt, I did not expect much! The reason I wanted to watch this movie was that someone mentioned that the movie contains some serious action scenes in the style of John Woo! I am usually very cautious when I say it! There's only one John Woo, and there is no director to date, who is approaching his brilliance when it comes to action! The fact that a "Moon Child" would have a vampire convinced me even more! How can you go wrong with the guns that are crazy! It sounds promising and interesting! The first thing I noticed about this movie was that the pace was slow! It takes time to set the mood! This movie contains some nice action scenes in Hong Kong style! But "Moon Child" is not an action movie! It's a drama about friendship and fidelity! It focuses on characters and their relationship to each other! Pop singers Hyde and Gackt do a good job in acting and are very friendly! The only problem I had was with the plot! Several times the movie seems to skip a couple of years without explaining what happened and why they had to skip! Example: When one gang member dies (very dramatic moment), Alexander Wang sees Kei (Hyde) drinking the blood of one of the attackers! Without warning and explanation, the film skips 9 years and most of the friends are no longer together! Also without the proper reason why the son (Alexander Wang) and Sho (Gackt) must kill each other! I know it's been done to add some serious drama! Because of the actors it is very effective, but sometimes it feels forced! Apart from the shortcomings in the film, this film has an atmosphere and slickness that makes it harder to make a movie! It's hard to explain why this movie is great! But it's just! The overall experience you get is heartfelt and sincere!
