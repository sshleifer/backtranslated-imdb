It was another great film by Tom Berenger. But some people are right that it was like the second character of SGT BARNES, but it was still crazy. Tom Berenger played a great sniper in the jungles of Panama! Billy Zane was first and foremost just like Cpl Upham from Saving Private Ryan, but eventually he got a bit more aggressive! The sniper was awsome and action fans should watch it .. I remind you that it will not have as many action as reg action flick .. I have this on DVD too and it's great!
