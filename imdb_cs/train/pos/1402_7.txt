Contains spoilers <br /> <br /> "Hollow Man" is probably the weakest film ever made by Paul Verhoeven, director of great films such as Total Recall, Starship Troopers and Robocop. <br /> <br /> This is probably not his fault. For some reason, Verhoeven was stuck with a totally bad script and spent the best. <br /> <br /> The first part of this movie is rather good, with many cynical jokes, great special effects, and even Skunk Anansie on the soundtrack. The film, unfortunately, collapses in the second part if it degenerates into a standard slasher film or perhaps a very bad "foreign" clone. The end is especially ridiculous <SPOILER> because Kevin Bacon is coming back to life after a series of incidents that should (in a logical sense) kill. </ SPOILER>. And the whole thing is quite shallow, indeed: the subject of invisibility is never fully explored. But in all, Verhoeven can stay above this average above the average. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 of **** stars
