With the rapid interruption of insane mood scenes and assembly / superposition of images and vague, intertwined narratives, this is a very tough film to follow. Apparently a man (Masue Inoue) takes a job as a porter or a guardian in the asylum facility to be close to his imprisoned wife and perhaps save her. But she's obviously crazy, she crawls on the floor with a free expression of much time and fear, misery and confusion written on her face for the rest of the time. The filmmaker sometimes turns to her gaze and we see her vague paintings on the shore of a pond that drowns a child or clings to a drowned child. Something is tortured. When the view is on her or other crazy people, the filmmaker uses distorted lenses and such things, showing us what the madmen see and then how they react. And the place is born with crazy people, laughs, hiding and in one case frenetic dancing night and day. At one point the man tries to take his wife out, but the night before the door is scaring her and she's back in her cell. Gradually, a man breaks into a nightmare where he was interrupted in another attempt to take her away, and he kills a doctor and many attendants, and all the time the mad people laughed and clapped. When they wake up, they get better and the mops on the floor. Some fascinating shots of Japanese lives, streets, buildings in the twenties of the last century.
