It was a modesty we did not know! It was outlined and summarized in a comic book for syndicates to sell newspapers! Lee and Janet Batchler were the true fans of Modesta Blaise who received The Dream Job - tell the story of Modesta, which fans have never seen before. In their audio commentary, they admitted that they had changed their origins to make the story smoother. "Purists" should also note that we really do not know if everything she said to Miklos was true because she "stopped in time". I did not borrow or borrow a DVD, like the other "reviewers", I bought it! And I do not want to return the money! I looked at it three times and I did not sleep over it! Great dialogue and well-drawn characters I cared for (even the bad Miklos) as well as in novels and comic stripes! I also can not wait for another movie of Modesta (and Willie), especially if this "prequel" is a sign of what's coming!
