This is a very funny movie! I do not know if it translates well into other languages ​​or not. But I think men around the world can identify with Frank and his thoughts in some way! These ideas are incredibly entertaining, and women also enjoy this film. I'm sure all the members of the show are performing well and this movie could be a huge hit all over the world if it was made in England or the USA. But for those of you who are lucky enough to understand Swedish, you are in favor! <br /> <br /> We are highly recommended.
