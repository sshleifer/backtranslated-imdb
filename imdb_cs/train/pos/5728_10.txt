I went to this movie and expected it to be a terrifying scary movie. What I got was fear of scaring. It's a horror movie in his heart. It's not as blunt as other horror films, where the haunted house has only ghosts and ghosts. This film does not even show you the majority of deaths that show fear of characters. I think one of the best things about the concept where there is not just the house that chased everyone into the house. They happen horribly no matter where they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms ... etc. After reading some external reviews, I'm really surprised that critics did not like this movie. I'm going to see this again this week and am excited about it. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie ten stars because it does what a horror movie would do. I was terrified of me.
