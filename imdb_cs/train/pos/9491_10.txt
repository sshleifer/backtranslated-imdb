Henri Verneuil may not be as well known as Parallax View, Condor or JFK for 3 days, but it's definitely not worse and sometimes even better than the classics of the genre. The event takes place in a fictitious Western state where a fictitious president was killed. After several years of investigation, the special government commission decided that the president had been killed by a lone shooter. One man - Volney Prosecutor, played by Yves Montand - thinks that something more needs to be investigated, so the movie begins. This film does not relate to some accurate theories, but includes the whole structure of the relationship between government and society in today's world. Such a film could only be produced in the 1970s, but it would never lose its reality. It is also a bit horrible how precise the sentences are. 10 out of 10.
