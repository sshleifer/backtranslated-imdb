As the one-off summary shows, the two films left a remark on me when I left the theater. One of them was "Mix Echoes" with Kevin Bacon and the other was "Vanilla Sky". One of those movies that sits deep in the theater and stop thinking about everything around you stop and think about the end of the movie and leave the movie fast where you want ... Coming out of the cinema was a bit weird like the feeling that you get when you are sick and you can not think of anything. One of those movies that you make a man with, and you feel that you are moving around nothing but in the movie. One thing is certain. The actors are amazing, the soundtrack is great and everything in the movie is 9+. I'm sure one of the best movies I've ever seen, and the one that is the best and most shocking my life and my goal in this world.
