It was for the crime that "No other teenage film" did for school. I laughed all the way when two innocent gangs fought each other and each other. An irresistible comedy that used distinct jokes and gags that kept me moving. I suppose the greatest gaming player in the whole movie was that it never seemed like they would leave the characters trapped in the 1930s in the future.
