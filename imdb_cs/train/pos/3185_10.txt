cute story ........ voted ten against all the averages for my age and sex ... not all that much comedy (compared to the fact that I almost wet the movie) even though it's fun enough. is not a fan of musicals at all a bit too much for me, but they give you time to grab a drink or soda without losing something important. perhaps in the 1950s, when Harry met sally? Achab is not really, but if it's in the top ten like mine, you'll enjoy this movie. it really just leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling reminding you of what romance could and should be like what to shoot for him. my summary describes it best in very few words ..... quite charming
