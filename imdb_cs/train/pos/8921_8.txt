I look at this page and it seems to me that I do not agree that I have to listen to someone who leans and dresses in real classics. Of course, I agree that everyone can have their opinion, but here is mine: <br /> <br /> This film should not miss a classic horror watchman and many casual audiences around the world should be seen. Certainly it has lost some of its taste and size with age, especially in today's world of CGI effects, but that's not why you would like it. <br /> <br /> You should love it, because it is actually a scary movie, even for today's standards. It's the total difficulty that will slip you out just like the original audience, so do not touch the classics unless you've made it a chance. Watch this, but not with a critical attitude. Watch how it was fun, as originally intended.
