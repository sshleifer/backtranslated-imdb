I just caught an episode about Brad, a cocaine who went into a drug-addicted life on the streets after his career in cycling went as fast as it had begun. I must say that the story of his cycling career was more heart than his drug addiction. Here is the young man who wins bicycle races to the left and right and is invited to train with the Olympic training team for two weeks. And immediately after his arrival, he is offended by Lance Armstrong, one of the greatest athletes he ever lived, and is generally cruel and hostile to everyone in general. Of course, he is soon asked to leave. Most of the show is about his struggle with addiction and how he came back to life, but what I wanted to know was what was going on in the first place for his act to become such an ass? <br /> <br /> In any case, I was confused about how the set was compiled because it shows Brad at the height of her dependence. We see footage from him manipulating the gentleman and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine. I did not even know it would be legal, but why would the camera crew follow and film it? Are they doing this in the hope that this guy will turn his life and give them some material for a good TV episode? In any case, it's an instructive show because it shows the effects of various addictions and complete control that they can take over people's lives. Sometimes it's hard to watch because you really see how poor families and friends suffer from a dependence on indifference, even though I have to admit that at the end it seems a bit too clean. Sometimes horrible things appear in the episodes and everything seems to be lost, but still, and maybe I should warn the ally, everything is finally a bit too happy and still feel and I feel it is a very unusual occurrence in real life. But is it still a show of people who are trying to help other people, and you never have to complain too much about something like that?
