While this movie is not a classic one, it's very funny how I remember it. I saw it about 15 years ago at HBO and loved the movie. It was written by the same person who wrote and directed "Arthur," and though not as fun as the movie, it shows the potential that Steve Gordon has achieved with Arthur.
