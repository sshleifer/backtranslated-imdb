It seems more than strange that such extreme pressure as "Dukes of Hazzard" and "The Hills Have Eyes" (new version) can find DVD distributors, while older - and much better works such as this movie - are nowhere to be found . With all the ongoing debates on morality (or its inadequacy) about struggle and interest in espionage (considered to be a few productions by Jack Ryan, Bourne, XXX and "Mission: Impossible," it looks like an obvious choice because it is a 1968 film. style thinking aside, it's still a production that actually has something of value to say and has plenty of drawings to make the audience entertain. If nothing else, one will think of getting a soundtrack on some CDs, whether it's a compilation with other Morricone music or independent music I do not know if people in the industry are bothered to read what we have fans about our products but if you read this and other comments please take us seriously We pay for your rich homes with our demanding dollars spent on tickets, DVDs and CDs - give us what we want! if you read it and you have this movie you can not see lobbying for its release, so you can see what of those who We've seen it, it's talking. You will not be disappointed.
