This is the script Ed Wood has been working for over 10 years when he tried to get it. Aris Iliopulos eventually got the chuckle to make a screenplay that Wood saved from a burning home at the expense of other, transient valuables. It is a movie without dialogue, which some can foolishly describe as silent. In fact, it's a pretty noisy film without it being unclear. In the hands of these filmmakers, music and sound effects provide a rich sound experience that works better than almost all of the Hollywood scenario cages, especially in the silly shipping movie Billy Zane, which was last seen in "Watch Out!", "No! "- J. Cameron .... ick ...) I will take Zane's amazingly communicative monosyllabic grunts in this film through an empty dialogue every day. Billy Zane is the leading team of players who, of course, really wanted to be in this movie. Ricci is brilliant as always, and the gods shine when you can place Sandra Bernhard, Rick (Schroeder), Earth Kitt and Andrew McCarthy on the same poster. The design is perfect, the pyramid set out gorgeous and Ron Perlman's wild power is just great. Overall, it is a chaotic, visceral masterpiece, fondly created by fans of Ed Wood Jr., auteur and cinenephile. It must be seen for anyone who really loves movies so that the first speed of Iliopulos and his cast, of course, do. The movie that you wanted to do it yourself.
