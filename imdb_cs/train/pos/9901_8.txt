This movie looked like a classic in the hot 80s slasher genre, which is my favorite genre of all, so when I saw it, it was free on demand, I had to watch it! Cast Caroline Munro from Dr. Phibes (it was his wife who died!), Dracula AD 1972, The Golden Way Sinbad, Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, Spy who loved me, Maniac and Faceless. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < promises him sex in the shower and gives him public humiliation and his face on the toilet (all when naked!). Training stops, but both sides swear revenge. But cold children end up burning a lousy bloke. <br /> <br /> Cut into the future and meet at high school or think (bhahahha?). The only ones with the invitations were the gang that fired him and his April Fool's Day (or indeed, the day before April's fools, but the fun starts at midnight), but he can not see the coincidence and hang out before the school until dark. Then they finally get to school and start revolting. Inside they will find food / drink and a small shrine for each of them, each of their cabinets and things, along with the Marty (nerdy) cabinet and yearbook. They also find an old black servant who spends his time saying, "Oooh yesser! Yesser! I do not want any trouble, sir!" and then immediately killed. A fairly insignificant figure, but still my favorite movie. The film captures a page from an alien book, in a deliciously cruel way you have to see! That's when everyone realizes they will die there, and they start to scare, except Shirley, who decides it would be best to buy in the old school showers at that moment. Of course it spills blood and acid and her face is melting (very cool, thinks you) The rest of the night goes as usual, sex, drugs, and Marty kills everyone when she wears a mask of a jester. What is their plan? "All we have to do is stay awake and wait until noon. Marty will not kill us in the middle of the day!" Seriously, that's what he said. Apparently you can only kill yourself at night. But will they survive the whole night? Who will live and who will die? And why are all the bodies disappearing? Buy, buy or steal this great movie and find out! The movie is actually very good, filled with clich√© (the car is not in the beginning, DAMMIT!) And just slasher fun. Not to mention that everyone has names like Carol and Nana and Frank, Joe and Susan. I recommend it to all! And not to mention Spin Off! The 1989 Cutting Class is a spin-off of this slasher gem, and the film begins with the career of Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell. Favorite scene: 2 people have sex, the guy wants to quit, but the girl is not. "Talk to me dirty, Frank!" she shouts "Uh ... breast!" "DIRTIER!" "Uh ... goats, F * ck, breasts, Boobs, F * ck." She seems to be working for her, and at her peak, the killer is electrocuiting them both!
