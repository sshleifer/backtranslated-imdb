What about all European (especially England) commentaries? All I have to say is that when I first saw this movie when I was 13, I thought it was great. Of course it's stupid. That's it. You have to see the movie Dr. Strangelove and Men in Black to get the whole joke behind this movie, but come with the people you expected? I can think of many movies that are far worse than this, and they were expensive Hollywood movies with real actors in them. For what it is worth, men in white is a very silly-funny mocking of the film. And with all the stupid and fun things England has done over the last half century, I'm shocked by all the negative remarks. We're stupid Americans like our stupid humor. P.S., see "Team America: World Police" for some real laughter that Europeans deserve.
