My husband and I enjoy DoodleBops just as our 8-month-old child does. We bought him DVDs and CDs to watch and listen to them. They are fun, energetic and very entertaining. Encourage children to be active, share and care. They always have a positive message along with fun entertainment. Each time our son hears a dark song, he quickly turns his head toward the television and begins to float up and down with excitement. Dee Dee is a wonderful singer, she has a great voice. Moe is a great dancer. I recommend DoodleBops to everyone with children. Our favorite song is The Bird Song. You just can not help, just smile and want to dance when you hear it.
