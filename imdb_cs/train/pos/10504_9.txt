Or at least one of the best. I think it's a very fun and very cool game for the N64. Bowser is on his usual shenanigans (yeah, it's a dumb word, but the only one I can think of) and Mario has to stop him again. This game is a very fun game and contains lots of nostalgia for me. The only bad thing is graphics that are terrible for today's standards but everything else is pretty good (especially small mini-games that you can unlock) It's the second best N64 game (Conker's Bad Fur Day is the best) that I recommend to any Mario fan or any fan of games on the platform. Running on average every day Super Mario Sunshine. <br /> <br /> 9/10 or: A
