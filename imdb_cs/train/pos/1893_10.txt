Although it is politically wrong to entertain drunken, there is such a charm as Dudley Moore's portrayal of love, Arthur Bach, who can not feel that unique and wonderful position. How can you not enjoy this infectious laugh and giggle and utter stupidity. Although I'm not really a fan of Liza Minnelli, it was really great because Linda Marolla and I could not imagine anyone else in this role. Sir John Gielgud was the heart of the film and earned his Oscar. The rest of the cast is also excellent and that great melody "Arthur is the theme", wow. It was really one of the best comedies of the eighties. Great movies will improve with every view, and that's the case of "Arthur".
