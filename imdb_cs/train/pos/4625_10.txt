Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most surprising and wonderful movie I've seen all year round. It's a prison program, somewhere in California, if I remembered where prisoners tried repeatedly and played another Shakespeare play every 14 years. The film continues its production "The Tempest" from the opening of the show and in this process we learn some pretty wonderful things about these men who are all in the most serious crimes. The truth is indeed a stranger than a fiction - if anyone tried to adapt this story to a fiction movie, the audience would never buy it, but they knew it was a real scary piece - literally; When I learned about the crime of a crime of crime, I breathed out loud. It's like a tiny episode of Oz and even more fun because the characters and their bizarre stories are real.
