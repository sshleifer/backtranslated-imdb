When I did not see this movie in about 20 years, it still seems to me that it's hard - a strong impact and starring acting. Of course, one Mr. Mickey Rooney is really INCREDIBLE in his role as "Killer". (The link to another review here - nobody other than Orson Welles evoked Mickey Rooney's name as the greatest film actor as well.) I also recall jazz-brass scores and bare black and white photography. I love Mick's last line before he goes out for his dose of lead poisoning. (I think the Stranglers have lifted her beyond the boundary of one of their songs - Get the Grip on Yourself.) It's a great movie and an unfairly buried movie. Let's go! Side note - The recent magazine Film Review made a big contribution to Donsela's "Babyface Nelson," which was "Last Mile" a few years ago and also starred Mickey Rooney. Another horror of Mick's intense and sympathetic performance. Perhaps it is the beginning of the deep courage of appreciating a truly excellent cinematographic performance.
