What would you say about getting married and having a bachelor party with some of his closest friends in the Hawaiian bar? All the smooth cruise until he takes out his "hat". What would you say about talking to one of the suggestive dancers and then sleeping with her? What would you say if this exact girl was the cousin of his finances? New low, right? Well, Paul Coleman, who played comically Jason Lee, leads this experience of turbulent blur and new low. I have to say he's one of his good leaders. However, I believe his role in Vanilla Sky is better. His finances named Karen playing up-and-down actress Selma Blair while Karen's character, Becky, plays beautiful and talented Julia Stiles. When we returned to where we ended, Paul now has to deal with one emerging problem in the other. He gets a disease, has to deal with some people, and has to play his games stealthy deceit, or any member of each family can get P. O'ed, including one of his relatives who does not have "" for 14 days. * Smile * It all leads to a long-awaited wedding with one fun scene before recapping the whole hell Paul and his brother had to go through. Overall, A Guy Thing is very funny and well. Sometimes it may seem that the story does not come anywhere, and here and there the scene gets tired, but it's a mixed movie. And if you're a Canadian fan and a fan of the CTV Brett Butte, Corner Gas, you know the small role played by Fred Ewanuick, the same man who plays in the hideous Hank series. This movie is fine. It's another feather in Lee's hat (hitherto completely empty hat). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
