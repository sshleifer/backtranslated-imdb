I was so glad I came across this short film. I'm always so disappointed that short films are hard to meet, so when I saw it and saw it was nominated for an action short film at academic prizes, I was so pleased I actually had a movie that I was rooted for. The plot is quite simple, the director, the writer and the star Nacho Vigalondo have tried to come up with the reason why people suddenly go to the song and dance number as they do in movie musicals. The result is extremely fun and the song really is really catchy. It's a well made short film, well-groomed and actors all do a great job. And the last movie is perfect. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
