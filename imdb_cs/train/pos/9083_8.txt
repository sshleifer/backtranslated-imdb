I like this movie and I had very low expectations due to all the negative reviews I've read before. I went because I was curious about what it was all about because some listeners were so angry with this movie and with the Koreans. Oh, and that's from Korea, which has fired some of my favorite movies. I liked Guest, but not my absolute favorite. Some of my favorite science fiction / fantasy movies, so you can feel my tastes: Mirrormask, Stardust, Serenity, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil, LOTR, Stargate, Dark City. <br /> <br /> It was not as confused as everyone said and the monsters looked good and the battles were great. There are some holes in the story, but it does not matter. I sort of like that and stopped wondering why he'd seen the summer tricks long ago. The Korean legend was interesting, the reincarnation was different, and I thought the main characters were dressed suspiciously as Korean actors at other shows. Ethan (Behr) hair looked so Asian. Yes, it could be better and I hope in the future that Korea with an unusual special sense of life, intense emotions and unexpected humor can bring some variety to the guessed genre. Maybe there will be a combination of host and dragon wars in the future?
