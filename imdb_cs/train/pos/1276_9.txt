I love this movie. Noir imagery, combined with Spillan's senseless character, Mike Hammer, is incredibly moody and seldom in the low budgets of detective films in the early 1950s. It does not have to be a "Maltese falcon", but this film is a solid asset for its genre. Spillane is often criticized for alleged misogyny, etc. But his "ladies" are far more than their male counterparts when it comes to cuddling and intelligence. Poor old Mike Hammer, as effectively played by Biff Elliott, is blinded by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist he meets in investigating the death of a soldier. When the penny eventually drops his face is an image. It is good to see that the censorship of the 1950s did not create filmmakers to skip the famous last line. Bona fide classic low budget.
