Alain Chabat claims that this film is his original idea, but the theme of reluctant lovers who finally put him together is as old, if not older, than Shakespeare. Chabat is "vieux garcon", happy only, and they do not want a member of the opposite sex to interfere with his life. She has a problem, 5 sisters and a matriarchal mother - G7 - who decide to be married. Enter the beautiful, charming Charlotte Gainsbourg and what should be a simple plan. Charlotte must be like Chabat's girlfriend, and then she simply does not get up on her wedding day. Do not talk about the G7 marriage. Of course, the best plans are out of control. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> <strong> br /> There are some fantastic scenes as the first Charlotte to charm, then rebelliate the family. French farce with English.
