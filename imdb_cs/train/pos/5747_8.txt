If you have a heart and sympathy with people, it's a heavy film to watch, at least in the second half. <br /> <br /> It's in that segment where we see the pretty little baby that's beaten, and then it slows down (the questioner) when she witnesses this brutal act against the baby. It is not a pleasant material. <br /> <br /> But it's good film and acting is also good. The story will sit with you for a while. <br /> <br /> Dominick is a mentally handicapped guy and plays Tom Hulce. I think this might be Hulce's best role at all. He was taken care of by a bear student, "Eugene," played by Ray Liotta, who was the next year star of "Field of Dreams" by Kevin Costner. Dominick is a good brave man who reads "Hulk" comics and loves the game. It's a kind of "slow" guy you can not help but love and spice to live a happy life. When he gets scared, it's for some good reasons and ... well, look at the movie for the whole story. It's worth your time, but be prepared to go for a real emotional roller coaster, and you may be very excited about some of the things you see.
