Enjoying real life by Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie in New York in 1890, "The Bowery" is a high energy and a good girlfriend. But be warned: Occasional racial epithets flow from the tongues of Wallace Beer and Little Jackie Cooper. The first shot can be surprising. This is true at the time it was set and at the time it was done. And it also talks about the diversity of the population in that forest ridge. It definitely contributes to the creepy flavor of the atmosphere. Beers like Connors is a fearsome thunder in the midst of events, a guard saloon with a loud mouth with his own fire brigade. And it has a nice place for Cooper ornters. Raft like Brodie is Connors whisker, a better-looking rival in almost every effort. Brodie never managed to avert courage and loved attention and led to a jump from the Brooklyn Bridge (it is still debating whether he actually jumped or used a dummy). Beery is as bombastic as ever. put on Irish and American accent. It's just an unfortunate kind of figure that draws kids, cats and ladies in need. This is perhaps the most wild figure Raft ever played, and even fits into a little dance (just like a show leg). And again, the front lady (beautiful Fay Wray) is going for a prostitute. Cooper is as hard as any of them, though he has a chance to turn on tears. The highlight is not a jump from the bridge, but a not-held-fistfight between Connors and Brodie that in detail looks like a real battle among the top leaders. It is certain that someone bruised more than an ego.
