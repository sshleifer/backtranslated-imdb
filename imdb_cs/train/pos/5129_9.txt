I see why this film was nominated for an Oscar for the best acronym for live action because it was made masterfully. Even if Blues are not like you (although it sounds much like jazz for me), you can easily appreciate this movie. It's just very good, though for my life I do not see why director Gjon Mili just directed one movie - this movie. In other words, the film is nominated and yet the director has not received any career support. As for the black artist, I understand that it does not recommend that their career be changed to a high speed because unfortunately most white companies have indifference (or worse) for blacks or "the kind of music." <br /> <br /> If you are looking at this film, if you are not dealing with an earlier part, skip forward to mark 5:50 - where it will pick up considerably. When the lady stopped singing and the artists began to improvise, the pace improved.
