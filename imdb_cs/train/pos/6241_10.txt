initially, I had a reaction that many people have missed when they saw this: the footage of the fat man who sunbathe, etc. were somehow cheap shots. OK, so diane arbus meets him. . . It does not matter. . . but it was not long before I realized that it was not done in a dehumanizing way the images unfolded I felt the problem was a whole audience: we were conditioned by Hollywood and movies from almost everywhere that watching people over a certain age behave sexually is something unpleasant, something that should not be revealed. if it was the whole movie, it would be a lot. nevertheless the story of women with an abusive friend and his drunken friend really hits like a lot of bricks: a very telling story, incredible performances and the thought that the scene has been improvised. that blonde is a brilliant actor. I would finally like to deny those who say that this film is about how all these people are pathetic. the old man who is at the beach with the woman who is finally dancing for him is absolutely ok that breaks this form, so do not overlook the film by overcoming it. yes, his dog is killed. it's not a pink picture of the world, but it's not. . . completely hopeless. I really felt really grateful filmmakers for making such a beautiful movie. I would not say that every one of them was as strong as the strongest, but I say that this film basically kicks its butt and would highly recommend it. . .
