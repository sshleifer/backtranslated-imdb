Watching "Ossessione" today - more than 6 decades later - is still a strong experience, especially for those who are interested in the history of the film and more specifically on how Italian filmmakers have changed movies forever (roughly from "Ossessione" and "I Bambini Ci" Guardano ", both 1943 and 20 years later with Fellini, Antonioni, Pasolini.) Visconti makes a wonderful directorial debut with the (unscripted) plot" The Postman Always Rings Twice "as a guideline for developing his own themes. /> Today we are struck by how prematurely "Ossessione" was. In World War II, in Fascist Italy he shot in fascist Italy (think about it!), Drawn scenes and themes that caused the film to be immediately banned from theaters - <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> but is also extremely courageous in his sexuality with Gino (Massimo Girotti, who definitely precedes Brand Kowalski in "A Streetcar Named Desire") to make Giovanna (Clara Calamai) married a woman, went to bed just 5 minutes after she was first to meet. We look at Calamai's impeccable seduction and gentle but indisputable homosexual signs between Gino and Lo Spagnolo (Elio Marcuzzo - a very attractive actor, his face is not like Pierre Clémenti, who was shot in 1945 by the Nazis!) ... A few words : sex, desire, greed, and poverty, just as tirelessly as it has ever been before in Italian cinematography. <br /> <br /> All copies of the "Ossessione" were destroyed soon after their opening-it was called scandalous and immoral. Visconti managed to save the press, and when the film was re-released after the war, most critics described it as the front of the neo-realistic movement, Rossellini's "Roma CIttà Aperta" and De Sic "Sciuscià". Some other critics, perhaps better, have seen "Ossessione" as the Italian counterpart of "poetic realism" of French film (remember that Visconti was Renoir's assistant), especially "Quai des Brumes" and "Le Jour se Lève" and Julien Duvivier "Pépé le Moko ". <br /> <br /> While "Ossessione" may be neo-realistic in its visual language (showing the war in Paesano in Italy with its favorite fairs, poverty, child labor, prostitution, burns, fraudsters, etc.) were definitely Viscontian. He was always more interested in tragic, passionate, obsessive, greedy characters, in social / political / sexual apartheid, in the decadence of elites than in realistic "everyday" attitudes and topics that support DeSica and Rossellini. In "Ossessione" we find elements of drama and tragedy that later developed into many of his films, especially "Senso" and "Rocco e Suoi Fratelli" ... Even in his most "Neo - Realist "," La Terra Trema, "makes fishermen resurrected from everyday characters into mythological characters. <br /> <br /> "Ossessione" is a good opportunity to confirm the theory of great artists who have been working on these approaches to analyze and develop specific themes and concerns over and over from their first to last opus, whether or not may change scenery, background or time settings - Visconti can play with the frame, but the themes and the essence of his art are, so obsessively repeating. "Ossessione" can not be missed: you will be fascinated by this nice and powerful film.
