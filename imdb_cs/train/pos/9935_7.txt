My name is Domino Harvery. {EDIT * dizzing * CHOP} My - my - my name is Domino Harvey. {CUT, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey. {EDIT. SHEAR. Playing <br /> <br /> I have never seen that the director has already taken so much luck for his style. Now, it's obvious that most people do not know how Tony Scott is distorted, a glamorous and dizzying editorial technique. If I have to choose between love and hate, I would say I love it. It was a distraction from time to time, but the end result was pretty good, and it's nice to see the director with the creative boundaries of his style and originality (even if he borrows heavily from MTV videos). <br /> <br /> This stylistic edge is reflected by the fact that Keira Knightley plays the role of the lean harassor hunter Domino Harvey, and even her dialogue looks strangely torn. Otherwise, she played it badly, because I almost hated her character and felt no sympathy with her, no matter how much she suffered. We watch the Domino through her life when it connects with other hunter lovers Mickey Rourke, Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The crew gets tangled at the FBI and suddenly has a reality show contract under Christopher Walken's television production (by the way what Christopher Walken does in each movie, by the way?). I think it's a clever filmmaking technique, because now Tony Scott can freely enjoy so many flash editions of the MTV / Reality Show as he likes. At this point, it becomes a pasteurization of the MTV culture. It follows that the story is narrated by the amazingly rapid fire rate and lots of dirty tongues and violent weapons. There are some funny jokes; all this is very modern and unrealistic at the same time. It's a mess, but it's a pretty nice mess. It is eventually defective in many ways (actors are trying too hard to keep their characters "cool" for one), but it works. Do I give that a slight 7/10, which may seem generous compared to the general consensus of filmmakers who have rated this film? but I feel he has some good ideas and done it well. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
