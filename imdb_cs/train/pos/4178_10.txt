This film is a real reflection of the Australian ingenuity that is required of this country from what has been in the past 200 years. He is not pompous like the British, not Gung-Ho as Americans. If one of these countries attempted what this crew did, it would fail. Either because of the ignorance of the British part, or too much faith in the superior firepower on the American side. "True" Australians (ie Importers) are the only ones who can excel in modern military conflicts because they have had to improvise most of their adult lives. Just look at examples like Gallipoli; Paschendale; Tobruk; New Guinea and Vietnam.
