Great movie. Outstanding actress Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas and young Irene Cara. Tony King was very realistic in his role of Satin. This film was one of the most recent "all black" films of the 1970s, and unlike the blaxploitation films of that time, this film actually had a conspiracy and was very well done. The film soundtrack sung by Aretha Franklin was popular at the time on R & B charts.
