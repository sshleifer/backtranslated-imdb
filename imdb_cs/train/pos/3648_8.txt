"Pandora's Clock" is a gripping thriller that is a cross between the film of virgin and the catastrophic film. This film, which was broadcast in two parts on the NBC television series in 1996, appears on an airliner that has infected a virus when it comes to a passenger who has just caused the disease. The United States government is discussing whether the plane should be destroyed or not, while the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and the virus expert (Daphne Zuniga) are trying to figure out something to avoid a disaster. I'm not really a big fan of TV movies and miniseries, but I like "Pandora Clocks". It's one jacket of exciting driving. Jane Leeves (TV "Frasier"), Robert Loggia and Edward Herrmann (as president) also star. *** (out of four)
