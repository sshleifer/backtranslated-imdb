He could not understand why Jeremy Irons felt it necessary to show the most disturbing accent, spoken through his teeth and his throat. In fact, it made me a little spoiled for the film and turned away from what was probably a great performance (very irritating). No other actor or actress seemed to have such a pronounced accent, and while I always rated Jeremy Irons as a fine actor, I would not have included this film as one of his best. The film, however, brought me a sense of appetite, as well as some of the other comments on this movie that I found very interesting, and I intend to read the book now.
