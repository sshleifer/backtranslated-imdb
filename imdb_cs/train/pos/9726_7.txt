It was a pleasant surprise. his trailer did not predict a good film at all, it was even a little misleading. Particularly part of Jeff Bridges was a positive surprise, well written, sardonic and entertaining. Less realistic, I think the person who got where he came would show signs of such disrespect for everything his current society holds. One does not become a top suit, just to doubt that suddenly again. The end of the film, during the Dolce Vita show, was too crowded, clich√© and quite disappointed. And, of course, a guy like Pegg's character will not last this week in New York's flash magazine like that. I hope one day I will see a decent role written for Megan Fox, here she looked like a poor actress playing bimbo. And by the way, I do not know why it's a "sexual symbol" of the year, I can see every hotter girl in every magazine.
