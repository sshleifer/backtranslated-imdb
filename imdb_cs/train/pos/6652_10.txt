I saw the movie and I really could not stop the tears. Her tragedy that India does not have the freedom of such leaders who dare to do justice to their children when they do not behave properly. In the current generation, politicians bring their children to politics without measuring their caliber and skills. I remember a dialogue from Gandhi, "What kind of society do we want to create / create (about Harilal)?" No wonder it will be a dream that India will hardly have such a leader in this or next generation. Einstein was right when he said of Gandhi: "After 50 years, man hardly believes that such a person with body, soul, and mind (Mahatma Gandhi) lived on this land." I sincerely want to divide LOT into Anil kapoor, Feroze khan and all film actors actress for this wonderful film about a great man and a relationship with his son. All father and son should watch this movie once and learn for both roles.
