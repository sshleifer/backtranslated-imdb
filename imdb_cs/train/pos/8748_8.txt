I think that's what the film wants to say at the end of the movie! or damn Australian? I still do not know, but what I know is that I really enjoyed this movie but it could not have been my favorite movie! A big story with big actors, but with a terrible end ... to cry and say, "Oh, she's so good" ... And yet who did it? What really happened? Who's the guy? No answer to these questions ... <br /> <br /> A mysterious movie with a good mark overall ... I'm giving 8/10, going to 8.5!
