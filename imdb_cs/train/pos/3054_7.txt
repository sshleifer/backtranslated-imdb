"Panic" is a crime comedy-drama with William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland and Neve Campbell in the lead role. Alex (playing Macy) is a guy who kills people for a living. At the moment, however, he faces depression and therefore sees the therapist. There she meets Sarah (Neve Campbell) and falls in love with her. He also faces another problem: he wants to end his family business (killing), but now he does not tell his father. Following a guy's story, the midlife crisis, is facing regular problems: to fall in love with a pretty young girl and everything that's going on. <br /> <br /> Pretty good cast performances. Macy is as good as Alex. I had great expectations for this and it was a good movie, but it did not finish. The story was rather flat and clich√©. <br /> <br /> 7/10
