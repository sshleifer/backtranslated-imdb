The performance of Om Puri, Smita Patil and Sadashiv Amrapurkar and all chemistry is reflected nicely, along with a minimalist approach to telling and guiding the story of Govind Nihlani. Dialogues Vijay Tendulkar are also great. <br /> <br /> I have not seen another movie. It's one whole, every piece so nicely fits into a conspiracy. This movie can not be overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> Amrish Puri performs as a bossy man and 'baap' Om Puri. Om Puri is a young man captured between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system. Sadhashiv as Rama Shetty gives almost the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain. The first meeting of Anand Velankar with Rama Shetta in Sadhashiv is absolutely astounding. Smita Patil does not play a major role, but it does not interfere with the main story. <br /> <br /> And to add to it all, Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a policeman who coped with the system and its functioning. Say the right things in the right places and know how to keep away from the troubles. He is also the "guru" Om Puri and helps him when he gets into trouble. The film not only focuses on the difficulties faced by a policeman trying to carry out his duty, but also the other side of brutality in police custody. Om Puri captures the hopelessness and burning desire to relax in this extraordinary performance in Ardh Satya. <br /> <br /> Tribute to all the fans of Indian cinema.
