The amazing reason "race against time" - found that the murdered John Doe has a pneumonic epidemic, so while the health office and the NOPD are fighting everyone and everyone else trying to find contact on the seafront, the killers think the heat is because of it waiting for them. <br /> <br /> This movie is freely available from the internet archive and is worth downloading. Much (all?) This movie was filmed in the original New Orleans locations, making it interesting to look at what is now a detail of the period, though it seems to me under-exposed, even for the noir - maybe the mobile lighting sets were not what they are. There is also a lot of noise in the background, which is a bit disturbing - car horns on the love scene, anybody? There are plenty of unprofessional supporting artists in crowd scenes, which may explain why the transition to the film is somewhat tense - there's not much chance of repeating or reworking, though the ultimate chase is worth it. The most important thing is that Jack Palance is really frightening as a charismatic, intelligent psychopath - the later scene when he comforts and threatens a sick cousin is amazing, while Widmark, as often as he did, gets a fair man's rage on a mission on a credible level - time. <br /> <br /> Someone should replace it - no supernatural, no mystics, no special FX, just a good yoke full of conflict character and current topic. Another reviewer mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole, and it is in place with a number of special types of New Orleans that touch on this dark, clumsy, uninterrupted drama. There is even a newspaper retailer. "" Community? "" What community? "" Do you think you live in the Middle Ages? "
