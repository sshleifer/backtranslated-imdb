Many Americans would say ... What? to my introductory note. Yes, I know my comparison is undoubtedly an insult to the fans of Master Akira Kurosawa, but if you analyze this movie, my comment is correct. We have a peasant who goes to town and is looking for help against a group of grasshoppers who want to steal a harvest of the village. The big difference is the way the story lasts. Our samurai, a group of circus artists as in the original, are a very complex combination of personalities, but in the end what they need, HEROES. Watch again this incredible film (of course the Seven Samurai) and find other movies that stole the story and tried to get the same magical effect as Masterpiece Akira Kurosawa. Tip is the 13th fighter with Anton Banderas, Michael Crichton copied the story, written by his bestseller, but did not find the third leg of the cat.
