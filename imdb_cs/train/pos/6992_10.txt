I do not think it's a bad movie; in fact, it is typical of the type of film that was releasing studio "poor series" at the time. Bela Lugosi, shot in the Monogram, is very effective in acting as a rather demented doctor-scientist who dresses as a respected member of the community. In this film, Bela and his henchmen have an unpleasant habit of stealing young brides and, after their disappearance, injected Bella with a serum from the body to keep her young. Lugosi is more of a task than making this nice movie, but the film suffers from the ultra-wooden acting acting of Luan Walters and Tristram Coffin. The coffin (a nice name for the guy in horror) is particularly bad in this case. I've seen him in numerous movies and TV shows and he's always the same; solid, wooden and absolutely unconvincing. Miss Walters is just a little better, but she lacks acting talent to make her role credible. Still, the viewer can enjoy the great game of Lugosi, which has another strange plan, just to avoid! Despite the misconduct of some, "The Corpse Vanishes" is a nice film everyone sees.
