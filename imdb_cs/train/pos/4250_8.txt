Todd Rohal is a mad genius. "Knuckleface Jones", his third and most fully conscious, short film has an extraordinary sense of humor and leaves some head scratching. What about film in heart, and he almost certainly disagrees with it, is how regular Joe finds the confidence to live a life of inspiration. Or not. You just have to realize yourself. Short is to intermittently make rounds at the festival circuit, so keep your eyes peeled and catch if you can - you'll be glad you did. It's funny. And look at Todd's other short films that appear from time to time: "Single Spaced" and "Slug 660".
