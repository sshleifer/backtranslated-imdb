I loved this movie. I knew it would be full of camp and stupidity as the original series. I found it very heartfelt when I saw Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin and Julie Newmar again. Everyone who loved the Batman series of the 1960s liked Return to Batcave. It could be said that the actors had a lot of fun filming this film, especially Adam West. And I bet he would like to go back to his Batman's costume if he wanted it from the script. I told some friends about this movie, who decided not to see him ... now they wanted to have it. I have all the original 120 episodes on VHS. Now this movie joins the collection. Thank you for the gathering Adam and Burt.
