Such a wonderful movie! Very warm heart. One can not help to fall in love with the Gigi character. He is adorable as a child and grows into a sensitive artist. The whole movie revolves around him. Is he living in a beautiful world? to live your life? curiosity, desire and expectation. He is an older brother trying to steal his glory, but in reality he remains in the shadows all his life. The father is very stereotypically Italian and so is his mother. I wanted my father to come and meet her mother again in the last scene? and let them cry and laugh. I would also like to have something redeemed for the older brother. His personality seems to have been completely destroyed. Passion and ardor? it is the key to life. And looking at the camera? focuses on small details and enjoys the subtle details of life.
