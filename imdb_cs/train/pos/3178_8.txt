Adam Jones's "Cross Eyed" movie drives the viewer on a redemption while the main character takes control of the bike and sets his life in order. Adam Jones has found an imaginative and refreshing way to reinforce his character and update what's most important. These truths become distinct for both the characters and the audience when you laugh at them and gag the credits. Simple, yet attractive setting \ costumes are constantly arguing about what you will see next. You can not help, but you smile and laugh at the antics that take place in this movie. I can not wait for his second job. It's only a matter of time before Jones strikes again. Bravo!
