IN COLD BLOOD is masterfully modeled and adapted to Richard Brooks. However, it is also bent that it is realistic, it is sometimes more clinical than fun. Talking about the brutal murder of the Midwest family, author Truman Capote has focused on minutia, wrapping himself and readers into the subject and the objects! Brooks diverges wildly from this approach in favor of something closer to the docu- ment. Although he films in real places, he kept his distance. The killers are portrayed as spoiled imbecils, which were for sure. They are not considered an incomprehensible soul (as in the book Capote) and the wildness of their act is terribly dull. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are excellent as murderers as well as supporting supporters, including John Forsythe and Paul Stewart as reporter (Capote "character?"). Photo monument is from the large Conrad Hall.
