I saw this movie when I was about 7 years old - 33 years ago - and I never forgot this movie! I was deeply shocked and moved by a brave little boy and a beautiful eagle. And I just could not believe when he turned into an eagle just when everyone in the theater thought he would die ... My sister was in a movie with me and I recently asked her if she remembered the movie we had seen with the boy and eagle, and said she remembered it, as we saw it yesterday. So it's not just me. <br /> <br /> This movie must be seen! <br /> <br /> You will never forget - just like my sister and me ...
