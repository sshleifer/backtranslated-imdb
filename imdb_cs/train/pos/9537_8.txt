Some may think that the ratings I just mentioned are a bit generous, but for what this film is, I think the directors did a good job at their disposal, it's also a movie, a film of the taste! <br /> <br /> My instant idea was a direct connection with the classic cult of The Thing, ie the parasitic extraterrestrials from the outside, the invasion of the human host and then whenever possible! <br /> <br /> You can see how this film focuses on this movie and other genres of horror / gore, although cleverly retaining its own originality, these things fight each other and then continue eating, then the fallen opponent! Just kill and choose a man when he needs a new host! To choose another fight with another infected host! And this film even fits into a love story, but I'm not going to say that it's too much to go away. <br /> <br /> GREAT! But as I said about the taste, do not be surprised if you do not like this movie. It's a low budget, and yes, it's bloodthirsty, with creatures / aliens / things that morph their limbs into coarse weapons, that's Pil, drills, blades, and even strange weapons. I found out that I had moved to what was shown to me, but at the same time I was stuck to the screen thinking what was going to happen! <br /> <br /> So if you like gore, you love strangers, you like fighting and maybe even a little love throwing somewhere, then I have to recommend this movie as you must see. I just wanted to come across it before I did it!
