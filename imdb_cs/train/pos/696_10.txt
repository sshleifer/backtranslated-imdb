Surprisingly well done for an independent film, Insomniac's nightmare portrays a surprising picture of how insomnia is. Beautifully well written and directed, creates an atmosphere of dream, while the viewer is insomniac after one night. <br /> <br /> Starring Dominic Monaghan as Jack, we see everything he sees as long hours of lonely night-sweep. Narrative is almost hypnotic and it is impossible to turn away from the introductory lines. Fascinating and slightly troubling, it shows how someone cope with a lack of sleep, balancing on the verge of reason and madness. Turning around and turning around every corner, Insomniac's nightmare is provocative and eye-catching. It is highly recommended.
