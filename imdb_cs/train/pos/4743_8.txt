This is a very strange HK movie in many ways. First of all, many of the action sequences are not really that fun. The first battle that took place in the movie was just stupid. Cold stupid, or even funny stupid, but stupid. That does not mean that there are no great action scenes, but most of all they will not reach the level of some of the other movies I've seen. On the other hand, this film is actually CHARAKTERS, not just people. All the main characters are interesting (with the exception of the main bad guy who is flat as a billiard) and most of them are pretty good at acting. All the protagonists of this movie are just entertaining. The conversation is quite funny and does not seem to be too losing the translation. This movie is worth seeing, but I hope an uninformed American audience does not think it's the best thing HK offers.
