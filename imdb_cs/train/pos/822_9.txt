The last Lucas saga film is a rich, spectacular production. It is often regarded as the ugly duckling of the original trilogy, but I think it is the glow of episode IV (and only a fraction under episodes III and V). In fact, I think it's the third best six-part solo movie. As for me, it's still a spectacularly funny movie. It is not a movie with the beginning, the climax and the end; the film mechanism works with the only goal in his mind: to bring it to Lucas's universe. The whole thing is associated with finality, which makes the film a bit sentimental but emotionally rewarding. It's also a lot of fun. New characters are introduced and old faces new unexpected challenges. C3PO and R2D2 provide (as usual) great comic reliefs. Leia and Solo are a wonderful romantic duo and Luke is still a great character. Again, it is the inner Luke (and Vader's) conflict that gives the saga backbone. Lucas's aggressive imagination is still very obvious, and film motives of fidelity, hope, and redemption resonate. I'm glad that Lucas eventually dropped the idea of ​​filming episodes VII, VIII and IX, because this movie is a great book of a long, fascinating and fascinating saga. It's not a perfect movie but fun in the best matinee style.
