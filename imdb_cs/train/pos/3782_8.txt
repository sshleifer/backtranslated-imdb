When I was a child I totally loved Bill & Ted Movies. The other night, Bogus Journey, and since I first saw it, I decided to tune in. And I loved her again! This movie is still fun after all these years. "Excellent adventure" is better, but this is almost the same. Sure, some performances are a bit bizarre, but hey, the whole movie is fine. In addition, it contains the most beautiful characters in the movie! Conclusion: Totally like a fake movie dude! The way is great! STATION!!!
