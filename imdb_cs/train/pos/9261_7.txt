What do you think the average person has more / less knowledge of Iranian cinematography or Iranian football? Interestingly, these two get to the forefront of Iran's controversial Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi called Offside, a story that uses football or football as a background for a series of scenes that turn around someone's right to do something or go somewhere and the right individuals to extend this courtesy if and when they would. The strange thing is that you did not come from the Offside when you learned about Iranian football or Iranian film (unless it's Panahi-like controversial lesson), but you came out enlightened that at least someone from Iran took a controversial question that is in a country like Iran, is clearly still very effective and willing to present it to an international audience rather than exploit. I remember the World Championships in 2006, I think many people can. It was summer after my first year at the university and after the slogan, which was my first year, the summer of the football world championship was like a timely tonic. Needless to say, I have seen virtually every game console, which at the same time shows with others at the very end of the group stage to avoid occurrence, as seen in Spain '82 when it was thought that West Germany and Austria appeared, the result between them , which would have seen them both at the expense of Algeria. Anyone in Britain watching BBC Iran? The Mexican game, which is the first place in the tournament, can remember that at the top of the show BBC Football Commissioner Gary Lineker launched an unpleasant commentary to introduce the game. It looked like this: "We have seen the giants of Germany, England, Argentina and the Netherlands, but now we look ........ Mexico and Iran are fighting it." Emphasis on the fact that the last two were lower was clear, and maybe he was watching them as a chore. It's a pity because there are people and they are films like Offside who are really willing to see how Iran is playing until they risk their prosperity to achieve that goal, and it's sad when people in a power position reject what they think "worse" when there are others who would do anything to have another chance. <br /> <br /> When he immediately thinks about the words 'Iran', 'football' and 'World Cup' back to France '98, the match between the nation and America. Here is the World Cup film about Iran, but where some or most of the Iranian filmmakers have decided to introduce a story that revolves around Iran's famous victory over the United States and what it meant for them, Panahi's director decided to see what was happening behind the scenes and presents a story of the stands because women are excluded from football matches and are not allowed to live the ecstasy of victory games of enormous size. Can you imagine how a heavy hand film describes in detail Iran's "victory" as a wooden propaganda film destined to exploit as it "defeats" the western power or "enemy" in the sport that perhaps they did not expect. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> Similalry, in 2005, "The Game of Their Life," sees the Americans defeating English on a soccer match only this time in the World Cup in 1950. The differences between these films and the Offside are immense; Offside looks at a situation that is behind the state mentality and dares to explore the essence of feminism as a girl, trying to see how their beloved Iran defeats Bahrain and qualifies for the World Cup, is rounded off as animals and kept in the raw purgatorium with just feet out of the excluded windows that would allow them to see the game. The reason is that this is a bad language that men "can", not will, but "can" use during the game. The film represents Iran so incompetent that they can not take the right of a man to oath and forbidding a bad language, but must prohibit a woman from seeing the game together? no wonder Panahi's film was forbidden in Iran itself. But Panahi remembers that it includes what makes the rule so crazy in the first place by often allowing his female figures to smoke cigarettes and use cell phones, two things that doctors and scientists think they are much for the human body / mind more dangerous than hearing a bit of a bad tongue on a soccer match. Panahi pays special attention to the title of his film "Offside", which decides in detail about football when the "attacker" is "caught" and tries to gain an edge in the field of play. Parallels take place with the status of women in the film because these twisted (allegedly non-right) individuals are caught by trying to put one over the opposition team; that it is the state itself. I think Offside is one of the better movies that came out of the Middle East and the surrounding area of ​​the Gulf that I saw. It's a tense but humble film about people who, according to IMDb, have no acting history, so acting is a crude and true addition to this quaint neorealistic aura. The immediate end is a scary and constant word battle between men and women who dare to resist the state is amazing. I also think that for anyone who does not really like the movie, for the reasons I have mentioned, it is obvious that there is a clear degree of hatred, whether you are working in the Iranian government.
