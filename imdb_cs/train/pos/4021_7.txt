A complicated story laid behind the division of Bharat. A sincere Muslim who has kidnapped an innocent Hindu girl and an educated Hindu who burns a Muslim man's harvest - but you will end up liking it. The story is strong, but the scenario and flow are hesitant. Music scores on the background and tracks are excellent. Next comes the unforgettable act of veteran Urmil Matondkar. The photo captures the time, violence and taste of rural Punjab very well. Other actors either did not work well or did not get a chance to act. Direction is really the weakest link. The characters were not well developed. Not sharp, unlike the "Earth", where even the five-line character leaves the mark. The end is very interesting. This story could have several different ends - and they could all be just as good.
