Shakespeare's games have a way of overcoming time. The language somehow interrupts the time barrier. but maybe they're actors who really do it. After disappointment in Romeo and Juliet (versions with Claire Danes and Leonard DiCapri), she hesitated to accept another contemporary Shakespeare performance. To my surprise, Othello was great! <br /> <br /> Iago's character played so well with Kenneth! Even when Iago is really evil and contempt, the character played so well that he does what Shakespeare intended for the charater to be, a joy for the audience to hate. I have to say that the fish fish was really good here. I recommend it to Shakespearean scholars and lazy students (who refuse to read a book).
