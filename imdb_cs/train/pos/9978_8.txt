I must say I loved the Vanishing Point. I've seen the original, and that's a pretty good remake of this. Although it was not according to the original story (that's why I gave 8 out of 10), it was still pretty good and it's probably a better story. As for the car, the DJ Comment on the end of the Challenger that goes into the 185 mph bulldozer is quite unlikely (And when you look, the speed needle rolled to 145-150), but even though I'm on the engine in one of starting scenes where the engine shows, the original plot was overcrowded with Hemi, so it's possible. For those of you who say that aerodynamics would not allow it, the normally sucked Chrysler 300C can now go at 168 km / h. And when you look at it, you're on the highway as if you were pushing a brick wall in the wind at 70 mph . In addition, in the wind tunnel test, if you installed an air dam on Challenger, it would probably be aerodynamic.
