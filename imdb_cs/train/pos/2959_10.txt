It was a Saturday night, and BASEketball was on TV. I always wanted to watch it, but I never got to it when it was in the cinema. The boy was wrong. Words can not describe how this movie is funny, playing with South Park makers who share natural chemistry on the screen when they are entertaining. I played the next day and exactly one week after watching it for the first time, I saw it 7 times !! I am obsessed with this, and I know that everyone who appreciates the work of trey and matty will appreciate this film. YOU SHOULD SEE, THIS IS A MOST 1 COMEDY OF ALL TIMES
