Like a 90-minute experience, it's not on the "Drive" level, as the actors in the Who's Me Store are clearly familiar with it? academy, while the action sequences are generally not better than those in the beautiful Mark Dacascos beat 'em-up. Those who enjoyed "Drive" (and I thought it was amazing!), They will certainly enjoy it. You will not go back to the beginning and look at it again, but you will definitely return to some of the action scenes for a long time. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing, the art of quality choreography is still practicing, though not in Hong Kong, and I'd like to see what these guys can do with budgets, time and respect for people like Yuen Woo-ping and Corey Yuen Kuei. If you are sitting in the first half hour and you are not crazy with a crazy dialogue, then you are on the favors. Bosch is spectacular and can really grab a move with some spectacular acrobatics, kicks and simple acts of bravery. If you're lucky enough to reach a distance of 500 miles from a copy, then you can watch it and watch it. It's not Shakespeare. In fact, it's less funny than Coolio in "China Strike Force," but you'll be amazed at both the movements on the display and the pain the stunt team felt - (I'm sure it's not a safe way to land right on your head or be forced to the head of a wooden roof accelerator car!?). <br /> <br />
