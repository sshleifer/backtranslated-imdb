Imagine what kind of school would be in a world like this: children are one big gang who have a really good taste in music and associate with bad directors and teachers. In this world, Rock 'n' Roll High School is taking place. It's like Ramone's life. The characters are just as stupid, innocent and charming as Ramones songs and the music is of course fantastic. College comedies have really changed over the years when you are comparing a movie with a classic american cake with the late 70's when no funny jokes will ever happen. Since the remake is probably in the works, one can probably expect the original spell to be lost along the way and replaced by vulgar, half-funny jokes as Bill Hicks called them. The main problem, however, is that Ramones CAN NOT be replaced. He was the perfect band for this film and no one else could get close to taking his place. The best thing would be to leave the original alone, strange and charming. Gabba-gabba hey!
