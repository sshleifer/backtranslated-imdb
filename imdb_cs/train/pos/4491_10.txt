I love the film "Spring and Port Wine". I was born in Leigh, a town about 7km from Bolton, moved to Bolton in 1965 when I was 20. My job was daily through Little Lever through Farnworth, sometimes on a bicycle but then by car when I could Allow The Film brings all memories to working class neighbors who have almost always been broken but always helped if they could. Fred Dibnah was around the corner from Bromwich Street. If you did not see the movie when you first released it, you may be forgiven for matching it with soap like Coronation St, but I agree it is soap, but it was called "Kitchen Sink Drama!" Watch this film for talented cast, which soon became a home name from frequent roles on TV, I look mainly at the shots of the site and feel a good factor of people who are poor but happy!
