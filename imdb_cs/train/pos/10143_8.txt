It was a great episode, one of the best seasons. Down with the horror of change, with a story that is so above the average episodes of the MOH if that is the case. The man's wife is almost dead in the tragic wreck of the car he was driving. His airbag was not working. She is burned out of recognition (great make-up btw), and not given much chance to live without full skin graft. But she still dies in the coma, but it is brought to her by modern technology, and when she dies for a few minutes her spirit seems to be a very vengeful ghost. Carnage, of course, follows, as well as some extremely cruel kills as well as some extremely sexy scenes. What can you ask for? Well, very much because this baby has everything and a very satirical end that should look like a smile on most viewers. I just loved Rob Schmidt (Wrong Turn) way too, he has a great talent for horror. An excellent episode is the one I buy for sure.
