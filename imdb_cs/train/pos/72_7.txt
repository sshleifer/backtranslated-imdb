I just recently watched the 1954 film, starring Vincent Price for the first time in Turner Classic Movies. The prize is depicted by Don Gallic, a magician / inventor who is murdered when his boss steals a few of his magical inventions (and his wife, whom Eva Gabor has painted in the short role). Even though Price is a killer, I actually found myself at the root for him, a sympathetic nature that is crazy about the greedy people around him who are still using him. <br /> <br /> Although this film does not mean to have the "horror" factor of some of its more famous roles (such as my favorite, "House of Wax"), it still has enough to keep the interest of the audience. <br /> <br /> It's for Vincent Price fans.
