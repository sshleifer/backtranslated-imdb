This film is undoubtedly a perfect 10/10 .. for all those people who rated this film for low marks because it has no "good plot" or something like that, it's ridiculous to say that the movie Jackie Chan is wrong because of his plot it's like saying porn movie is bad because it has no plot! you look at Jackie Chan for FIGHTING SCENES, an action that does not focus too much on a good story or something, if you look at how movies are doing and comparing with other American films from that time, and even later you will see that Jackie Chan movies behind the scenes of top fights and not really good drawings, while American films had good drawings but dirty action scenes compared to what Jackie Chan was doing at the time. Porn is being watched for porn, Jackie Chan is being watched for ACTION, I think people are bad because there is no plot because you think that how clever film critic would rate a good movie, but as I see it is good film is a movie that can entertain me. Surely in the middle of the movie it was boring, VERY BORING, but it gave the rest, which are all action scenes and bits that will pay for it all. This has changed the way in which American action movies have been created, even have the scene of the movie from this movie. If you want a real person, a real entertainer then watch this movie and much more of Jackie Chan, always clean. He literally makes American movies look like a walk in the park, and even in movies TODAYS. American films rely on special effects and safety wires, couples of stuntmen and much more. Police Story and many other Jackie Chan movies are the work of a real entertainer who has done everything and is very talented in what he can do. masterpiece
