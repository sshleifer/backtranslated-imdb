It was a good film with a strong message of love and redemption. I loved the transformation of my brother and the consequences of this terrible illness on the family. Good negotiation and well-managed. If there were any mistakes, I would have to say that the story showed a typical suburban family and their problems again. And what about all the people of all cultural environments? I would like to see a movie where all these cultures are depicted - as in real life. The film, however, has grown in terms of its values ​​and understanding how illness can bring someone closer to its producer. He loved the film and brought me tears
