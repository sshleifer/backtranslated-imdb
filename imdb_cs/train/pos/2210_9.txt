I can not believe how many people hate Hal Sparks! It was my favorite show host, my hands down. I hate celebrity gossip and generally do not like to talk, but when Hal Sparks hosted Talk Soup, it was for me to watch television. During my run, I seldom missed the episode and was saddened when the hosts started to pour (although most of the guests still did a great job). <br /> <br /> Anyway, for all people who do not like Hal Sparks, I think they never found weekend specials. It was an hour long Talk Soup episode that contained the best clips of the week and was released by sketch comic bits. The original bits that Hal Sparks made were merry. In one of them, he was obsessed with a bad comedic demon, and in the exorcist's scene his head turned around as he told about airline jokes. One episode was devoted to making Multiplicity a hobby because a lot of cloned Hal Sparks were still out of the episode and outstripping the studio. OK, maybe it does not sound fun when I describe them, but all I know is that besides Talk Soup, the only other two shows I watched consistently in those years were Simpson and Late Night with Conan O'Brien. So if you like the comedy styling of these shows, then you would probably like Talk Soup during Sparks years. That said, Henson and Tyler were both great hosts as well. All three guests brought something different, but in my opinion, they were all great comedians. Of course, after all the years of Tyler and the visiting stars, my interest in the show began to drop, but I am always caught up with Soup, the spiritual successor of the show, and surely a new guest can bring some unexpected laughter over time. <br /> <br /> Okay, I have plenty of time to talk about a TV show that's no longer in the air and the channel I usually despise. Come on, look at something else!
