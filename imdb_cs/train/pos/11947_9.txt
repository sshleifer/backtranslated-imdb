Simply written, directed and acted ... Woody is the best of 2000, if not his best since the 1980s! Hugh Jackman was the perfect choice for his role. Scarlett Johansson and Woody show how well she has become an actress. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing that the romance with the front lady is not on the screen. He plays the perfect magician magician. There have been several reviews maligning this movie. Do not let them prevent you from seeing a great movie. The people in the crowd I've seen this laughed so loudly that I made another turn. If you like Woody Allen's 70s, you regret that you missed him. I suggest that you watch this movie with an open mind, if so, you can go with a smile.
