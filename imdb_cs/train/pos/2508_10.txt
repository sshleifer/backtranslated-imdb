This movie is amazing. The conspiracy was just ... wow. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised by the performance of Gackt and Hyde after I grew up in the American world of actors who can not sing and singers who can not act. <br /> <br /> In this movie, young Sho (Gackt) encounters a vampire, Kei (Hyde). Over time, they make an unlikely friendship. Kei suffers because of the way others live, half the vampire. <br /> <br /> It's a sad movie but not spoiled. This plot was very unique and unlike your typical vampire. The story was thick with twists and turns and very fascinating. The only mistake I would have to say was that the movie had, although it is a lack of happiness - although a peaceful "ending, it would be more languages. I had the unfounded version (I am lucky to understand that I saved some of the Cantonese) so I'd recommend you get something with subtitles. Overall, the film was just amazing.
