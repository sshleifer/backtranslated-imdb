This movie was great. <br /> <br /> The plot was absurd. </ P> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But, . Baddies were more stupid than bad. Good guys were not very good. Black actors played normal characters rather than black stereotypes. The incorporation of the child has added a good impression. Compassion can be a bit difficult. <br /> <br /> I have to disagree with the negotiations. It was quite good. I really wanted to execute Judge Reinhold. And, after all, is not that a sign of a really good film that would want to defeat Judge Reinhold?
