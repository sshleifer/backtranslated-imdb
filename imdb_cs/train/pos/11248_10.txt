Illudere comes from the Latin verb "ludere" (play), so you are warned of "spy play" as a cruel and yet complicated and intelligent (!) Activity coming from the complex and how it may seem absurd and futile personal history, whether it be whatever it is; yet I feel fascinated by the mechanism of treason and fidelity, the raw material of any relationship, from personal to social; after many years I was ABLE to finish the book it was a revelation! At the beginning I was so dull, not because of the surprising style of writing (I really began to love Le Carra after that novel). The main character is not thinking at all: he has decided to redeem his weakness through the path of faith to friendship and love or not? After this novel you can clearly understand the darker version of Green's "Our Man in Havana," written by LeCarr with "Tailor of Panama"; there is no game, there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical manner, or both. There is no Smiley that would support decent human qualities here in "service," or at least it does not make sense to implement it in this case. The BBC has done excellent work with these series of LeCarre novels: actors are excellent as well as places and ensembles; of course, this script is greatly modified. Be warned, even if someone can be ridiculous, after taste is bitter.
