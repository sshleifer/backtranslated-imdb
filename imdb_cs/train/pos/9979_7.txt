To begin with, this movie is a classic remake, this rating has already been reduced. Because this version nests Viggo Mortensen in the lead role of Kowalski, it will help. It's not like the US government to terrorize one of its citizens. It sounds like the character of Jason Priestley from the movie! But it is true that the government would do anything that could destroy a person's life because he was trying to get home to his wife. A woman who works less and does not have to do it. <br /> <br /> "In this country it was time for the police to accompany a man to his pregnant wife." Disc Jockey. <br /> <br /> In this movie there were some great shots of scenery and great car chases and a lot of spirituality. After a lot of reflections I made this film 7.
