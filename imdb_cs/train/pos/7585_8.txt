It's a strange, brain, unreal, esoteric movie. If it's such a thing as "intellectual horror," it's a movie. I started to scare myself and I wish someone else would look at me and barely have a plot! I have to see the film again a few times before I feel I really understand it. If you are such a person who likes "My Dinner with Andrea" and Godard Movies, or when you make a lot of drugs that change in your mind, you'll probably enjoy this movie. Wow.
