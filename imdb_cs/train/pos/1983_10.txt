I saw it recently on a cable channel. The movie is great; this is one of the few musicals I've seen that can not avoid the light and the darkness. It portrays some splendor of age along with a lot of misery. Some of the dance sequences are happening a lot, I did not know where to look. One day I'll go and see it on the big screen just to see what's going on. But what really takes it to another level is Oliver Reed's performance like Bill Sykes. He is not just an emphatic and threatening man, but there is something else, some inner demons. It seemed to me that when he pushed him into the corner he was able to do everything. It was almost as if Sykes's character was on the edge of madness, just waiting for the trigger. I saw Bill Sykes from Robert Newton's 1948 film, and I thought it was "just" a bad egg, but the performance of Oliver Reed was intimidating me in my own living room.
