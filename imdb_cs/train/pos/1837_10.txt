Simply a great movie is no doubt about it. Great story and excellent performance, let Amitabh, Akshay, Shefali, Priyanka, Boman or Rajpal. The Hindu film industry is becoming uncompromising with Mallika and Co, this film is utterly vulgar and therefore must lead to the failure of vulgarity dependent on our Indian society. But the message and the notion that this movie carries are all excellent. Anu Malik (boring copy-cat) could be ruled out and Ismail Darbar or Himmesh Reshmmiya could be used as a musician. I think Vipul Shah should give a little touch to Gujarati, especially in music. Anu Malik is the worst musician and thinks he's a popstar, but it's not the movie where the presence is needed - He looks just fine with Govinda-style songs. I felt that some pretty classical music with some good Ghazaly or sad songs could remind this film.
