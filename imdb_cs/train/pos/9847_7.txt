He enjoyed watching this movie .. despite the feeling that I was given a lot of time that this film almost copied Monsters Inc. There are a lot of things that are extremely similar between the two, the relationship between the animal / monsters and the little baby, the other animals that try to break this relationship, etc. It seemed to me that pretty much all over the film, for me. One of the redeemed features is Scrat :) Very very funny figure, though it does not make any sense :)
