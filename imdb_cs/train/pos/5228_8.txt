I found this movie cheerful. Losses on other popular films of that time were some of the funniest things I've seen in this movie. Try. If you've seen movies that this movie is spoofing, and you get humor, you should enjoy the movie. I (and others who watched the movie with me) feel the most fun part of the movie (it's not a spoiler because I'm not going to tell you what's really going on) was a scene with "crazy things" from the MIB. When you first discover the device and you do not know what it is ... and then again later in the movie ... you will understand when you get there. My only complaint about the film is that I could never find it on DVD so I could buy a copy.
