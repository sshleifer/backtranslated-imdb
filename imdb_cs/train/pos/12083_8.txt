The second is about a young woman in London who desperately needs work, and she is happy to take a lively secretary position with an older woman and her son. The thrillers that people are held in the house against their will always make me a little worried - finally, I feel like a prisoner - but this classic B-movie is neither loving nor claustrophobic. It's very exhausting and unlikely, but not uninteresting, and our heroine (Nina Foch) quickly stands up to her feet. Rehashing this in 1986 (as a "dead winter") proved to be wise because the plot-elements are not modern. "Julia Ross" is extremely compact (too short after 65 minutes!), But it keeps well, until the too restless peak, which is a little careless. *** z ****
