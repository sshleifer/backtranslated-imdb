Pinjar is one of the few movies that really leave the brand and makes you think hard. Set in Partition India, this film shows the real reality of India's partition. Urmila gets full marks of her beautiful and deeply emotional portrayal of the suffering woman who has no way to go. Her freedom, personal identity and family esteem have been averted overnight by a tragic land dispute. Manoj Bajpai is simply brilliant as her hijacking hurt. A few moments in the movie where one is tied to tears. The film in points is deeply traumatic. Some scene divisions are chilling flu, but Urmila perseverance and survival are remarkable. From a woman robbed of her freedom to a woman who gave freedom to women in similar situations. A remarkable film that should be rewarded with intelligent characters and narrative stories.
