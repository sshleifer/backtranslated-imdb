I found myself borrowing this film from a friend she did not know about, and it turned out to be an excellent documentary about the journey to an ancient ship across huge ocean fluctuations. Thor Heyerdahl developed the theory that the ancient Inca in Peru was able to travel thousands of kilometers across the ocean to Polynesia based on some monuments located in both places on some of the types of old naval vessels we know they had available, wind turbines, and the awareness that inactives are actually traveling at some unspecified level at sea. In order to test his hypothesis, Heyerdahl and his crew constructed the vessel as close as possible to the ancient Incas, using only balsa and other materials at that time, and set out from Lima, capital of Peru, to attempted to reach the islands of Polynesia about 5,000 miles away. <br /> <His theory, as well as ancient history, can not be proved with 100% certainty, but the coverage of their path provides strong support that he is right. The film is really little more than a story about the shots taken during a 100+ day expedition, but it is a very detailed description of what it was and the trials and tribulations it faced. I often want documents about winning an Oscar to be easier found, and more than 50 years ago it is still as interesting and informative as I'm sure it was when it was released for the first time.
