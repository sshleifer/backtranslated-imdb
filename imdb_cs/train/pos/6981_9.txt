To all haters: to condemn the television series with one episode is like judging the entire book after reading the first few pages. That being said, I was a big fan of BSG, I thought it was one of the best TV drama (not only sci-fi) in the air. But it was time for it to end and the story went on. I really liked the BSG epilogue "The Plan", but she raised so many new questions to answer, so I eagerly expected "Caprica" ​​and I was not disappointed. I was hoping she would not try to be another BSG, and I was delighted that "Caprica" ​​is something different and personally I found the story exciting, other than flames of space battles, blasts and sci-fi special effects (do not do me bad, I like the stuff too). Eric Stolz and Esai Morales give a solid performance and Alessandra was simply great. I can not wait until next week.
