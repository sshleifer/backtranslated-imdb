I saw this movie last night on the cable and it's extraordinary. What I love most is that it is underestimated and little key but deeply honest. Henry Thomas' (he played a child in E.T.) performance is a masterly inarticulate (he was supposed to be a man with few words). David Straithern is a beautiful crazy villain. And miraculously (as we are talking about the Hollywood product here), the child serves as the main character, but the one who does not have lines but rather IS (and shines on it). Interestingly, Thomas's mysterious relationship w. E.T. was at the heart of this film; while his bond w. the child serves as the core of a "Good Child". <br /> <br /> Then there's music - ah, what music! Gillian Welcha's melodies are wonderful and the whole score is awesome music down the hill. <br /> <br /> This movie is wonderfully atmospheric. I recommend it very much.
