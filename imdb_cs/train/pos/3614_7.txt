The girl battle is like your grandmother's cooking: the same old recipe you tried a million times before, but somehow it changed into something fresh and new. Try and explain the story to people who have not seen it before: young women from the wrong side of the track are trying to improve their situation by fighting the box while dealing with a bitter obstructive father and a growing attraction to a male rival. Watch your eyes look at the cliché chain and are right: * is * cliché. Still, I was hypnotized by how well this film works, because of the often excellent negotiation and dialogue and the sensitive direction that makes it "new". I avoided it in the cinema because it looked like a bullshit, but it did not make the same mistake I did. It's definitely worth a look.
