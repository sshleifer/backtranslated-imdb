This film is visually stunning. Who cares if he can act or not. Each scene is an artwork composed and captured by John Derek. Locations, designs and costumes work perfectly to prove what's in the love story of beauty, youth and wealth. In some respects, I would like to see this film as a homage to John and Bo Derek's story. And ... this comment would not be complete without mentioning the role of Anthony Quinn as a father, a mentor, a lover and his portrayal of men, men lost to the past when men were men. Some of us who find value in strength and direction are wrapped in trust that contributes to a sense of trust, constraint, and security. Yes, no such people do! But how often do you find women that are made like Bo Derek.
