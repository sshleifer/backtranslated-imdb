I considered this film to be very good in all areas. It performs brilliantly from all characters, especially from Ms. Stone and Morissey. Tramell's character is just smarter and more psychologically twisted. The plot is interesting even though this film is more for the mind that plays among the main characters and how Catherine continues writing with new ways and abbreviations for his novels. The setting was also wonderful and the whole atmosphere of the movie was the mysterious thriller as a masterpiece. Watch this movie now, it deserves better than what it got from viewers who were introduced by some flawed horrible reviews of the movie (even before it started) ..... You will not regret if you go .. .
