I have to admit that I did not expect a lot to be devoted to this film in a movie in the Japanese film class, but this movie really kicked me off. The director does a great job following the title of his movie and actually displays a picture of madness. I think the fact that this film is silent adds to the madness and helps the spectator to experience the characters of the inner world rather than the world beyond his mind. This film has only added to my feelings about foreign silent films against the US, in that foreign films are working much more to think and think rather than tread on the fluffy film with a happy ending, very little.
