Personally, I think Sayonara was the biggest film he ever did. She touched all the emotions, from anger to romance, until the tragedy was over. And Brando was supposed to win the best actor. Anyway, the movie is amazing, the man is attractive for both men and women and now you have no reason not to see it! Do it and fall in love.
