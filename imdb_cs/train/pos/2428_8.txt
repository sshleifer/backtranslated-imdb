Like an old white housekeeper, I can still afford that Laurence Fishburne is one of our best actors. anyone who appreciates his work, as in Deep Cover, can enjoy watching an incredible acting actor. Since I think it's his directorial debut, it could be even more interesting. The whole actress is pretty good. If you can not take down the lower Manhattan space worlds or the reality of crime life (not glorious action shooters), then it is not the movie you would enjoy. This is Mr Fishburne's usual contribution to incredibly delicate relationships. I would like to see that Larry and Anthony Hopkins go to film every day.
