I think I've ever read it: Joe Johnston (film director and also one of the boys who founded Industrial Light and Magic to work on the first Star Wars movie) and one of his producers, or something "Rocket Boys" (about) something is missing. <br /> <br /> One day they talked to a computer program that makes words from other words (that is, you enter a word or a series of words and mix letters and create other words.) I think the technical term is "anagram" /> <br /> Anyway, they wrote in "Rocket Boys" and surely what's coming back is "October sky". They were shocked by the slightest. The title summed up everything in the movie because the film revolves around Sputnik. At first, Homer Jr did not like this idea, but after he wrapped up the "film poster novel", he warmed up and set off.
