I saw this movie a few years ago at a video rental and rented it. My husband and I enjoyed it so much that we bought VHS and enjoyed it ever since. <br /> <br /> The plot was well discussed, so there is no need to go over it again. The point is that this movie deserves a re-view. Especially Americans will not have all the jokes for the first time. I know I'm not. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun, touching, sad - all at the same time. When Ray suggests a toast at his daughter's wedding, it's caused by a peak. When Karen calls Tony "Brian" when he tries to kiss her, it's heartbreaking. When Beano finally marries in black, it's too fun for words. And music: it's just as good as a movie soundtrack I've heard for years. I was dancing in the living room "All over the World". <br /> <br /> Every performance is absolutely perfect. Bill Nighy was rightfully praised for his idea of ​​Raya, a man who had too many bad trips. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, a nice keyboard player who has borrowed Karen's flashlight for years. It has an attractive look that makes women want to embrace it. But all actors are just as brilliant. <br /> <br /> Ignore all the pans you've read about this movie and you will see it. It's a gem.
