A few years ago I bought several $ 1 DVDs that included two movies each. One of them had Three Broadway Girls (an alternative title for Greeks had a word for them) and one, Happy Go Lovely. It's basically a backstage musical comedy that's happening in Scotland, and it's about a mistaken identity that includes one of the dancers who ride a millionaire limousine. Vera-Ellen is the a-wow dancer, what foot! Ceasar Romero is her producer who gets a chance at the original front people because she thinks it dates to the millionaires whose car I just mentioned. And David Niven is the rich man who, in search of Vera-Ellen, is wrong with a reporter who should talk to her, but Romero is blocked. What I just mentioned may be confusing, but (it's mostly) makes sense if you're willing to check your brain when you watch this charming comedy with the beautiful musical numbers done by Mrs. Vera-Ellen. Romero may be a little nasty, but Niven is curious. The print I saw was quite good due to the age and the fact that it is publicly owned. And Vera-Ellen likes her lines because she is not really an actress. So, on this note, I recommend Happy Go Lovely to film lovers who love old-fashioned musical comedies.
