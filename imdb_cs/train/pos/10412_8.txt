Thief Baghdad is a treasure. First of all, it's a good story. Although my primary speeches of my four most famous children from the Arab Night Stories are coming from the Disney Corporation, the Baghdad thief has ended their interest. The story moves at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduces predictability. Sabu, who plays the young Abu thief, also watches any of today's teenage actors on appeal, and judges how many times I've heard my oldest daughter, "It's c-u-t-e!" <br /> <br /> In 1940 he received the Oscar for cinematography and special effects. Today, of course, these effects look very dated ("Look, it's Barbie flying through the air," she declared to my daughter as she glanced at genie flying). Yet it fits well into the story. After all, the film is over 60 years old. The effects match the script. In addition, what he sees in the Baghdad thief has remained essentially state-of-the-art over the next twenty-five years. Just compare the Star Trek episode in 1967 to see it. That was a pretty good success. This qualifies as a family film, though at the end it is a few spots. The game is so obvious and the wounds are as bloody as those scenes that are almost as artificial as animations. Overall, there is a fun movie that's worth watching either for the evening of pure entertainment or for the historical value of the effects. I recommend it.
