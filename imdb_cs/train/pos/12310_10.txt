Just read the original story written by Pu in the 18th century. The film was very prominent, although the plot changed very much. Film language, rhythm, a special effect are all from Hollywood, but there is still a Chinese core. It is amazing how Hark Tsui succeeded in joining together. The result is pure beauty.
