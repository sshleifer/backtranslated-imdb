I have read most of the comments here. I came to the conclusion that almost everyone agrees that 9/11 is a shocking history. There are a few who think the added story is weak and I agree that the narrative is weak and unnecessary. About two brothers who, after the disaster, appeared to each other and stand on a cliff around Tony. But I do not think the narrative is useless. Like many theorists, I think our own lives are narrative. We live and do our own autobiography. So if we talk about our lives, it's always like a narrative. We do not allow to summarize facts such as: birth, childhood, high school, etc. We are creating a story about our lives. <br /> <br /> Because we've learned stories, we want to make history even in the story. Because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves. We can better understand what happened in history when it was narrated in the form of a story. So it's intended to add a document to the document. The story is weak, so it is, but we understand what's going on. If it was me, I'd worry about my brother. <br /> <br /> And the second point that fades the movie. It is true that it was recently to come up with a big film about September 11th. Though little has appeared on the subject, none of them like this document. But what if the movie was in about 5 years? I agree that it is wrong to try to make a lot of money from 9/11. But I also agree that movies are one of the best ways to tell history. How many movies of World War 2 have we seen? If I did not see these movies, my view of WW would be totally different. I remember seeing Schindler's list and I was crying an hour in an hour. Films give you a good idea of ​​the things that have happened in history, and although it is a fiction, it contributes to the memory of disasters and sacrifices. <br /> <br /> So my remark: telling stories is not always bad, it does us by identifying the story and never forgetting what happened.
