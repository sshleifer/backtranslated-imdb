I love this show because it is an action full of adventure, love and intrigue. I love sometimes! It's so good to see a show where all the characters work well and treat each other with respect. Dick Van Dyke is also very well in the television role as I saw him only in Mary Poppins. the mix of main characters, Mark, Amanda, Jesse and Steve is greatly captured by the audience. This is a show you have to watch!
