The basic story is Aditiya (Kumar), who is the spoiled son of a millionaire Ishwar (Bachan) who owns the toy industry, Ishwar's son Aditya can not do anything wrong, Aditya's mother Sumitra (Shefali Shah) warns Ishwar to bring his son on a responsible journey before it is too late because Ishwar is a lung cancer patient and only has 9 months of life when his son gets dressed and married to Mitili (Chopra), Ishwar easily forgives Aditya but when a happy couple Aditya and Mitali returns from the honeymoon, Mitali is pregnant and it causes Ishwara to kick Aditya out of the house to make him more responsible, Aditya does not know that his father suffers from lung cancer and also does not know his father kicked him out of the hose to make him more responsible, Ishwar can not bring high Aditya that she is about to die, with a hungry and pregnant woman. it's a race with time, so Aditya does everything he can to prove to his father, and the climax comes when Aditya gets into a big break in the film industry and his father tells him he's going to die. <br /> <This movie is absolutely brilliant, it is a breakthrough in the Indian cinema, which was needed for the Bollywood industry, the direction of Shah is almost flawless, but which film does not make mistakes? The best part if this movie is the relationship of the father of a son who is a tearjerker. singing interludes is just at the right time, the scene is good, the only part where this movie fails is where the jokes between Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav jokes are too long and a little annoying, but overall it is a brilliant movie, I advise everyone Read this review to watch and watch it regardless of other reviews. 9/10
