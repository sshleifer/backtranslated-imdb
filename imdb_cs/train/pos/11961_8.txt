I thought it was a great way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend, to sit in the air-conditioned theater and watch a cheerful comedy. The story is simplified, but the dialogue is funny and the characters are sympathetic (even the suspect bread on the serial killer). While some may be disappointed to realize that this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still under the control of the style that many of us have got used to loving. <br /> <br /> It was so much that I laughed in one of Woody's comedies in years (I dare say ten years?). While Scarlett Johanson never experienced me, she managed to calm her "sexy" image and jumped directly into the average but lively young woman. It does not have to be a crown jewel from his career, but it was more than "Devil Wears Prada" and much more interesting than "Superman" great comedy they meet with friends.
