This is a great movie for all generations of X'ers. What other world was America compared in 1972 with the psychotic 21st century. You can realize what America was in 1972 was like watching this movie. I found out that the clothes and the style of the car brought me a lot of memories to a much better country than we did. Just think ... At that time, only 4 or 5 TV stations could be selected. There was no AIDS, Muslim terrorists, Road Rage, 911, bird flu, highway snipers, etc. Atd. The Vietnam War is over. It's still 7 years before Star Wars comes out. Your personal computer and the Internet would still be 29 years old. When this film first came out, producers had to shoot the film themselves, as no other film company wanted. So a tour of small Protestant churches across the country began appearing on film projects (days before VCRS, of course). A pastor of the Church who would be interested in showing the Thief in NIght to his congregation would get a copy of the film. Then he organized an evening to show it in the church where they met or in the dining room. Members of the Congregation would invite "unsaved" friends and family members, and it would be a social event of the week. <br /> <br /> If you can overcome the limited production value of the film and just watch its nostalgic value, then I think you will enjoy this movie more. Of course, I'm talking like a family. <br /> <br /> If I had the machine for a while, I would go back to 1972 and say goodbye to the 21st century bay that we have now.
