If the Lion King is a serious story about a young lion growing up to avenge the death of his father, Lion King 1 and a half is the opposite, full of whims and cheers. The Lion King narrated the story of Simva's young lion, one and a half from Timon and Pumbaa, less than the perfect duo composed of meercat who went home because he could not dig without the funeral his friends and neighbors and the warthog who had a smell. The film is a bit short on substance, but Disney does a good job of filling time with various sketches in the lead role of Timon and Pumbaa when they "watch" the movie with us. My favorite is the singing that takes place in the middle of the movie, make sure you look at the bouncing mistake! Disney advertised one and a half as "the rest of the story," though it really is not. This is the other perspective of The Lion King, without all the serious things that have penetrated most of the second half of the original Disney classic. Nathan Lane's credit as Timon and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa for their voice work, without their efforts, the film may not work. They sing, have fun and make us laugh. They also give us reason to avoid a hot tub with warthog.
