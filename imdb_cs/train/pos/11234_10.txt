This is a great and well-spent contribution by a group of fans, and because it is made in the back bedroom on a painted green screen, the story lines are complex and twisted and its characters show a realistic depth and dimension. CGI created by the crew is breathtaking. While the first season may be a little restless, the last few are well thought out and well shot. Some fans may have thought that Star Trek Franchise ended with the early cancellation of the Enterprise, but these fans do not answer. I recommend it to fans and novices alike, 10/10 hidden border crew. <br /> <br /> Do it so ...
