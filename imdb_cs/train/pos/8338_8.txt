This movie is so great. Her bettor probably resides in the 1940s and Meg Ryan's character struggles to be known as 'smart'. Plus Tim Robbins is so cute in this movie. Everything about him has a magical feeling. Whenever I look at it, I feel happy. It's definitely a girl movie, and I'm a girl, so I like it. I like music too. The violin is amazing. but besides, I think it's a cute story and everyone should watch it.
