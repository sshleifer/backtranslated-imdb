One of the best films "Amitabh comeback" I liked. That was the stage when Govinda was strong with Dhawan. The songs were amazing and absolutely, as we call it "masti". Still a faithful entertainer with similarly diverse Anupam Kher. The story line has plenty of cheerful twists, as is well known for David Dhawan's diver. The timely appearance of Madhuri "Nene" Dixit, it was a complete uprising to the end. It was great to see Amit with such power and humor after a long exile. Although some may consider it a typical Bollywood Masala movie, I would watch him every day. I make it easy 8 out of 10 just because you are a clean Bollywood.
