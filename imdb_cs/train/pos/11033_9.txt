I do not think if I understand the hatred for Renna Harlin. 'Die Hard 2' was cool and he gave the world 'Cliffhanger', one of the most amazing action movies ever. That's right, you little punks, "Cliffhanger" rules, and we all know that. Sly plays Gabe Walker, a former rescuer who "is just visiting" his old city when asked to help a former friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), helps rescue the top of the mountain. Walker seems to have returned at a suitable time because the stuck people are in fact a sophisticated team of thieves led by Eric Lithuanian (John Lithgow). Qualen & co. they lost a lot of money they stole from the United States government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they really would like ... <br /> <br /> Basically, Cliffhanger is the next Die Hard clone. Just trade in the borders of Nakatomi Plaza with the open Rocky Mountains, complemented by scenes designed to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him deadly. It goes without saying that this arrangement is totally torn to pieces soon enough, because Stallone's character avoids a fairly large number of beads with lightness and strikes first on several rock faces without obvious side effects. After all, is not it about action movies? <br /> <br /> 'Cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies around. An exhibition of great scenes and stunts. One of the early stuntmen is one of the best stunts I've ever seen in the movie, and while the rest of the movie is getting better than it was at the beginning, she keeps her awesome. John Lithgow is the leading rascal fun and one bad dude. Maybe one of the best lead nasty villains ever. <br /> <br /> 'Cliffhanger' is an effort of Stallone, definitely Renny Harlin's best effort and a very exciting action movie - 9/10
