I saw it too at the premiere last night. I was completely blown away how better this film was than what I expected. Few films can combine the dark comedy and the current drama dramas, and it's not a breakdown at the end. I will not bother rehashing the plot too much because I think the more about this movie going into it is much better. But I'll say Adam Sandler's performance was really refreshing and real. It was funny and much more fun than most of his latest comedies. Don Cheadle was believable as ever. This movie is not funny like Borat or Billy Madison, but that's good. I would say 90% of the audience laughed most of the film. In the middle of the journey, the film slows down to deal with the dramatic end of things and makes a really good job of linking it all together. I also thought it was really cool to play instead of playing my entire black friend / white friend whom they chose to ignore and focus on the relationships themselves.
