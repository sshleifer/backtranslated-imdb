Usually, the best way to bother me in the movie is to include a link to Orson Welles. But here's a science fiction comedy that tells the broadcasts of World War ... and it's gold! The very concept of a small bunch of diminutive, aggressive and stupid aliens who are mistaken as kids in Halloween's dress is spectacular. Do not be fooled by the idea that because it looks like a kid's movie, it's simple - no, there are plenty of hidden treasures ... Jewel!
