All good movies "inspire" some directly to the video. I was afraid that "The Gladiator" was not really such a good movie because I did not see a movie that would have been something like Romano in the new storage field for months. Then I saw the complete monthly offer, Demonicus. I'm a fan of Puppetmaster and Blood Dolls, but I have never seen one of their puppet movies. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Demonicus records what is happening with a group of campers in the mountains of the Alps. One of the campers, James, finds a cave with old gladiator artifacts, and feels he's supposed to bring a helmet from the corpse and try it out. He becomes obsessed and as a demonic gladiator Tyrannus is forced to kill his friends to revive the corpse that is a true Tyrann. Like many Full Moon movies it has little or no budget. Sometimes the editing and direction was so amateur that I swear I was looking at the Blair Witch Project. Attempts to cut limbs and heads remind me of Monty Python skit. Weapons, though apparently real, look really plastic. It literally looks like it was shot by a group of friends with a digital video camera at the weekend. We admit that there is nothing wrong with the filming of a movie, it simply does not work because it expects a technical masterpiece. It seems that attempts to investigate the scenario were too much, because even though Tyrannus does not even appear to be a gladiator at all, at least he speaks Latin. <br /> <br /> All trashing aside, I actually enjoyed this movie. Not like a killer fabulous movie, but it still adds a full moon! The only thing that disappointed me was not at the end!
