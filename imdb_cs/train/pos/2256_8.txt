He did not know what from Van Damme's partner and friend / coach / and his martial choreographer for most of his films. It was nice to see him as "TONG PO" in "Kickboxer and Van Damme's next films, now he is alone and he and his wife are doing a great team." In this Qissi, an action director and leading bad guy, and he is that his wife was a writer, producer and director of most of the scenes that did not require action, and also made a good job of editing the film, working together. edited it well, we were real warriors, and they looked good together - the story coincided well, and if you could understand ... no bad language, no sex, just action, one new to me.
