In the process of endeavoring to empower audience empathy with Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) filmmakers threaten North and Jayhawkers. Missouri has never escaped from the Union, and the Union's army was not an invasion force. Southern citizens fought for the rights of the state: the right to own slaves, to vote for criminal legislators and judges, and to employ a system of political prey. There is nothing noble about it. The Missouri could easily travel east and join the Confederate Army. It seems to me that the story has nothing to do with ambiguity. When Jake leaves Bushwhackery, it's not because he saw a mistake in his way, and he is certainly not surprised by the virtue of the cause of the abolition.
