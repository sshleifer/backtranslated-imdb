"Loulou" enjoys the same way as expensive high quality French wine. It leaves you a very delicate flavor. <br /> <br /> 'Loulou is not a new topic. The film also does not bear an original conspiracy. Its color display is good, but not extraordinary. Its setting is serious. Its elegant style never and no matter your mind.
