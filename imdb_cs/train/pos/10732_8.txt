I saw that this movie is great. He did not surprise when he did so for the sake of truth, and so on his own as he got a dirty flight to which he had no place, but it was just such a conspiracy theory, right? <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie when I was a child. I wondered if that was the case, if it turned out that such a flight really took place, certainly for no reason, because it denies logic and common sense. Who in healthy sentiments sent the kids in the orbit to the orbit. I really like reading about the theme, US and Soviet space programs. I know a few space missions provided by the CIA contained a "TOP SECRET" clause, but they are definitely just divorces, but who knows?
