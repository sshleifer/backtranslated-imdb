For fans of Troma or Cyberpunk genre mixed with small blood gates then this movie for you! Within the boundaries of this film there is a good amount of blood that can be eliminated, and the effects can also be sensitive and amazing. This plot is ridiculous and refreshing, it is not associated with what we, as an audience, are waiting for from the movies today. <br /> <br /> Also noteworthy are the small extraterrestrials I found cute. Overall, it's a good movie for fans of the genre. Movies like Tetsuo: Iron Man and Versus are also recommended for this strange Japanese film approach, full of wonderful secrets and bloodshed. Of course, when you see this movie, you should know about it.
