It's an excellent but difficult to find Trippy World War I spy thriller in an inimitable 60th Italian style. From the psychedelic introduction credits and the great Ennio Morricone score to the lesbian love of the Capucine scene and the complicatedly produced apocalyptic earth battle scenes, no one with poison gas and the German cavalry in the "storm trooper" movie should not be omitted. It is a film that captures the horror and cruelty of war and the recklessness of players on and off the battlefield. In addition to fighting scenes, some of the productions and special effects are primitive, probably because most of the budget of this film was saved for battle scenes, but it should not be a problem for 60s lovers. I first saw this movie on TV and predicted I was uploading it to VHS. I still have a tape and I like to watch it from time to time.
