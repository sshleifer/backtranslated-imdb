This movie probably never made a blip on the radar screen, but it's pretty good. It's quite realistic, yet you think "It's just a movie." Duvall and Close are ordinary people and you never realize that they are now actors with a big name. It seems that in this story, a blockbuster is too old to chase Eugen's girlfriend, but I think it's possible. It seems unlikely that the baby would travel from Montana to Nevada alone, but I think it is possible. Maybe you think family troubles in this movie will never happen in your family, but I think it's possible. I remember Glenn Close saying something like "Do you think the work you do is the hardest part of your life, but it's not."
