I always tell people that "Enchanted April" is an adult film that has no cussing, no sex, no violence. One might think of it as "the best cat", but I bet that there is one or two enlightened men who like it. Do not connect children, however. This film is very small. <br /> <br /> See "Enchanted April" is a very healing experience. The soundtrack and beautiful scenery, along with the lavish ways of the ladies, bring to mind the peace and beauty of painting in front of rafaelite. <br /> <br /> In order for someone to think that your only one is watching one type of movie, I will paraphrase the line I once heard of Saturday Night Live and say that my two favorite movies are "Deer Hunter" and "Enchanted April".
