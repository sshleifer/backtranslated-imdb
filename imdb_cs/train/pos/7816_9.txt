Richard Attenborough is a director whose name is synonymous with the victory of "Gandhi" in 1983. I did not know any other work until I recently hit "Cry Freedom," released back in 1987. Though it may not have been as popular as his Gandhi , it is just as gripping, if not more, and was released when South Africa still did not get rid of apartheid sleep. While most of the films about social issues come out after the event, I think this has been released over time. The story is based on real life and events. The book on which the film was based was written by Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), a journalist who worked in South Africa until the end of the seventies. He follows the origin of Woods' friendship with charismatic black leader Steve Bik, who is beautifully portrayed by Denzel Washington. I can not imagine a better roll choice. Washington radiates the natural charm and presence on screen that Biko needed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> <br /> <br /> To your fights and ideas. The connection between them grows stronger, and Woods and his family become aware of and become more sensitive to the situation of the people who represent Biko. Eventually, however, the tragedy strikes and Woods must now focus on escaping from South Africa, with his book to publish and let the outside world know what's going on. The other half of the film is the breathtaking story of his escape from South Africa, along with his family and will keep you on the tenterhooks. There are also several deliciously humorous dialogues. The scene between Bikou and the lawyer in the courtroom is an example. Lawyer: Do you advocate violence? Biko: I'm defending confrontation. Lawyer: Well, is not that violence, Mr. Biko? Biko: Not necessarily. You and I have a confrontation, but I do not see any violence. Moments, however, bring you back to the horrors that have penetrated into the earth before it has better meaning. The scene in which the army opens fire to protest schoolchildren is exhausting and cordial. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a must. I would suggest those who are not familiar with Attenborough, and wait for it. There are movies that make a lot of money. And there are movies that make life. Anyway, I would prefer the other.
