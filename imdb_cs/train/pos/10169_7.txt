Through her dead body was a nice little movie. She was decent and fun, though she was still quite funny. There were a few clich√©s, but I found most of the things fresh. At first I did not think it would be good at all when it started. If you can get in the first 20 minutes though, the movie is getting more and more interesting. This movie was not torn in a cheerful laugh, and it was not OH MY GOSH gorgeous. which you can sit down and enjoy how pleasant it was.I do not see how this movie was bad.It's rating is just a little too low.I could have dealt with 5.5 but 4.8? Also, it gives this film A 1 is shameful. It was quite good and there was nothing scary to give 1, which is what most people gave it.
