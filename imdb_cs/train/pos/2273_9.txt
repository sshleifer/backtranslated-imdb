I've still seen a movie with Nolte about not liking me. However, it was said, he did a lot of movies and I did not see much. In my eyes I keep the paintings of his performance here and that in the "Thin Red Line". Nolte has a range of acting talents. When he needed to scream, he pushed like a wounded lion. His best moments are those I appreciate in the actors: when he simply emulates gestures from his face, hands and body without saying anything. When they come to the conclusion that our current generation of actors are basically not valued by what the actor can do without talking without knowing consciousness of Keaton and Chaplin, this generation of actors relies too much on the mechanical magic of computers. Of course, it's just a sign of the time we live in. If Chaplin lived in our days ... who knows, he could also be a fan of CGI tools. <br /> <br /> I did not read the novel Vonnegut from which this film comes to the screen. However, the plot is not so busy or intricate that we can not follow the path, nor with all of its surprises. Of course, at first it seems absurd. However, it is not impossible. <br /> <br /> Imagine the beginning: Spy in the heart of the Third Reich: Extraordinary life of Fritz Kolbe, the most important American spy in World War II Delattre and Prichard (see Amazon for more information). Consider: History Undercover: Piercing Reich: American Spies Inside Nazi Germany DVD (I saw it here: http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=75054) seems to be the production of History Channel. <br /> <br /> So the story is ridiculous? Far too interested, yes, impossible, no. Back to the fence. Nolte's character is recruited and accepts an unimaginably dangerous mission and unfortunately the script does not give a good reason for accepting. Was it a type of passivity that he got into this role, as he says, because it was the best story he ever wrote, and he was supposed to play this role? It's hard to imagine any of us grabbing. But it was an unusual period, and people were doing extraordinary things. All filming throughout the movie is great and the people who have pointed out that Alan Arkin is always fantastic is very good in a small role. <br /> <br /> I was really shocked by the end of the movie (no - I will not spoil it) and it made me feel terribly over this choice. Did this man feel that the journey was finally over and that he was talking about everything that was necessary and that other chapters would be added to a life that is already filled with many burned pages? It's hard to say but it really does. <br /> <br /> Nolte gives you one of the best performances you can expect ... the film space is thinking about a lot of things. It's very fun and provocative. What great movies should be. A little while, but it's worth it. By the way, film music has the choice of one of the best living composers: Arvo Part.
