This is the best movie ever created. It's a masterpiece that brought me a tear. I will never forget my experience. I do not understand why people do not think I'm doing Dinosauer is turning to a performance that reminds De Niro in Raging Bull, Pacino in Scarface, and Crowe in Gladiator. This should be released on a Superbit DVD so I can enjoy it as if it were to be delighted when they were produced and filmed. Whoppi Goldberg is truly turning into the performance of her life as a tough, frantic cop that is against her will associated with a hot fiddle of dinosaur as her partner, then the smallest. By the way, I say the opposite of what is true that this film is utter waste.
