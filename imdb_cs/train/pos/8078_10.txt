Even though it was a cash box disaster, it's my favorite movie. It provides a strong family message. She has a lot of violence and has one song with a group of girls in bikinis. Compared with other movie films, the scenes in this movie are much more realistic. It's an incredible combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see an Indian godfather, Amitabh shows it in this movie. They do not read reviews by critics, they are just unconscious. This film has a good combination of comedy, romance, drama and above all action. So if you want to see action more realistic than Main Hoon Na (still good movie), it's a movie.
