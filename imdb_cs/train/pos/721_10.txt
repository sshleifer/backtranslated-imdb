ROCK N ROLL has a special place in my heart because she introduced me to Ramones. During the mid-1970s, I was too young to be aware of it, even though I had an older cousin who was a great fan at that time. Finally, I saw RNRHS on TV one afternoon in the mid-1980s, when I was about fifteen years old and laughed all the way. (Is not it that every dream in high school has destroyed its school and blew it down, everyone in the rockin 'soundtrack?) I recorded the subsequent broadcasting of the movie a year or two later and constantly watched the Ramones concert sequence and again, he thought, "Man, these guys kick their ass! I have to look at some of their albums! " The rest is history. Twenty years, the Ramones LPs / Cassette / CD and the three Ramones appear later, they are still one of my favorite bands, and RNRHS has always struck me when I look at it. Now that Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny have left us (R.I.P. all), we have at least this film and a lot of great music that we remember.
