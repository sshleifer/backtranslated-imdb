Yes, some drawings are a bit hard to follow, and Bill tends to get violent, but it's actually a breathtaking show I'm not trying to miss. The vast majority of the episodes are very exciting and quite tense, and the acting is pretty good even though I miss Robert Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I admit that I prefer older episodes to newer episodes, and it's a bit of a shame that the program is now downstream because I thought it was easier to watch when it was 8:00. Still, why do I like Bill, it's not just because it's breathtaking, but at the end of the end it will make another episode unbreakable. It's true that it's more melodramatic than it was, but I really like this program as a program that does not try to take too much of myself. 8/10 Bethany Cox
