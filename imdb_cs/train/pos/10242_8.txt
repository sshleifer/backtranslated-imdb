I saw this when a video first appeared, my little sister gave it as a gift, and at that time I was about 12 years old ... What I dream of is the lack of a middle film conflict that has so many films where the main characters they are cowardly mad at each other, because when the time comes to explain, they simply do not say one thing that you're shouting on the screen that would make sense for the whole agreement that someone with a reasonable intellect would know to say. That's what I like most in the movie. I think the main characters do not mean what they are in the middle of the way ... they do not wander and do not match, they just like the more the movie goes on. <br /> <br /> These two children join together and although they seem to be initially from the opposite sides of the track, they are not so different. Loui is actually just a middle-class kid who needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family, and Cecelia was the top-class kid who just needed to prove to her family that she existed, and they would have missed her if she was gone . Anyway, I've seen this movie on Hulu and had to watch it again ... of course it's a hole in the hole if you analyze the script and no, Woog and Dweeb should not eat ready-made dogs because they would actually be herbivores. br /> <br /> Now that it's lost from the movie, it's an unexpected scariness. Small children under the age of 5 would probably scare scenes with Dr. Screweyesem. And adding it to the middle of the movie (even if it's obvious in the first scene it's going to be watching) is too sudden ... it should be a look at making the movie earlier in the movie, to show that it it is not scary without dinosaurs. I think there was no real danger for the first half of the film, so it lacks a bit of continuity when it appears in the second half. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Taking into account the target audience, who can surely overlook thought-blowing animation and dialogue questions ... I think I will pass on these factors and just look forward to the story. It's a great movie for a kid and it holds in your mind ... it makes you think a bit about how you treat people and that should be again every ten years I think.
