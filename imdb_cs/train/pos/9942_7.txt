A good Korean film not only about Taekwondo but about how good it is as a warrior's way of fighting can not defeat a taekwondo guy in his sport because there are rules as well as life and school and this movie has subtleties of that notion. <br /> <br /> The martial arts in the movie are not so good, but they are nice and enjoyable. Friends who achieve something they once mocked become stronger through mind and heart. This film is not meant to be taken too seriously because it has a pile but also carries a message. Good movie again from Korea.
