This is one of my favorite films of all time. I read a book and liked it, but this movie is spreading over everything the book has made famous. Acting is fantastic, especially from Jon Voight who plays sir, a very bad figure. This movie has a certain way of telling that will keep you in the whole context, until the end, when everything is brought together for a great ending. I also like the way this is directed, between Stanley and Stanley's ancestral stories. The story was written by Louis Sachar, yes, but it seems that this story is shot for the film and Andrew Davis is doing a great job driving him. I certainly recommend it to anyone who has good movies.
