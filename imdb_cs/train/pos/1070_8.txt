Jessica Alba is Max and Valerie Rae Miller is the original Cindy shining in this action and atmospheric series. Surprisingly politically incorrect. Quality varies considerably from episode to episode, but generally the standard is high, and when it's not, Jessica always looks at it. Valerie's urban jivetalking afro-american is occationally almost pulling dark angel into the situational area.
