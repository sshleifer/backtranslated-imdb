Despite the fact that he has a low key in this country and his apparent overlook in other countries (rating "R" in states could not - honestly, just because HBC uses the word C!), It is indeed a good thing. Sentimentality occasionally threatens to suffocate, but it is overcome by playing both. <br /> <br /> It's easy to make a pay just because you play physical or mental critics (Daniel Day-Lewis, Geoffrey Rush, Dustin Hoffman, etc.) And Helena Bonham-Carter may not catch the physical degradation of the MND but her vocal stretching and the merciless emotional disk balance out completely. In fact, almost all of her performance is carried through her eyes (and what eyes!). This is an intelligent turn from an actress who quickly opens her reputation for English roses and acts as a character of a position. The awards must certainly be watched, although not, unfortunately, for this excellent performance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Here, however, he fulfills his next performance and plays on the grip of a suicidal, unstable, ultimately kind guy with a softness he has not always displayed, showing intelligence and depth. In short, we believe him as well as we could not believe him as Frankenstein, as a priest in "The Proposition," as a lawyer in "The Gingerbread Man", even as Andrew in 'Peter's Friends'. This is certainly his best performance yet - so why could not he produce the goods much earlier? As a movie it looks more like a TV show and without its stars it probably will not do much. But it was a pleasure to see the couple doing their socks like that and I expect them impatiently (though not "Love's Labor Lost" ...). 8 out of 10, but Branagh and HBC get 10 out of 10.
