I liked the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality that they had a strong animal at their center. The gorilla looks great and the eyes are especially lively. It's even a little frightening and the kids should be slightly scared without going over the top. Rene Russo plays her role as a beautiful woman. Typically, these types of Hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create straw thieves, but the only opponent is the gorilla. It's an interesting look at how close animals are to humans, how they feel the same emotions we do, and how we really can not treat them like humans because they are not. There are not many films in this area, and it is worth seeing if you want to think of a human-animal similarity.
