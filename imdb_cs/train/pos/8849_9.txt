Brothers Hanson - Andy (apparently doing his act together) and Hank (obviously not having their act together) need money. Andy comes up with a scheme to get some dough that will have consequences for the entire Hanson family. The film adds. This is a layered, full-fledged roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it does. Like a crime drama / thriller I'd like to compare with 'No Country For Old Men'. While both films have enough storytelling and excitement of nature, "Devil" is rather a thriller because of the fast pace. "No Country" is a cooler and paler film that you can really admire while "Devil" is a bit more enjoyable. There is certainly less violence in the "devil" than "no country". Also, acting is taking place. Ethan Hawke, sometimes wooden in the past, brings nerves, sweating and deer in the spotlight - the besieged Hanka. Philip Seymour Hoffman, like Andy, has the toughest scenes of the movie and quickly becomes an actor who you think he can do. The film is not really bad. He jumps back and forth without being confused. Spiral events are out of control, but the film never does - writing (from Kelly Masterson's first timer), directing (veteran Sidney Lumet) and editing stay as tight as a drum. In many categories, it's a Calibration Award, although possible films such as "The Departed" and "No Country" squeezed this film out of focus. If you like it, you will like it.
