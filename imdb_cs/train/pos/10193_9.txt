This review is dedicated to later Keith Moon and John Entwistl. <br /> <br /> Original drum and bass. There seems to be very little. is more than it allows to have, now-and-days it's a very different kind of Who together, parody, shadow their (much) better years. To be fair, none of them has ever been able to prove anything to anyone, to have their respect and overtime. <br /> <br /> This concert recording for me is one of their best. To empower audiences around 400,000 plus a strong crowed requires skills, charisma, joke and plenty of bloody good music. We all know about other acts on the bill, the door (their last sometime a week before Jim Morrison died), Moody Blues, Hendrix, Taste, Free and many others. The fact that whoever was there was Who who came most to see. This show was one year after the Big Hippie Fest in the 1960s; Woodstock. The movie and the recording came out, so he once had the biggest job, Tommy. The still hungry crowd wanted the taste to experience its own unique event so that Grove and Love could be convinced that this performance was their own. To do this, you needed the best of what Rock 'n Roll had to throw on the hungry crowd. <br /> <br /> Two hours in the morning at the end of August 1970, M.C. "Ladies and Gentlemen, Little Rock 'n Roll band from Shepherds Bush in London," OO ". <br /> <br /> John Entwistle's tennis suit is made of black leather, the front is the outer human skeleton from the neck to the heel , Roger dressed in the traditional stage of long haircuts and long flowing hair, Keith in a white shirt and jeans, while Pete had a white cosmetic suit and Doc Martins that he advised to wear. <br /> <br /> Who has never stopped his the rise of High Energy Rock for more than two hours, performed with their biggest songs like Young Man Blues, shaken all over the world and then as a queue, Keith baiting "Silent, It's a Bloody Opera" with Tommy, Rock's Opera. That's what they came to hear, and who did not fail, right into the overture and never got into the air until the last message "Tommy can you hear me?" Amazing. , which was the last of its kind anywhere in the world, was a fantastic kinematic history. <br /> <br /> English DVDs appear only in the English / Linear PCM Stereo soundtrack as well as in the US, I think you can get it at least with 5.1, "Check local print details?" to do it well. <br /> <br /> The duration of the DVD is 85 minutes without additional bonuses, which is disappointing. Yes, for some piece of rock and festival history, this DVD sends you a nostalgic journey down the memory track when you hit the game for some of the best concerts Who, as it should be, Live, Raw and on your face! <br /> <br /> I would put this DVD ten if it was not for lack of 5.1, and some accessories would be nice. Thanks to Roger, Pete, John and Keith.
