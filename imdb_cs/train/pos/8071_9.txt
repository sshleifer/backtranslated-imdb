This film deals with the Irish rebellion of the 1920s and, more specifically, with one man after informing a friend of the head and consequent successes. While watching the movie, I had the feeling that you could make a screenplay and just some minor updates, repeat it, and it would unfortunately still make sense of the current events. But the remake would not be that good. The spectacular performance of Victor McLaglen (for which he earned the Oscar) and a subtle cast cast that includes most, if not all, of the brothel actors in Hollywood at the time, most of them recognizable character actors either founded at that time or just started. A very good movie that's worth watching. Highly recommended.
