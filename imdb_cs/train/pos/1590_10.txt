I just started watching the TV series "What I Like about You" and I have to say that it's a pleasure to watch. I always like to see new shows that are doing well when we look at a lot of shows before they really feel. I watched Amanda Bynes from "everything" that she is a really funny girl, which is the best in her comedy is that it's so natural and what I mean, it's something that somebody could say the best friend did not try. I recently started watching the show and fell in love. Right now I watch re-runs, but I'm looking forward to the next season. All the characters in the show give a whole story. It's nice to see some old face from other shows I've enjoyed in the past like Jennie Garth of "90210", Leslie Grossman of "Popular" and Wesley Jonathan of "City Guys". The new character is also very talented, Nick Zano has the charm that loves him, even though he's doing something wrong at Holly (Bynes). Overall, this show has the right ingredients to be successful, I look forward to seeing it.
