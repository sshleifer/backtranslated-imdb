This film was one of my children's favorites, and I must say that, unlike some other films I liked at the time, the Baghdad thief was holding me up when I grew up. It's not just a movie that kids can enjoy, but they can also watch and enjoy the adults. The only drawback is that one can not see the bad effects (as compared to today's impacts) as if you were a child. I did not forget any of these effects, of course, it was about ten years ago that I saw this movie when I was eleven years old. Who then follows the effects? One only looks for good stories and fun, and that's exactly what this movie offers. In my opinion, this film is one of the first great adventures of the 20th century. I was thinking that Indiana Jones is quite similar to this movie. There is comedy, romance and adventure in one, creating a wonderful blend that captures you from beginning to end and although the movie is old and the music and style of movies is obviously not modern, it is successful in being dusty and old. All this is due to the great story, good direction and good performances of actors. Sabu (as Abu) and Conrad Veidt (like Jaffar) perform in this department and provide the comedy and cool elements of the film for the most part. A great movie and though "oldie", surely "golden". I hope somebody has the brains and courage to have this movie ever released on DVD. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
