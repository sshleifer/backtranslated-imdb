This is one of the best serials that resides with Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (or Biohazard: Last Escape) The game has a very good story in which you play as Claire Redfield in search of her brother Chris Redfield Which you probably know from the original Resident Evil ) It's as scary as Resident Evil and contains much more cutscenes. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** from ***** Stars (Comparison based on other video games)
