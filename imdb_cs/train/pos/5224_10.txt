Ayone, wondering how filthy this film is or whether she has no plot, had to look for "Jean de Florrette." HI! this film was filmed as a random comic act, and in no way involves a conspiracy of any shape or shape. I would remind them that if you win the crap from this movie, it seems they are missing. This movie is obvious to people who do not appreciate the so-called "American humor," which seems to me only a pile of sad stupidity. An important point is that everyone has an opinion and you should be a little more recognizable that some people's sense of humor may not be in line with your own before shooting your mouth.
