I bought the video somewhat late in my collection and probably would save a lot of money if I bought it earlier. On the nights of "Cosmo's Moon" he always replaces something else. Cher and Olympia definitely deserve their prizes, but it's a truly flawless set of excellent scenarios. What? Do not know what "Mesiac Cosmo" is?
