10/10 for this movie. <br /> <br /> I am a British Indian doctor, currently in India. the word Beckham put me down because I'm a desperate fan of Liverpool and I personally think Owen is really cool. Since Liverpool and Man Utd are rivals, I was sure the film would not look. But then I was in Delhi to meet some friends and I had an early morning, so I thought, "what the hell, let's watch this movie for a while," because it was a late night show What I was crazy I think I'm using Beckham's name, it was to draw the audience's attractiveness (which in my case was a backup !!!), but then I really can not think of a better title for the film. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And Nagra, Knightley (Rhino-Myers) and Rhys-Myers have done a great job.If you hate football, you do not like Manchester United (or England), then it's DEFINITIVE for you. 29 years old, a professional psychiatrist, but a child in his heart This movie tapped "Star Wars" from my first place <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, there is not much commentary on this movie by Indian brothers like me, why? <br /> <br /> 10/10 for this movie.
