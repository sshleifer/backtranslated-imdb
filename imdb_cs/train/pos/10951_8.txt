Big S is not playing taboo and does not require a program like Mencia or Chapelle (though I like it). It is clear in subtle, almost subliminal remarks. Her show does not change the world, nor does it intend. But along with crazy Brian Posehn and former boyfriend of Paget Brewster Jay Johnston about "The Glory of Mrs. Show," it's one big show with a desire to destroy! My party was thoroughly destroyed by the first episode. Look, I love that woman, and she likes her friend, Jimmy Kimmel, just adding lines and letting the audience run with him. The best kind of comedy around. Spoofing anything and someone like "Mary Poppins" in the second episode when singing on fake birds for quick hitting comments on society and an existential age college. This is highly recommended, but only to those who still have funny bones (and did not lose it in their last lippo-suction treatment or boobs).
