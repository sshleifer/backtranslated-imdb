In the first episode of Friends, which appeared on September 22, 1994, "One Where Monica Receives a Roommate" is a song playing as Rachel sits in the window at the end of the show, the line that plays them: "If you ever need to hold" .... Does anyone know the singer or song title? It sounds like a great song ... I'd like to get a copy. Thank you for your help. I'm looking for an album / cd to buy it. <br /> <br /> I have shows that are available for purchase and enjoy this show over and over again. It seemed plausible ... thanks for the hours of fun you've provided over the years.
