It is crying that the beaches have never been. Just like I wanted to love Beaches, it always seemed too fast for me to "feel" (its soundtrack is one of my favorite albums). Stella, on the other hand, moves slower (and occasionally too slow) pace, and although it is somewhat manipulative in her tears, the story of a self-sacrificial mother, it works because Bette and the rest of her cast are in great performance. 10/10
