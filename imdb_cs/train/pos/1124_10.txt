I agree with all the awards, I passed through the tissue watching this film. She had dirty authenticity and rang truthfully. <br /> <br /> The question that I'm going to highlight is the current sensitivity to the treatment of animals. I had very difficult moments with the beginning of defeating sheep and goats, and dying deer with a throbbing neck and collecting blood because his life was draining was hideous. This is the age of "no animals were injured in making this movement." Iphigenia was created in the late 1970s before the arrival of a computer simulation. Was it possible to attack these animal deaths? Or were these animals slaughtered for art?
