Nora is the mother of two children who still lived the life of a young artist in the 1970s, as well as her friends, a group of writers, singers and actors. The philosophy of "free love" is not entirely out of the system? and Nora did not expect her to fall in love, especially with a drug addict. Hazlehurst won her first two AFI prizes in four years for a stunning conception of Nora, who makes sure that she does the right thing for her children but at the same time falls in love with hatred Javo (Friels). Garner? who would later costar in movies such as love and other disasters and STRANGE PLANET? is well occupied as a pre-puberty daughter Nora and Caton (perhaps prepared for her role as host of the HOT PROPERTY lifestyle program in 2000) appears to be a bearded painter. Cameron's early efforts are the winner; he continued to make the award-winning miniseries of my brother JACK among his later projects. But it's an amazing delivery of Hazlehurst, which brings to life an intelligent, search scenario based on the award-winning novel, Helen Garner.
