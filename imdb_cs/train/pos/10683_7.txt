It's a better than average silent movie and it's still worth seeing if you're a fan of silence. However, if you are not a fan of this genre, I suggest you try several more movies before watching this genre. That's because the plot looks pretty old-fashioned and hard to believe places. Still, it's still a good movie and kept my interest. Pretty lady unfortunately joined the wrong man and fled to marry him. The film begins five years later when he realizes he is a brutal thief. In spite of that, she tries to make the best use of her and does not worry about how good a life was before the asshole got into it. However, the rent is due and there is no money, so the lady is forced to look for a job. She becomes a personalized seamstress for a wealthy lady whose husband is trying to trade. Unfortunately, a lady who tried to connect a potential client with a party can not do this, and the seamstress will be careful to become a man. Well, like Cinderella, it cleanses well and the man is furious with her! What to do now - because she is really married and the new boy wants to marry her! Take a look at the movie yourself and see how it is solved. She did not like to deal with her husband, because it seemed very predictable and clich√©. However, once he was out of the way, I admire how the film NEVER gives up the final number and leaves a movie with several free ends. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very good movie that's worth seeing, but it's definitely not great.
