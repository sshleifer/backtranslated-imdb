As previously documented, Rockstar's real stars: INXS - and really a sequel to Rockstar: Supernova - are Paul Mirkovich, Rafael Moreira, Jim McGorman, Nate Morton and Sasha Krivtsov. I do not know who they are? They are the awesome, narrow Rock House "House Band", whose musical nice and talented music made it more than a sad American Idol clone. Do you remember the "strings" in the evening? It was musical precision and perfection whenever I saw it. Suzie McNeil's epic renditions of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody, Ty Taylor's unforgettable cover "You Can not Always Get ...", JD Fortune sings "Suspicious Minds." The common denominator is the amazing House Band. Just as INXS was in their main direction, they are sadly shadow of their former self, though JD's live performance has somewhat breathed new life into their music, this show is all about HB. <br /> <br /> Note to producers: The third season (if we're blessed to make it happen) should be Rockstar: House Band. Get the boys to a good singer and they're going.
