Here is one family that looks forward to ... even those who think they are too old for fairy tales. Shelley Duvall was surprised by this unique, imaginative look at almost all popular childhood fairy tales. Scenarios offer new twists and turns on the ancient beauties that we have grown up and contain a bunch of stars in each episode. "Cinderella" is no exception to the Duvall standard, and in my opinion it's one of the five best series, highlighted by Jennifer Beals (you remember "Flashdance" - and she's still in Hollywood where she is shooting a movie today). the title role, Jean Stapleton as a fairy tale with a Southern accent, and Eve Arden as the embodiment of a perverse stepmother. Edie McClurg ("Ferris Bueller's Day Off") and Jane Alden make a merry duo as a helper. Matthew Broderick is Prince Henry. You will all keep coming back for this!
