This film is one of the fastest black and white films of this era in the early 1930s before the Hoyts Law was applied. It's a story of a young beautiful woman who moves to New York and makes her way to the top of the store by using her body as a tool to get there. Barbara Stanwyck plays young and beautiful Lily Powers who really does a lot of work with her performance. Lily moves to New York and comes into the business area with her bedtime with all men. Stanwyck has an excellent performance as a strong woman who uses men unilaterally, hardly any emotions to them as if they were pawns. Lily Powers is a woman who does not mean love, just strength and money. I thought this movie is a bit different than the other movies I've seen, because there's hardly any background music I hear. I think this is only because people who lived in the sound and dialogue between the people of the film first introduced themselves. Several times the music is heard at the beginning as it shows us how to get into the chain. Shooting and various scenes were fantastic! The director of this film has done all the right angles and all the good tricks, so this movie is full of realism. This movie was a great movie together. The final movie was not as good as it should be, but it did not destroy it. Baby Face had slow-moving scenes throughout the movie, and perhaps a few predictable parts like, who will sleep with another. But it's a nice movie that can be watched more than once and suggested to some people and friends.
