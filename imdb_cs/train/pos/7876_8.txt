I did not like Chandni Bar from the same director. I have not seen his other movies. They came and left. But Page-3 is nicely made. It seems real. Like Satya of RGV. <br /> <br /> The mental illness of the so-called High Society is a summary of the film. At the heart of all the illnesses it is difficult to lead the normal life that the protagonist Konkana Sen does. A serious film that is not watching with children or waiting for wives. Page 3 of newspapers is the usual venue for reporting activities that take place in rich parties and elite who do far more dirt than what is recorded. How this page-3 is also a business prospect is displayed in the movie. Event management companies are paid to organize parties and make rich but famous people known overnight by clicking on photos with celebrities invited to the party. Western culture has reached the deep Mumabi company deeply. The film shows it courageously, without retention. <br /> <br /> Madhur Bhandarkar begins a new way from here.
