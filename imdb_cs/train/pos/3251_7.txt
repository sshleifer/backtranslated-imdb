Still another remake of "Fistful of Dollars," Sergio Leone is a remake of Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" (proposed in the novel "Red Harvest"). This is strictly B-film; it's rather nice. the direction is sharp, it is full of verve, limiting its "direct-to-video" photographs well manipulated. The weakness of the film is in a catastrophic decision to marry a "fistful" / 'yojimbo' plot on Leone's 'Once Upon a Time on the West' plot. Although Leone has managed both Fistful and West, his motivation behind these two of the films could no longer be different: "Eastwood" is a border social road with a soft place for broken families, Chales Bronson is obsessed with his own farewell family and obsessed with vengeance, and these two characters should not do anything together. To be able to put them together, "Gun Crazy" must tame your fence and complicate it until we lose what the story actually follows. But this is a B-movie, filled with act and stupidity, fun at this level, do not expect more.
