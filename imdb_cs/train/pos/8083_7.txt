If you've read the books, forget the characters built by Tolkien in your head. Representation of hobbies, dwarves, etc. She had a "disney" treatment. Dark riders are excellent and as I have always imagined from books. <br /> <br /> Cinematically this is an excellent movie that blends animated animation and animation and produces amazing effects for the year. I would just like to get him (Bakshi) the money to finish his epic. <br /> <br /> It is worth to have a video as it will be a little after the Lord of the Rings in 2001 !!
