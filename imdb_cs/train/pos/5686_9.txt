Wonderland SPOILERS * July 1, 1981: Five people, Ron Launius (Josh Lucas), Susan Launius (Christina Applegate), Billy Deverell (Tim Blake Nelson), Barbara Richardson (Natasha Gregson Wagner) Joy Miller (Janeane Garofalo) as they sleep and brutally hit the head with steel pipes in the house at 8763 Wonderland Avenue, Laurel Canyon, LA. Only Susan will survive. Main Suspect: John Holmes (Val Kilmer), former porn king, owner of a 30 cm long dick and now hopeless addict. <br /> <br /> Two investigators, Luis (Frankie G.) and Sam Nico (Ted Levine), are investigating the case and trying to confuse him with a witness who claims he knew John was at least involved in the murder of David Lind (Dylan McDermott), boyfriend Barbara, trying to get a witness from Dawn Schiller (19) Holmes Holmes and Susan, who unfortunately remembers nothing more than night shadows her husband's head was destroyed and almost the same fate suffered and the name Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian), the major drug king (who is always around ladies like Barbie (Paris Hilton)), appears as a suspect planner of the Wonderland Massacre. But what happened that night? And could Sharon (Lisa Kudrow), wife of John, know about it? "Wonderland" is a learned, intense thriller, a desperate love story and a story of the sad decline of man in one; there is a clever use of the "Rashomon" technique (we see the events of this fateful day and night of David, John, Dawnu, Susan (albeit very briefly) and Sharon), a beautiful direction and great scenario, but it is predominantly convincing for performance, Kilmer, who return to their central scene with his hopeless, harrowing, sometimes childish Holmes, Lucas, whose Launius is strangely tempting, Kudrow's strong Sharon, and Bosworth's innocent Dawn. <br /> <br /> Wonderland: 9/10.
