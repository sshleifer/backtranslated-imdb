The year 1933 seems to be a great year for satire (for example, "Duck Soup"), and it fits well, even though it is an obsession with a bridge bridge. The tone is like a humorous work by The New Yorker because the movie starts with the "Goings On About Town" page of this magazine. The only thing is odd. A few years later, William Powell and Myrna Loy would be perfect. After 1934, however, you would not have had such a sophisticated way of adultery, the young and beautiful Loretta Young in some sloping and salty suits, or a group of prostitutes listening to the bridge competition on the radio. Even if you do not know anything about the bridge, you might want to look at the rare example of Hollywood satire.
