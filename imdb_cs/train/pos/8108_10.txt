I have, "What to Come" on D.V.D. and it's very clear when compared to your version of VHS. The sound is fair, but it can sometimes be difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> I liked the film so much that I was looking for a copy of the book and found it. He gave details of why some things happened. The best things about the movie are small things I did not notice first. Like John Cabal, he plays with a party toy as if he was a diving bomber dated to the naval force by naming the Battleship "Dinosuar". Ships sunk by air force, undeclared enemy attack on planes. Fly flying wing planes. Strong roles for women throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> There is more, look at the movie to enjoy it.
