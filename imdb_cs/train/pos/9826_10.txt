This low-budget erotic thriller, which has some good points but much worse. The story revolves around a female lawyer who tries to clean up her lover who is accused of murdering her wife. Being a film with a delicate core that requires a secret club to be secret and sex with potential suspects. As plots go for this type of genre, not bad. The screenplay is fine, and the story gives enough sense to someone who is looking at 2 o'clock in the morning not to notice too many holes. But everything else in the movie looks cheap. The lead actors are not that bad, but most of them are incredibly bad (one girl looks drunk and / or tall). Cinematography is poorly lit and everything looks grainy and ugly. The sound is so terrible that you hardly hear what people say. The worst thing in this movie is why you're watching it - sex. The reason people are following these things is for hot sex scenes featuring really hot girls in the Red Shoe Diary. Sexual scenes are not hot, they are dirty, shot in this porn style, where everything is only a master shot of two people. The woman also seems to be a haven of pornography. I'm not trying to be rough or here, but they all have breast implants and a burnt / weathered look. Even the title, Deviant Obsession, sounds like Hardcore. Not that I have nothing against porn - in fact, I like it. But I want my soft core and my hard core separate. What happened to actresses like Shannon Tweed, Jacqueline Lovell, Shannon Whirry and Kim Dawson? Women who could act and who could wake you up? And what happened to B erotic thrillers such as Body Chemistry, Nighteyes, and even Stripped to Kill. Sure, none of those where the works are doing, but at least they felt like movies. In addition, they pushed the envelope and went through Hollywood's relatively violent attitude to sex, sexual obsession and perversion. Now they make hard-core movies without hard-core sex.
