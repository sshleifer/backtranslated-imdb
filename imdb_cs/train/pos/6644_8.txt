After many years of waiting, Anne Rivers Siddons' 1979 "The House Next Door" was finally filmed. The result is a bit of a novel, which is understandable in the first story of the trilogy, if it is unsatisfactory, because it is a television film that is absorbed and in fact very good, just not as big as a book, Royal favorites and one of my own. <br /> <br /> With more time and less limitations like the theatrical release, all the wealth inherent in the original three-part story of a terrible ultramodern house could be explored and especially the peak revelation near the end itself. The whole actor, however, thinks about hopeless malice. There are some unnecessary cheap shocks, but the growing atmosphere of fear is well developed. One of the most disturbing scenes is actually the abstract painting of a house by a neighboring amateur artist who is trying to show his corruption on the canvas. Make sure you read a great novel.
