This is perhaps the best short criminal track I've ever seen. Amanda Burton, whose character moves from spooky to sweet to sad to sad, and especially sometimes ... makes an amazing work balancing the feelings of Rachels / Carlas and the rising pain of someone who has lost a child is so credible that it it feels more like a real life story than a drama. Other actors are of course big, which is usually in British television / film. The end that can not be dealt is fantastic mainly because you do not really have one ... (you get what I think when you see it) It's good to buy and see again and if you do not touch yourself, you're the only person with cold heart.
