Most of the movies about New Orleans are ridiculously bad and ridiculously inaccurate (see "The Savage Bees"?) But I make an exception for "Tightrope", which is almost right. <br /> <br /> Here is the one that inevitably bad. The accents are not too bad (yes, the "yat" angle is much more than the Brooklynes than the South), the 1950's is displayed as it is, no mandatory "touring" shots, and understands a good drama without trying to " southern ". <br /> <br /> One of the few movies that run this city and a good movie that boots.
