Simply, one of the most visited movies I've ever seen. It is a parody of crime - a life, a parody of everything that Chicago represents in 1930. - There is no need to underestimate this film because the rating is below 5. Her opinion on matter and the meat is hypnotized. Whoever chooses to watch - he will regret who decides not to watch - will be more sorry.
