Review on September 12, 2006 2nd screening at Paramount 1 at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film was World Premiered the day before in the Elgin Theater VISA. <br /> <br /> The basic plot involves Morgan Freeman playing once a popular actor who is on the slope of his career and who is on the roles that may be beneath him but who still makes a positive attitude knowing he has to pay the rent etc .. Downward is indicated by his long time between the role of the previous films in bargaining DVD basses and his being a chauffeur by not too much self-belief that a production assistant will sink Freeman into the local community market where he will be researching the role of a supermarket manager. He soon finds out that the real-life market is run by a "10 or less" force pliers played by Paz Vega. When Freeman's ride never returns, and Vega needs help in preparing for the interview, circumstances cause them to get together in the city to get Freeman back home and get Vega a job that would make her move to a more gradual mobile career. <br /> <br /> While the movie was pleasant, it seemed to him that it was still a sketch or piece of work. There were two widespread musical sequences (One with Vega and Freeman, who taught each other's children's songs in a car that literally played as a Paul Simone music video) that felt like filling to bring time, and even then the movie was only about 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's a good thing Morgan Freeman is equally popular because it's without him that it's too little. Sure it was fun in parts and Paz Vega is also a pleasure, but it was not enough to say it's a complete movie. They lost me when Morgan Freeman started talking about stopping the car to ask for directions, and Paz Vega said she would never do it. Who ever heard of a guy who would like to ask for directions and the woman said no !? In the real world, it's exactly the opposite. <br /> <br /> Make sure you stay on credit. Morgan Freeman's Target Store lecture on how to move through sales is just fun! Soon, Freeman's driver insisted that Freeman's voice on "tape books" was also quite funny. Director / writer Brad Silberling and actress Paz Vega were there after a short Q & A screening. Silberling replied to one question that the script was not written specifically for Morgan Freeman, and that as soon as Freeman took over the role, he changed very little of what was there. It's really a compliment for Silberling, and how Freeman can just slip into the role and feels he feels just like him who was born to play.
