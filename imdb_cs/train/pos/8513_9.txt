I always had the philosophy that every human being has a different taste, I found this movie amazing, and I think every university student can agree with me. Regardless of this, there is no "plot film," his real boys and some "problems" they face. I found the movie cheerful (especially the parts that played practical jokes on each other). Simply put, if you are at the same "wavelength" as these people, you will find this movie amazing. I do not think this is going to win any Golden Globes or Oscar, or that people in this movie will become future Hollywood stars, but their "classical culture" among young people who could relate to their experience. For me, the most protruding is Hans: a Scandinavian guy who, according to him, "is not a seeker," but receives all (or some) chickens. "Little people" also play a big role in the film, especially when they are drunk. If I continue, I can provide a spoiler and I do not want to do it, just go and get a movie and you will not regret it. I give it 8/10
