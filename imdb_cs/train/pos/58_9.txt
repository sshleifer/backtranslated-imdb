I caught the back end of this movie channel surf over cable film channels and was so interested that I was looking for another show. I really did not know what to expect after reading the program summary, but I came from this film, which was quite anxious and concerned. I also like it as an adult who attended high school in the 1980s, which is a bit better look at what our children must struggle with these days. The fact that you do not see shooting just adds a chillness conspiracy. Seeing both a child and an adult fighting to understand and cope with pointless shooting was sometimes overwhelming. And I admit that I had passed through a few tears. Overall, not a movie I'd be looking for, but I'm sure I'm glad I saw it.
