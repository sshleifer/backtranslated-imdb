After seeing Dick Tracy in a $ 6.99 basket in the Future Shop, I decided to give it up without prior knowledge and be a big fan of Mafia and Crime. I was very surprised to see a very entertaining, intelligent, funny movie with solid performances. The film moves well, of course, it has another solid performance from Warren Beatty, but the real ideas of the film are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was happy to find out that Pacino was nominated for his performance as a top gangster who was trying to take down the city. Madonna was great as a girl in distress, really impressed and raised my depth. If you go with the attitude to want to watch entertainment, a clever movie with a great actor and a solid script then Dick Tracy will try. I think you will not be disappointed. And watch the cameras by Paul Sorvin, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman.
