As dr. Alan Feinstone, Corbin Bernsen transforms "The Dentist" into an amazingly unsatisfactory performance. With his obsessive compulsive tendencies at high speed, the IRS chases him and a very suspicious acting woman; Dr. Alan Feinstone loses healthier reason every day. <br /> <br /> When the doctor really realizes that his wife has a relationship with a local baby boy, there are a number of events that lead to torture, murder, ants and total chaos! "Dentist" is a solid movie! Bernsen made the character of dr. Feinston thoughtful and hateful at the same time. Even if it is entirely from his pumpkin, the audience will feel sympathy with him. The fact that my friends ..... is a damn good performer. <br /> <br /> A nice solid cast of supporting actors closes this jewel of the film. Outstanding direction, good murder and gore, and effective stimulation will make you entertained throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
