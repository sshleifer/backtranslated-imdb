After watching the Next Action Star TV series, I was glad to see the winner's movie right now. I was useless of such a show of new talent, but I was pleasantly surprised and excited. Billy Zane, of course, was his custom, but Corinne and Sean stood side by side. It was also nice to see Jared and Jeanne (also from the competition) in their roles. Sean's character, not Billy, is hunted, and his frustration in finding new rules in the game is playable. Corinne walks well between her character, who likes Sean and is only in her money. I loved playing the game until the last second. And then on! It's not a great movie but a fun movie and a great show for the two people who first got out of the gate.
