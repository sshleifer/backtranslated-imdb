In the middle of the city and outside of Detroit, this comedy was considered to be an amazing new comedy duo. "Noriyuki Pat Morita" is a very funny man who becomes a police officer from Japan on his way to an industrial secret thief who stole a "type" supermotor type supercharger, reluctantly going to the United States to follow a thief after being ordered its commander. Pat's character collides with 'Jay Lena', 'quick talk', but up to a Detroit businessman. As they travel along the paths, Honorable "Journeys" of Japan meet the old Detroit police investigation agency "Ways". The two are slowing down for the first time and first set off on the other side, but then they develop a rhythm that turns into an explosive, two-tier team of the power plant that solves the case cold. After fighting with the crime boss for the stolen "equiptment" and closing the briefcase, these two go from scattering each other to being friends and working together. A little worse for wear and needing an extended vacation for everything, they can come to a winning conclusion. 9. Lewis's direction makes this almost perfect comedy. Entertainment for all ages. I recommend it highly. (***)
