It is difficult to evaluate this or another comparable early-era movie in the sense that one could use for a regular film commentary. Sometimes it's almost desperate, because many silent-era filmmakers are testing their wings for sound, they are sure to be ashamed to be aside (as some have become), Rin-Tin-Tin. but it was perfectly natural. In such a venerable unrelated sequence, some were definitely out of the question. John Barrymore's soliloquy from Richard II. It is a moment worth preserving. All in all, only those with previous training radiated confidence. However, it is mostly fun and the necessity of "movie fans" who are particularly interested in a quiet and healthy transition
