This show succeeds because it appeals to all adults, no matter where they are in their relationship. As a person who has married for 26 years, I feel the character of Patrick Warburton: he loves his wife, but he expects to know it. I also have its monotone delivery; never too excited or too low. Nice character set. It will be a nice addition to the set on Monday night. <br /> <br /> I do not know how David Spade will be in his role. He enjoys the best in small doses. It seems to me that she is a little old that she was still standing for women. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the pilot and I look forward to the development of this series.
