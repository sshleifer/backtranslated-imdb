James Dickey is a beautifully descriptive author. When one reads a "Deliverance", one is instantly relocated to the lush deep forests. When we look at the film version of John Boorman's book, one realizes how accurately the essence of the book is. The camera is as descriptive as the narrative. The characters are fully realized and the fantasies are fantastic. I first saw this film in 1992, after the first school year. I was at a stage when I watched films that were released within a few years of my birth in 1973, including Patton, Papillon and All President's Men; fine films, all of them. This was easily a group class. It says a lot.
