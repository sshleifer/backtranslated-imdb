An ancient sailor is really a classic piece of work because the original poem was / is. The context / setting with the old sailor himself is fine, clear and without pretense. The artistic work accompanying the reading of the poem perfectly corresponds to the time / period of the meeting and the work itself, bringing the audience to a period of constant, yet moving accompaniment, using the excellent strategies of constant movement that he voluntarily conquered. producers of the era before MTV and much less obvious in contemporary works. (MTV has brought a static, often irrelevant, slides into television and video, from the theme to the subject without moving forward and without a clear relationship to the subject or story.) The voice, intonation, and readability of Redgrave brings this wonderful poem with all its fear, disputes and pains. Moreover, the smooth motion of the video highlights the cadence and occasional monotone (in this case the positive mood under the theme of the story itself) about the author's interpretation of the sad and haunting story of the ancient sailor. It is the necessity of any love of classical poetry, the sea, the storyline that almost rotates the truth and the story that has left a lasting impact on our world and culture. Who does not understand the meaning of "albatross"? or the term "water, water everywhere and not drink?" Great experience. Thank you, Mr. DaSilv, for bringing us to life, never forgotten.
