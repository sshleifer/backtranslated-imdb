Described as the "first family film" by Takashi Miike - probably from people who did not see Zebraman. YOKAI DAISENSO takes things even more towards a friendly family, dilutes the darkness and cynicism to create a fantasy fantasy tale. A young boy is chosen by fate to save the world from monsters and horrors that are mostly unknown to them. The film is obviously a larger budget than anything Miike has done, with a lot of CGI to create a fantastic world populated by odd creatures (YOKAI). Perhaps the lack of extreme content is the result of more nervous investors, but I think it's just about wanting to do something else. He has never been the only pony but is often accused - perhaps that YOKAI is meant to keep these critics silent. Notwithstanding this, it is a great project for Miike to direct his infinite imagination and invention. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Yokai are based on an old series of comics that turned on Japanese folk tales, which certainly influenced Miyazaki (especially SPIRITUAL AWAY). He must remember that Miike has nothing like the budget of Harry Potter's film to work on, so the special effects will not be a trouble-free work in the style of the Hollywood style - some blue screening is particularly obvious. Some of the special effects are great, but with some very well animated creatures (mix CG, stop-motion and puppetry). I think the little sock puppet that follows the hero around much of the movie should * look like it looks really cheap, and it's all fun :) A young boy playing the hero of the movie does a really good job - it's so hard to find pre-teen who really understands the concept of acting, but Ryunsuke Kamiki, 9 years old, is a real talent (I can see that he made voices in the last two films Miyazaki). Chiaki Kuriyama is delicious as the color of the work, although Mai Takahashi made even more impression as the Pixie-noble River Princess - yum yum! Those who are looking for another violent, foul gangster film do not find what they are looking for in YOKAI, but if you're a fan of Miike because of his fantasy and joke, there's plenty of pleasure here. And it has added bonus that you can happily give to what company you have :)
