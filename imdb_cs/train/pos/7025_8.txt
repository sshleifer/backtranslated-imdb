I find it a charming adaptation, very lively and full of fun. Except for a few major mistakes, cast is great. I have to echo some of my previous comments - Chynna Phillips is terribly miscast as a teenager. At age 27, she is too old (and yes, it shows) and lacks the singing "chops" for Broadway-style music. Vanessa Williams is a decent singer, and she is adequate for non-dancers. However, she is not Latina, and her character is definitely. She is also very STRIDENT, which is annoying. The Conrad Birdie Sweet Apple fans are really sparkling - with strange quirks Brigitta Dau and Chiary Zanni. I also enjoyed the performance of Tyne Daly, even though I'm not a fan of her work. Finally, the Shriners dancing is a revolt, especially the three of them in the bar. The film is suitable for the whole family and I highly recommend it.
