In April 1965 CBS broadcast the first of Barbra Streisand's monumental television specials. The show was not just a successful hit, but she also won 5 Emmy Awards. This is one of the most remarkable moments of television in the 1960s and (unfortunately) kind of television special, which is no longer produced. Filled with beautiful songs and spectacular performance from Barbra, this special is a must for every Streisand fan and anyone interested in morning TV.
