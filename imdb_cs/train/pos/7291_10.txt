When you usually watch a short film, you are always worried that the person making the film will try to throw too much into it. This is not the case here. A great story about a young girl who has enough and other world powers who are trying to help make things right. Eric Etebari is doing a great job representing the spirit of twisted justice and helping to tell the complexity of the blurred line right and wrong. <br /> <br /> Both young girls and father give great performances in this wonderful short film, but Eric's performance is definitely a show of theft in this story. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie because it's complexity, performance and a great story.
