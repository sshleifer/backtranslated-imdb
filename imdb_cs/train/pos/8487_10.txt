I remember my mother watching Gung Ho as a child, and I wondered why she would cry in the last few minutes. Of course, I found the whole movie cheerful, especially the manners of characters. It was only after I was much older and I watched again that I realized how far this show was more important. Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe are in their role as reluctant mediators. Keaton no longer stunts my style in real life, and Watanabe adds humor and patos to the mix. I also thought that Patti Yasutake (Umeki) was simply wonderful in her role as comic relief. I think this film is one of the most underestimated films of the 1980s. We can all learn lessons from the merger of American and Japanese laborers in this movie ... sometimes you * can * have * the "best of both worlds." And now I understand why my mother felt the way he did in those final moments. I'd like to have one of those cars.
