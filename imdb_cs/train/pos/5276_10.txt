I joined the IMDb to let people know what a great movie is! It's not often when you come across a movie that moves and is visually cinematic but humble. You have read a plot so I just want to say that you do not look at it because you want to see the clash of cult religious idiot blabber because it's a typical misconception of the people it reads instead just just appreciate and realize that it's the father and son on a path that is becoming more and more oriented through his struggles. Buy it and pass it before the film4 gets to it. It was one of the few films to be nominated for an independent and foreign BAFTA. The beauty is that she can appeal to someone, even if you never see a subtitle or just use the Hollywood formula, just a great story to keep you. The only thing I want to do is make it longer and see what happens
