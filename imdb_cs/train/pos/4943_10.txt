This is film making in the simplest and best of all. <br /> <br /> I had my doubts, because even though Freeman is a great actor, she sometimes gets involved in bad projects; it's not one of those times. It's a small story that lasts for over an hour and fifteen, at a time when we're accustomed to making movies longer and longer and not necessarily better, the director takes a short time to his advantage because the characters are so good at the beginning (fantastic portraits of Freeman and Vega by the way) that a little background of information about them seems real, Morgan is alone, although his name is not mentioned, he has been on the movies for several years because he was saturated with a trade and he was afraid to commit to scriptwriting, and doing research for a figure in Indian film where a dealer / supermarket plays. The story begins by being a drop in a supermarket in a rough neighborhood where she meets a cashier of ten items or less (Vega) and has to go with her cause "production" forgot to pick it up. <br /> <br /> In many ways, it's a road movie, Morgan gives laughter and sadness with his invincible smile and a positive view of everything, showing a successful actor who trained his mind to define everyone he sees in the figure, and Paz (by the way, what an extraordinarily beautiful woman, even more beautiful than Penelope Cruz) brings the vulnerability of a 25-year-old separated woman who works harder than anyone else without getting any credit in the dead end work on the dirty supermarket. It's a talkie, there are plenty of dialogues but the balance between light and fun and serious and sad is well preserved, the characters are so proud that you spend the last 20 minutes begging for more time on the thi screen but strange it's the nature of the story so it was a good call from the director not to give up.
