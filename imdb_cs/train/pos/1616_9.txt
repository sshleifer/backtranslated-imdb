Smashly romantic comedies with intertwined subplots that are beautifully crafted and actors who separate lines with precise comix timings, which is a beautiful look. When Cher is a paperless fiance who asks her to help him calm down with his estranged younger brother, no one can dream of the consequences that follow. Operational symbolism, Catholic church beliefs, love and sinking ... "Moonstruck" is timeless and smooth. It took about 15 minutes before the image rhythm began to kick (this is an early procedure with Grandfather and his dogs in the cemetery, which is a bit rough and the following scene with Cosmo and the older man at the gate that seems to be blunt) but patchwork plot is interwoven with agile skills, and the movie is a wobbly tone and kookie spirit are both infectious. *** 1/2 from ****
