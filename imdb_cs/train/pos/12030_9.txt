hi, im scott (A.K.A woody7739) I love Twisted Desire and I love watching Melissa Joan Hart at t.v because I think she's okay. I am a true fan of the same adolescent witch, so it helped me keep track of it (do not ask). I love the way Nicole plans her parents for a very murderous murder, making sure that someone pulls the trigger and trains on the bottles, so she gets used to fingering her fingerprints (a very well-planned idea) all returning to nicole when she was caught when her old friend arrives and hiding a hidden camera beneath her shirt. I give this film nine out of ten and I put it on the Top 10 MY list. And last but not least, if anyone sees this movie in stores, tell me how I saw it on TV and did not notice it. Goodbye
