Many mysterious stories follow the standard way: murder most dirty, gathering tracks, bullying the possible adventures, sprinkling red fattening, and inevitable exploration between a clever criminal and an even smarter criminal. "Forgotten" leaves the well and gives us complex characters that may or may not commit terrible acts. The fact that we do not have easy answers at the end of the three episodes, and no slick package can make it impossible for some, but for me it was a sign of a smartly crafted story that disturbs and chases the question: What makes the evil guy look like? Outstanding acting and production combine to keep secrets from being easy ... forgotten.
