On paper, this movie could sound incredibly boring. The idea of ​​a 75-year-old man riding the country on an equestrian mower does not have that, but the real power behind the film is his charm and intelligence. Writers do not find a better study of what does film work than "Direct Story." A perfect example is the scene where Alvin meets a teenage girl. She is pregnant and is afraid of what her parents would do if they found out. Alvin has long told her the story of her children. Each of them took a stick and broke it, which they could easily do. Then he let them pack the bars and try to break them. "The package," he said, "is a family." So many other films would feel compelled to continue and make sure that we know that someone could be divided, but that the members were stronger together. "Direct Story" realizes that we are smart enough to understand and simply let us think about the idea and draw our own conclusions. Alvin's way through Iowa is full of a refreshing, non-Hollywood character of interaction. Every interaction is full of heat and humor, and Alvin is so cute on the lake that we can not just smile when he goes to Wisconsin to make peace with his brother Lyle who suffered a stroke. And the simplicity of the final scene highlights that the real story is not a goal here, but a way. It is the way in which Alvin shares his life with everyone he meets - in their favor and in ours. It's a slow, easy and relaxed ride that reminds us of everything we've lost with the urbanization of America. Straight Story is a rare "G" movie that should not be missed. Stamp A
