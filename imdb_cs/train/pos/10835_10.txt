I love this movie. It's one of those movies that you can watch over and over and still find interest. Congratulations !! I believe that everyone involved in film and script should be proud of themselves. It's so scary, you feel you're looking at real life. I would like to see more films like this one. I'm glad you did not choose the famous Hollywood stars in this movie because it probably would not work. Even when Billy Connolly is fairly well known, he really got into the role and I could not imagine that someone else would have played it. Congratulations again, I really believe that this film deserves the Peter Sellers Comedy Award for Bill Nighy. And when you get to the final scene ..... well, what can i say !!!!
