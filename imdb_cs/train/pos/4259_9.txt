Solino really played me with deeply drawn characters. While it was a simple story of rivalry between the two brothers, it was not just about hatred and jealousy. What I liked most was how I could identify with the feelings that Gigi was going through, especially when he had to take his mother back to his home town in Italy and escape from attending the festivity ceremony of the festival films that the film entered. To see this figure, which struggled so hard between his art dream, and his innate sense of duty towards his mother was so frustrating. Even at the end when he once tried to reach out to his father, he was so courageous. And as in real life, most fathers can never walk past their walls to address their children. I was even able to identify with Giancarl, a brother who was also more confident and older, had so many inconsistencies. A really beautiful film that made me laugh and cry.
