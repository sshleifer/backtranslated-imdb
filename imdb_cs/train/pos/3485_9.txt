This Wrestlemania just did not do it for me. While some things like the royal battle and celebrity engagement were a return to good old days, it is talked about, it seemed to be "tall" in your house than anything else. Above average ... worth a few matches, like a team match, although it's worth noting that changing the title means nothing because it was canceled the next night.
