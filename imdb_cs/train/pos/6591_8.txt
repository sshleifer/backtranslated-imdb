An invisible man is a show everyone has to love! It reminds me of the old school series 80 (a-team, airwolf, knightrider) Special effects are small but very effective! but the most important thing is the fun they shot the series. It really shows it! the entire cast will fit into the best roles and it looks like they can do what they want! especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Ventresca. Ventresca really shines in this! for me it's incredible that an actor with such a great sarcasm is his acting style It does not get shot in a big movie (Mr. Tarantino this was the show you were targeting instead of the main boring danger (csi) show if you can be well worth it!
