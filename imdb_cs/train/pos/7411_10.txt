The key to joy and beauty, pain and sadness of life is our ability to accept that life is basically what it is so that we can continually fight this one convincing truth. In this way, we find peace. Elegant in its simplicity, but so heavy that most of us will grasp it. In this film, the director shows us this truth, but allows us to discover it in our own way. This is a beautiful and yet simple story, rather a fable that plays very well. Watching actors is more like being in a room with real people than just watching the actors. <br /> <br /> I tried to write a review of this beautiful movie so the others would be motivated to see it. I'm on the loose. The story is about men in the spa. It sounds like a real shutdown, is not it? But nothing can be further from the truth. The American title for this film is Shower, but it is almost the opposite of the main thematic element in this movie, which is bathing. I'm still losing. When we talk about a story or attitudes, we do not do justice to them. So I'll tell you how much I liked watching this movie and how it touched and moved with an experience. I was also very entertaining. I took care of the characters and I took care of what had happened to them. For every story, it is the highest form of praise. If you've been moving movies like King Mask or Not One Less, then make sure you see the Shower. Netflix has it and the quality of video and audio DVD is excellent. I saw it in the original cord with well-executed and well placed English. <br /> <br />
