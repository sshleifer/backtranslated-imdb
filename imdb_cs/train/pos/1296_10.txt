It is an extremely difficult film that can be watched, especially when it focuses on the innermost core of all our lives. But in the end it's a very beautiful and deep-moving movie. Anyone who thinks it cynical I have to say that they had to miss the point of the whole message of the film. For those who are actually watching the movie, they see that the way the questions are dealt with is absolutely necessary and the result is ultimately uplifting. Sure, it's very hard to watch, a difficult subject and even a brutal one. But it is extremely important for society and for all. This shows the pinnacle of what the world cinema is doing at this time (we will not limit this term to mere France) and everyone should try to see it. I will say that it is best to go with a clear head without bending over conflicting opinions and let the film work for you.
