Of course, John Garfield's five best films must be pride in the navy. It is the true story of the naval private Al Schmid who at the cost of his own view while the wounded held a horde of stormy Japanese on Guadalcanal. <br /> <br /> The story breaks down a little in three parts where Al Schmid's home is where he is just working stiff, beginning to be serious with a woman and likes nothing better than his night bowling. Pearl Harbor is bombed and he's gone to war while millions more. <br /> <br /> The second part is on Guadalcanal and we see part of the action where there is a machine gun in the isolated nest that holds Japanese units. His activities prevented the naval positions being crossed, but he had a grenade in sight. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the third is his painful adaptation to civilian life, and he assures that people are not only interested in the one he did not like, especially the girl Eleanor Parker saw. This film was broadcast on TCM on John Garfield's 95th birthday and was a documentary about Garfield, hosted by his daughter. One of the people interviewed said that Garfield was an actor who is the most righteous in the role of the working class in acquiring and holding a union card. <br /> <br /> He was lucky to join Warner Brothers in Hollywood. Although in the tradition of this studio he was constantly getting into gangster roles, Garfield was amazing in these parts because of his background because he was from the life of Al Schmid except for Garfield's Jewish background. <br /> <br /> In this respect, it was perfect to play the role of a working class hero like Al Schmid, who took responsibility for defending his country. No super heroines, just a guy who would rather go back to Philadelphia but do the work to do. It's a big part for Garfield. It's a movie that should not be missed. I'm thinking about what happened to real Al Schmid.
