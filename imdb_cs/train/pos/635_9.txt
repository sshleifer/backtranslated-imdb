I went for a small preliminary screening of this film on July 19, because I knew nothing more than the names of several actors and that it was some fantastic / adventure quest. <br /> <br /> The fence line is really nothing I've seen, and the unique story is certainly appreciated by all the others who are now or soon coming to the theaters. Despite what the first impressions can give, it's not that cruel, harsh, sticky or ridiculous, and it's really fun and fun. The flow is quite well done, it seems that nothing is chopping or pulling out. The soundtrack, due to the lack of better words, is magical and adds a lot to the film, unlike it just fills the silence, as is often the case in movies or television. And although I could know what was approaching the points, I still could not bear to stop watching the screen; in my opinion, no one left the theater during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this movie and as brilliant as it is, I can not find out why.
