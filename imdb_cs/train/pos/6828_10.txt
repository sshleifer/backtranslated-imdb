Broadway and film actor - reversed director John Cassavetes (from Rosemary's Baby) creates a masterpiece with this 1977 film. Casts are Gena Rowlands, John Cassavetes, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondell, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert, Laura Johnson and Peter Falk. Movie premise: The aging stage and film actress (Gena Rowlands) will re-evaluate her life after a dying fan dies in a car accident and tries to get her autograph. The film has a slow pace and a dark, moody, frightening quality. She has a 60-year-old film look and even reminds me of Polan's Rosemary's Baby without supernatural horror. Concerns are here that every successful actress has - cares and becomes unhelpful in his career. Moreover, she feels that she lived a life that lacks real spirituality, humanity and merit. She lived only for her career - she has no children, she does not do charity, etc. The gradual decay of her personality is the flesh of this film. It collapses. He is in a crisis. Gen. Rowlands really gets into the terrible psychology of the character and works quite well. She is an amazing actress and the film of the 70s is a refreshing contrast to often violent films of the period and / or movies about disaster or adventurous thrillers. It's a movie with many deep emotions, but it has a cold, cynical feeling as if Cassavetes criticized major films and actors of the 70th generation. Either that or this film is a product of the 1970s that was cynical in many ways - Nixon's Scam, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although the production value is not big and this film is not well known, it's a very scary film with moody moods. Kudos to the underestimated and late director Cassavetes, who died in the 1980s.
