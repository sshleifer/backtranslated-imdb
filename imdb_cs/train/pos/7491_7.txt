Years ago, I found a copy of this "exhausting basket" for one or two dollars. In many ways, it's perfectly fine, because when it happened in 1933, it was a really cheaply-made film of "poverty" Majestic. However, while the film is rather derived, it is still worth watching and provides some surprises. The story is very famous, as in some Germanic cities, people are upset because of some recent deaths that seem to be the work of vampires! Adding this acquaintance is Dwight Frye. He played Renfield in Dracula, and he is very, very similar - though he plays much more harmless weirdo. In this case, his bats are obsessed, and people begin to blame him for death. The film does a good job of providing some "red herrings" (and so it does not mean that it's brilliant to find that Frye may not be responsible, WHO and why they are interesting and they make it very different from the average horror film . In addition, while the production had little of the money she was talking about, she had several good actors today - Lionella Atwilla and Melvin Douglas - and also used Universal Studios at night (when they filmed a day). As a result, the film looks pretty good overall, even though I thought Fay Wray was horrified as usual - he thought he would not noticeably affect the movie. I saw her in more movies than most people on IMDb, and I noticed that her characters are not deep - she always seems to be cast as a "screaming lady" and provides something new in each movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's great for fans of old horror films and it's worth seeing. For people who are not fans of the genre, it's probably quite skip-capable.
