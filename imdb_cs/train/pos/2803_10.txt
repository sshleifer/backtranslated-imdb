As a former world champion of Okinawan karate, I love movies about the victims of the sport. But this movie is about much more. This movie is so good and so deep. I have recently suffered from very serious injuries and a largely disastrous lack of passion. Almost shines. And this stupid little movie touched me so deep that it reminded me of it as if it were of fate, of what life to be. This is a movie about life. Live your life for yourself and respect for others. Strengthening. God bless "Bend it like Beckham" I believe it's a real jewel.
