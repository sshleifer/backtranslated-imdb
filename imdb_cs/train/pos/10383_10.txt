I saw this movie in 1976, my first year of life in New York. I started living there in the next 26 years but never saw anything as fine and beautiful as this little TV movie. It was part of the PBS series, as I recall, and I never forgot. <br /> <br /> There are no sex scenes to talk about, just fine, moving, extremely touching moments full of tension and excitement, all within the conservative Boston environment (I mean) the role of a devoted husband waiting for her husband to return from war and she did not find her career and financial independence. Frances Lee McCain is excellent as a career photographer and I spent another 30 strange years looking for him in the same challenging roles without success. Does this movie have to be a movie? Sure it should be on DVD, but at least video?
