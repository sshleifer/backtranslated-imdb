I'm not sure it could be called an anti-war film, it shows war on an elite level. They are elite units who know what they are doing and have great pride. Even when they are pacifists, they still enjoy skill levels and the defeat of their enemies, even if they go against the pacifist. The films are slow and relatively uncompromising, and in many ways they are rather twisted as war movies - rather according to today's standards, with no body parts floating as in modern films. It's brutal in other ways, even if you see killing on a personal level. It's more like a thinking man's movies. As soon as you start watching, you do not want to miss anything. The thoughts of men in the film and their interactions are what the film is about - not the fight itself or the great exciting story. This may be called a warrior triller. <br /> <br /> If you're into the skill of war, if you are reading or seeing programs about SAS and so on, you want to watch this music song !!!!! Comparable films include The Hill (1965) and Sean Connery, 49th parallel (1941) starring The Naked and the Dead (1958) with Cliff Robertson. All are unusual and show a personal level war. Enjoy!
