"Once there was a beautiful country called France ... People lived happily after, women were easy and men enjoyed their favorite entertainment: war, the only recreation of kings that people could enjoy." This war was the Seven Years' War, and when it was found that there were more soldiers than soldiers, recruits were sent to re-occupy. <br /> <br /> And so it was that Fanfan (Gerard Philipe), caught by the farmer's daughter in a stack of hay, escaped marriage by enrolling in the regiment d'Aquitaine ... but only by believing his future as predicted by the Gypsy that he will win the glory and wealth in His Majesty's uniform and marry his king's daughter. Sadly, Adeline (Gina Lollobrigida) is not a gypsy, but a regimental sergeant's daughter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When Fanfan volunteers from recruits, the saber in hand to save the carriage under attack who should be inside but Marquise du Pompadour and ... royal daughter. She is now convinced she will be taken high, despite the extremely low blouses Adeline wore. She will soon discover her love for Fanfan. We are in the middle of an incomprehensible film about Fanfate's fate, the adventurous adventures of the sword and the villain. There are escape from the curtains, swords on tile roofs, crazy battles, romantic getaways and more joyous jerseys than you can imagine. What Fanfan lacks in Polish, it does in disrespect and enthusiasm. He is a quick swordsman and a fast lover, but with such a naive belief in his destiny and so optimistic that we can not please? <br /> <br /> Gerard Philipe was an iconic actor and screen actor (which Francois Truffaut is constantly abusing at Cahiers du Cinema). He did most of his own stunts. He was handsome, athletic, charming and charismatic. The men admired him and the women dreamed of him. He was dead at 36, seven years after Fanfan, from liver cancer. Everything France was mourning. Gina Lollobrigida as Adeline has her own. These are not the short-length blouses that make her acting. She is sharp, passionate, not quite innocent and nobody crazy. <br /> <br /> Fanfan la Tulipe just sings along with endless satirical events, top-notch situations and good-natured. Not to mention the fun dialogue. After Adeline has taken steps to rescue Fanfana from hanging up, she meets the king in her private cottages. "Give me your beautiful hand," he says. "But the heart belongs to Fanfan," says Adeline. "Who will ask for your heart?" the king says, "All I have asked for is a little pleasure." "I'm the right girl," says Adeline. The kingdom says, "You owe your respect for your merits, you love Fanfana, then thank you, my whim will let you show the greatest proof of your love by betraying for her loyalty the loyalty you swore to him." Now it's smart, fun stuff. Jean-Luc Godard, Francois Truffaut, and the rest of the New Wave band tended to abuse popular films just as fun (and adapted their attacks). Fanfan la Tulipe and his director, Christian-Jacques, belonged to their main goals. They probably missed the Fanfan point, a very fun satire about the absurdity of the armies and the war. How much better it would have been to make movies anger that only some cinema could appreciate. Thank you for the good that some of them, like Truffaut and Chabrol, overcame this childish congratulation and come to realize that a good film is a good film, whether it's masses or just cognoscents. A smart person who enjoys movies can appreciate everyone if the films are well prepared. Those who behave on the basis of their popularity are as absorbing as those who boast that they have never read Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard, eat your heart out. Viva Fanfan!
