Gang of roses. "Every rose has its thorns." <br /> <br /> The blend of old western and hip hop has blended perfectly. Clothing styles, scenery and plot are appropriate for what the director wanted. <br /> <br /> Plot - in five years they robbed twenty-seven banks and then disappeared without a trace. Today is a small western city under siege, and one of the first victims is Rachel's sister. Rose Gang is ready to go again. And this time it's personal. Rachel (Michael Calhoun), Chastity (Lil Kim), Maria (Lisaraye), Zang Li (Marie Matiko) and Kim (Stacey Dash) after five years together. When Rachel's sister is murdered, she ends up again with her friends and goes on a track of revenge. <br /> <br /> Good, skinny around the western version. (If you've seen Bad Girls, that's a bit better in the ways of female characters). I gave it 10/10, because it was for me to characterize characters, plot and scenery.
