This film contains one of Richard Dreyfus's greatest performances as an actor who plays a dictator and makes it so convincing that his own mother can not find a cheater. Also, this movie is fun, yet it has a serious side. What is particularly interesting about this film is the character Madonna, who is a dictatorial mistress, but eventually becomes the leader of the country. Evolution of Madonna from Lover to Political Leader greatly contributed to the quality of the story and the value of the film's entertainment. And the main character, who at the beginning of the movie is a fighting actor and somewhat a jester, also develops and respects at the end of film commands. I like this movie.
