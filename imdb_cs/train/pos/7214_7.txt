Ira Levin's Deathtrap is one of those mysterious films in the Sleuth tradition, which would be very easy to break, given any real exploration of the story. That is why I will be brief when I say that this is a play, a man who is a famous mystery mystery, another person who is a promising writer, a dramatist who is much younger and sexier than a role, and a German psychic for riding. Director Sidney Lumet, who is not a filmmaker, is largely good at creating the tension the film needs for the engine. Dialogue is fast, fresh and humorous. Michael Caine excels in such roles. Christopher Reeve is real and really grows on you, the more you see him acting. Irene Worth excels as a funny psyche. What Dyan Cannon? Love how Lumet wrapped her in her best trousers and dressed her most sincerely, but she is terribly wrong in this role-the role that the older actress would have given her, and certainly less seductive. But why argue with an apparent attempt at bribery for their male audience when nothing is changed now? Deathtrap is fun, sophisticated, funny and elegant. The secret has some sharp flaws that get a little worse and I was not completely happy with the end, but watching Caine and Reeve under Lumet's direction with Levin's upsized verbs was enough to take my interest and keep him in captivity throughout the movie.
