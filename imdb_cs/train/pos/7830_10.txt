In "Die Nibelungen: Siegfried" Siegfried was betrayed. Now Kriemhild tries to avenge. She takes Hagen and through a series of events, finally, a very drastic event will eventually take place at the end. One of the things we are looking at this movie now is that we can look at certain portraits. Attila Hun (called Etzel in the film) is portrayed as a strange person from the East, perhaps a hint of the Soviet Union. It is obvious that it was not Fritz Langa's fault that Hitler used "The Nibelungenlied" for German national pride in the Third Reich, but one can see what Fuhrer liked the story. However, it is an absolutely impressive film.
