Hidden Frontier spoke about several long news agencies and reported their long commitment to create the best Star Trek stories and provide an example of unity that was the mission of Gene Roddenberry. Their focus on homosexuality, depression, war and acceptance of different races is on par or exceeds the values ​​of other series and films Trek. Production value began to be smaller and torn, but in seven production seasons, acting has improved, stories are more complex and visual graphics have become smoother and more impressive. In Season 6 episode 1, Countermeasures, is one of the greatest space battles in the history of Trek. The ships are well-drawn and the space battles are impressive and exciting. The actual drawing on the border is not a ship or a background, but they are people and the interplay and the growth of characters. There are also a nod to other Trek series and movies with places and characters we all know. I recommend Trek fans to look at Countermeasures and you'll be throwing!
