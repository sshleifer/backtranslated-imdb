17 years ago, I showed it to my 6th year class and the students loved it. I loved it too. The story of the termites and their interaction with their environment is amazing. The cast star is deep and they all play well. The battle between two cold-blooded titans is really a classic matter. <br /> <br /> Alan Root has done incredible work with the camera and should win the best documentary oskar. The copy I have is not written by Orson Welles (Derek Jacobi) and is not called "Mystery Clay Castles", only "Castles of clay". It thinks that it had to be done with Welles added to the star power and oscar pressure. I was lucky to have found this VHS just recently, and it is now a favorite movie for my children. They brought the latest family gathering instead of Disney's movie. If you find this movie, you are really lucky.
