In 1979 I was a baby boy at the age of 12, my parents just got a home cashier that was quite new in our neighborhood. Like a 12-year-old boy, it was the first time I've seen on television. I will never forget the joy of those times. Racing supplies, full teeth with a bad bath, water bed, smoking herbs, hot 70s, "love in my Chevy van song, all of this was so new to me." A complete movie with all the memories you could hope for. and I use it once a year When I watch this movie, I do want to get my skates, with four wheels, not in close lines, go to the park and chase a few bucks with feathered hair, really great memories of young teens!
