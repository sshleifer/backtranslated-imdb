I saw it in theater at the beginning of the seventies. The most memorable and scornful scene is when the German army first attacks the yellow cross gaseous gas. The Germans and their horses are covered from head to toe (or hoof) with terrible protective suits. Experienced British soldiers give gas masks (only) and gas clouds and German invaders again. The gas clouds are getting closer and finally encircling British defenders. The Germans are slowly threatened with haunted looking clothes. Suddenly a shout from the defenders ... This gas is like no one else than you have experienced before .... Now you will know why I have remembered this scene for the past 30 years and more, I think you too!
