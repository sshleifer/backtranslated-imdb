I have to say I loved the film completely. It was funny moments, some real parts, just everywhere good. I personally really liked the movie, because it is something that can ultimately be about childhood. In my opinion, this movie focuses more on the young gay population. It shows how a young homosexual boy will be treated when growing up. All the dubious, calling names and unconscious are something I always remember, like most other young female boys, and now, finally, a movie that shows how hard it really is to grow up gay. So I would definitely recommend seeing this movie. You probably should not really watch it until you are old and mature enough to understand
