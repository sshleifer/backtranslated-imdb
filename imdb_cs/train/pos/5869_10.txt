after watching The Deer Hunter, which is a masterpiece, Jacknife had great shoes to fill. has the same topics as Deer Hunter, the devastating effects of a person after the Vietnam War. Robert De Niro is in this movie, like in The Deer Hunter, and is very good here, like Kathy Baker.but, this film belongs to Ed Harris, who gives a powerful, emotional and impressive performance. the movie is based on a scenic game and there are one or two scenes where it was obvious to me that it simply means that for those one or two scenes it felt like I was watching the play.that scene was not such a big deal and is not really reduce film.i actually really liked this movie.it is not epic like the deer hunter.Ty are similar period and have similar themes but they are two very different movies. I thought Deer Hunter was great and I think this movie was great. in that it makes it so great.for me, Jacknife is 10/10
