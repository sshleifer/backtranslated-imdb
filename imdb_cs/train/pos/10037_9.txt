The ship may have sunk, but the movie was not! Director James Cameron of "The Terminator" did it again with this amazing picture. One of my favorite scenes is the "Table Dinner" scene where Rose's family and friends meet Jack after he rescues her. Rose has a look on her face that every woman would have when you meet "ONE" ... I hope to look at it when I'm in peace with my future husband. Jack and Rose have a connection that's "movie STUFF", but it's good movie stuff. We have a greedy mum and all her elite who stay away living out of her husband's wealth. Rose almost suicides, but star Gilbert Grape rescues her. I really enjoyed hanging over the ship's scene. It was a good risk. <br /> <br /> The film is long, but it's fantastic! Good story, good flow, good actors !!! Go see twice if you want it worth it!
