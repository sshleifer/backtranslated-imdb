I do not know why people always want a deeper meaning in movies, otherwise they would be worthless. What do you just have fun with? Something Morgan Freeman stands out for. He gets a chance to show up a bit. Paz Vega, his star, gets a career and Brad Silberling gets his name to attract people to watch his film. I thought it was a good movie. Some humor, some pathos, some bitterness, but nothing above the top. Especially I won Jim Parsons as a receptionist in a construction company. When Freeman looks pious and says, "You made me a woman." He's just funny. The battle scene between Mrs. Vega, her ex-husband and his girlfriend is also wonderful. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a cute, charming movie that smiles you. It could do a lot, much worse.
