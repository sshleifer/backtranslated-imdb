I'm the second step to make it into the movie, that would be great! I was also surprised by the story and the character in this game. I played it over and over (more than 20 times) to try something else, and that's always more interesting. Final Fantasy Eat Your Heart Out! THIS MUST BE CREATED IN MOVIE !!!!! If someone outside wants some help to start a petition to make it a movie, please contact me. I would like to help with this project every day. The graphics are great for PS1 and even forget that PS1 is most of the time. The number of battle tasks is different for each game.
