What a wonderful movie! It was very scary, great acting, well written, a nice conspiracy plot, interesting characters, very good directions and a surprising end that smiles your face on your face. It's a popcorn horror movie that does not have to be tempting fans without horror, but it's still (still) one of the best thrillers there today! I highly recommend it only to fans: <br /> <br /> 1) Horror genre <br /> <br /> 2) Actor or actress appeared in it. </ br /> <br /> *** of **** stars! <br /> <br /> PS - I'm sick and tired of people who compare it, and other modern horror films with SCREAM. I know what they did not want to be like SCREAM. Everyone is like "Oh, they copied SCREAM!". Well, if I'm not mistaken, SCREAM copied other movies! In fact, about every horror film copied earlier. SCREAM, however, was a good movie. But still ... stop comparing and enjoying it for what it is! <br /> <br /> YOU ARE GOING TO KNOW THIS! <br /> <br />
