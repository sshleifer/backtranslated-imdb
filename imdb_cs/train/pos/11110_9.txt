You can not add a lot of positive reviews that are already here - great acting, balanced writing, versatile characters, a great anti-hero in Tony, a great commentary on the millennium of American life. The complex use of psychiatry in conjunction with Tony's mothers is especially fresh and humorous. Several other characters add a lot of depth - interesting Heshas history as outsider music, Ralphie's complete irrecoverable malice, Chris's dual desire in life, and so on. I have to deal with some critics, however, especially that it "celebrates violence / worsens the Italian-American". Most writers and actors are Italian-American, would they attack? There are several positive Italian-American characters - Artie Bucco Chef, Dr. Melfi and her family and Cusamanos next to the sopranos. In fact, my former husband, Dr. Melfi, in the first season, states that only a few minority Italians have ever had Mob connections (certainly smaller than the proportion of African-Americans involved in the crime, let me say that.) In both cases, poverty and lack of opportunities are the biggest causes. <br /> <br /> Most characters do not really choose the life they have; family background or circumstances in them basically corner. Outsiders (even Italian stocks) trying to integrate into it usually encounter the hectic endings - Matthew and his friend in season 2, for example. If you criticize this show, I suppose Frasier wanted to be a psychiatrist or Will & Grace did you want to go homosexual? You probably will not listen to rap music that deals with gangs, or r'n'b, who is talking about promiscuity or rock music that deals with drugs (or any other combination)? People are not as stupid as some of you are doing ... <br /> <br /> Everything is not perfect. Lots of characters appeared only once, with all the logic to appear or at least mention in previous episodes - Tracee dancer, Meadow's girlfriend Ally, ladyfriend Uncle Junior (probably for 20 years before being split in season 1).
