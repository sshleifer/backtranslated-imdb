I think it's so great that even after all these years, we're still talking about this movie! Obviously, this movie was not that bad, otherwise people would not even say it. I personally enjoyed this movie and I still do! I think this film is not for everyone, but it certainly touched a lot of hearts. <br /> <br /> As for those who think that this movie is "overrated" or "exaggerated" ... well, we have only the movie public for which we thank! lol * You know, it's not CRITICS / writers of the article that make the movie "HUGE" or "HIT" with the general movie audience. People make the movie a huge success. With Titanic everyone was amazed. Let's see, the movie was never before. At least not with the type of special effects needed to truly capture the essence of the ship that has actually sunk. This movie is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the movie with the actual sinking of this fatal day in April 1912. Even silver for a charitable reconciliation! <br /> <br /> Give this movie a break, boys! Critics have thought that this movie will drop BIG time! When this movie actually came out and people started to hear WORD OF MOUTH (which is the best form of advertising that you thought) that this is a good / decent / movie that's worth seeing, then everyone started going to theaters to they saw this movie ... not once, not twice, but maybe three times and more! So, I really did not say that this movie was "exaggerated" ... at least not as an increase in accumulated MATRIX or HULK is "exaggerated". ha! Critics did not even think that Titanic would have earned enough money to cover Cameron's giant film budget to become a movie mammoth. Film money, however, provided 200 million budgets and much more! <br /> <br /> Personally, I love this movie. But this film does not have to be for everyone. Do not say that this movie is upset just for romance! That's the sexiest thing I've ever heard! He does not love the movie just because he has romance in it! The story was sweet. Dialog could be better, but tell it ... REAL movie star was not Leo or Kate ... it was the GIGANTIC! I think all the actors, including DiCaprio and Winslet, have been greatly involved. It's not their best job (I've seen much better work than both) but it was not what I saw on screen earlier. Give them a break! <br /> <br />
