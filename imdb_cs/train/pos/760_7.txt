I have not seen this movie since the late 1980s and decided to pick up its version of VHS. This conspiracy is very slow and actors are almost robotic in this breakdance flick. Music, hip hop / freestyle artists and breakdancing scenes are what make this movie special. Breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in "Breakin", but I have to say that Breakin 1 & 2 carry the energy and the excitement on the screen much better. It's a movie I'll keep in my library, but it's not a movie I can watch over and over once in the blue moon.
