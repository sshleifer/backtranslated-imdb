Revenge is the theme of this thriller, Denzel Washington, which offers its share of action, chaos, murder and cruel bloodshed. The most important thing is finding and destroying missions because his accusations, young Dakota Fanning, are kidnapped from school, which is exactly what Washington has accepted to prevent. Places in Mexico are as chaotic as it happens to its predictable, violent conclusion, plotting on the way. Washington, a former CIA operator with a drinking problem, gets a good link from a former coworker who launches contour contours. Washington and Fanning have a great deal of chemistry, and after the uneasy start, the officer and his accusations become best friends. Christopher Walken, Rachel Ticotin, Radha Mitchell, Giancarlo Giannini and Mickey Rourke are a good player to support two stars.
