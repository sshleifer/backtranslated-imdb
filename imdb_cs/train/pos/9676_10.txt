The film was very kind and hearty! She crys almost every time I look at the movie. I recommend this movie for everyone. The film was so inspiring for me. The actors played great work and the film was very well played and done. The film was about a little girl who owned a parrot named Paulie. Paulie separated her from her parents because they thought it would be best for her. When Paulie had seen so many people, he ended up alone in the basement cage in the basement. Finally, this Russian man who did his job as a porter. Paulie found herself in the basement, and Paulie began talking to him to tell him the story of her life. Finally, the man helped Paul again to meet Marie (the girl who raised Paulie). Love overcame all obstacles.
