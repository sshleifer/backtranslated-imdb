I really liked this movie and it was a bit difficult when your brother made silly comments in it for 30 seconds. But I liked this movie mainly because I was used to the usual action films HK. Most movies like this do not look at the story, look at it thoughtlessly. And the insignificant action is right. You can see Jet Li Jump, spin, kick, punch, shoot, make impossible jumps and avoid countless rounds. It is true that this movie was released to a wider audience after Li was in Lethal Weapon 4. This is one of the reasons why the film's ratings have fallen. Most people probably expected to see a movie that was as polished as the North American film. But you have to remember that most HK film budgets are not as high as the North American film, and the style in action film HK is usually very different, usually requiring wire work in many of them. To see a good action movie, you should see that you are trying to ignore the dubbing. <br /> <br /> My rating was 8.
