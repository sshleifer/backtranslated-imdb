I did not like the demanding and overvalued Apocalypse now. Probably my favorite film of the Vietnam War is The Deer Hunter. Deer Hunter focused on one part of the war, then focused on life before the war. This movie is basically Deer Hunter 2. The screenplay is too free compared to Deer Hunter. The story has never evolved so that viewers can really understand and feel characters like Deerhunter. Vietnamese flashbackys are not as handy as those in Deerhunter. That's why I can give this film only 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> But I think the acting was excellent. DeNiro and Harris are truly amazing actors. They were completely immersed in their characters and expressed great anxiety by two former friends who had lost their best friend Bobby in the fight. Harris's character is a slimy alcoholic who conceals the blame he has in Bobby for losing his life and trying to save him. I also like supporting cast. Everyone in the city is part of the film. The city of course can not handle Vietnamese veterinarians very well. Like many small towns, it's all about being calm, humble, and thinking about your business. But Harris's character can not be one of these things. It is interesting how wars affect people. Some people quickly recover, while others will never really recover.
