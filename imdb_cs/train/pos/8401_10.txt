The love of the trap is "must see" an independent film. When I sat down and watched the film, I came with low expectations, but left with a blessing. The story is poetic, material, and creative. The writer enjoys and expands on each scene, allowing you to connect with realistic characters that everyone can identify. The film allowed me to think about my life and what I consider to be love. The film showed what love really is, the action is not emotion. I was also impressed by the quality of cinematography and the soundtrack of the film. The whole presentation exceeded my expectations. I give the film two big thumbs up and I recommend it to everyone of all ages and backgrounds.
