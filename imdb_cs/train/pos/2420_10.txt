If you like the fine (yes, I said the gentle) action and reaction of John Candy, you can not help but like this movie (pronounced "fillum" by Salvatore DiPasquale). An obscure (and uninformed) observer has always seen Candy as a broad actor - the big canyon. And sometimes it was (see "Stripes" and "Splash"). But if he had the opportunity, he could be really sharp and kind. It is bad that he was cast in so many roles that only showed his broad side because we will never look at others. Yeah, the movie. One can watch "Going Berserk" over and over again (I know I am) with the frequency of "Caddyshack." It is alright like this. This conspiracy, though a little complicated, is so deep for such a farce. It allows Candy and always underestimated Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy to bounce off Candy ... and bounce HARD. It is definitely worth seeing for anyone who has enjoyed SCTV or Candy's next job.
