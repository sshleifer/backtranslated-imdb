Playing as a Pre-Runner to the Big Escape about 13 years later, this sad little British film plays it straight, without excitement and dares to overcome well. The first part of the film is the establishment and subsequent escape of our protagonists, while the second part focuses on their survival while on the run when trying to reach Sweden. The film is based on pure characters, which has a simple, effective and yes, trustworthy dialogue that transmits it and achieves its goals wonderfully. No tense tension keeps the movie ticking, and as an adventure story it works perfectly for the timeframe it holds, so it's a big shot of the movie that can be the first of its kind? <br /> <br /> <br /> 7/10
