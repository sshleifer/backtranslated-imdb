Great movement. It must be for some musical snob. You do not have to know about the bands that can enjoy the movie. Before the movie I heard only two songs by Dandy Warhols. The only thing you need is an open mind. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the massacre of Brian Jonestown. Dandy Warhols play a part in the movie as a "rival band", but they are the second hostage to BJM. Dandy Warhols play a big part in the film as I originally guessed, but they did not have the BJM's excitement and unpredictability again. You can not help, but be fascinated by the band and his very charismatic frontman, Anton Newcombe. In itself, it is a transparent film and a study of the music industry. Just watch this movie and enjoy it.
