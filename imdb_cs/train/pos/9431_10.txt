and that's a very worrying film. Maybe I'm wrong, but it's the last movie I've ever considered Burt Reynolds as a real actor who changed the role and sent a message. Jon Voight and Ned Beatty are also excellent. They are insignificant and unconscious; businessmen wishing to enjoy the country. Little did they know what would happen next. Photography and reports are realistic and natural. This was before Wes Craven. What is most worrying about this film is the fact that such places still exist. In America, rural people are still dwindling with urban people; it is almost a century and a half since the Civil War. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy this movie. It was filmed in rural parts of southern Georgia that still exist. Just do not do around Mobile, Alabama; This area has not yet been repaired by Hurricane Katrina. 10/10.
