I went to see this movie twice a week and I can only summarize it in one word (which I normally do not use lightly): Amazing! In my opinion, it is the best film ever. Who deserves the Oscars and other awards, if not the Swedish crew, who created film perfection in the latest scenes of the film, when everything that is said (and not specified) throughout the narrative sums up? Just like the character of Daniel Dareus evoking so many feelings and long suppressed feelings within the people around him, the film does the same thing for his audience: You go out with your head and stomach and your heart feels full. Great things! Next time you ask, "what is the meaning of life," you might think about how you feel after a grand experience like what is in heaven: happy, content, filled. Tell Ms. Dalloway of Virginia Woolf, "Such moments are enough."
