I think I truly love this movie. The "Prix de Beaute" was originally a silent film, but later dubbed French in 1930. Despite the fact that someone else nicknamed her, it remains a stunning tour of power for Louis Brooks. The fact that her singing voice is called the legend of Edith Piaf helps us weaken the purists of dubbing fraud. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Lulu and we first see her in the department with my idol friend Andre (Georges Charlie) and their friend Antonin (Augusto Bandini). Lulu enters the frame like a pair of legs: we see her inside the car and change into her bathing suit. Lulu is very loose to show off his body, and he does not sit with irkous Andre. When Lulu considers the Miss Europe title, we know that the happy end will not sit at the end of Easy Street. The film seems to focus a lot on the men who nasty the beautiful women. We see many magic beauties and the reactions of the men looking at them. But in the middle of all this is beautiful Louise Brooks. <br /> <br /> If you do not like watching movies from past periods, consider checking this. Louise Brooks is not the name most of the average movie lovers can easily know, but once you see it, you'll be fascinating and you'll want to know more. Also, check it in "Pandora's Box" if you find it. <br /> <br /> Be careful with the DVD Movie DVD release. I do not know if their projected speed is correct. Many scenes seem too fast. It could have been the way they were shot. I do not know. But because it's the only way to see this movie, it's worth swallowing that one little bitter pill.
