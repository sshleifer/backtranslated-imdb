I found this movie very entertaining, I loved it as it was from modern sports politics. This movie is not as fun as South Park, but it's quite funny. And since I was a sports fan, I loved having fun with some of the ridiculous sports. This movie is great for lovers of unsportsman, probably better for them because they have to live their lives because they are interested in why people follow sports, so they end up when there are so many crazy rules and complexities of sports and the fact that it does not mean it at all. I also found the real game they came to be interesting, it's like a horse with pedestals and psyche outs (for the person who shoots). Overall, I strongly recommend that you watch this movie and believe that you love this movie in the end. However, if this style of comedy is not your favorite, you probably will not like it. (but it's with some comedy movie)
