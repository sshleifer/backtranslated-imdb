I have seen this movie many times and I like that all bad teachers want to give ten out of ten, but they think it would be unfair for other good movies. But I think it's one of those precious gems: the perfect comedy. It's one of the greatest comics of all time. Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly matched and do not respond. The script is so sharp you have to bleed. The story is well known and has already been described in other commentaries. The two guides provide extraordinary performance, the girls are great and the situations are divisible sideways. Not one swear - word in the eyes (mark Hollywood, you do not have to swear to be funny, you have to be funny) and the transition from scene to film is smooth. They will not do this anymore. Timeless.
