Gerard is a writer with somewhat exaggerated imagination. He is also a homosexual and a Catholic susceptible to Catholic guilt and something clairvoyant, or so he looks. On a trip to Flushing, Christine has picked it up. When he finds out that Christine's new boyfriend is a bit of a rough business he's made from a distance, he decides to stay. After all, forced heterosexuality has its compensation. Then she realizes that Christine's previous three men have all died violently. Caught by Christine and is he or a friend, Herman, will be the "fourth man"? Verhoeven's superheated melodrama is a great blend of Hitchcock and David Lynch, full of OTT eroticism and religious imagery and amazing red colors. It looks like a lot of time, and it feels like a dream, and we can never be sure that what we see is real, or the fiction of Gerard's imagination. Fun is at discovery. Also, the fact that Christine is an infinitely more attractive figure that either a nice Gerard or an exciting Herman means we do not like the root for one of the men above her. In fact, it is fair to say that Gerard's arrival can not come soon. Outstanding performances by Jeroen Krabbe and Ren√©e Soutendijk and easy Verhoeven's best film to his surprisingly subversive piece of sci-fi "Starship Troopers".
