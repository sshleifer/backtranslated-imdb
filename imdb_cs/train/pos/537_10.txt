For me, it is a matter of life and death - just the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end the class comes to life. It is encouraging, thought provocation, a mirror for the post-war world, and relations between peoples. Cinematography is just amazing and the effect of mixing monochrome and Technicolor to emphasize different worlds works without any problems. Characters and conspiracy development are almost perfect, and attention detail supports trusted imagination. No matter how many times I watch the movie - and I've watched it a lot - it never touches me. It makes me smile, it makes me laugh, it thinks to me, it makes me cry crying. It's so fresh today, as it was in 1946. If only one film was allowed to keep me looking again Life and death would be the movie.
