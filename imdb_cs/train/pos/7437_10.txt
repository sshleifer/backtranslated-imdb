We recently discussed with our friend about educational and ethical influences when we grew up in the 1950s today. She mentioned Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who wrote the Ancient Mariner Frame in 1798. We both had to recite parts of the epic poem at high school and English literature courses at college. My friend said, "Her message could even be called metaphysics in today's context." <br /> <br /> We tried to recite it and remembered only pieces. (I have trouble remembering Dr. Seuss.) I said I'd get two copies of a poem so everyone could read it. It was easy enough, but I was extremely surprised to discover it was a movie. We look forward to watching the movie to see how it was interpreted. After all, the Old Seaman's Frame is not exactly light. After each reading of the poem we watched the film together. We considered the film a remarkable success, especially given that it had happened in the 1970s, before the computer before the so-called "Ken Burns Effect," "and before special effects began to cope too often with a lack of substance. Particularly remarkable are the 19th and 20th century illustrations that have been excluded from "lesser-known artists," such as Willy Pogany, an early Hollywood designer, who was told by Sir Michael Redgrave, who taught a poem when he was the director of the school, and his credibility when he remained faithful to his poem. <br /> <br /> His mastery is in layers of gentle communication, transmitted without "instructions" or becomes a tortuous and obvious story of morality. today's mental "face" and "overhead." Most of today's message of morality in the film is two-dimensional: the extreme us ilia, murder and chaos are bad, bad are really bad and good are great heroes, as if the human figure lacked some nuances. The Ancient Mariner's framework is a celebration of an individual, a character, an award for celebrating all the wealth that life can offer within the broader context of humanity, ie the ability of a person to give others. <br /> <br /> We are proud to have found this "unknown" jewel, and we have learned that it has won the highest awards in its category five times out of six on the "name" of international film festivals. Another surprise was that the director of Raul daSilva was a recognized authority in early animation and wrote six award-winning books on the film. <br /> <br /> The message of this film is as important today, if not more than if Coleridge wrote the original epic poem and when Raul da Silva translated it into the movie. If I had taught high school yet, which I did for five years, I would catch it and show it to all my students. There is plenty of wealth that naturally leads to the discussion of the great and important issues we are facing, either in 1798, in 1978, or today - in fact, if humanity has a spiritual component. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
