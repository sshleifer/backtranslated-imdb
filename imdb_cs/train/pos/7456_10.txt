Do not get me wrong. "GoldenEye" was revolutionary and is definitely the best FPS game based on French 007. The series, however, fell into the FPS route. Enter "All or Nothing" that Bond puts in a third person. When I wrote my earlier review of "From Russia With Love", I ended up with FRWL and I just started EON and said a little EON. Although FRWL certainly has the edge in nostalgia and captures the essence of the film franchise, EON is definitely better in terms of depth control and game variety. Missions range from standard running and SUV driving, Aston Martin control, limousine control that is linked to the blast, take two different types of tanks and "GoldenEye", motorcycle ride, helicopter, repellent shaft protected by laser spirals and free fall falling girl. Sure, the control of the vehicle is a bit clumsy, but the problem is here. <br /> <br /> As a film adaptation, "GoldenEye" and FRWL were all I could hope for. But the original story of EON adds a sense of James Bond's adventure control. It helps with the impressive cast of Willem DeFoe, Shannon Elizabeth, Heidi Klum and Misaki Ito. Judi Dench and John Cleese repeat their movie roles M and Q, respectively Pierce Brosnan, while Sean Connery does not provide credibility in the gaming process. All characters are star-like, with the unfortunate exception of Heidi Klum, who is in the gaming model, not doing just model righteousness. Mya's theme song is on par with at least some of the big Bond title titles title. <br /> <br /> The game also plays tributes to some older Bond films. The character Willem DeFoe is a former colleague from baddie Christopher Walken from "The View of Killing". Richard Kiel appeared as Jaws, a nasty henchman from The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker in three battle scenes, the first and best of the same way the fight in the movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The single player game consists mainly of standard on-foot missions like Bond. Like Bond, you'll be able to choose whether to use stealth or go out with weapons. The game provides lots of opportunities to use stealth, with lots of wall and object lining. Unfortunately, unlike FRWL, only one button in the EON controls both the rotation and the wall, so Bond can eventually twist down when looking around the corner and vice versa. The game also allows the player to switch to "Bond Reflex" mode. While browsing your inventory, everything around you gets sophisticated, allowing you to analyze objects around you that you can communicate with. While it gets used to some habits, this mode will eventually allow you to perform many spectacular "Bond moments", such as shooting a chandelier, to take four pieces below it, and greatly contribute to the feeling of Bond. <br /> <br /> There are three levels of difficulty: Operative, Agent and Double Oh. At Operativ you can wind in a few hours. Agent, a few weeks. On Double Oh, a couple of months. The level of difficulty can be changed for each mission. Get high score on missions to unlock gold and platinum prices and effects such as vehicle upgrades and dirty clothes that Bond girls wear. Some missions can be extremely frustrating due to lack of control points, but when everything is said and done, no mission is longer than the one action scene in Bond. <br /> <br /> More players, unfortunately, are not so exciting. "GoldenEye" has the best multiplayer mode in any Bond game. The main multiplayer player EON is a cooperative campaign that gives players the responsibility of smaller MI6 agents for a less important mission than Bond's. In this mode, a more standard third-person death match can be unlocked. However, one player mode is the most complete Bond. The end, like most Bonds, is anticlimactic. While the final mission is one of the most worsening matches, the final confrontation with the villain is a disappointment. Also, the levels that require Bond to be fast, are to a great extent test and error. Still, for some serious Bond fans, playing this game is equal to missing one of the Bond films.
