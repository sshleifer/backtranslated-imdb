Most movies about an atomic-age monster I've seen on television as a child-and some of them, including BLOB, scared me out. Films like MARS INVESTIGATORS have made it clear that children were not trusted when things like things that attack the home world; BLOB repeated this fact. I recall, kindly, the late evenings spent stretching out on the floor, observing how the body hijackers and the Martians and the invaders and the maids came into unsuspecting society. There was summer, at the beginning of the eighties, when the local Science Museum (in Richmond, Virginia) ran the classical atomic age every weekend. These were 16mm movies and most were black and white (and the projector was noisy) and the "color" BLOB print faded into a faint pink - but, man, it was fun. I dragged my mother and she enjoyed it as much as I did. It was there at the science museum that I really fell in love with BLOB. Of course, the filmmaker's intention was to make money - but the sincerity of all those involved, from creators to "talent" (players), made me fall in love with this film. Corny? You bet. Raw? They have no cheesier. But, man, what movie!
