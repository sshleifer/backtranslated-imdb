It is said that David Lynch's films and short films will not appeal to all. Not even Dumbland, maybe more than ever. I have the feeling that Dumbland, as people meet him, will be a real mark of "I get it" or "what the hell." It is not exactly surrealism, but absurd to the point of not returning. It is also very, very, very stupid. But in this stupidity it can be some sort of ironic intelligence that the creator knows how childish and nasty it is, and that self-esteem is a plus, not a damping. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of coarse short short dresses that would not even finish on Hertzfeldt and the Animation show (which I would like to add, Lynch has a lot to do with both directors in their work on lummox with IQ 20 who has a constantly trembling fear of a woman and a child who looks like a cross between a gingerbread and / or a stranger.Episodes include small situations such as a defective treadmill, a businessman who can recite the Gettysburg address, follow a sick brother in law, form hallucinations and just booming on a sofa with noise all around.Once all Lynch is still experimenting because it has been constantly better or worse over the five year period it has been done on and outside the Inland Reich. <br /> <br /> One thing will return to the roots of its the first short six digits, which worsens six times, in using repetition as it means that sometimes it works unbearably well and sometimes not as well as with the episode with a sitting around a house that does not do anything because the teeth bleed and a fly buzzes around, absurdism becomes wax and worsens without much effect. And even an episode like a coming friend is more fun - for example, to compare Beavis & Butt-head (both mix as idiots and are equally concerned with killing things like fish and sheep). What ultimately works is how Lynch performs the front delirium abstraction, the worst ways it can be imagined, and excessive violence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> , including solos. And one of the most crazy things I've ever seen since the filmmaker is to "get the stick" where we see the guy, his son woke up and got a stick in his mouth. Soon his neck breaks, his eyes jump, and once the stick is removed, he does not care for traffic jamming like a shaft hatch. Other moments appear in unexpected slots and are drawn as cheap paper with the impulse to shock with a language that is embarrassed (mostly from a man and from a "grandmother" who, in one of Lynch's voices, the characters are the deepest of all) and the restless quality , reminiscent of the cream of the (early) Hertzfeldt. Still, I'm still not sure if Dumbland is something I would put into someone's hands if they did not see much Lynch, and yet leave nothing to them. There are a few social points that could be closer to Lynch's mind than we usually think of those in real life. However, in general, there is not much to be read, and I would say that more than half of them see it hatefully passionate. For those who dig the unconditional pit of animated comedy, get ready.
