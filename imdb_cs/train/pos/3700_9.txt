Cameron Grant is one of the best film directors. His only opponent is Andrew Blake. Celeste is a dynamite throughout the movie, but the DR sequence with her two other ladies is unbelievable. Almost equally good is Carrera's performance with construction workers. I highly recommend this movie and gave it 9. It's almost as good as Cameron Grant ELEMENTS OF DESIRE, which I gave 10.
