Director Sidney Lumet made several masterpieces such as Net, Afternoon or Serpico. But he was not too lucky to do his last work. Gloria (1999) was pathetic, and Find Me Guilty was an interesting but unsuccessful experiment. Now Lumet brings his best film for decades and, in my opinion, a real masterpiece: Before the devil knows you're dead. I think this movie is like a rebirth for Lumet. This movie has an excellent story that deeply has many layers. I also think the end of the movie is perfect. The performances are brilliant. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as usual, is a great performer and is undoubtedly one of the best actors of our day. Ethan Hawke is also a great actor, but I think he is underestimated. His acting performance is great. The rest of the acting is also great (especially the great Albert Finney), but these two actors bring a monumental performance that unfortunately the pathetic Oscars. The film has a good level of intensity, partly tha nks for performance and partly thanks to the brilliant scenario. Before Devil Knows You Are Dead, he is a real masterpiece with a perfect direction, great script, and excellent performance. We need more movies like this one.
