Unfortunately, this film has long been unavailable (as other posters have noticed), but this is one of the main dramas of the Great Depression, a lyrical and touching love drama in a swampy city. It's a showcase of Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young, who are just about the best of career, and it's a surprising example of how director Frank Borzage has created an almost fairy-tale aura about elements of poverty, crime and terrible social injustice that only demonstrates how truly romantic and spiritual was his talent. This film shows how love survives in the midst of pain and desperate need, and it is totally alive. This is the real masterpiece of the period and it is a film that deserves to be more known.
