Cult classicists are almost impossible to predict. Who could argue that Vision Quest, Fight Club and 2001: Space odyssey, the films that critics and the audience gathered at their release would be extremely popular? Like many IMDBers, I consider myself a film expert. Unlike most of those who hate Envy (as evidenced by abusive ratings of 4.4), I've found that Envy is one of the funniest movies in the last decade. The story of the movie is ridiculous. The dialog is not smart, the scenes have little continuity, and the script looks like it's written by the fourth grader. But that's why the movie is so cheerful. You see, to appreciate the casual genius Envy, you have to enjoy the film from an ironically separated view. Why do I love Envy? Because the film is bad, it's getting good. This is a recipe for classical culture, and Envy will definitely pay an account.
