This is one of the best films Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers, or at least one of my favorites. Most A-R movies have great dance but sappy romantic stories. This still has a shyness, but not as distinct as other movies. This film contains not only great dancing but sympathetic characters and plenty of good songs. Music is a central theme and what's nice is the addition of the Rogers solo tap. She was not only a super dancer but a very pretty woman and one with a huge figure. She, of course, is also dancing with Fred and they are always a fun couple to watch the dance floor. During the 1950s watching TV "Ozzie & Harriet" on television, it was real for the first time I saw to see such a young Harriet Hilliard. It was no surprise to hear Ozzie for this beauty. Though she had that short early 1930s haircut, I immediately recognized her voice. Also in this movie are fast performances of Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, but I have to admit that I did not have Ball yet. I can not find her, but I know he's here. Astaire, with the exception of some unpleasant chewing in the first third of the movie, enjoyed watching and Randolph Scott - even better in the westerns - is also sympathetic. <br /> <br /> It's simply a nice, good movie and good if you want to enjoy the great talents of Astaire and Rogers.
