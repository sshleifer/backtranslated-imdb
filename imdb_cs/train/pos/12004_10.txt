This film is a true and historical film. It is very useful for those studying the LDS church because it is 100% true. It's a great movie and I recommend it. It is very factual, exciting and motivating. There are some who think it's not a fact, but it is. This is the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Prophet Joseph Smith, who renewed it. In life, he has such events as the illness he had when he was a little boy, his courtesy Emma Smith, Emma, ​​his wife, childbirth, and so on. But the most important is revealing the renewal of the Church.
