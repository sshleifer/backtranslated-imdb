Recapitulation: In the morning after his bachelor party, Paul awakens his close mother and discovers that a woman sleeps beside him. Unfortunately she's a waitress from the bar and not his fianc√©e. And suddenly she appeared everywhere ... a taxiway on the highway and on the parents' dinner. And it's hard to keep a secret when her jealous ex-boyfriend had to follow and photograph. It's not just about saving your wedding ... it's about survival. Comment: Actually much better than expected. Not the sweet romantic comedy I've been waiting for, but something much more fun, something with a small edge. This movie was not afraid to take jokes a little further. And Jason Lee is doing a comedy now, especially when his character is totally panicked and deeply in trouble like here. And he received pretty support from the beautiful ladies Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. And actually I thought Lochlyn Munro did a good job like ex. So more emphasis on comedy than romance and the end result was good. I liked it very much. <br /> <br /> 7/10
