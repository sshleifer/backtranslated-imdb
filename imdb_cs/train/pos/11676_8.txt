If you loved the Long Way Round, you will enjoy almost as much. It's educational, fun, interesting and tense. Charley shares a screen with two interesting teammates, two tired mechanics, two great cameras, and too big a Russ. Ewan makes a few performances, but Charley really pulls him off. It's funny, engaging and constant puddles of stress and doubt. Great things! <br /> <br /> The series is in 7 episodes. Like LWR, preparation is almost as interesting as a race. Although they cover the races and races of the race well, it could be a little more explanation for trucks and cars that are just mentioned and rarely even seen racing. This is a motorcycle movie and someone on two wheels will love it. <br /> <br /> The series contains an amazing photo, as well as several interviews with people in the mouth. So. There is another extremely catchy theme song like LWR, but it's not as good as Stereophonics. <br /> <br /> If you live in the American God, know when it will be released, so buy it on Amazon.uk and watch it on your computer just like me. Oh, and be ready to buy another bike.
