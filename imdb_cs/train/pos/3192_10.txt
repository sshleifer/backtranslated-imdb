Yes, you will get ten stars. It is clear that this day is full of genius. The universe once sent Trent Harris a young, wonderfully weird person, and Harris caught him on a tape, in all that's a real glory that you can not be fake. It is a shame that it ended in a tragedy for a young man if only the alternative end of this man's story could be written. The other two steps in the trilogy tells the story of Sean Penn and Crispin Glover in the roles of young men. The world is expanding and curiosity is contextualized by transcription, which gives us a wider view of strange growth in vanilla America. Recommended for everyone and everyone!
