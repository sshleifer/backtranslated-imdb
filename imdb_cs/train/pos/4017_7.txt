It is a very unforgettable western spaghetti. He has a great story, interesting characters and some very good acting, especially from Rosalby Neri. Her role as the evil wilderness in this movie is really classic. He steals every scene he is in, expressing so many faces and eyes, even if he does not speak. Her performance is very credible. She was very charming without being over the top (not that it was bad if you were over the top). Mark Damon is also surprisingly good in this movie. The musical score is excellent and theme songs are those that will play in the head constantly the days after watching the movie, whether you want it or not. There are a few parts that are very fun. I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri takes off before the parrot. There are also plenty of neat pistols that are very well done. I guess I would have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it was not for two things. The first one is a stupid bit room that appears about 25 minutes in the movie. This is one of the most spectacular fighting fights I've ever seen in the movie. It is very poorly choreographic and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any real fight. One could overlook it if it were a comedy by Terence Hill / Bud Spencer, but this is more serious Western and the battle really needed to be more realistic. Another thing that made me angry with this film was Yuma's cowardly Mexican assistant. I think it was supposed to be a comic or something, but the character was just stupid and useless in a movie like this, and it was not funny at all. All I can say is where is Tuco when you need it? <br /> <br /> All that has been said, let me assure everyone by reading that Johnny Yuma is a classic western spaghetti despite the mistakes I mentioned and all fans of this genre need to see this movie.
