After the Chronicle of the Heroic Knight, I find myself very extraordinary, just minutes away, but questions are still being asked. While it seems that the first 7 episodes or so is actually telling the events of the first Lodoss record of the war, the truth is they really are not. It seems that the creator of CotHK had a different idea of ​​how he originally ended (and that may be the reason why the first 7 episodes are there), but I will not find it. CotHK says it begins 5 years after the Heros war, including Parn. I think the director made the first 5 episodes seemingly similar to the original recapitulation just to give the viewer a little reminder and an introduction to the characters and their deeds because it seemed much less after the series hit the Spark story. Now, as soon as the series comes to Spark's part, we find out that we have jumped for another 10 years (15 years since the Heros war). Spark and his crew, in some cases, resemble Parn and his crew as soon as the journey enters the equipment, especially the love story between Spark and Nees. I also thought I'd throw in the original series several times, and if it was not for the long blue Spark hair, I know I'd stop more than once to make sure it was the right disc. consider these major back sets, however, writers did a great job in crafting credible characters and a remarkable story. The only thing that causes me harm is the return of Ashram and Wagnard. Ummmm ... jak ??? Do not get me wrong, both are great villains, even though Ashram's only villainous feature is that he supports Marmo. Maybe I missed something during the rough series that explained this part. As for the continuation, I recommend CotHK. I place CotHK and even more the original recording of Lodoss' war far above the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Both are much more epic than anything I've ever seen or read. I highly recommend.
