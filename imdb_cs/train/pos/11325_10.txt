When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV, I must say that from all the shows I've seen, it's all about it. I had to see this show, and I really did. When I got the first sound of this show, it was best. I liked the animation and all the fighting scenes were amazing. I have to say that my favorite characters in the show were Saber and Archer and, of course, I like Illyu. And of course, all the episodes on the volumes were interesting and very cool. Another thing I have to say about the series is Michael McConnohie (known for Transformers and others) who plays Berserker's voice. It has a great character. And I even watched the whole show again and again before I watched the last volume. So if you see something good, then look at this show, it's best.
