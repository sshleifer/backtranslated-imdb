Outstanding interpretation of Jim Thompson's novel, this neo-noir thriller has all the necessary elements - an exasperated former boxer who turns, an alcoholic widow with ominous desires, a former policeman turned into a small time step, and a devastating land destined to perish. Nevertheless, the film never goes clich√© but remains fresh and interesting. The performances are excellent, especially the role of Bruce Dern as a dirty sleazeball, Uncle Bud. There is a tense uncertainty about the film, a movement that deliberately or not adds to the cruel behavior. Highly recommended.
