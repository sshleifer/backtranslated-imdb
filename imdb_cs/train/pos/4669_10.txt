If in 1968 two more charming artists appeared than Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith together in a charming movie, I do not know who they are. For the first time, I have seen this magnificent small satirical gem 25 years ago at the age of 16, and I consider it a year in which I could not sit down to see it again unnecessarily. It is intelligent, unpredictable, elegant, sad, sweet, subtle and totally charming. The romance of these two social riots is both comic and horrifying - never more than Maggie Smith's desperate attempt to take the right card on board, a scene that is both sad and the perfect miniature portrait of heart loneliness. And the final frosty frame on Ustin's anxious, loving, loving face when he asks, "Are you all right?" - Has anyone ever made the appearance and the sound of devotion so perfectly and naked honestly? I would never want to know someone who does not like this movie.
