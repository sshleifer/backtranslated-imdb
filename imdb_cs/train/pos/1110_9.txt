I think you would have to be from the USA to get a lot of jokes. But if you like Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you want this movie. Of course, you can not compare the quality of the shooting, but of course with the cameraman's way it was expedient. Killer Tomatoes is one hundred times better than Nepolean Dynamite. Just my opinion. I'm sure people from France will not appreciate French cartoons. So this movie is not for the world audience. And when I'm not a trained film critic, I know what I like. I could not laugh at the whole movie. My sides and my jaws hurt at the end of the film.
