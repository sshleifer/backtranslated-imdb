I have never seen all of Han's movies, but this is certainly the best I've seen so far. The story is not something special, so I won not go deeper into it. Stunning balls, fighting, good game, warm sense of humor are special. The movie has a rising pace all the way and you're just stunning to see it. All cold stuntmen (Jackie, of course) will make you want to jump over the couch and scream. It's amazing! Even my mom was stunned by this great movie when she saw it. I know this police story can be a bit difficult to get to the front, at least it's here in Sweden. But I can assure you it's worth checking out.
