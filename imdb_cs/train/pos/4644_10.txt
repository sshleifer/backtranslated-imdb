Align the funniest spoof of selected home movies you've ever shot. <br /> <br /> This preview exposes all clich√©s and then some! Excruciatingly bad (Downs game syndrome)! Very tough own important dialogue. Scenes that should shock but fall flat. Break through springwork. The remaining points. They are all wrapped in a grim mishmash of disrespect towards the audience and vague psychic vibration. It will achieve exactly what has been proposed. The cheerful satire of those tiresome movies that destroyed teenage donors to show their parents when they asked what they were doing in the last two years! After "What is it?" won the awards in Cannes, Werner Herzog lecturing says the film was in fact a spoof, partly in his own movies! He supposed he was throwing out the information. Until today, he refuses to discuss this event. <br /> <br /> Anyway, seeing and laughing, it will be a classic of humor for many years.
