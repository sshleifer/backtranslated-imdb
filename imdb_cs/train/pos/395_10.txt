Visually stunning and full of Eastern philosophy, this amazing fantasy of martial arts is brought to you by director Tsui Hark, a man behind some of the best films in Hong Kong. Special effects are beautiful and imaginative. The conspiracy is a bit on the side of the brain, but it's a refreshing change from films that treat the audience as if they were crazy. If your thinking is not your strength, it may not be your movie. Perhaps you should look at the latest from the brain of the Hollywood studio, but if you're looking for something more, it's where you find it.
