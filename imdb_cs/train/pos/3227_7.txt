Kurt Russell is strong and (mostly) silent in this futuristic action thriller by Paul Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil.). Set on a planet with waste, Soldier plays as a cross between Rambou and Shane. Russell barely speaks as the title character, an "outdated" genetic soldier who has remained dead. Support for the occupation of colonists, including Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee, and surprisingly hairy Michael Chiklis, is capable. They spent most of Russell's movie, and the rest has been running for life. Russell's acting is one of the best he ever did. With almost no words he speaks, expresses emotions, feelings and senses with a look and a look. It's almost a mime performance. When the action sequences get into the gear, kicks the butt - and does it in strong, quiet things - in fact. There are mistakes. Jason Scott Lee is brutal as a "superior" genetic soldier. Jason Isaacs makes a great impression that Frank Burns of M * A * S * H ​​is a kind commanding officer and Gary Busey busts the gut (and almost drops his belt) like Todd's mentor. This is an underestimated and excellent sci-fi film, and recommends to everyone who wants to write a second visit to the Blade Runner universe - David Webb Peoples.
