I enjoyed it. Generally, I'm not a fan of comedies and comics, but I like Whoopi. I'm also part of Sci-Fi Fantasy. A dinosaur. I read for pleasure, but when I feel overly stressful or really dead, I watch television and movies to escape. Theodore Rex allowed me that. It makes me successful in my eyes! I did not even go to do something else when he ran. It did not matter whether or not it was rated "good" or not. No, I'm not young. I'm not crazy either.
