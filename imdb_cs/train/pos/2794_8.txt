How can a movie be both controversial and gentle? This makes it almost perfect. No one wants their daughters to be athletes. Obviously, most cultures do not want their daughters to be too small. Here we see a bunch of gorgeous actors we have never heard of before telling people of different cultures who live a fairly humorous life until their female children want to have the potential to become professional footballers. The structure around the parallel arrangement of both cultures is amazing. There is no indignation. Both cultures are considered modern and valid. (And yes, they are both stupid). One defect: It seems that the Hindu wedding ceremony involves hundreds of relatives, but not one child.
