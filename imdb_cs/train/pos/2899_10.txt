Very smart humor Outstanding performance I can not believe how people can think they deserve 1/10! I hope this movie will be shown everywhere so everyone can enjoy it. If you ever have an opportunity, watch it ... do not miss! There is a part where the main actors are driving and singing "Happy birthday" and "el payaso plinplin" (Argentine song for children (I think ... this could also be on the South American side, I'm not sure)). These two songs that have the same melody ... but people do not usually realize that ... it's just a grate! I tried to write it in Spanish and English because it is an Argentine film ... but the page will not let me :( I hope you like it!
