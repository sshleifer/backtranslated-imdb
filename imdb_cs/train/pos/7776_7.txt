Does anyone know what are 2 sports cars? I think Robert Stack could be Masseratti. Pink Hudson's character told her father that she was working in Iraq, is not it timely? I have Dorthy Malone in my spank bank for most of my life, maybe it was the movie that impressed me. Loren Bacall surely had some chops in this movie and probably eliminated Malone, but Malones had a more sensational impact, so she received Oscar for the best supporting role. Loren's part was considered to be the main role: Hadley's character was probably a fairly common picture of the magnates of his time, as he was a normal person who became a big player in the emerging industry, the whole city forgotten his children to bring his wife. At a time when she was widowed, she realized that it was all he really had, and they were spoiled and looked for attention, so instead of trying to relate to his children, his head off. An ancient moral story. But seriously , what were the sports cars?
