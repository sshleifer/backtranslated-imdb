This movie gives us an interesting reminder of how easy it is for so many people to get into a busy job that nothing is doing. We as people of African descent are indebted to change into this cycle of "talking and doing nothing" and to become aware of the change we need to have less talk and more actions. It is a powerful expression of the division of our people about minor issues and our shortcomings in recognizing a larger image and the need for unity to change ... Despite its reference to the black community, all viewers can learn something from the message that this film is trying to show.
