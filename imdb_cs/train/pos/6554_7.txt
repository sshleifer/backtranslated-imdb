Ok heres what i say: The film was great. I'm a huge fan of Nancy and I read all 1-56 original books and I continued to read more. I am now 96. Watch out for the villains who give this film a lower level than it should. All the tracks show a wonderful movie! I loved the whole thing. So what Nancy is at the moment. It's still old-fashioned as it is in the books! People who have not read more than 5 books complain about Nancy's opinion. I read them all and I think Emma is perfect and that Nancy was perfect. I found the parts of the movie scary. I loved the exciting pursuit of vehicles and got in the way. I loved the tracks. I've solved the mystery myself! It was really wonderful. I suggest that you see it because the people who complain are no more about what a good movie is about and B about Nancy Drew. Go for it. Perhaps it's not an Oscar, but a really good movie.
