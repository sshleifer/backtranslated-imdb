and anyone who follows this movie will agree. This film was focused on the days when the plot, the credibility of the character and the theme really mattered. Jean Peters, Widmark and Thelma Ritter stole the spotlight. Ritter is in peak form as an informant "Moe" survives in the Bowery section of NY, acting as a pigeon pigeon for the NYC police. The only other movie I saw in Peters is "Niagara," and she certainly demonstrates her acting skills here, complete with Brooklyn's accent. Widmark is a very threatening, like an anti-hero, who must recognize what's right, despite his need for cash. Photography is great. Neon, metro station (though it looks cleaner than the real thing!) The port, where Widmark lives as temporary. The excellent use of the city is, with "Lightning Louie" in Chinatown; there are many tastes and tastes of the city; the political atmosphere of time is a breathtaking background. 10/10.
