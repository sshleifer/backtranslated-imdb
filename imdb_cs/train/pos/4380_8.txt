It is a very good, lesser rated action / dramatic / and slightly historical film. The basic story is about 1000 pounds of borrowing, its theft, and the problems it causes to its family and indirectly to its clan. <br /> <br /> Cunningham (Tim Roth) is an amazing villain and character in this story. Brutally cold and when you look at his face, he seems to be able to turn his eyes and look totally evil. Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is also excellent, but I think the authors have used the word "to honor" 1 too many times. The rest of the cast is strong and the whole movie is very well played and shot. The action is exciting and the sword plays very realistic, but not too cruel. The story is good and you really want Rob to win. All in harmony with the classic.
