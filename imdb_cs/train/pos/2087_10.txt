This movie was released in the year I was born and in 2007 I will be like me 70. Last night I saw him because I did not see him from high school. While it was full of 30 sentiment, and acting was a bit stereotypical, it was great. Pearl S. Buck's story came to life through the magic of Luis Rainer and Paul Muni's chemistry. The novel, which won the Nobel Prize for Literature by Mrs. Buck, will live under Sydney Sydney Franklin's baton, which along with an excellent screenplay tells the story of a farmer farmer Wang Lung, whose father gets a bride for him, slave from the kitchen of the local landlord. In Buck's story, Wang's success is signed by his willingness to listen to his wife, most of the time and love to the ground. Eventually, he realizes that his wife, as well as the land, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. Buck's stories always had powerful women occupied in a critical spot to influence the outcome of events in the pre-feminist world. Luise Rainer, who was born in Germany, brings a pre-determined but determined rural Chinese woman into her life in an olfactory performance. Muni also captures the naive but honest Wang, who was eventually captured between the two worlds of rich and peasants. Other classic characters include Charlie Grapewin, Kansan's uncle Henry of Dorothy Gale of Wizard of Oz, Walter Connelly as a raving, sad uncle and Keye Luke as the number one son - but this is not Charlie Chan. <br /> <br /> The classic can be defined as a movie that you can watch over and over and never bother. If that's true, this movie is a classic, no doubt at all.
