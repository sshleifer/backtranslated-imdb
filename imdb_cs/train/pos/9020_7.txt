Flight theory is an eye-catching character in the study of the artist (Branagh) desiring to get rid of the boredom and mediocrity and finally the sick patient (Bonham-Carter) in the final stages of ASL, limited to a wheelchair, wishing to make love to man before dying. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham-Carter radiates joke, defiance and independence as an ASL patient, who is virtually dependent on other people to take care of her. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh, a community-led service to take care of her, complements Helen's spell with pitiless melancholy, creates a sentimental and convincing love story in which two people try to help each other to find their way to happiness before it expires time.
