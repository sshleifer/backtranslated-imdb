He caught this film at the Arizona International Film Festival. I did not expect much (although the director of the festival told me it was one of the best movies). In five minutes I was sold. The image in the black and white image lags behind the borders, this film is merry. The game is solid, the font is solid and the appearance of the movie is solid. Acting is probably the biggest revelation because most of the films shot at low budgets tend to have amateur or scenic acting. This one is not. This is one of the most convincing, cute and entertaining portraits of the Tourette syndrome I've ever seen. The conspiracy is intricate without being confusing and carefree without being free. If you have a chance, check out this movie. Movie players like Majkowski (I hope I have the right one) deserve the chance to push things to a wider audience.
