Road Rovers was a great show of superheroes of dogs who chose champions to fight crime around the world. The show was cheerful. Simple and complex jokes that can appeal to all ages. Run jokes throughout the series that could trigger a drinking game. The action was fascinating and cleverly set. The characters were very original, each with a very different personality. But what brought me to enjoy the most was the depth of my characters. Each of them has struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed, but are indicated in the subtext. Hopefully one day there will be some way to watch the rotors again.
