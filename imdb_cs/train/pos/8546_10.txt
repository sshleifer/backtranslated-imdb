This is one of the most entertaining and the best films ever made! Although I only saw forty minutes and I have to say it's a good movie. Story if it's funny and because there's sex in almost every corner of this movie. It's really funny and I do not see how she NEVER likes this movie. I really really want to watch the rest of the movie. It's a bit of a bad scene (believe me, it's not very nice), but besides, it's a great movie. The rating of this film is 7/8 for comedy, 10/10 for sexual content and 10/10 for conspiracy. If you are your American Pie fan and you want to watch a movie where there is almost all sex, buy this movie. You will be pleased. <br /> <br />
