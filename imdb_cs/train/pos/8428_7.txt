If it was earlier in Zatoichi, it could be one of the best. It's pretty good, because most of them are, but story and character are too complicated for the series at this time. The situation is extremely interesting: the farmers in the province have two champions, a blessed boss (for one) and a samurai philosopher who begins a sort of Grange; both run far away from the usual local gangsters who want the crops to fail because they increase gambling revenue and their chances for their major or powerful ally to be a seeming puritan who is death to drink and gambling but secretly accompanies his perverse taste. (It also resembles Dracula, as the villains in the later films of Zatoichi tend to continue to do so.) These characters are meaningful enough to deserve to stand up against Zatoichi as originally drawn, but he has already lost many of his nuances and changes in some characters, such as the good boss and the angry sister of the man who killed the Zatoichi, need more time than the film has to give, so the story looks jerk as if some scenes were missing. In addition, the film shows the virtues of most others in the series: a good actress, sometimes lyrical photography, the creation of a lively, incredible and uniquely recognizable landscape (the absence of which is evident in an occasional episode where the director is simply missing) and a technical quality that is hidden in its nature: imaginatively diverse use of limited sets, so their constraints do not seem to exist. And, of course, there is a main actor, whose presence, as well as his performance, does it all. It must be one of the best-kept series in the history of the film.
