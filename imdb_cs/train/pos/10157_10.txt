It's a fun glimpse of the gospel, as presented by Johnny Cash (of course decorated in black), who sings a lot and tells a little. If you like Johnny Cash, this movie is pretty nice. Also note the blond display of Jesus in this work ... just for fun, try to think about five Jewish men who have blond hair ...? Anyway, it's a fun showcase of the biggest and most important story of all.
