With this theme, it's so easy to make cheap shots. You know, a fellow with a hairy leg trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here - Adrian Pasdar is doing a great job that Gerald makes REAL, the person you care deeply about, and as a result, you feel because of his difficult situation when you try to live like Gerald and Geraldine. Not only that, but like Geraldine, it looks HOT! And the chemistry between him and Julia Walters is electric. These are two characters who feel love to each other and come, even when they look at the breakfast table simply. Even the potentially irritated signed corporate take-over line is credible and at the end you are successful. At least I did it!
