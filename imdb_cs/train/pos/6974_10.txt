I recently looked at Caprici again and thought I could come and write a review! I saw it for the first time after seeing the Battlestar Galactica final (It was a big fan of the show fans who let me hold everything I could from the show space) so I did not know what to expect ... but I'm going out with a smile, even though I have to admit ... The story begins dramatically on the planet capricum and we are introduced with different interesting characters ... I will not give too much but there is a dramatic event that dictates the course of the story, but I suggest you follow it. <br /> <br /> I have to say ... Esai Morales is a hell of an actor who pulled the young Joseph Adama. .. (Admiral's father at Battlestar Galactica) I found his acting place and I could believe he was the father of William Adama from BSG ... Also, Eric Stoltz is exactly what he's doing. ..! A special note was to see Polly Walker outside Rome! Do not sit back and watch Caprica expecting it to be like Battlestar Galactica because the story line is pretty straight ahead and someone can watch it without having to see BSG !. <br /> <br /> This show is a well written drama for those who like claw with a little sci-fi kick!
