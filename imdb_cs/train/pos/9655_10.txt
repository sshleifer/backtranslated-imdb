Maybe "Presque Rien" is not the best movie ever shot ... But it's better than many of you were saying. I have not seen a homosexual movie better than this one. <br /> <br /> You are accustomed to watching very storytelling movies with clear beginnings, development, and results. But European films are less storytelling, but you think and feel. Many of you did not understand the meaning of the movie. The purpose of this film is not to show a simple "summer-loving film," with commercial characters who "fall in love and live happily forever." Summer vacation and beach are just the background and this film is aimed at every young boy who can feel with <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < and half a stay in Nantes, Mathieu will not go to psychiatry himself, he tries to take something to suicide, and Cedric brings him to the hospital, later talking to a psychiatrist to find out why he did it - The last part is when Mathieu returns to Pornichet, winter, alone ... to think about how his life has changed, how his life has become and how he tries to find that some people can not understand it because all the scenes are but as I said before ... it's not a funny movie If anyone wants to see it's meat, that's why we have Belami movies. Presque Rien, what he wants to show us, is how cruel life can be for a young boy who is not sure about his feelings and did not know what to do in his life. Mathieu just wants to leave home and try to live the kind of life he thought he could bring happiness. But it seemed what seemed perfect at first ... later not as good as he thought, and he felt he had lost his way of life. He is lost and does not know what he really wants to do or what makes him happy. Eventually he becomes depressed and attempts to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> So, funny? It's not a funny movie. Very hot scenes? just a few .. but this is not a movie for fun. It's all about feelings ... friendship, love, happiness, misery, pain, depression, loneliness ... I, like many others, feel identified with Mathieu's life and problems, and that's what the director wanted to do. .. movies that show us the cruel reality of a boy's life. <br /> <br /> For me the best gay movie.
