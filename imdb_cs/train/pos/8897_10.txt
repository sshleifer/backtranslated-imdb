Me and my sister rented this movie because we were in the mood for someone who is dirty and not so demanding to watch. But the film has greatly surpassed my very low expectations. It is much more than just the representation of the century. He has very real portraits of characters in it and most actors do a great job. Various stories are baked together with the actual shots of a time that gives them a unique touch. While watching, I really thought I felt about what happened to the character. I also want to give Julie Stiles an endless amount of praise in her imagination about Katie, she was great, he set out! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone ..
