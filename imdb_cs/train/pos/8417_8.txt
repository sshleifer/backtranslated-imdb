While the style of this movie is not so undervalued and realistic, what would probably be the sound, it's still a very good movie. In fact, it was seen as an excellent movie at its time, as it was nominated for the first Oscar of the Best Picture (Lost WINGS). Still, I think WINGS is an excellent movie, but this is great even though it was a little more interesting to head Emil Jannings. Jannings is a general of Tsarist Russia who lives in recent days making a few dollars in the 1920s by being Hollywood extra. His luck seems to have changed when he got the call-playing the Imperial Russian General who fought the Communists during the revolution. Naturally, it is not a lot of acting-wise, but it also gets an old man to think about old days and revolution. Exactly what happens next, I'll leave to you, but it's a pretty good movie - especially at the end. By the way, look at William Powell as a Russian director. Despite being made in 1928, makeup does not look much younger than many of his later films.
