With what's happening in the world, we sometimes need an escape. Curly Sue is just that. It's not a complicated conspiracy or a profound meaning; however, it is not deprived of matter. There are more than furious actions or dramatically crazy drama. There are charming little shows that you can watch with your kids and have plenty of stuff to enjoy with your date. Try that you may like more than you think. The girl is really clever and cute. "Dad" and girl go through several routines. When a jealous friend comes in, trouble comes to Curly and the life she's known for may be torn. Fred Thompson and Kelly Lynch play a good role as the top bark, and Alison Porter and James Belushi are an interesting fable as a duo depicting the street of wise homeless people. Their worlds collide and the comedy follows.
