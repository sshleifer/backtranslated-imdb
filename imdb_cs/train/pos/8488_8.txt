I just have to throw two cents. Relax, it's a comedy. Yes, the characters are generally written and spoken. I can not think of many comedies where they are not. This is not a new version, it's video and cable transmission almost every week. Would I see it in the theater? Sure, when I first came out. It's funny ... it should be enough. Even if I did not like it at all, I still watched him on the cable for Michael Keaton. He is an underestimated and underestimated actor. I can not think of another who is so capable in every genre. I can not even think about who is just as successful. A comedic actor who is also an action star (short-lived, but still), who is also a romantic conductor who is also a dramatic actor; a villain and a hero. I can not think of anyone, at least not in Hollywood. Surely no one who has been successful in all these genres. I mean, it's Tom Cruise, but it's better for me to be Tom Cruise than to be a figure. However, it is not about Michael Keaton vs. Tom Cruise, so I'll go on. Gung Ho is worth the rent, hell is worth buying because he's probably going to find it for $ 10.00 or less at stores like Wal-Mart. Pay attention to the cable (if you have cable or satellite). It's one of those fun movies. You can give your brain a break and just relax and smile. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to ask for more, in my honest opinion, she is asking too much.
