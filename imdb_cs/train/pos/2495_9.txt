Strange, humorous and beautiful view of family life! Writer Andrew Marshall wrote something that is fun, premonitions and sometimes scary! Yes, do not be angry with the merry melody and bubble figures for kids, the show has a dark side and sometimes it can be quite cool. And that's what's on the show so good, it's not just a simplifying sitcom where every character is a 2D comic book device (case with My Family). Instead, the figures are completely rounded, showing the full mountain of human emotions. Occasionally, dark moments like Bill, who allegedly haunts a curse, and Ben waking up in a bizarre village, are two examples of surrealistic dark turn shows that help to add a bit of depth. The show is, of course, incredibly fun and is guaranteed to smile at you. It's a real shame Eureka Video has stopped publishing this comic gold on DVD. Veoh.com is your last hope of becoming unnecessary episodes in stores.
