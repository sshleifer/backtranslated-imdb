This is a very strange film by director / animator Richard Williams. Everyone who knows about William's work knows that it's a little futile (though not brilliant), but this one has a cake. He has two unfortunate ragdolls who have to save a new French doll from their owner from a lousy pirate toy and find themselves at the mercy of some bizarre characters on their way. The strength in this film lies above all in aesthetic quality; his strange characters, his strong animation and his sharp contrast sweet and scary. Williams's brilliant animation portrayed Raggedy Ann and Andy as real rag dolls, floppy disks and darned, rather than simple cartoon versions of dolls, making it more credible (at least in the visual sense). Animation is shining to bring Camel-s-wrinkled knees, whose body walks with two different personalities who dominate each end, a silent film pursuit with Sir Leonard Looney and, of course, Greedy. <br /> <br /> Greedy animation, in itself, is probably the most beautiful psychedelic animation I've ever seen. There's something about this animation that only causes your jaw to break apart - and every second it's new. Living in what was considered "Taffy Pit," Greedy is a massive blob man who lives and mercilessly enjoys sweets. She sings a song that I can not help but feel some sexual undertones, and then tries to kill Raggedy Ann for her sweet heart. The only complaint I have about this movie is that there is too much song. The pace of the film is steadily rising because it is sixteen. There are about six good songs (which should be the only ones), including "I'm Looking And What I See", "No Girl's Toy", "Blue" (though they do not need to sing it twice), "I'll never get enough" Because I love you "and maybe" I'm home ". The others seem to be useless and frankly, it is not very amazing to listen to. It's a strange movie with strange undertones, but if it's what you're looking for, you will not find better results.
