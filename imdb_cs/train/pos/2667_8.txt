I have never been a big fan of horror films. They usually try to get cheap tricks to scare their audience like loud sounds and scary kids. They usually lack originality and contain a surprising fool. The only horror movie I liked was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was great and had a great story. But that has joined and perhaps even surpassed Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, which is perhaps the worst movie ever to have been. The film follows the writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to be closed for the winter. There were rumors that the place was spooky, and the last inhabitant went crazy and murdered the family. But Jack is convinced he will be fine and can overcome his writer's block. After several months of loneliness and silence, however, Jack becomes grumpy and later violent. Is it a fever cabin, or is there something in the hotel that is crazy? One of the most exuberant parts of the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick does. The hotel is very quiet and the rooms are large but always empty. It's also quite quiet when Jack's son rides a bike across the bare corridors. The performance of Jack Nicholson is also one of his best, scaring me out of hell and making sure I get out once in a while. My favorite scene is when she talks with the spirit from inside the refrigerator. <br /> <br /> Shining is, in my opinion, culminating in horror films, beating the slices of bullshit like Ring and The Blair Witch Project. It may be old, but it is definitely good. 8/10
