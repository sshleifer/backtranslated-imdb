I love this show! It's like watching a miniature movie every week! The first episode was so stunning and frightening ... so was part 2 of the pilot ... I will definitely continue this show! This is a real Survivor! I looked at a few other comments and I see that after one or two episodes, the crazy fools are crying for the wolf ... I'm sorry if this is not a reality, girls! Once there was a time when they were ... now they're leaning! Current TV shows! And this is in fact good, unlike most of the miserable sitcoms today or ump-teenth carbon copies of the Law & Order series or NYPD Blue or CSI you are trying to see ... Watch it yourself to make your own opinion, do not take one of the bones here!
