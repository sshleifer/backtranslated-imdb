This film is one of the best American B-movies of the 1990s. If you're looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for some action, a lot of laugh, and tongue in the face of variance on cops fighting gangsters, it is well worth watching. All the villagers chew a little, but that's really what the movie is about, and everyone is quite funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have great chemistry and they need to make another movie together.
