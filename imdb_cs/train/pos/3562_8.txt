Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is the manager of the longest-established fleet in New York and needs $ 1,000 to gain a new position. He is convinced of his chances that he is betting on Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) that the missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) can not escape. "Boys and Dolls (1955)" is such a great musical because it blends sensuously the contrasting styles of film and scene. During the dazzling opening sequence, pedestrian crowds move in the rhythm, stop and start as if reacting to backstage events. Even walking alone is stylized and square, half way and dance. Mankiewicz's New York City is a shimmering wave of artistic decoration and movement, a fantastic world so completely excluded from reality that even underground gambling and criminal shamefulness seem perfectly brilliant. <br /> <br /> When I write this review, I just got the message that Jean Simmons died at the age of 80. It was unbelievable when I first saw her in the movie, yet she laughed at me from the beginning. Her idealistic and sexually suppressed Sarah comes out of her shell after a hit in Havana and lets himself relax with a cute playful rendition "If I Was Bell". Although Simmons and Brando were non-singers, producer Sam Goldwyn has decided not to sing his vocals, he says, "You may not be as good as that, but at least you are." Despite Goldwyn's intimate confidence, the pair both do well to wear the entire music numbers themselves. Simmons suggests the same livelihood Audrey Hepburn might have brought to this role, and Brando brings up such self-determination and charisma that it does not matter that his singing voice is not there.
