Greetings from this Portuguese boy :) I believe Soprano is one of the best producers at all, has reality and fiction mixed in such a way that it is hard to see the difference. It has the same quality as GodFather! James Gandolfini fits on paper like gloves! I'd love Sopranos would never end. It's perfect! It should be a subject at school :) I saw the Soprano when I was small, but I was too young to stay awake until the episode, so now I bought all episodes in DVD format and I look at all the episodes at home and after dinner and I'm addicted, like I did with Prison Break. In my opinion, Prison Break and Soprano are the best series for television. The argument of both is wonderful and the actors are perfect. Congratulations on your work. <br /> <br /> I apologize for my English. Thank you for reading.
