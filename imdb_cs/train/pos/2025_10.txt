Anny Brontes' epic novel THE DAY WILDFELL HALL should be studied and read throughout schools and libraries and dwellings. It's a fantastic story and tells the "real" truth about alcoholism and destroys marriages and mothers fighting to turn their son away from their brutal husband. It is so similar to today's stories we see and hear, and I believe that people can learn a lot to read this book. Based on the possible real experiences the author had back in the 1940s. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, its great version of the book and truly real motion. I'm sure Anna would be pleased with how she was made. Excellent acting and great location.
