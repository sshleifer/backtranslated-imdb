In Stand By Me, Vern and Teddy discuss who's harder, Superman or Mighty Mouse. My friends and I often talk about who would win the fight. Sometimes we have the absurd and compare people like MacGyver and The Terminator or Rambo and Matrix. But now we're talking about guys like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. It's a futile comparison when we see that Lee is dead, but it's fun. And if you go according to what we saw from Jet Li in Lethal 4 and Black Mask, you must at least say that he and Chan are doing well. In this film he encounters a God of martial arts. The black mask is a man who was created along with many other men to be the ultimate fighting machine. Their only purpose is to win wars that others will lose. In some ways, they are invincible. This is the premise of the film, but what it does is create all the amazingly choreographic battle scenes. <br /> <br /> Jet Li is a miracle. He can do things with the body and his body that no human being would have to do. And that's what makes him so fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In addition to the martial arts in the movie, the Black Mask is strong with humor, and it is due to the chemistry Jet and his star have a police officer. They are great together. But to be honest. if anyone reads this review, they want to know if the movie is at the start of the action department. And the answer to that is loud YES! Lots of horrible ruthless actions. You will love this movie.
