I'm a fan of C & C, I'm returning to their recordings and liked this movie, but at one point in the mid-eighties on cable television in San Jose California it was broadcast with an alternative line that destroyed the whole point of the movie. All references to marijuana have been replaced by "diamonds". The bag that "red" drops to Chong has diamonds instead of marijuana, but the interview still remains the same ("... it's worth $ 3000 / lb"). There is also a subplot in which clips of foreigners on the boat were added to observe C & C, and talk to each other about getting diamonds. In the end, instead of "space coke," it's different. I'm not sure who created this version, but it was awful and it was obvious that they were trying to make the family / baby friendly. It would be better if this network did not call at all.
