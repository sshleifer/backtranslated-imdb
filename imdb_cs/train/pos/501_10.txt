I think it has the potential to be the best Star Trek series so far, I'll say POTENTIAL ... we all know there's a chance that they'll hit the ball and run out of ideas ... BUT WE DO NOT WANT! For those who have not seen it .. SEE IT! Without the unpleasant "PRIME DIRECTION" that floats over their heads each time they encounter races, it may be cool .. and Scott Bakula was undoubtedly a great choice for Captain and Vulcan Babe is also hot (check out the decontamination scene ) I gave it a full 10 ... throws out all the other openers of the series .. I hope it will be more than 7 years ...
