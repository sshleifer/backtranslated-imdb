He had seen this film twice on community screenings and really loved him. I work in the Jane Finch community and feel that the film has actually captured some of the essence and taste of the community - granularity, determination, exuberance, creativity, in your face with a dose of despair. Writing, dialogue and acting is solid, and I really found myself in the story of a young woman, Raya, who is trying to fight for her goals and not get lost in the process. Big dance sequences not only bodies that move smoothly and with electricity, but the camera moves with great fluency and intelligence as well. All the characters are multidimensional - no good or bad, and the characters of the women are admirably strong. It is a film that has strong drumming hearts and celebrates the irrepressible spirit of youth, hip hop and communities like Jane Finch.
