"Father of Pride" was another of those good shows that unfortunately do not have a long life. And that's pretty sad, especially if you think almost always the worst shows are still in the air (think in "The Simple Life") I admit that there are many similarities with this show and "The Simpsons", but despite the similarity, the show has their own merits. Animation is just adequate, not incredible, but good. The best ones are the characters. All the animals are very nice and fun, and even Sigfried and Roy had their moments. Music was good, I liked many songs. Although the show is not very original, I think it has a lot of potential. Just like Mission Hill, which is not very famous, but I liked it very much, it was not appreciated that it deserves it. What a shame .
