First of all, I think the note below is inappropriate for such a place. You obviously do not taste and do not respect the taste of others. Do not do a lesson in history, but I think you need to do it. Black actors are just, if not more, successful than others. If you are not part of the "Black" race, you can not understand the quality, creativity and liveliness of old movies such as "Sparkle" and "Mahogany" and "Cooley High". Since, unfortunately, you are not black, you do not have the pleasure of feeling what we feel when we look at these classics, so you need your vomiting mouth to be closed and just hold on to your dance event. Thanks.
