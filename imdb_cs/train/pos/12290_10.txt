Hotel Du Nord is a gripping drama of guilt in which Marcel Carne portrays the funny story of unhappy love that also acts as a rebellion against the cruel world. The film is based exclusively on a pair of unhappy lovers. Pierre and Renee were wrong when they thought suicide would end their misery. Hotel Du Nord has its own inimitable charm because its inhabitants have become an essential part of the facility. There is an element of alliance as every guy joins Du Nord to eat, chat, etc. Marcel Carne remains true to the spirit of the films produced in the 1930s and 1940s, when Hotel Du Nord has some kind of nostalgic feeling. While re-creating the lives of Parisian roads, he was able to create a kind of nostalgia for black and white giving the unique genre of poetic realism to his oeuvre. Hotel Du Nord can be called a quintessence of cinematographic populism. The July 14 ball scene on the shores of St. Martin's Canal remains a wonderful sequence.The film im that the popularity of the hotel can be judged by the fact that the Hotel Du Nord has been proclaimed a national monument.
