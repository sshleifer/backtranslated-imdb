Recap: It's usual at the Louche Casino in Tanger. The casino is about to close and is preparing for a big deal the next day. The owner of Louche and some staff leave for the night and allow Modesta. Suddenly armed gangsters attack the casino and shoot wildly. Unknown to Modesta, he has already killed Louche, and now there's hidden money in the vault. But no one who is present and still lives in the casino knows that the code opens. The vault itself is heavily captured by explosives, so the attackers can not throw the door as planned. Suddenly, Modesta finds himself in the eyes of gangster leader Miklos in a roulette game with his life threatened. Comment: This is a review written without any link ever with other published media about the Modesty Blaise because I have not seen or read anything. The first point I like is that it is slightly incorrectly classified. At first I thought this was a thriller with a battle of reason between Modesta and Miklos as a major story. Sure, there are some explosions, but they are not really an integral or important part of the story. As mentioned in the main plot and the main thrilling scene, there is a game between Modesta and Miklos. It's an innovative and exciting way to uncover the character's background and that's why a lot of the story takes place outside the casino in a much earlier era. Someone said that it's almost like a pilot for a TV series, and the feeling is that it can actually be used as such. But I felt it was a much better way of imagining character than many others. I was by no means disappointed with the lack of action, instead I liked this game, history much more than a simple action movie. I think the two major stars, Alexandra Staden and Nikolai Coaster-Waldau, are very good. Staden, in particular, interprets Modesty very well and really carries this confident and talented figure. <br /> <br /> 7/10
