I found this movie as charming. I thought the characters were being developed, because as I watched, I found out that I was taking care of these people. This is a period that, in my opinion, occurred during depression. Separate mother, who is known as a city that appeals (she has reason to be), advertises a "husband" ad. Christopher Reeve plays an ex-con who is going to town, looking for a job. He sees the ad and goes to see her. She hires him. I really giggled because their relationship progressed because I felt easy to get into my shoes. Everything was in reality. He needs work not to be upset. And she needs his help but he does not want him to get up. They dance around the fact that they really start to need each other. Things will start to warm up until ...... big blowing. I will not ruin it by telling you what will happen. But the solution point is absolutely amazing. I thought the story was very credible for the time it takes place. I think it's one of the better "relationship" stories out there. Perhaps the younger generation will not "get", but if you are over 40, I think you will like it. And if you liked Christopher Reeve in "Somewhere in Time", you'll love it in this too.
