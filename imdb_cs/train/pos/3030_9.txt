This movie has scenes that appear to me in the most astonishing moments - this intense scene, when Mr. Muckerji told Mrs. Melandez that someone she spoke with witnessing that the girl had pulled a window from a woman who liked it to describe was one which revolves around him-the way he always refers to him-by the Greek accent "Mr. Muckerji" -and then, when Boyer discovers that she has just taken the poison and gave her the last smack to the side of her head before she dies - it's pleasure! "Fools - Fools - All Life ..." etc. Atd. - You get a point ... I have to buy it. I love the acting of Dan Seymour - usually playing some full foreign sultan or police boss, and he has appeared in Casablanca and many great shots.
