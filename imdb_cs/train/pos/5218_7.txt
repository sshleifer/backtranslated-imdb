Flora is unjustly corrupted as a smaller "rival" Se7en. There is really no reason to compare both, except for similar sceneries in the final duel. Now, if that's the case, I'll go into why the flock is very interesting in some respects. Mostly it's a rather dramatic piece than a full-fledged thriller about a very alert social worker who follows sexual offenders. At the beginning you can well realize that his work is the better. Obviously in two scenes where he first interviews the offender and kills him around him and the other when the woman tries to pick him up and everything he can think of is his standard queries from his questionnaire. Gere is very good as Errol Babbage, the aforementioned social worker. His way of doing his job is not unlike a policeman, he carries a gun and constantly checks the newspaper and provides legal officials with information if some of his "herds" can be responsible for sexual crime. He is also a man who has lost all his fortune in life, and his only relief appears to stem from the enforcement of his own vigilance of justice on his flock. You see him twice as he smiles as he apologizes for dealing with his partner roughly, and the other after he defeats a member of his herd. Like the uncomfortable film The Flock is not so successful. Quite confusing and with some irritating plot of holes, but he has a number of striking sets. <br /> <br /> Overall, Flock is a solid drama about a man who performs dehumanization work and ultimately has to work hard to avoid being swallowed by the abyss in which he surrounds himself. The world in which we live is a very sick place, and another can move away from the worst the happier it is. The herd gets it.
