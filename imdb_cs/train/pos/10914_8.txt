I saw a series of Thin Man - Powell and Loy are definitely great, but in this movie there's something very scary about Powell and Arthur's chemistry. Jean Arthur SHINES when he looks at Powell. Between them there is a buzzing backlight. This film does not have to have a joke from the Thin Man series, but no doubt it does in charm. As I watched, I thought Powell and Arthur were out of the screen. My friends thought the same thing. This is a movie in which I wish I could go back in time (to approve and block my lips with Powell!). It seems his sweet playful smirks are not over! Powell's character, Lawrence Bradford, is probably the closest thing to a "perfect man". Well, that sounds very excited, but I can not help.
