Actually, I liked this movie very much. Not because of this conspiracy, gambling, jokes, no. I liked it because it's one of the worst movies ever created. It's so poor, so bad it's becoming funny. Some jokes are really cool, but the rest makes me pray for unemployment for the screenwriter. The "Men in White" are so stupid and stupid that you can only do two things. Turn off the TV or mix on the floor (beer helps a lot :). I chose the second option.
