This show has a few clich√©s and little over the top, moments of Dawson's Bay (the 16-year-old spoke of a return trip when life made sense?) But, overall, it looks like a decent show. Most characters seem very real, and the story seemed to be moving well in the pilot - eventually ended with a good lesson. I just hope that every episode will not be the first, which would be too dramatic for this vehicle. Jeremy Sumpter does a great job as a teenager with baseball enthusiasm, I believe a lot of us could associate with his horror and sometimes a tunnel vision for the team he always wanted to take part in.
