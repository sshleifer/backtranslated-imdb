This is an amazingly-looking film with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors. When it came out more than 15 years ago, the audience overwhelmed its color scheme, which differed from anything else that had ever appeared on the film. These colors, at least for me, make this film totally fascinating. There are literally thousands of scenes that I would like to freeze and somehow turn them into painting and study them for their work of art. Characters and story do not match the size of the photo, but they are all over the top, especially villains. The famous actors who played them here must have a lot of fun on "Flatop", "Pruneface", "Lips", "Mumbles", etc. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are good as Dick Tracey and girlfriend Tess Truehart and she is as sweet and soft as her name. Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo as the young boy Dick and Tess who find themselves under their wings. Other colorful characters include Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madonna, and other names that you know but are too numerous to be listed here. Check the full credits on the main page and you will be amazed. The only negatives I found were Pacin's voice, splitting you apart, Madonin's blasted voice and the fact that the movie would be better cut for about 10 minutes. These "mistakes" are all tiny because, overall, it's a fun movie ... a cartoon element that comes alive in an incredibly colorful color ... like nothing you've ever seen.
