I saw this movie in the theater when he came out a few years ago and he liked it a lot. But I still wanted to see it again this year to see if it's still good compared to the movies that are out now and I wan say it's one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life !!! !!!!!! !!!! <br /> <br /> What you need to know is that you do not miss a minute of this movie if you do not fully observe the action you lose and you will not understand the end. <br /> <br /> The end is what makes this movie so good that you can not expect it. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the producer!
