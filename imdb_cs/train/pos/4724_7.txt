In captivity: the buried alive brings us to a resort that has just opened and will close soon. <br /> <br /> Getting Started with a guy blowing drifts to prevent avalanches. somehow it does not make sense. Anyway, he is about to blow one of the big ones when he notices that the resort is open. Despite his best efforts, the higher authority tells him that his day is over. Soon, as everyone expects, the avalanche will fall. Look, I will not reveal anymore, all I can say is that it's a B-movie designed for a family channel (which I saw and the fact that she has no ads, proves it's B-film), it's a pretty movie, but this is partly unrealistic. <br/> <br/> First, when people are buried with ice and snow, they are buried. not just traces of powder. or what about a CD with a screwdriver? it is not possible. and finally what I can not emphasize is that the explosion can not stop the avalanche, guaranteed. In addition, it is worth renting or watching TV, but not owning it. 7/10. <br /> <br /> The movie is rated PG, but maybe it should get something a bit stronger. the boy almost loses his leg in the elevator, but the foot is cut around his ankle, the guy is fired with electricity and diesel, and in the gym dead people are walking around. <br /> <br />
