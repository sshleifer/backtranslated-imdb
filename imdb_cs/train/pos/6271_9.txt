I like this movie. It was pretty cool. It has everything: cars, gun shot, fought, and even a token girl. None of these things excel, except for cars. A little shooting, a little bit of a fight, a little smoother and a LOT's car with a big hunt at the end. Jump, you can say, is impractical, but according to our good friends in IMDB it is possible, so the film is not as bad as people paint it. She has a certain quality and I like to look at it. In fact, I loved the movie. And I did not have to shut down the brains to watch them. I have not always thought, "Is that possible?" or such a tramp. 9 at 10.
