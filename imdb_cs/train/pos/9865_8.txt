I saw a movie with two adult children. Though it was not as smart as Shrek, I thought it was pretty good. There was no sound in the cinema surrounded by children who were in the spring break, so I know kids like it. It seemed that Death and the apparent death of the characters had brought about the proper flurry and remark. Hopefully, people realize that this movie was for children. As such, he was successful even though I liked it. I personally liked Scrat !!
