"Stairway to Heaven" is an excellent invention of film making, probably never duplicated. I put it between "Wizard of Oz" and "Queen of Africa," although it is a completely different type of film than the "African Queen". "Stairway to Heaven" is a psycho-drama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that, in my view, are absolutely unique. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a combination of black and white and color shots - as in Oz, but the meaning of contrast is much more than a simple - but beautiful - effect achieved in "Oz". In the "staircase", the purpose and effect of contrast can only be marked as powerful. Another great aspect of the "staircase" is the term "time" and its use. How could anyone imagine a better way to keep time up? verbatim? And then it's the staircase itself! <br /> <br /> If you have any imagination at all, you agree with me. "Stairway to Heaven" is a real jewel.
