My observation: Post-war cheer. Tom Drake and grandfather from "Meet Me in St. Louis" two years later (I was born one year). Donna Reed charming and pretty. Margaret Hamilton as always; less than the "Wizard of Oz". Spring Byington was so nicer, Hamilton was missing Hamilton, too, with the premise of a sharp little nose. The scene scene at the end with the former boy next door was cheerful. As a two-year veteran of the army tent he looked quite youthful and inexperienced when I looked into his eyes. I worked in a department store and was as elegant as this one. It is sad that it disappeared and disappeared. We were famous for these great windows that were used to attracting passers-by to shop to buy them for great goods. 10/10
