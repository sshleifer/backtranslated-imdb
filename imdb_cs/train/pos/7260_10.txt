Hello all my names Larissa I am 13 years old when I was about 4 years old, I see curly sue and it knocked my socks that I watched this movie for a long time in fact about 30 minutes ago I just did watching it. Alisan Porter is a really good actor and I love that movie It's so funny to deal with cards. Every time I look at the film, crying at the end, I said I know I'm only 13 years old, but his story is so odd that Alisan is now 25 years old. Every time I look at the movie someone is always young and the movie comes out as a year after they do it and when you see and see how the old person in the movie is really at the wounder how they can go from one age to another. Like Harry Potter. That movie was great too, but Daniel was in the first movie for about 12 years and I was around 11. How could he go from 12 to 16 in 4 years and I'm only 13. I do not know if he's 16 right now I think he's almost eighteen, but it is strange when u look at one movie and the other there about 4 years, then u when they were only 1 in the last. I'm not sure I have a lot of fantasy and I would like to nause it. I'm a kind of computer man, but I like to do a lot of kids stuff too. I'm very smart as a curly in filming, but one thing I do not like in the movie is when that guy calls a foster home and makes a curse sue I'd kill to kill that guy if he really did it in real life. Well, I stop writing, I know I sometimes write a lot, but the kids have a lot in the head they need to get out, and if the kids never get to learn. <br /> <br /> Larissa
