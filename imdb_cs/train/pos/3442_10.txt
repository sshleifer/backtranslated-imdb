This film leaves intellectual thinking and tries to analyze the story. I do not understand why people would destroy this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Jerry Bruckheimer, this movie may not be suitable for u. <br /> <br /> This film represents a high degree of realism. Performers and actors are exemplary. Not false, just natural. <br /> <br /> No special sound effects, so special side effects. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera is great, the music is oh so good. I can not wait to get a sound track. Leaves your body numb, like the constant Garderner. He has a very sympathetic talent, certainly not a successor.
