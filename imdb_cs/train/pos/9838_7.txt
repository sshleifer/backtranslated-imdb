Born Again is a good episode of season 1. Reincarnation is in my opinion cool. The more I look at it, the more I like it, but it will never rise above "Very Good" for me. Although it is not very memorable, I always remember it as an episode of reincarnation. Anyway, let me tell you what is good about this episode. <br /> <br /> Good: Oragami. Oh Yeah! <br /> <br /> That the fish tank was nice. =] <br /> <br /> Eliminated from the window. Very elegant. x] <br /> <br /> Wrong: Have a look at your best friend's wife! O_O <br /> <br /> What a random selection to reinvigorate. <br /> <br /> Why did the boy who died by having his scarf tangled try to remove the scarf instead? <Br /> <br /> Conclusion: A good episode, not very memorable. 7/10
