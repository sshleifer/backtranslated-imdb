This film deserves ten for its brilliant portraits of the world, as experienced by the playboy mind. While I discovered that this world is morally repulsive, the film best taught about what the story should tell, and it takes us through an experience we would not otherwise have. Tim Meadows so convincingly portrays Leon Phelps, and the story has dragged me into the ruthless world of Leon, for a moment I forgot to look at the playboy world's parody, and I felt compelled to recall him. In this sense, film intervention is because his big and courageous success in the narrative comes at the cost of his own success. Understanding that the vast majority of viewers will only respond to the story of this film that lies on the surface, and reject the story, I hesitate not to understand them and admit that I loved it. I loved it not only because of its fascinating knowledge of the playboy's sad mind, not only because of its entertaining depiction of the idiocy of human sexual drive, but also because of its courage to examine fearlessly what is in the shadow of heterosexuality. Besides, it's just funny.
