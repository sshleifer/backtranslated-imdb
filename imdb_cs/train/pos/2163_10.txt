I just like this movie. It is a perfect example of well-rounded, surprising stories that come from Asian cinemas. There was a recent Hollywood remake of this film, with Richard Gere and just terrible Jennifer Lopez. Please do not confuse two movies. Original Japanese film touches, gentle and amazing. The Hollywood version is exactly the opposite. I was horrified when I first saw a trailer for a reworked American version and who played in it. It's a typical Hollywood non-original harsh commercialism in the worst. This remake confirms the argument that some foreign movies can never be improved. The only reason why the original film did not become wider is the aversion of American audiences to the subtitles. One of the main reasons why this film will never work in the American narrative is that the reserved, ultra socially conservative character of a public Japanese persona is in this film. The main character will surely awaken to a fuller understanding of living a live life through dance, but half of the film's tension comes from stereotypes and mocking ballrooms in Japan. <br /> <br /> Try to look at this movie in its original form, not on a terrible full screen. And please, please skip the American remake ... it's shallow intimidation compared to the original Japanese film. Yes, I know the "original" movie is much older and it's just Japanese what will soon become apparent, and that new and new American remake. <br /> <br /> When we talk about foreign films, I'll make some quick recommendations: 1. Monsoon Wedding - I'm getting to know it first because of a great movie! 2.Johnny Stechino - Very funny Italian misidentification flick! 3.Shiri-Korean action pic, which combines both Asian flare and American style plot 4.Run Lola Run-German film that integrates its techno scores ingeniously. Well, just a quick list as well:).
