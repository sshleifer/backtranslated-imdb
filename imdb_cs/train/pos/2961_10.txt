This is the only film by David Zucker, which does not release anything of its kind. The most amusing film 98 with Roxbury Night behind Me But I did not think that Theres about Mary is fun, so it does not count except the French and bean thing he. Do not listen to critics especially Roger Ebert he does not know solid fun just check out his reviews.Anyway to see that wont be dissapointed
