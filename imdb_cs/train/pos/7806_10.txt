"Cry Freedom" is not just a movie. It is a historical account, a heroic story and insight into the cultural environment of a major event in history. It's not just that Denzel Washington does a terrific job that sounds like a motivating hero, Steve Biko, but he reports to the public about South Arfrican Apartheid. The story of Bik, the influential leader and his main "influence," Donald Woods, is heartbreaking. But the ultimate success of his life may go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa. "Cry Freedom" can tell their audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot. It's because of big movies like this that the public can learn about the terrible events in history, the great leaders who tried to end them and never let them happen in the future. Because of this importance, "Cry Freedom" is an amazing movie that everyone should see.
