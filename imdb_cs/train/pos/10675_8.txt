For a long time, I wanted to see this movie, be a fan of both Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I agree that the romantic partial conspiracy is a waste of time, but the talent of this society is experiencing this role. Thank you to the heroes behind Turner Classic, which broadcast a show last week. I can imagine that there were a lot of problems with the kids after the war, especially as things happened in the 1950s. Some boys are a little frightening. I certainly would not want to meet them on a well-lit street, much less dark. There were also some good insights about the feelings of a fiery bomb or, as they say, a fire.
