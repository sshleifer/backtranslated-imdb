Delivering some very humorous enemy lines by Pierce Brosnan stands alone at the cost of admission. He plays a "James Bond Double Brother" who has been separated since birth. As an intense hit-man, his character is very sexual, but even better, very funny. Add a nice and noble American "guy beside," Greg Kinnear to create a contrast. Many places, vibrant colors and quick humor provide great entertainment. "I hope Davis is well-liked as a" gem wife, "but the film focuses on two boys, a new" odd couple ", and that's the part that works very well, they have laughter (maybe R-rated) , where the story goes a little deeper.
