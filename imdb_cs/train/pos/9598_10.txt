I was following a trip two years ago on the Internet - now I've seen a movie! What a ride! And what kind of trip does Darius Weems know! Such a brave, wise, entertaining and talented spirit! And what crew! Listen to Darius, who laughs that he is in the water in Panama City, see his fear of being too close to alligators in Louisiana, a miracle in his eyes as he goes in a hot air balloon, the excitement of rafting over some rapids, betting to eat a wasabi spoon, and the phone calls home and as always - boys will be boys. This film must be seen by everyone - young and old. Darius and his mother are models of strength and courage. And crew members are tests to the heart of the younger generation. Dalius got a new wheelchair; documented accessibility issues; they took Darius for a trip of his life; and touched many, many lives. By raising awareness of DMD and supporting research funding, this film will contribute to achieving the ultimate goal of Darius Goes West - a DMD drug.
