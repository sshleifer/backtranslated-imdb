This movie saw him for the first time yesterday, and he enjoyed it thoroughly yesterday. I am a student of screenwriting, and I loved the way in which minority characters struck when something pivotal / climatic appeared in the scene. I thought the dialogue was very sharp and the premise of the story is rather shocking - at one particular point Barbara Stanwyck openly flirts with her daughter's daughter; And she awoke to her husband a passion she had not seen in ten years; And with the shot signal "two shots and then one" will connect with his old shag to a Dutchman (the reason why he left the city first!) YET ALWAYS! The moral majority must be utterly enraged when they see how this occurred in the 1950s. Love for costumes and cinema and straight from hip dialogue - just to watch Barbara Stanwyck and What to do "Bunny Hug is a good reason to rent this movie on DVD." One of the best movies from the period I have seen for a long time.
