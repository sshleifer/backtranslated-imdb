This film is forbidden in almost every foreign country I think. Japanese people (?) Who stars in this must be really desperate to work, or we are just friends. Here are the blades: The three martyrs tortured the hell out of a helpless woman, using all sorts of things to kill her, burn her, kick her, turn around in the chair (over 200 times!), Use the torture sound (forced to listen to the static sound after more than 20 hours! That does not sound so bad at all, but it can make you go nuts). They take her sad (probably from the animal) as she goes off, and she scares when she wakes up. And who can forget about the grande finale the most beautiful eyes from the eyes I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> If you did not hear about these movies and watch them without knowing that it's a simulated snuff, you'll think it! (Just Ask Charlie Sheen) This is guaranteed to scare people and make some sick! As I said purely underground. See if you are a fan of underground horror or a strange gore. If I'm not really recommended to read the series before watching! From the point of view of gore, shock and creativity, he gets 10, but from happening and all that stuff is 1. Underground classic ... <br /> <br /> My final score is 8/10 <br />
