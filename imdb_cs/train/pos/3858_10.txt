Paul Verhoeven's American director has different qualities, but most of the films he has made in his native country are undisputed masterpieces. This is the story of an alcoholic (and bisexual) writer who moves with a beautiful rich and very strange woman. But the lady does not know she's just interested in meeting a feminine lover. Meanwhile, the writer is plaguing strange visions - initially they look like hallucinations caused by alcohol abuse, but he soon becomes aware that he is actually experiencing some premonitions. Fascinating thriller Hitchcockian, very original and provocative. I love movies that make you think they are about something, but then you realize it's something completely different. This is one of those films; a thriller during the first half and a quasi-religious surrealistic saga during the second half. Very erotic, original and blasphemy, not for children or people who go to church every Sunday. Great cinematography of the future director, Jan de Bont. Highly recommended!
