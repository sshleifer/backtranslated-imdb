I own Ralph Bakshis the forgotten masterpiece Fire & Ice at the old OOP video shop. <br /> <br /> One thing is better than any other Conan-esque movie you've ever seen. Sure, it's so cool, but who cares? It was a test of time, and the only way the cheese looked like is the comparison with modern fantasy epics like LOTR: FOTR (although I love the movie.) The plot goes like this: After the battle between fire and ice, King's daughter is kidnapped by Jaroles (Ice) creatures, while the only survivor of a village victim rescues her. Yeah, it does not sound like an original like Sister Betty, but that's no reason. It's really reviving an interesting concept of the world of two enemies: Fire & Ice. And that will do. <br /> <br /> As for action scenes: excellent. They are well processed, they have a terrible suspicion, and they have lots of loud sounds. Just look at the climate battle, now it's over! And negotiation and dialogue: Competent. Really. They will not be nominated for the Oscar, but they are all right and they will not get nervous. Animation is pretty good. Shot on 3D and rotoscoped (I think), it looks pretty good. Many backgrounds look really detailed and well-drawn, and though the characters are a bit dimensional, they are all right. Overall, this is a gentle neglected little jewel and enjoys more than any superficial "fun". 10/10
