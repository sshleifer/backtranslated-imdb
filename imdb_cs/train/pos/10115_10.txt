This film deals with the atrocities in Derry thirty years ago, which is generally known as the Bloody Sunday. The film is well researched, acted and directed. It's so close to the truth we reach until the result of Saville. The film presents murder in the context of the time. It also shows the wildness of soldiers on the day of atrocities. There was also a disgraceful white wash that was related to the Widgery Tribunal. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is an excellent track that moves and is shocking. When the Saville report appears, take a look at the movie again to see how close it is to the truth.
