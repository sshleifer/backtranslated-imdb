It's so rare to find a movie that provides a plot that can not be found at every step. Surprise in the whole body will delight. A few things I could not fully understand is that you have a leading female figure who plays a "good girl, a hardworking worker," and yet eventually ends up being a person who is against social risk. It was not enough to be disliked, but it gave me a break. The second thing I could not get was the old man who was torn off by the police at the very end of the movie. I never found out who he is or what his problem is. If anyone has any ideas, I'd like to hear what it can be like. The movie was exciting and fun and always let me guess. It's worth seeing.
