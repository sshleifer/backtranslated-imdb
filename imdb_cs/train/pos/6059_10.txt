This is an excellent documentary, full of racing events of beautiful pictures and a great story. IMAX cameras give you a very broad perspective because the DVD movie is perfect. You hear all the speakers working almost all the time, the film is not accelerated and just gives you a natural atmosphere of 230 mph. Of course there are some sound effects added, but I think they are good, they give the depth of the control scene ...
