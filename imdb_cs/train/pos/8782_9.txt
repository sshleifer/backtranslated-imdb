Freely based on James Corbett's biography, "The Roar of the Crowd," Gentleman Jim is a gorgeous image that perfectly encapsulates not only the rise of Corbett's pugilistic prancer, but also the winds of change in sports boxing around 1890. The story follows Corbett, from his humble start as a bank collector in San Francisco, through a casual fight with a former boxing champion who eventually leads him to fight against the terrible world weight heavyweight champion, John L Sullivan {beefcake personalized wonderfully Ward Bond}. Not all the fighting is in the ring, and that's all that reflects the wine in Corbett's life, which makes this spectacular funny picture. There are problems that need to be overcome (they play perfectly when club colleagues pay for a pin or two to be eliminated) and Corbett must not only fight for respect from his so-called peers, but also have to overcome his ego as he grows as fast as has his reputation. Together with the stunning Corbett family and all their stoic humorous support, Corbett's journey is as charming, as joyous, though he is so cruel and courageous, that he is a very kind character, and is a character that fits into the marked as he gets to Gentleman Jim. The film is not glimmering for one moment, and it is a testimony by director Raoul Walsh that although we are impatiently waiting for the final fight, the outer ring holds us tightly enjoying this picture {thank Alexis Smith}. Combat sequences are really evolving and perfectly showing how Corbett has become a champion, his brand of dancing rings around fighters is now firmly placed in boxing history. When the ultimate role rolls up, we all descend to the ground as if struggling between Sullivan and Corbett to put all the brutality into context, and that's where humility and humility become a clear winner and as far as this viewer is concerned ... ..... ... it will surely be certain for me, 9/10 for a really amazing picture.
