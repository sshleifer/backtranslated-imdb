I understand that Paramount wanted to do it with Rodgers and Hart, but could not solve copyright problems, so Burke and Van Heusen, who wrote the most songs for Bing Crosby, <br /> I read Leonardo Maltin, who says , that this movie "sits like a glove on Crosby" and I could not do it better. No, it's not a satire Mark Twain, it's a Bing Crosby movie, and in 1949 Crosby was the strongest star in Hollywood. Once Paramount used technicolor and Rhonda Fleming was never more beautiful on the screen. She was a woman who was invented by a technicolor. <br /> <br /> The origins of Brooklyn William Bendix are out of the ordinary, but it's a good comic effect. Trio Crosby, Bendix and Sir Cedric Hardwicke have a bad time with Busy Doing Nothing. Bing has one of his patented positive philosophical figures with If You Stub Your Toe on the Moon. The third song she sings Once and For Always himself and Rhonda Fleming. That song was nominated for the best song, but Baby It's Cold Outside was lost. <br /> <br /> Nice too that Bing managed to score scores for Decca with Rhonda Fleming and Bendix and Hardwick. One thing I like is that it shows Crosby's comic talent without Bob Hope. I love Road paintings, but Bing was a comic talent wearing and this film is better off than any other. <br /> <br /> This is Crosby at the top of his game.
