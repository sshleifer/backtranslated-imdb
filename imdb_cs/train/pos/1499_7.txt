For fans of Hammer-style horror films in 1970, this film should be a cure. The only thing I did not like in the movie was the fact that Peter Cushing was useless in the worst episode. Generally, however, it is a hard, scary little film. If it's not the best Amicus movie, it's definitely one of them. The best episode that has been legally stamped is the one that portrays Jon Pertwee as a horror actor - it's really great. Just as Pertwee was in this role, it's hard to believe he did not do more of these types of movies. All in all, it's a fun movie that has terrified me like a child, and that still gives me a mold.
