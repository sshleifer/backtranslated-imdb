Indeed, the story of two fragile brothers and their respective falls of grace (drug addiction) and later redemption. One brother, the self-appointed genius played by James Franco, is your typical sensitive but intelligent person-child. The second brother is a hard-working future physician who becomes less critical, as he becomes the prey of addiction while coping with the stress that he meets his family's expectations for both children. They do not want to be too heavy to serve as drug bulls, and that's all quite realistic about the family dynamics that drug problems pose. I would recommend it to anyone interested in such studies of nature and praised James Franco for his efforts on what was obviously the work of love.
