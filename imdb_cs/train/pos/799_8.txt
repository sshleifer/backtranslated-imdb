he is a major narcissist and manipulator; in this case, Tom Capano's attorney (and assassin) shows up. Kathryn Morris is sympathetic as a victim, Anne Marie Fahey, but she is too victimized at first. We apologize for the situation, but at the same time becomes disgusted after we saw his victimization of several other women (including Rachel Ward). The sad part is where she really helps her with her self-confident problems and Capano actually let her psychologist kill. Pretty hard to believe, but it was based on a true story. It's a portrait with Olympia Dukakis (excellent) as Capano's mother. A totally interesting story because it's based on a real murder and you want to read the Ann Rule book to get the exact details. 8/10.
