That's so exciting! After seeing "La Roue," a short and light little movie this afternoon, I find it a real experience! This is absolutely wonderful and one of the most beautiful pictures I've seen this year. It is much more amazing as it is an early talk, and thanks to its innovative use of cinema sound, some great 1930s images are lost in depth. It's just full of music and a cute mood that is really optimistic and down, it made me happy! Obviously, it would not be so hard to get a lottery ticket that men were looking for, but the tempo is so exciting, and the movie is so amusing that I did not think about it twice. The comedy is often cheerful and I think it's even better than the Marx brothers, perhaps the greatest comic power of the time. This is rather perfect.
