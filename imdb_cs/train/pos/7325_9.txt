Halloween John Carpenter is a frankly horror masterpiece. It tells the immortal story of an escaped mental patient, Michael Myers, who returns to his hometown at Halloween night to pack and kill a group of babysitters. This was the first and certainly the best in the Halloween franchise. Carpenter has a great restraint in how the story develops very slowly, unusual for a horror picture. <br /> <br /> It is still unusual that there is no blood and gore, and still remains the most important Halloween. Get it! <br /> <br /> Halloween marked Jamie Lee Curtis's debut film and defining a point in Donald Pleasance's late career. True Classic.
