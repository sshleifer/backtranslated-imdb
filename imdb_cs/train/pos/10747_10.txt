Gédéon and Jules Naudet wanted to make a documentary about modern firemen from New York. What they received was the only film record at the World Trade Center on September 11. When he worked with James Hanlon, Jules went with the captain to check and repair the gas leak, while Gédéon stayed in the event of a fire if something interesting happened. The airplane flying over the city distracted Julele and pointed the camera up, a few seconds before the aircraft hit Tower One. Jules asked the captain to follow him into the towers. The first thing he saw was two fires, something he refused to shoot. He stayed for the next few hours, filming the reactions of firefighters and others who were there. The Naudet brothers took care to make the movie too strict, grizzly and cruel. But the tongue from the firefighters is a bit rough and CBS showed a lot of spheres explaining it without censorship. Naudet brothers mixed shots they filmed with one-on-one interviews, so firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during specific moments of crisis. <br /> <br /> Unlike a feature-length movie, most of the DVD sales go to a 9/11-related charity. A very well-done, emotional, mobile, and plain political propaganda is the best document of this kind.
