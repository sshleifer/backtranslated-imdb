I thought it in a GOOD way, believe me. It is true that life is not. The whole Oirish thing is a little dense, but you have the cast - Flynn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Frawley, etc. All good. I also liked to see Mike Mazurki - of course he was a boxer, what else? Typical forties include moving faces and familiar faces and fast-moving scenes in succession. Flynn is okay like Gentleman Jim, you never come across one dimensional view of him or the others, I suppose, but it's all right, it's a cartoon and she wanted to please, that's all. Boxing scenes were pretty good, Wude Bond's logging in vaudeville was a revolt, and you had to see that all the bee billyclubs are coming to the scene a couple of times. <br /> <br /> Really funny, Flynn was on the roll at the time and it's clear why the audience loves. <br /> <br />
