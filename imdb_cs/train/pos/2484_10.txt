Olivier, Kosentsev, Richardson, Coranado, Zefferelli and Almerayeda all run Hamlet, but Branagh is the only one who did it right. This is the only film "Hamlet" that contains all four hours of William Shakespeare's masterpiece and gives a unique feel for the whole story. Many directors could take it without bothering their audience, but Branagh is a skilled use of bravo film style and stunt lets people see the meaning of the scene that is usually cut out. Examples include Gerard Depardue as Ranyaldo, whose overall purpose in the film was simply to say "yes, my lord," as Polonius calls him to spy on Leartes. It also included Billy Crystal as a robber, Robin Williams as Oscar, Jack Lemmon as Marcellous and Charlton Heston as an actor. Branagh's version of Act 4 scene 4 soliloquy out) is nothing but a movie miracle because the camera slowly pulls back as the intensity grows. It's a scene that I really wanted to jump out of my chair and start applauding. Branagh is the only filmmaker to understand the importance of each scene in this movie, and he knew how to explain this importance to the general audience. <br /> <br /> This must be seen for anyone who likes a good story, brilliant acting and incredible direction. All these part William Shakespeares the greatest triumph.
