Personally, I could not get to "This Is Not Love Song", it's a great movie and there's a great story line, just found myself checking the time on my phone every two minutes to see the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I love the relationship between Spike and Heaton, where they are so close to themselves that they get to life. At the same time, I wish the relationship was more than what it is. Heaton is in love, but Spike Ibsen't is in love with Heaton, or he does not know how to love him. The effects of betrayal on both sides have a great effect on two men. Both are destroyed by the fact that the other fled and left them at a time when they really needed to survive each other.
