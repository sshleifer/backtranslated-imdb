Perhaps one of the most important and enjoyable Greek films I have seen in the last ten years. An excellent performance (especially yiannis zouganelis is great), a well-written script and effective direction from a very special, for Greek, very average standards, author. The film, apparently influenced by the fearful dogs Sam Peckinpah, could be a masterpiece if he eventually avoided some obvious and exaggerating situations and symbolism. However, it is a film that deserves our attention and belongs to this rare category of Greek films that should be watched outside of Greece. It is a pity that she did not work commercially in Greece, in addition to other fake and frantic major productions such as Politiki Kouzina.
