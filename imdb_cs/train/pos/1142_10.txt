until HBO starts again this month. I remember how I laughed out loud in the theater in 1991 and now again in the living room. If I see it turned on, I have to look at it. There is no doubt. This is much more fun for me than other, more popular spoofs like Airplane! (which I really like, BTW). Cathy Moriarty, in my opinion, is a steal show. Quotes like "Sudden speech! The last symptoms of the cerebral blood vessel!" put me over the edge. And Whoopie Goldberg was not that funny about 'Jumpin' Jack Flash '. Kevin Klein, Sally Field, Robert Downey Jr. they all turn into excellent performances as expected. I started out doing this ten out of ten stars, but then I realized that the type of movie is supposed to be, there's nothing I can change or improve. So 10 is. I have to get it on DVD, that's all.
