The old family story told by two young girls about their grandfather is revived 16 years later, as he predicted. People are murdered and the blood is spilling and the rats are still shaking and the naked bodies are suspicious, but we know it's not a murderer. Is it Franziska (Marina Malfatti)? Is Evelyn back from death for revenge? Is it a conspiracy to steal an inheritance? The color is great in this thriller by Emilia Miraglio, just what I did just one other Giallo, as far as I know. The only thing that broke the film was the appearance of several frames. Somebody calls the police and suddenly tries to save Kitty.
