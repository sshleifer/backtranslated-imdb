Good. This film is pure pleasure. It sometimes has such violent horror mixed with little suspicion and a lot of black comedy. The dentist actually starts to lose his mind and it's nice to watch how he does it. This movie is for some people, though. Either you will love yourself or you will completely hate it. A good movie to rent and watch if you do not have anything else to do. Also recommended: Psycho III
