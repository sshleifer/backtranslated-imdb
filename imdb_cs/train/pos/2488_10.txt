For me, the final scene in which Harris responds to the press association is worthy of seeing this intelligent and timeless policy dimension (especially the campaign phase). If only the intelligent, articulated way that only half the people in real life, like Mr Harris, would react, then the arrogant, self-serving members of the press might think twice before an irrelevant, confrontational "waste" emerging that has absolutely nothing with the capabilities of the candidates effectively manage the tasks of the office he is following.
