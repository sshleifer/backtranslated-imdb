I am the parent of a special baby and I liked the movie very much! It was nice, warm and fun. I've learned to see humor in things long ago. Especially I thought it was sweet as all the other characters cared about Frankie and who would take care of him after his grandmother died. Prior to the film, I took part in film gathering with other parents and siblings of children with special needs. The film enjoyed everyone and really inspired wonderful discussions. We talked about how our children laugh at us, and we also talked about how we care about them. The writer talked about how she worked with autistic children and other children with special needs as a volunteer for several years. She founded the character on a real person. Our family is blessed with the sense of humor we received during very stressful times. I give the film two inches up!
