I watched this show on the basis that it reminds me that it reminds me of David Lynch's Twin Peaks - a show I admire. The show soon began to bring us to the main characters, and in a somewhat unusual way the pilot episode is the best, very dramatic and really gets the whole bad side of the show that is ready for the rest of the season. My only criticism is that I was a little bit misunderstood - probably not my own fault because it was canceled for just one season, it seemed to show that they have a lot of potential and deserve much better treatment than it did. The show is great and this show has some of the best characters (good and bad) I've ever seen are well developed in a short time. There is a special cheese effect for the first 5 or 10 shows that are a bit too dramatic, but it is repaired as the season progressed. It's a lot worth watching, definitely something extraordinary!
