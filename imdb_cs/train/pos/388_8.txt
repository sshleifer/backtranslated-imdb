... and I love it. A lot of special effects and for a movie that is not created on a mega budget, this movie really does a great job of creating a fantastic masterpiece. I'm one of those guys who did not understand the story, but it was still a great movie to watch. It's definitely out there in standards that go beyond Boring Rings and in the same place with movies as Harry Potter. Which again means something for a movie that is divided into a fraction of the budget of these international hits. One thing I really love is the fact that an envelope of an adventure film coming from Hong Kong is coming up. The theme is exotic and original. Production quality is unlike anything seen coming out of HK for fantastic action film and acting is great. One of the best films in Hong Kong, this is the film Infernal Affairs of Hong Kong fantasy film, and I hope they will continue to work in this area until they overcome Hollywood adventure films. <br /> <br /> Just fantastic.
