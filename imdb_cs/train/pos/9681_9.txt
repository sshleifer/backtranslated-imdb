Add Paulie's parrot to your favorite animal character movies. This movie is a Love Story - Bird and Gene Rowlands, a Bird and Beloved Mary, Michael and Marie. The Russian Porter helps the talking and thinking parrot find his rightful owner many years after Marie's parents have sold him to the pawnshop. Before we end the warming of the heart, we learn all the bad cases of Paulie. Cheech Marin and his dance parrots are amazing. Beautiful photo all over. A great little movie from the mouth will be popular with him.
