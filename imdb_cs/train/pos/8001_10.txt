Surely one of the best movies I've ever seen. Outstanding direction and flawless action make this very fun and often moving movie. Denzel Washington played one of his most intriguing and emotional roles to date, and the rest of the cast is beautiful. Christopher Walken, of course, is excellent in his part, although he does not seem as often as I like him. The story of the Greatest Greed, which is slowing down, is compensated by childish indifference and love. It's also a movie for action movie lovers because it has a fair share of bullets, missiles and vengeance. The location of the city in Mexico adds a sense of seedliness and corruption, which is by itself the opening of the eyes. Overall, it's a truly gripping film from start to finish. Highly recommended!
