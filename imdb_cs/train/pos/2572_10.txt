I thought it was a very funny movie. I like dog movies and comedy movies so combined that they were twice as good. K-9, k-911 and k-9 PI are my favorite movies. Jim Belushi is hysterical and Jerry Lee is cheerful and adorable to make a great team. The only downside is that I really did not understand how Dooley's wife died. She died before this movie, but how? If they said that, I had to leave it. Other than I put two inches / tails up! These dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) had a lot of training. They were so funny, and all the sounds Jerry Lee did when talking to Dooley was so funny. my favorite was when Jerry Lee sang and when he would bite nations private to get information very very funny lol
