One thing about Hollywood, someone is successful and always nasty to be copied. And another thing is that players give some of their best performances outside their home studio. Rock Hudson won such awards for his performance in the Texas Giant film, which the Universal Managers had to think, into another modern Texas environment. Likewise, Robert Stack received great reviews for The High and Mighty as a pilot who was cruising under the strain of a flying damaged plane that it was natural to give him another bursting up. <br /> <br /> Both of these goals were achieved in a written wind text. Before Hudson was the big owner of the ranch, he is now the son of a hunter's companion, Robert Stack, who took Hudson under his wing. In other words, the James deans of James Dean from the Giant. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall is the executive secretary of the advertising agency that Stack's Hadley Oil Company uses. Hudson loves her, but she is blinded by Stak's millions, and when she does the girl, she has the means to actually run her campaign. She takes Stack. And last but not least, we have Dorothy Malone, a stacked amoral sister who only has Rock, but Rock does not need to get in touch with this wild child. Dorothy Malone spent more than 10 years in a number of roles of colorless movie heroes before joining this gem. She was awarded the Best Actress Award for her role as Marilee Hadley and she was well deserved. If you like sleeping techicolor Fifties soap opera before it's a movie for you.
