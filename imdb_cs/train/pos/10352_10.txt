Religious bigotry is ubiquitous. Australia is not immune. Dingo caught the baby and her mother was tried and sent to prison for "killing" her own baby. I do not think I'd spoil the story, but you need to know the basic information before you get into the depths of what caused her to find her inside the prison. Buying or renting a movie and finding out how deeply rooted human hatred to those who are still continues to benefit all over the world. <br /> <br /> This is a very moving movie with an amazing actor. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep (with his famous accent Aussie) and Sam Neill, whose accent is his native pronunciation, are excellent. Those who have supportive roles are also quite good. <br /> <br /> You will remember this movie for many years. <br /> <br /> Look!
