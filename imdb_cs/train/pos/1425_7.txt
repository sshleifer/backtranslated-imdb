Like Al Gore shuddered with painfully honest and cleverly presented documentary film "Inappropriate Truth," directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield also remind us that it is time to improve our way of life to save our beautiful planet. The "Earth Planet" is also a challenge that global warming of our planet has disastrous consequences for all living beings around the world. Al Gore showed us the Earth's immortal future by showing solid facts based on documented examples through long but always interesting monologues. The creators of this document choose a different but equally powerful way to do so. We do not represent a future representation of what might happen on our planet if we did not radically change things, but rather show us the true beauty of the Earth in its amazing glory. We see places we knew existed, but never thought they could be so beautiful. In this film, we see a wide range of the most extraordinary places, such as deserted deserts, giant forests full of fauna and flora, and the icy landscapes up to the eyes. And in all these enormously different environments, we see the most beautiful animals that try to survive. That's exactly the film that had to be made in combination with the Al Gore movie. To realize that our planet is too expensive to concentrate on it. The vote by Patrick Stewart is always relaxing and therefore very well done, though it sounded initially as if I was watching the X-Men movie instead! Cinematography is probably the most remarkable thing in this document. Occasionally: what you see is so unreal that you tend to forget that a person with a camera had to really shoot all the beautiful shots. In short: This is certainly a necessity for everyone because it concerns every person on this beautiful planet Earth! The truth is, I never thought our planet was so wonderful!
