I really enjoyed this thriller! I wanted to see it again when it was over. Cast was great, the plot was thrilling and fun and it was just a nice movie! I would appreciate it as one of the best thrillers I've ever seen! The girls were really cute, especially Denise Richards. She was very ornate during the film and gave her character some OOMPH!
