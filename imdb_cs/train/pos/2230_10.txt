I've been searching for this movie for years. I was 14 years old when I believed it was broadcast on television in 1983. All I remember was that it was a teenage girl alone who had survived an air crash and survived the Amazon. I remember people searching for it (family) and knowing how to take care of themselves - the story tells and I notice about it that I knew the bugs were under the skin. I do not remember much about this movie and I want to see it again - if it's the same - and if any of you have a copy, could you send me an email at horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? I'd be curious to get a copy to see if it's actually the same movie I remember. It was broadcast on Thanksgiving (US) in 1983, and I went through my own troubles and this film really hit me. Thanks in advance!
