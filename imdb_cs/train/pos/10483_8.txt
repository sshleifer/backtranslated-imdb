Yes, this movie is predictable and definitely unrated. But then they do not try to be anything that is not. Funny splash with real funny stars, a starry and very entertaining performance by Peter O'Toole, grounding and acting on the ground by Joan Plowright. The performance of the band was in place, each playing its role skillfully and comically. The music was good, though not so great, but it filled the film nicely. From some negative comments, I deduced that the humor of some humor was overhead. A good example is a commentary on a "strange baseball game", well, my dear American, it was cricket - of which baseball originated - and the explanation of the American band's ignorance was very fun for those who know cricket. No, you should not have fun when Carl broke the window; it was funny how Lord Foxley said "oh yes!" get more money to break and the manager said at the same time "oh no" also referring to money. Jeez, it seems that every joke must be explained to some people ... Everything I enjoyed it and I was laughing! It's worth seeing.
