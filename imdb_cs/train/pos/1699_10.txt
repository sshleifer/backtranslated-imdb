This is the jewel of the film not only for people who like fun and strange space, but they love the history and tradition of Sci-Fi and Classic Hollywood. Every Martian crew alien is the embodiment of a classical sci-fi character or a member of the Hollywood royal family, and it is a real pleasure to see how Big Bean inhabitants bounce off.
