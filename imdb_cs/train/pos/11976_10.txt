This show is about three little girls. (D.J., Stephanie and Michelle) Their mother murders a drunken driver so their father Danny invites his brother-in-law (Jesse) and his old friend (Joey). So the whole show is about live life. Girls are experiencing life problems and have lessons of life. There are gossip, friends and many others. The whole show is basically going with the stream. You do not have to keep the courage you just have to leave. I think this show is really good and fun. I grew up watching this show and still watching it. I'm glad they're still broadcasting this show on TV. I see it almost every day. I rate 10/10.
