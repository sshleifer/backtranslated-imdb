Fay Grim is a true example of what I call a completed puzzler's film. It has all the pieces of acting, direction, storyline and entertainment. They all come together and when they do, create a masterpiece, Fay Grim. This film follows Mother Fay Grim, who is trying to raise his son so that he does not grow up to be a father who has fled the law and disappeared. Soon the CIA will meet Fay in a desperate attempt to search for eight magazines of her husband Henry. These journals were filled with acknowledgment of his long history in the CIA and his engagement with countries and their governmental steps. Fay is sent to find these magazines to release her brother from prison and is sent to a European walk with a cat and a mouse to retrieve these journals and learn about the secrets of her husbands she never knew. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey was an actress I liked when I watched her in OH in Ohio and Best in Show. She brought life to her two comedy roles, but Fay Grim was a much different role than the other two films. Posey believed me what was happening on the screen, I felt for her, I rooted her and wanted to know more. It catches you when it's on the screen and when it's off, you can not stop thinking about what's going on with it. I have not seen any previous work by writer / director Hal Hartley, but I believe I will look at some of his older films if they are half as good as Fay Grim. If you decide to make a smart film the next time you decide to borrow a movie or buy a DVD, I would urge you to choose Fay Grim. If you have some common sense about what movie you should be, you will enjoy this movie immensely.
