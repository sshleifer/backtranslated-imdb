this is a wonderful movie, making the 1950s look beautifully stylish. Kim Novak is interesting and attractive as a modern witch with one foot in Manhattan and the other at infinity. All of the supporting performances are amazing, from Jack Lemmon, when he harasses Nicky Ernie Kováček as the Magic Magician in Mexico who works on Magic in Manghattan, Else Lanchester as a little bunch and witch of Aunt Queenie. And then there is a cat - I have no idea how many witches (except me) name a cat Pyewacket, but suggests a zillion. Jmes Stewart looks out of place, but only as little as his character outside the psec in this strange subtext of spells and witchcraft. Perfect. And she has the perfect romantic happy ending that we believe, because the films from this vintage have the happy endings. Gillian and Shep are sure to have such a chance to be happy after Rose and Charlie Allnut in the African Queen (another great movie)
