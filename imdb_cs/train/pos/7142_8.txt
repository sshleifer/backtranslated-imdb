The Holes, originally a novel by Ludwig Sachar, has successfully transformed into a fun and well-filmed movie. In the lead role of Sigourney Weaver as administrator, Shia Labeouf as Stanley and Khleo Thomas as Zero, the roles were very well cast and the actors portrayed their roles well. The film had an inter-weaving plot that all led to the end. The main story is Stanley Yelnats and his punishment spent one and a half years in Camp Greenlake. The second story is Sam and Kate Barlow. This conspiracy deals with racism and is a deeper story of the film. The third is Elya Yelnats and Madame Zeroni, who explain the Yelnats family's 100-year curse. In my opinion, these events were very well connected. <br /> <br /> Unlike many people's beliefs, I do not think you need to read a book and understand the movie. The film is understandable. The film was greatly produced, especially Shia Labeouf (Stanley), Khleo Thomas (Zero), Sigourney Weaver (manager) and Jon Voight (Mr. Dear Sir). Other members of D-Tent, Jake Smith (Squid), Max Kasch (Zig-Zag), Miguel Castro (Magnet), Byron Cotton (Armpit) and Brenden Jefferson (X-Ray). However, the best parts were with Zero and Stanley, who created a great team together. Though Holes is a Disney movie, it deals with some serious issues such as racism, shooting and violence. Dramatization is very good at some points. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to people of all ages, whether they read the book or not. You should not miss it.
