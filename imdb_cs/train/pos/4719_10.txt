This movie is why I found this website. I did not find this movie anywhere else! I'm so glad we found it! We've seen it before on TV and we desperately wanted to find and buy it and have a few buyers. One more poster remarked that it was boring, though I must say it was not. Especially if you are a horse, you will love this movie. The horses are amazing, well trained and the film is well done. It's definitely one that we'll buy for our home DVD library. We will recommend it to our friends. The connection between man and horse in this movie was so inspirational and made you want to spend more time with your horses. This is certainly a movie we will be watching several times.
