I have to say that this is the first quality romantic comedy I've ever seen. it was deep, and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together, it was still the desire and the expectation. that maybe they will not gather ... it is finally an indie movie. this film was well written, controlled and acted. the dance on the side of the road was magnificent.
