It's Easy 9. Michel Serrault, known for comic roles in his earlier part of his career, is doing stunning, even disturbingly wonderful work, which claims to be Dr. Petiot, the legendary French serial killer. <br /> <br /> Every moment in the movie is so credible that the actor completely disappears behind the figure - only the best that has ever achieved this success, and when they do it, it's only in the hand of the best. <BR/> <br /> The whole story (the real story that took place in France in the 20th century) is so powerful, so ominous - it's a very powerful movie you remember a long time.
