Lost is not the biggest television show in history, but it's not far. He does not have the story or the characterization of The West Wing or perhaps even an early ER, however, it is probably the most continuous grip of the show I have ever encountered. I love the way I can not guess what will happen. I like repeatedly telling stories about characters that often bring new dimensions to see them inside. In some respects, I want the show to last forever, but I think they can get 6-7 seasons of it before it has to end at the famous height. The combination of characters and their nationality along with the smoothness of the show for moving backwards and forwards, expanding the dead characters of "life span", all adds to the enormous sense that this show is something very different from what we are accustomed to. It's charming, surprising and (here's a little suggestion for all conspiracy theorists) more than a bit interactive - keep these internet discussions - you just add to the conspiracy ...
