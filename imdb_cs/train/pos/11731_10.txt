I think this movie is very funny and frightening. I love Elvira and I like this movie. It is a great shame that the second part of this wonderful movie was not successful because it is very fun first. I also regret that I did not see Cassandra Peterson next to this movie in other films. I think she's an amazing actress with a great ... potential. I hope to see her in the third part of Elvira's adventure in the future. Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedic actresses. Cassandra, if you read this, you know you are the best and my heart will be with you. You can rely on me. What can I add more? This is a great and classic movie!
