Big Broadway Broadband Music. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) loves to play dice and organizes illegal games. Blond girl loving Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wants to marry him if he drops craps. He decides to play one last game when he is in Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando!). Sky is playing that Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) can not get to Havana with him. This may sound like a strange summary of the plot, but it's a movie! <br /> <br /> This is a really mixed bag - there are some great things. All the songs are good and the dance is incredible. The real shadow is at the end of the game. Brando is really quite good - it may seem odd if you think he's singing and dancing, but it pulls him off. I have to admit that he saw the big, bulky Brando, who drew up some difficult dance moves, was a lot of fun! Sinatra is pretty good too, and Blaine is just great as his long-time girlfriend. Her song and dance figures are clearly highlighted here. <br /> <br /> Now for the bad parts - Jean Simmons is a gorgeous actress, but she is stuck with a deep colorless role and can not do much to do with it. The movie is too long in 150 minutes - the scenes between Brando and Simmons are really stretching and should be truncated. Also, most characters speak English very precisely - contractions are never used. Maybe trying to be fun to come out of the mouth of the gangsters, but I found it scared and it kept driving me out of the movie. It is worth capturing songs and dances, but overlapping lengths will come to you after some time. I give it 7.
