When I first saw this film on cable, it immediately became one of my favorite films. I'm a great fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duval. The movie shows an accurate picture of the south and racist attitudes. Most of the attitudes came from Solla, the old owner of the plantation, who uses condemned work. Soll is what he does, his funny work gives us insight into the way he was already south. I suppose if Soll lived today, he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. However, his attitude towards a small boy who comes to work for him and for the convicted is complicated. While he has racist views, he is trusted by some convicted, all black. Two convicts most believed about are Jackson (Mel Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). The interviews between Ben and Sol are the best in the movie, they have real chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both, but in great performances as well as Hass. <br /> <br /> This movie should be more familiar. However, it's on DVD and it's worth the money. Rayvyn
