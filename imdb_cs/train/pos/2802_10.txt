As a person who has never been sporting, it seems to me that it would be difficult to get into football (or as we Americans inexplicably call it soccer) - bordered by "Bend Like Like Beckham". But I have to say it was a great movie! Englishman Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and her girlfriend WASP Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley) love to play football (yes, I mean it British - and internationally) and just adore football player David Beckham. But the traditional Sikh parents Jesminder does not approve (her mother actually offers a really frantic description of football early in the film). Well, maybe it was a clich√© in this sense, but you have to love this movie! And if you like me, you will go to this movie without knowing the definition of "bend" in football ... do not worry, the film explains (even before this movie I never heard of David Beckham). And we all know that Keira Knightley struck: a few months after she went to the States "BILB," she played in the equally cool "Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearls".
