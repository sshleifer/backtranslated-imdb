I like the movie, it was a very interesting fantastic film b / c about the real meaning of the family in it, about the history of our country, about the fun action in the movie. I watch time @ at the top of about 4x a week and I just love her! I wish there was more information about Susan's father in the past and she watched Susan delt with her new sister and no phone, computers, gameboys or anything else in the 21st century. I hope everyone else liked the movie just like me. I think you could say I'm at the top of a fanatic, and I do not mind. The Lil boy in Robert Lincoln Walker's movie was simply adorable. I wonder who he is and what he is today. Does anyone know if he played them in movies or TV shows?
