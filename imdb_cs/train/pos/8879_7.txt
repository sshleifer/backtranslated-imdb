*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This movie always seems to be exaggerated until I remember that my college campus had a former student-turned-Nazi-racist-killer who had committed suicide at the time, too: his name was Benjamin Nathaniel Smith. <br /> <br /> Look at it in wikipedia - I added some photos to her article. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe, but these things really did. I'm not a big fan of Omar Epps or Ice Cube, but Larry Fishburne, Kristy Swanson, Jennifer Connelly and Mike Rappaport were good.
