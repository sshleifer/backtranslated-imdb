How can you go wrong with the amazing Ramones? What a crime that two of them are already dead. It reminds me of Dennis Leary's joke about great musicians who die in kitchen fires while living unnecessarily forever. Here I paraphrase, but you get an idea. ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL explains the story of a group of children who get rid of the rights that fight against their oppression at high school. These are extremely stupid things, but it is optimism that is refreshing (even if they resort to throwing out a building). Who knew it would become a real problem for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule of a time when people still believed that music is important and that it may mean a difference for a larger society. It is full of children who know that the authority does not have the right answers. Rather, rock and roll is the only thing they can trust. But the most important is pure exploitation. <br /> <br /> Do not take it seriously. Just go and have a good time. If that was not the case in high school as in the 1970s, it was supposed to be.
