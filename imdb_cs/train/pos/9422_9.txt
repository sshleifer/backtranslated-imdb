When I learned about the death of Sir Alec Guinness, it was the first of many movies I thought I was meeting again. What a gorgeous droll commentary on the film has provided after all these years. And Guinness helps weaving the spell in every shot. His eyes and face are as bright as the white suit he wears. Both he and the film must be considered a favorite for life.
