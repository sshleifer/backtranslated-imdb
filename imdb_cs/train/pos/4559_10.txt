My elder sister was born in March 1985 and has cerebral palsy. at her 22 years of life she saw nothing but the walls of our house and her school, which is also occupied by other disabled children. I was an ass to all the jokes, because my sister is disabled and I still think nobody is, or will never give her her condition. Then I saw this movie. I knew what Christy's family is going through. but they were lucky. Christy could talk, communicate, and have artistic skills. my sister can walk, but she can not say a word, and she can not use her hands to do anything other than catch things. but this movie made me realize that there are other people in the world like my sister and the end (to tell the truth) screamed me. And I saw SHAWSHANK !!! This movie is seriously underestimated and should not be. This film tells people something. that people should be proud of their own lives. do you think you can not write well? this guy was writing with his leg. do you think you're not attractive? this guy has refused a lot of girls because of his condition. the fastest runner? Christ could not even stand. <br /> <br /> My opinion: Parents of small children, I suggest to their children to watch this movie with you so they will know that they will see someone on the street in a wheelchair next time, they do not look like they are strangers. My sister has received millions of views and my heart is broken when I think it's still happening to many people. This film teaches people that people who seem "normal" are also people. 10/10
