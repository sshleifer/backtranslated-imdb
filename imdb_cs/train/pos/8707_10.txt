"Mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic movies I've ever seen. The name of the film can be translated into English as a "sword wearer". The main character (Sasha) was born with one extraordinary ability: he can protect himself with an extremely sharp sword that comes under the skin in his hand. On the first page, it may seem that another ridiculous superhero comes from an absurd film about unreal events and the beginning. But it's not Mechenosets. You can hardly be called an anti-hero. I think it's just a man who lost his meaning and faith in goodness, justice, and love in his life. In his life he never met anyone who could understand and love him (except his mother). Each step is stained with blood; he will apologize to everyone for his gift, which has become a damn for him. And she suddenly meets her. It does not need idle conversations and explanations. He loves him for what he is. It does not matter what he did. The fact of being beside her is more important than anything else. But soon he finds out the secret: he kills two people (her ex-boyfriend and her bodyguard) to protect her from the eyes. Even then she could not escape her feelings. They try to run, but it's a hart to hide. Finally they have a serious traffic accident. He is in the cage; she is in a psychiatric hospital. She knows nothing about her, but she believes she will save her. It overcomes many obstacles but finally finds it. They are running again, but they are not vulnerable. She's wounded, needs rest, but the police are almost caught. He does not know what to do, they go into a corner and then his sword begins to cut trees and a helicopter around them, but it is not necessary because he is already in his arms dead and he is a lonely person all over the world.
