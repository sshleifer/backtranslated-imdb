The line, of course, comes from the Lord's prayer - "Your will will be made on earth as it is in heaven." Sweden, especially its far north, is not my idea of ​​the sky - 30 ° C winter temperatures are a bit on the low side for me, but the good people living there no doubt think they are in God's own country. <br /> <br /> The story is known here. The renowned international musician, Daniel, suffers a health breakdown in the middle of his career, returning to a small village in northern Sweden where he was born. Convinced by a local pastor to help with the church corps, he changed some unlikely talent into a class act and entered the competition in Innsbruck. There are echoes of the "Brassed Off" band players, "Girls Calendar" and "Full Monty" dancers. Of course, it causes a lot of emotional shocks, because some of those who are more depressed are aware of their value and revolt against their oppressors. He will face hostile husbands and ever more dubious pastors, but nothing but death will stop him. Despite the somewhat horrifying story we see and like many of the characters who meet people rather than cartoons, although many of them are recognizable "types", and have I thought that the wife is beating so impatiently? Sweden is one country in the world where such violence is strongly discouraged (it was also a little young to be one of the youths of Daniel's youth), and the puritan pastor with secret passion for girl magazines was a bit stereotypical, but Niklas Falk was awesome. Michael Nyqvist is just as cool as Daniel, a fragile but nasty musician, and there's also nice music, I've been around for two hours, so that's what you're doing, I think, but that does not mean that Daniel's got it , what is he supposed to do .
