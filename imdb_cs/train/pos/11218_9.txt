This anime is a must for fans of Evangelion. It's Anno Hideaki's earlier work, but his uninterested, dramatic style is quite right. Also, those who do not like the Evangelion could find this relaxation a little more tasty. Gunbuster is rather a unique science fiction anime in that it really is based on real science. In fact, the show has a few interludes "Scientific Lessons" that explain physics for some of the events in the film. One of the great dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds near the light. The series does a terrific job of coping with the traumatic experience of leaving the country on a six-month mission that moves near the speed of light and returns to Earth for ten years. The main character stays at the age of 17 or 18 throughout the series, while almost all other characters age are considerably older. Please note that this show is sometimes difficult. It also has a couple of the most incomprehensible breasts I've ever seen. I've found it easy to ignore dirty uniforms and boo-hoo scenes because the series is otherwise very good, but low-tolerance viewers may want to stay away from it. On an interesting note, Gainax, as always, has been able to cash out the last few episodes. However, they have managed to use black-and-white film and still acting sketches that produce good resolution. The end is a little stupid, but he left me with so good a feeling in my gut, I could not help but love it. Gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of the best pieces of Anime.
