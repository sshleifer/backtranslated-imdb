Three teenage girls in incomplete triangular relationship. The basis of the triangle is hardly there. At the top is Marie, the serious, short, and slim-faced Belmondo-shaped tomatoes. Her best friend is a physical and psychological counterpart: koquette, baculat - let me say fat - and I long for my first kiss with a boy but not quite ready for my first sexual encounter. Because of her taste, boys do not seem interested and pain her. The second leg of the top is the wonderful "fille fatale" blonde. It is deeply involved in the sport of synchronized swimming, which operates at a competitive level. Mary sees her during a competition at a local public pool. Marie initiates herself into vamp's life with the desire to become a synchronized swimmer as an argument. Vamp has a reputation for being fucked up with any young man around him. Mary is not removed from this legend. Emphasize the reputation. <br /> <br /> The first half is set. We see a lot of synchronized swimming as soon as we get to know the three girls. Finally, the story leaves synchronous swimming and focuses on top relationships between the three.

Here are the ceilings and the dying. Check out the movie to learn more. The director says using synchronous swimming is useful. The only sport for women is the metaphor of a girl's life: pretty and feminine on the surface while working hard and competing underneath. Several scenes govern this point: elegant moves and smiles for the public, foot kicks ungainly underwater. The title in French is also suggestive: "sucker" or octopus, suggests that an individual must juggle many pressures at the same time.
