If you've never seen this movie and like old veteran actors, it's the movie for you. He saw Frank Sinatra when he was very young and extremely thin, with shaky faces and a wonderful voice that sang some old old songs. Michele Morgan (Millie Pico) has released excellent performance with a number of dance and musical numbers. Leon Errol (Cyrus Drake) provided a great supporting role alongside Victor Borg (sir Victor Fitzroy Victor), who performed with a classic piano and no slapstick comedy as he did in his career. It's not a great musical, but Frank Sinatra was a great joy to see at the beginning of his career in the 1940s.
