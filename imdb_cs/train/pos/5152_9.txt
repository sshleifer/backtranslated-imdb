"Hitler, the rise of evil" is clearly produced by people who are emotionally tired of the horrors of the Second World War. Who does the observation of a refreshing experience. I think his greatest value lies in his crystal clear revelation of the Nazi mechanism. From Hitler's utterly corrupt paths, he reached the peak. After the end of this movie, this movie will end. When the "FÃ¼hrer" (German for the "Leader") was above, Germany led him to the largest and most devastating war in the history of mankind. Termination six years later in total defeat of Germany. As a result, Germany lost its eastern province (= about 35% of its pre-war land) and was forced to accept a 44-year division of the remaining territory. West and East Germany had to be rebuilt from scrap, their reputation was seriously damaged by many Nazi atrocities inspired by racism. As I said, "Hitler, the rise of evil" is doing a good watch. Based in an acceptable environment of the thirties, with (more than) competent behavior. In particular, Peter O'Toole's role as old President von Hindenburg excels, even adding another dimension. My copy of "Hitler, the rise of evil" also provides a second DVD with two good documentaries movies. One is about Hitler's personalities, the other is about counterfeiting Hitler's diaries. In 1983, this fake caused a gay scandal in England and Germany, which damaged the reputation of several historians and journalists.
