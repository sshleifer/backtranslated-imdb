Legendary director Sidney Lumet gives us one of his best films in his career in this very tense and ultimately shocking story about a family that is dysfunctional as one of the children. With a list of A-Sheets led by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei, and Albert Finney, Lumet captured not only elements of criminal stories such as Reservoir Dogs, but also family stories, The Ordinary People. <br /> <br /> Many viewers may be confused and feel overwhelmed at the construction of the land Lumet has left here. Instead of displaying it linearly, he went to Tarantino and showed that the central scene of the robbery had deteriorated for various reasons. Personally, I found it to be very satisfying, and it keeps me constantly guessing what will happen next. The screenplay is very strong with some excellent scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei, as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman. All the actors are completely responsive and Lumet is obviously entertained in a style that is not usually going. A lot of the actions and tensions that the audience holds for two hours of running, it's a precious movie, a disappointment for a while.
