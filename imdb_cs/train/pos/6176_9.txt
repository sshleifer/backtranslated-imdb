The 1986 film The Spirit of the Spirit was the pilot of a possible series. But Will Eisner, the creator of the ghosts, did not like the film, so no series was created. I thought it was a very funny movie and captured the spirit (sorry) comic with a modern twist. I'm sorry it did not show up in the series. Sam (Flash Gordon) Jones was the perfect ghost. Nana The visit was pretty Ellen Dolan and, of course, she would later go to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine years later. Perhaps with the release of the series of the Spirit in Frank Miller's film, more people will be able to see this precious gem of the history of the Spirit. It seems that when Hollywood made a film of an already established character or idea, someone will inevitably look for the previous version of the property and put it on the video to make a few dollars. When Antonio Banderas wore the Zorro mask, we got older versions of a camouflaged hero on DVD, such as a large version of Alain Delon from the 1970s (although all the copies I've ever seen were badly edited). I hope someone has just released the TV adventure of The Spirit to DVD.
