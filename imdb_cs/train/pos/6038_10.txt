But on the contrary, I'm sorry, I'll understand completely how you can be dragged into the movie because you're dealing with it (and you have it). This movie is terrible, the main character would give any charlie a brown headline run for her money, just a constant mumble, which is always laughing, most scenes just feel embarrassed with the characters more often than looking at the other with a look. Now in your line , then I will respond. Best British Comedy? Please, buddy, you have a strong word with your bad bad self ... at the end of the day ... the sun falls ... and this movie is sad. I think it was well done for the people involved ... they shot a movie ... and maybe even motorcycle enthusiasts could be in it, but people who still live here on the ground with a real sense of humor will fight more with a smile The Christmas present they bought ... was it too hard? sorry ...
