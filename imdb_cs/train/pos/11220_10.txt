Aim at the top! Gunbuster is one of those series of anime that has a classic font. I loved this series completely and still remains my favorite anime. And though it was not Gainax's first animated product, it was their first OVA series. It began as a parody of the Aceo Nerae sports drama. In 1970, Gunbuster raises steam as a serious runway to end Episode 2 when Noriko Takaya is forced to live again to death of her father who was killed in the first encounter of humanity with the insects that humanity is in war. It's because of the death of my father that Noriko wants to become a combat pilot. But her lack of confidence will show that she sometimes gets in the way and she's falling. Her girlfriend, Kazumi Amano, even doubts that Noriko was chosen as a pilot. However, coach Noriko, Koichiro Ota, has faith in her. And he did his personal mission to see that she succeeded in becoming a pilot because he was a survivor in the battle in which Noriko's father was killed. Other characters include Jung-Freud, a Russian combat pilot assigned to operate with squadron Noriko, and Kazumi belonging to Smith Toren, a love interest for Noriko, who was killed in his first battle together, and Kimiko Higuchi, Noriko's child friend. Kimiko's interest is also interesting because while Noriko is in the universe, Kimiko stays on Earth to live a normal life. And because of the widening of the time, Kimiko is usually aging on Earth, while Noriko is about the same age as when she left school. At the end of the series, Noriko is about 18 years old, while Kimiko is in his fifties. Overall, this is an excellent anime series that you can watch if you are a fan of the giant mecha robot and Gainax animation. If you like other Hideaki Anno exhibitions or Haruhika Mikimoto art fans, leave this show a chance. They grow on you.
