It is a refreshing breath of air when the film actually gives a story line with the beginning, the environment and the end, a nice, clever secret with an attractive hero for all ages that brings us with our joke and spell. Andrew Fleming's film is a truly modern miracle, a return to a good old, reliable story that was the norm in Hollywood. It postpones exaggerated reliance on the special effects that now go through entertainment and gives us an amazing film with a very capable young actress and talented support for the cast. The film is based on old books, but has been updated enough to make it happen in this century; however, props may be different, the heart is still a good secret, and here is a clever one that combines the traditions of the old and the nuances of contemporary youth. Emma Roberts is an old-fashioned girl who believes in good behavior and respect for others; details that are negligible from today's films. It's still good enough to get the attention of boys, but it also knows how contemporary poetry and self-esteem is. He gets his medals by working hard and not afraid to show a little malice when he needs to achieve his goals. During our California holiday, our heroine pulls into the secret of Hollywood actress who has been the victim of a dirty game; she suddenly "visits" her spirit, and it raises a number of events that could solve the mystery or lead to something horrible for herself. What makes the movie quite fun is small details because it finds out that its usual world is nothing but the California scene and it is well presented without resorting to unnecessary vulgar language or to any graphic or apparently sexual one. Eventually, the director has enough control to make it appealing to all audiences, from young to adult in the audience. It is a film that deserves to be seen, appreciated and enjoyed, a film that is rare and delicate, and it is not afraid to be considered fun! Five stars
