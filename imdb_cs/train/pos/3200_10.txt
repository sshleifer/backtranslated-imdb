This is a great Canadian comedy. The film tells how stars Jean Paul Tremblay (Julian) and the main showwriter and his friends Rickie and Bubbles play on top of what is a truly satirical view of the trailer parks and the inhabitants of the scary hoods. The movie tells you why Rickie and Julian are starting to make their more advanced trips to the world of crime. WHY and why everything would be spoiler so I will not give real reasons for their brilliant escapades. Their friend and often partner (Bubbles) is a brilliant character. The whole show is great and the missing film does not affect the way you see the sit-com one bit. It's a C-comedy and a brilliant satire in a trailer park, living and small, time-cheaters with little time ideas but big dreams. If you ever had the option to watch - buy - steal this program to catch it. You will be glad you did. And my American friends --- She'll break you, too. 10 of 9. Brilliant. TV, how should television be.
