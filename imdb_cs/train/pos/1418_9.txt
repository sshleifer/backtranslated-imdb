I almost did not see this movie because I remember the penguin march was not so exciting. I went mainly because Disney had promised to be a tree if I could see it on the opening weekend, but when I saw it, it was just amazing; the fact that photographers can capture the impossible images is simply worth the money. You can also see different natural habitats, different vegetation, animals and natural phenomena that not only shock you - simply because you never expected that nature would be so magical and dynamic - but it also touches your souls and raises the question of mankind versus the world, about how our life has diverted from nature to such an extent that we consider the natural beauty and miracles that are key to our biosphere. You do not have to be a lover of a country or a tree by hugging ecologists to appreciate just the wonder of this document. You just have to be a curious soul that questions the value and the miracle of life. Enjoy!
