In Carmen, Saura once again strives to create a dynamic relationship between reality and fiction, among the true passions of a person in a dance company that prepares a choreography on the dance part of Carmen and scripts from the story of fictitious Carmen, the famous deadly mixture of free spirit to drive the man with a mad desire. Saura used the same fiction / reality in the older black-and-white Bodes de Sangre (Blood Wedding). But because the tensions between the dancers who are testing the Blood Wedding have shown how they evolve into the fictitious characters of the story to be performed by driving their emotions into their roles in Carmen, the parallel between the small, libidinal attractions of troop dancers trials, and the spirit that Carmen has never achieved, is so close that it is believable. It's still a gadget, and that's why it's an annoying distraction. One really needs to see Blood Wedding next to Carmen to appreciate the comparison. It does not really matter that Saura's melodrama attempts to save her Carmen, because flamenco dance and guitar music on the trials - 95% of the film - by some of Flamenco's most famous dancers and musicians, more than pays the price of entry. Defective film and astonishment: perfect for giving the exercises in Keats's "negative ability"?
