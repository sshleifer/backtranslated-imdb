It's definitely not an intellectual film with a deep mission, so I really do not think it's too much to understand that you are not Czech. It's just a comedy. Humor is simple, quite entertaining, and sometimes maybe morbid. Some actors and characters are very similar to Samotári (2000) (Jirí Macháček, Ivan Trojan, Vladimír Dlouhý), so the authors are. But it does not matter, the genre is really different and these two films should not be compared in this way. One hand does not bother to try to give a lesson, it will try to laugh at you and there is a chance that it will succeed. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, not a brilliant, but I liked it. Some scenes are really worth seeing.
