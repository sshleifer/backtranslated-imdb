.... after 16 years Tim Burton finally disappoints me !!!! What happened to former Burton who read "The Dark Knight Returns" by Frank Miller as a research of his preparation for Batman's direction in 1988-89? Looking at it, Burton did not investigate a book or a movie because he got everything wrong! This movie is upset! It's not as good as the original and does not care about the same object as the original. If you want a good movie with people to watch the original. <br /> <br /> ** outside the **** stars
