An outstanding film by Thaddeus O'Sullivan, which features strong performances from many British and Irish actors. The film deals well with thorny objects and effectively captures the despair and gloomy atmosphere of the 1970s Belfast. Surprisingly realistic, nothing in this conflict celebrates a single party. On the one hand, he shows a young Catholic father who tries to raise his family without getting into trouble. On the other hand, it deals with a loyalist gang that seeks to promote violence. Very interesting and, fortunately, fun. Do not expect any laughter. 7 out of 10.
