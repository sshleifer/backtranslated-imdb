This film is basically a documentary of a chronologically organized series of events that took place from April 10, 2002 to April 14, 2002 at the Venezuelan Presidential Palace Caracas in Venezuela. The penis of the film is real, and one feels the pain, grief and joy of people who have experienced this failed coup d'Ã©tat of President Hugo Chavez. One comes from the view of this film that Hugo Chavez is really a great historical figure. Hugo Chavez's personality once brought Venezuelan people to overthrow the three-day military junta and restore the Democratic government of Venezuela. It is clear from the film records that George W. Bush helped and cheated the Venezuelan coup. The fact that the main media helped and encouraged George W. Bush is not surprising. What is surprising is how few people have seen this film and how few people are aware of the total corruption of the American media. <br /> <br /> It took only 20 years when Ronald Reagan abolished the Doctrine of Justice in 1986 to turn America into a blind and immobile state. Can Hugo Chavez open the eyes of patriotic Americans to the truth and beauty of a real American vision.
