You can find this jewel in your video store. <br /> <br /> The human condition in modern times LA. No exaggerated drama, just a collapse of events that might happen over time to a group of people. <br /> <br /> Helps you understand the joy and despair of urban life. <br /> <br /> Direction and cutting are top class. Cinematography and music are very driven by mood and situation. A CAST !!! <br /> <br /> Excellent casting and excellent performance. Nobody is in place or out of character. <br /> <br /> And it's not really what you'd expect. I gave her 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> If you did not see it, DO!
