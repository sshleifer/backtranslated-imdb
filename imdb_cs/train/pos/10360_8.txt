This is the story of Linda Chamberlain's case study and a look at its impact on Australian society. Especially deals with the issue of cues, gossip and expectations when it comes to real-life drama. One thing that this story deals with is the way it is expected that everyone will have the same emotional response to a similar situation. Not everyone is coming into the wild melodramatic hysteria of every major crisis. It is precisely because the characters in the movies and the TV act in a certain way, there is no reason to expect real people to have it. This is particularly well suited to journalists and news editors who seem to be looking for a large sobriety that will pull ratings. It is a problem that must be continually solved. Leaders play characters with depth, personality and sensitivity. And they are heavily encouraged by the great cast of all to play on the basis of real individuals. Some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporters in this story are people who are known in Australia as comedic actors. Again, he promotes my idea that comic actors do some of the best support in the drama because they know with comedy how to create the quick impressions of individuals. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler warning!) <br /> <br /> I have to say something very personal; in the fact that I was actually a former Adventist who was a trained member in Australia at the time of that happening; so I have somewhat different impression from the story than most. I think it's amazing creativity and personality and emotional heart. I think the best scene is where the two lords are haunted by new helicopters. She recorded great topic themes. <br /> <br /> I once heard that Fred Scheps in the interview said he told the actors "to play the best opportunity for their character they could." While this is particularly appropriate for this story, I think it is also a general principle that should apply to all who do the same.
