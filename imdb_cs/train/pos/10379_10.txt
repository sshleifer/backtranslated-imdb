Plato's Run is a fun b movie with Gary Busey.it is a relatively unknown movie so I saw him on the trunk of the car. I thought it looked funny that I was right. Gary Busey plays Plato with a heavy mercenary who is framed for the murder of a powerful Cuban criminal ruler who is now on the run, Plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with his friends who played Steve Bauer (scarface) and action star Jeff Speaksman (expert). what I liked Plato's run was the way the movie was never bored that the plot could be done before, but it was still good that the acting was fun to watch and the action was quite funny, especially the peak Gary Busey is a good irony because normally plays on the bad guy and Steve Bauer is good as Platon's sidekick Even Jeff Speaksman does good performance and he can not even act well to finish it Plato's run is a nice effort from no picture films and I give it 7 out of 10
