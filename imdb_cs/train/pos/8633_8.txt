Nicolas Mallet is a failure. Notebook in the bank, everyone goes after him. Then his friend, a writer who is not like a book, has a plan to change his life. Our hero tells the boss to stop. He intends to spend the rest of his life doing a lot of money and sleeping with many women. And he can do it. If there were no deaths (murder / suicide / natural causes) in the movie, it would be farce. In marriage, politics, journalism and ... life is a lot of jabs. Jean-Louis Trintignant is a pleasant amoral cheater. Romy Schneider is most appealing to her. It's definitely worth a look.
