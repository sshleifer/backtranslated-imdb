. . . or enter your computer keyboard would probably give this eponymous movie a "10" rating. After all, no elephants are shown to be killed during the film; it is not even suggested that anyone would be injured. On the contrary, owner ELEPHANT WALK, John Wiley (Peter Finch) complains that he can not shoot any pachydermy - no matter how dreadful - without permission from the government (and his tone suggests that such permits are not within the area likely). In addition, the elements conspire - in the form of unusual drought and the cholera epidemic - to leave Wiley's plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by elephant people (as natives dubbed) to close the story. If you encounter the latest EARTH release, you will find that Elephant people today give far less.
