Why did not manufacturers give a chance to make it all on TV, why did manufacturers not give six degrees a chance? Will the series continue with the video? I'd love to see how it ends. Put the season on the video and sell it. I was a loyal fan of six degrees and I expected him to come back. I set my recorder to record all the shows. Thank you for God. I just discovered that the show was canceled and I was broken by my heart. I wish I knew it would be canceled, why did not we tell it? I thought the show was developing in depth. The scripture was also quite good. Steven (Campbell Scott) is my favorite time. I'm sorry to see it!
