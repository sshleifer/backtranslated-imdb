Parker (Johnathan Schaech) is an aspiring writer who is still looking for a long break. Meanwhile, he works as a telephone consultant for the Manhattan mental hotline. One day, unfortunately, his apartment house burns. Parker and his cat make it alive, but now they are stuck with the tough task of finding affordable housing in the Great Apple. The word comes to Parker that girl Samantha (Alison Eastwood) is looking for a roommate but only accepts a homosexual. Because Parker is equal, but the price is right, he decides to pretend to be gay. Samantha likes from the beginning and welcomes him as his new co-owner. But poor Parker. Sam is beautiful, smart and very desirable. How will he be able to keep his true nature under control? Besides, Sam does not have a successful business friend? It is a sweet, sympathetic and humorous film with two very attractive stars in Eastwood and Schaech. Of course, it's a "how can I keep this busy scene," and Sam asks Parker for shampoo while showering or begging him to keep her in bed when he gets bad news. It's also necessary for Parker to produce his own "fake" gay friend, Boris, when Sam insists on putting him with a man he knows. Let's hope the gay community does not consider it too insulting because this viewer thought most of the problems were treated with sensitivity and subtlety. In a small movie, costumes, sets, and camera work were also nice. Therefore, if you love those funny stories of love, get this soon. You'll like what you see, I know.
