Simple, meaningful and emotional. I regularly go through blunt short films and it is always nice to meet something that has a simple and enlightened message, no pretentious demands or self-directed directing. The boy at school has to attend a lesson when his friend plays trumphant and gets the most important lesson in his life just to find out that if there are not enough copies to propagate, they have to share it with school mistreatment. <br /> <br /> Unlike most short films featuring children or actors who have these children's own, and it's plausible. The soundtrack nicely complements the emotions of the work, and the boundary of the movie works well.
