When I found this movie in my local video object, I expected it to be another sweet American vampire movie in the same spirit "The Lost Boys" (1987). On my surprise, "To Die for" is a really good movie. but sometimes there are enough stylish pieces and surprises to satisfy vampire enthusiasts. It's a perfect mix of romance and horror, and it's surprisingly cruel.
