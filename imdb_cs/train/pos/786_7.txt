Andie MacDowell's facial expressions are great in this movie. When you are 40 and you have been the only one (or your whole life) for a while, you may feel that you are losing. The film is a sweet reminder that love can be found anywhere if your antennas are actively active. I liked a quick sexual encounter that must be out of character for the normally reserved teacher (MacDowell). Her ex-student is pretty cute and has been wearing his teacher for so long. <br /> <br /> There are some parts that I thought were somewhat unrealistic or impractical. For example, in a scene where the jealousy of other women was suppressed, and a scene was created for Andie MacDowell to cast out a young man, would an adult police officer (second friend MacDowell) allow her friend to do such a sinister act? Is it easy for someone to stop in front of a car? Of course, the accidents have happened all the time, but I was hoping the heroine would happily marry the first man she was getting involved with (it was the hardest part to believe!) Such a beautiful woman ... <br /> <br /> Maybe filmmakers are aware of the fact that much romance between an older woman and a younger man does not last long. Besides, they know that a happy end would not call the public, especially the jealous women over 40, who are waiting for some miracles. A sad ending with the hope of a sad woman who has lost her true love is sweet, but if that man went on with life, would it take? How long? Nobody knows. However, it is a movie that brings you to later knowledge sometime later .... maybe a year later.
