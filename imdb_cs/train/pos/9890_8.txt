Unfortunately, this movie has never been on DVD. I saw it when it was first released to the theaters in 1983, and then again when the VHS was released in 1992. When I recently saw a copy of VHS on the flea market, I immediately bought it. I was not disappointed. First, obvious: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and happy to see. But then the film will bring you into an unreal world where you have to think about your values ​​and decide what is really important to you. The film is about a lot of things. This is how the World Bank and large corporations use and enslaving developing countries with capitalist programs to force them into a debt they can never repay. This is how our economic system abuses us by forcing us to owe you credit card, mortgage and car payments. It's about trying to save the innocence that we may have never had and maybe we can not really save. It's good and bad, and how tough it is to tell each other. It raises many questions, but it does not provide answers. I think sometimes it's good. For this reason, it is a film that really stands for rescue and vision.
