This film is about development. People are growing and people are disappearing, people are surprised and people are disappointed. It has all that and more. There is hope, frustration, injustice, justice, love and hatred. It's really a classical drama that has a fantastic performance from all over, but above all Whoopi Goldberg in her debut role. The film made me feel very human and proud of it, and I suggest that this film be obligatory every Saturday in all the prisons in the world-it touches your compassion. Rating: 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> PS: I admit it: During the final scene I ripped the joy.
