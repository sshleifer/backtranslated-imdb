He just came out and I can not believe what a great documentary is. You rarely leave the cinema in such awe and wonder. Recently, movies have become so exaggerated that the excitement of discovering something really special and unique is rarely happening. Amores Perros did it to me when it came out for the first time and this movie is doing me now. I did not know anything about it before I got into it and what a surprise. If you hear this concept, you may feel that this is one of those sensitive movies about the amazing triumph that hides top music and tries to fully convince us about what a great story it says but then lets us in. Apparently this is not the movie. People tell the story! It makes it so good to capture every moment of their engagement as we enter their world and feel at each moment with them. There is so much that goes beyond the climb and makes everything passing, much more tense. The touch of emptiness was also a great proof of climbing and showed intensity in an eye-catching way, but this film is a rather human story. I saw it today, but I'll go and say it's one of the best papers I've ever seen.
