This is a very gentle and poetic story. Beautiful landscape. Excellent music score. Last year I was in Japan twice and the film gave me this typical Japanese feeling. The motion of the camera is excellent, just like actors. It penetrates into your feelings without becoming melodramatic. Japanese people are very sensitive and nice and it is all very well brought to the screen. The director plays great light with colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to have them enjoy the film with fine and fine details. Once you see this movie, you'll want to see more from the same director. It's a really good movie and I can recommend it to everyone.
