I first saw a BBC film on July 27, 2005. For me, it was a good interpretation of Conan Doyle's personality and I really care what the fans of the Sherlock think. I also think it's a movie for these fans whether they agree or not what's mentioned. You may ask that A.C. Doyle was a strong man or questioned himself. But he was the creator of the famous Holmes, but how much of it was like polobiography? The less I've put this adaptation forward, it's a movie that you have to see - even if you're not interested in Sherlock Holmes movies or books - check it out, enjoy it and have your say about it.
