This early Sir, melodrama, shot in black and white, is a small film, yet it shows the atmosphere of a German director in expanding tired stories about something similar. Meet in 1910, Barbara Stanwyck is a woman who has been culled by leaving her husband and family in a small town for love in Chicago. She had never fulfilled her ambitions and was drawn back to the city she had left with an eager letter from her daughter who informed her that she also enjoyed the theater (that is, in high school). In her old town, she again opposes malice and has to deal with her eldest daughter, a confused (and boring) husband (Richard Carlson) and a former lover. The conspiracy is nothing new, but Sirk separates himself by creating meaningful compositions, each shot is carefully shot and is greatly helped by Stanwyck as his leading lady. Running 76 minutes, and that's just as good, because the material really has no legs to go on.
