I really liked this movie. All three stars (Connery, Fishburne and Underwood) provide trusted performances and Harris is pleasantly over the top. Illumination and shots in some of Harris' scenes make his face really devilish. Surprising turn of the plot at the end is interesting. It's not a great movie but a fun movie. I gave her 7 out of 10.
