Production quality, casting, assumptions, authentic atmosphere New England (Waterbury, CT?) And the fresh score of John Williams should result in a 3-4 star collection. Unfortunately, we only received a 2-hour "decent" movie, which was mostly memorable for what it was trying to do ......... to bring a traditional-style movie stream. A small town and the story of ordinary people is a genre in itself and, if done well, will satisfy most adults. Jane Fonda was unable to hide her brain so much that her character was believable. I was wondering why she did not do a Doctorate at Yale instead of working at Waterbury. Robert DiNirova's character was just a little too fancy. An illiterate, nice guy who, with little help from Jane's character, turns out to be a real person in 1990 by Henry Ford or Thomas Edison. This genre was more successfully crafted by "Nobody's Fool" in the mid-1990s and this year ("About Schmidt"). I wish mainstream studies to test other things for adolescents and to reserve a few games in multimedia complexes for this effort. I will give her "A" for the effort.
