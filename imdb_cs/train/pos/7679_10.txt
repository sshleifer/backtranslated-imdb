For my humanitarian quarterly project for school I chose trafficking in human beings. After some research on the Internet, I found this DVD and ordered it. I just watched it and I still think about it. All I can say is "Wow". It is such a convincing story of a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric who tries to save her. The end leaves you breathing, and although it's not happy, never after it's over, it's very realistic. It's amazing and I recommend it to everyone! She truly connects with Holly and Patric, and your heart decays for her and what happens to her. I loved it so much and now I want to know what will happen next!
