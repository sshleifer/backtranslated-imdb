Reda is a young Frenchman of Moroccan origin. Despite its Muslim heritage, it is very French in its attitude and values. Besides his blue father, he tells Reda that he will bring him to the hajj (pilgrimage) to Mecca - something Reda does not want to do but agrees with the duty. As a result, Reda is upset from the beginning, but is a traditional Muslim man, his father is difficult to talk or discuss about his fears. Father and son seem very rigid and inflexible - and it's very ironic when the father tells his son he should not be so stubborn. When I read a summary, she talks about how many figures grew and began to get to know each other. But I really do not think they did it, and that's a fascinating and sad aspect of the movie. Sure, there were times of understanding, but so often there was a subconscious of hostility and repression. I liked it very much, and I appreciated it was not a complete solution - how it would look like fake. Overall, the film is well-functioning and fascinating - the film about the West is an unusual view of Islam and the Hajj. It also provides a fascinating comparison of traditional Islam and the secular younger generation. While the slow pace and lack of clarity about the relationship throughout the film may be somewhat bothering, I think it gave the film intense realism and made it look like a movie about people - not a formula. Nice and unusual movie.
