I loved this movie. I'm not a fan of Ed Wood Jr., I would like to appreciate his "endless enthusiasm" and confirm his shortcomings. His films are fun, but his personal story is painful. I was hoping, and was pleased that this film would be about how to understand his stormy life rather than merely glean him with posthumous praise. From the beginning to the end, this film evolves from a documentary film into mythology and lets the viewer and viewer unexpectedly connect with each other and Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> What we get is people who knew Ed Wood best to talk about him from all perspectives, positive and negative, and show us their character just like Ed's. We gain insight into Ed's personal and professional life: from his novels to his drinking, sexuality, friends, enemies, and even his film. The film itself is filmed in a low-cost way that seems to be of respect to Ed, as if using the techniques of most of the theatrically released films of 1996 was disrespectful (something like having a prettier suit than the president). Set designer uses a sense of humor and a great deal of comprehension when they correspond to each cast member with their background. Fans will be enthusiastic to hear personal testimony about Ed Wood's controversy, and new arrivals will be amazed that this man was real. DVD is full of impossible to find gems ("Crossroads of Lorado" and photo galleries), but the real treasure of this movie is a surprisingly engaging and connected story. Ed Wood had the habit of defining people through their association with him (for better or worse) until a woman goes into history as a "swimming pool owner" once he lets his and his friends baptize in her pool. This ability to define a person's heritage comes ubiquitously because the most amazing effect of the film is not only to give a well-rounded idea of ​​the person who was Ed Wood Jr. but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created. In some way, without ever casting more than one cast member on screen, there is a clear connection that Ed Wood has created among the different people in his life, and the viewer has a great sense of engagement. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> What begins with unrelated stories by random humans ends with the conclusion that all casts will be forever woven into an unpredictably coherent structure that will bring history into a spooky unity with Wood's legend. Contradictions live in many ways, Ed Wood Jr. could not be condensed into a single view. This joint effort is closest to knowing him that he will ever get us. As a self-extraction of the themes, it is also respectful, provocative, thoughtful, gripping, entertaining, sad, kind and fulfilling.
