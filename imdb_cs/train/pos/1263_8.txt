I like this movie, I admit it mainly because I like to see Sean Connery's act and this one has the added bonus that Ed Harris and Lawrence Fishburne have in it. The story has a grandmother who seeks help from Connery because her grandson is in jail and says he was wrongly convicted. Initially, it seems to be racist aspects of the case, but later it turned out that the chief officer in the case was black and he seems to have done rather bad things to force him to pick up a baby boy. The boy will try to show another killer blocked in the same prison he is about to kill. He is a particularly unpleasant man because he has a lot of joy in what he does, he wrote relatives of his victims and tried to get people to send them. Many twists and turns in this with some have been somewhat unexpected. I enjoyed Sean Connery's character who tried to understand all the misery. The film also upset me in the areas, especially when you find out what happened in the end. You get very good interplay between Connery and Harris and Connery and Fishburn, because everyone is good at this. Eventually it does a fairly good thriller / thriller.
