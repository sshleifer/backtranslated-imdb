When I read a review from another user who says it's a terrible game, I could not stay idle and do nothing! Well this game is great from news clips (with two real people, full of humorous meaning and credibility!), Story, I find it very good! I just complain that the enemies will start to blink until they die until they disappear; and some frustrating situations on LERA VR missions while cycling here and there ... Besides, it's a great game with a great story, good graphics, great characters, great soundtrack ... I recommend it! Sure! It can be a bit old but still nice! At least for Dreamcast ... but PS2 must be the same.
