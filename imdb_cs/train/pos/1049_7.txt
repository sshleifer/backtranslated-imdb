Nurses in law will be published theatrically on March 24 in Sweden. A good opportunity for our Nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. This was shown in GÃ¶teborg along with a retrospective dedicated to Kim Longinotto, the festival's "director in focus". She was a master class, she was very honored, she was telling her about her method of documentary work and telling the audience about the special circumstances that led her to twice the laws: the first version was lost for good so the second shot was arranged, the film finally turned out to be different. A pretty awful problem has become, in this case, the possibility of a very strong film.
