My mother took me to see this movie when it was around Christmas 1976. I loved it and I love it now. I know everyone makes fun of Barbra's hair in this, but I think it looks and sounds great! ... And I seem to remember a few women who copied that lasting look at that time! The war scene between Streisand and Kristoferson is so sexy! Music is great. This is Granny's grandmother 70 in her best form!
