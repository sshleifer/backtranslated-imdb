I'm not an expert on playing or other details of the movie, but this film just hit me deep. I do not think I'd ever forget it. Especially one scene (I think everyone who saw the movie will know which one I'm talking about) is printed on my brain. I also watched a similar movie Lilja 4-ever previous commentator). He was also very moving, but not as straightforward and brutal. If you are receptive at all, either bring tears to your eyes, but Anjos Do Sol (Sun Angels) can stay with you forever. <br /> <br /> This is a very depressing affair, but I think no, I hope that this film will bring more attention. <br /> <br /> More people need to see this movie !!!!!!
