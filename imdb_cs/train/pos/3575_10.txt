Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such credibility, I just cried. Glenn Close's role as Ruth showed her she wanted to deal with the situation, but she was under her husband's lady. "Think about what he did," said Robert Duvall's character, Joe, sharply. The story depicted a rural family dealing with the accidental death of his son, "The Stone Boy," meaning he was so upset and overwhelmed by what he did, became emotionally paralyzed. Then at the end of Jason Presson's character, Arnold, he left it all to someone else, I was so broken for him that I thought of some of the terrible things I did in my life. I personalized myself and identified myself with his figure. Rolls of Frederick Forrest and Gaila Young did not bring too much in the movie. I was thinking about Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's antagonistic, feminine brother, Andy, like a fool who did not try to help the situation. His wife Lou, played by Gail Youngs, behaved like a crazy lady who had arrested her frustration with her own problems without sympathy, and blamed him for her troubles. I could not really regret the two. Although Lou was trying to keep marriage, she was not successful. Both did not solve their problems. They really did not have a movie and they were totally ridiculous. The partial role of Wilfred Brimley as a grandfather was touching because he was the only character who showed Arnold any attention. I felt that his role had to be worked out. The players just did what they considered adequate and sufficient. I really liked the fact that I really liked it, I actually smiled and wept with tears of joy. I felt good. Hillermans was once again a family. Actually, I wanted to be part of this family. They were so realistic.
