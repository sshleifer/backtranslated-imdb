You notice the stars I gave to this great film that "... before you see it for the first time," is outlined. I have never heard of this movie before, and it was precisely because this week (and last) was a very slow rental experience (not too much coming). I'm not sure how this movie slipped around me - I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam is also great. Still it was. The movie is a wonderful example of what to do if you do not have a big budget. She had just the right amount of plot and dialogue to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark; just enough. The whole movie is you (the viewer) who is trying to find out how many twists and turns are happening. I would give this movie 10/10, however some of the shots were pretty fake looking. I do not think it is too much against this movie, but I do not think it deserves a perfect score. Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think he is much underestimated as a serious talent. Remember her beauty (which is difficult), she really takes her roles seriously and will not stay on her look to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotions. And she can look cool and even lifeless if needed. At first, Jeremy Northam really cares about being a pretty captivating corporate rat, willing to go through each labyrinth to prove it. However, as it changes throughout the movie, it's like night and day. I know some fans of Clive Owen, Jude Law, or other hope of becoming another James Bond, hate me for it, but Northam could / should have liked it. He is excited and cultivated. He has a great attitude and a voice of Bond. I think he too may be cold if he wants the situation, and rather downstairs. <br /> <br /> A great movie and definitely this movie fan recommends that it be seen at least once, you like corporate spy movies.
