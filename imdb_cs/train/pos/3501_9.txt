One of the best movies I've seen in the last five years! The cast is generally spectacular in the story of young love and bravado on the lower side of East New York with two leads being superstars in doing. Funny, enchanting, sad and inspiring, it's a totally refreshing take-off for urban youth who gives Larry Clark often a furious stalk in the trough where he belongs ... even though I have to admit that Bully has been reduced over the usual ride. Victor Vargas lifting is one movie you're about to kick in for missing out ... so do not miss it!
