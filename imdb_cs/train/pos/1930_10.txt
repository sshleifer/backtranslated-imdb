This movie is merry, original and beautifully focused. I became a BIG BAD SWIM band, watching film festivals anytime, anywhere. I've seen it about half a dozen, and every time the audience's enthusiastic response has confirmed my feeling that this is one of the best movies that's been coming up in the years. On almost all festivals he screen, sell or win the Audience Prize. It is clear that people love this movie, and even clearer why they do. Cinematography is an excellent, characterizing and acting great, fantastic end, and a direction full of compassion, wisdom, and the art of perfect timing. It is hard to believe it is the first film of Ishwa Setton. I hope he will be released soon enough for everyone to see.
