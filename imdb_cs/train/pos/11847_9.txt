The horse is a really great animal. The graphic representation of wild horses and their grace could never be more majestic animations. <br /> <br /> Animation is just overwhelming. Fine animation forms the backbone of beauty that the horses make nervous. Even more, when the stallion passes through a variety of terrain, it skips over the cliffs and passes through the waters. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is also very impressive. Wonderful instrumental music attracts you to the film. <br /> <br /> "They say the story of the West was written from the saddle of a horse." Well, the story of a good horse was certainly written from a saddle in the west. Overall, this movie is clearly up with the best. It's one of the best animated films I've ever watched. It would be a very good choice for a lonely night. Easy 9/10.
