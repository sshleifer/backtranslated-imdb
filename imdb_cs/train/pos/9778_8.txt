It's a trio of stories, "Shakti", "Devi" and "Kali," about an experimental community called the Taylor-Eriksson group, which has brought people into a journey inside and into the unknown, leaving a little damage here and there, I would say. Many years later, some of these damage are still hidden and they are waiting for the right moment to show up. Shakti tells the story of a woman whose husband had mysteriously died, in fact he was split, and the suspect was a man who probably did not exist. This woman seems to be able to project an internal demon or find out the sister of a man who was killed when he tries to talk to this woman while posing as a reporter. Devi tells the story of a young man who wants to "jump out of his skin". She is a skinhead, speed freak, and is sent to visit a psychiatrist who is a former member of the community, which leads to a good doctor helping the young man to realize his desire. This is probably the best of three segments. Kali tells the story of a healer who is trying to "heal" this woman who was part of this community, and has let some kind of demon out of this woman lose, but man asks if he did it or when he released it for she could no longer survive. All three of these stories are quite spooky and thrilling because you're never really sure what to expect, and the premise and setting are so different from conventional horror films that add to the weirdness. It has some low budget appearance and feel, but it also can conjure a fairly scary atmosphere throughout, much to its credit. I looked at it with my mouth, which hung open for a good part of time, and when real fear (and gore) appeared, it was quite difficult. I found it a very interesting and disturbing movie, and he liked it a lot. A good little find, this one, I'd give him 8 out of 10.
