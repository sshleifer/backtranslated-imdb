In Brooklyn, a century ago, the rivalry between Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie and their competing volunteer firefighters led to the famous Brodie bet that he could jump off Brooklyn Bridge. This is a story that will be known to many people through Bugs Bunny spoof "Bowery Bugs" from 1949. This generally very enjoyable movie would probably be more widely available if it were not a famous and worrying scene involving some Chinese tenants - a time capsule of premature racial attitudes, which in my opinion gives the film a great historical interest.
