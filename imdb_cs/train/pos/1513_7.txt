This film is another horror anthology. It's quite good, but it could have been a bit more. I compare it to the "terrorist's house of horror," though it fits in this title. It has four floors, which are just a bit connected to the house. The first story is about the writer and his wife moves in. He creates the murderer for his latest novel and then begins to see the murderer roaming in his house. This is predictable, but in the end it throws a couple of twists. The next story is a bit unpredictable and you really do not know where the hell is going. This was Peter Cushing and he was probably my favorite couple. The guy buys the house, but it is not a house on the central stage, but a rather special museum of wax figures. The third story starts rather well and represents Christopher Lee. This has him as a rather bizarre father who looks terrible to his daughter. The problem is, once you know what's happening in the story, it will not end soon. It turns a bit, which leads to a very predictable conclusion. Then the last story is about an actor who bought a cloak from a tiny department store. The actor really gets what he paid for. Then there is a small story about an officer who is seen when trying to find out what happened to this actor, and then an explanation of why these things happened. Although I was not very satisfied with the explanation because I think it really did not explain Cushing's story. I think they need a little more story for it. Overall, it was an interesting set of stories.
