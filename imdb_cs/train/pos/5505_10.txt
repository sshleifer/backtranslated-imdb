This is something new. <br /> <br /> There is a coup and a few Irish documentarists are right inside. <br /> <br /> A democratically elected president who uses his power, literates his people and encourages them to read the constitution, is openly marked by the private media as a dictator, mentally unstable, a new hitler, etc., without affecting government (such as silencing with beads and other traditional dictatorial methods). Oh, and they still claim to be suppressed, of course. See how the media worry about their own role in a coup on TV when they overthrow the government with rouge generals (how much more stupid can you get?). And you will see how the people of Venezuela march into the palace, hold the constitution in their hands, and reinstall their chosen government. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a Hollywood fairy tale, but it really is against the express wish of the USA. The documentary is a historical masterpiece, fired from the center of events, acute and totally unpleasant to the main supporters of the coup: a good, democratic, loving, benevolent USA (still bringing a large amount of money to political opponents of Chavez). <br /> <br /> Also very fun and exciting. 10 points.
