This is one of the biggest films of love stories I've ever seen. Yes, I can agree that some parts may seem dated, but they do not reverse the film. One should attempt to observe, criticize and enjoy any form of art from the point of view of time. Apparently according to the "Sex in the City" standards, Charlie Chaplin was terribly boring. However, when judged from the 1925 perspective of America, it was fantastic. Likewise, Sayonara is a breakthrough film in her view of the love affair of mixed affairs, the American arrogant and prejudicial manifestation, and the complexity of different cultures. It's a natural next step to such films as the Gentleman's Agreement. Its purpose, however, was not just a social commentary, it is rather entertaining and entertaining, with innumerable lines that you will not forget. However, even if it's just like a love story, it's amazing. Although some attack Brand's accents, it is at its best in nuance and characterization. Buttons and Umeki (both of whom won the Oscars) and the rest of the accompanying cast add a lot to the film. <br /> <br /> So, a real star, doing a wonderful job that will make you feel passion for Brando while being torn by your sense of duty and loyalty. Her speech, when she first meets and talks with Brand, is a classic and something rare if she ever joins the cinema. The interview between Taka and Branda in the Tokyo dressing room at the end of the movie is just as good. Of course, he does not have a slime of the mouth, spit and worse, which is an example of love in today's movies, but that's all the better. It portrays true love and passion, not just "warmth." If you do not touch this movie then you are too young, too cynical or dead.
