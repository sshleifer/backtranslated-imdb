This movie is incredibly realistic and I feel it has a fair justice to crime, which many people do not understand because of the lack of experience. Many people who think they can understand what goes through the victims' minds are arrogant. As a victim, I feel that Dawson has done a fantastic job in the role of Maya. I agree that it is an incredibly courageous film. This concerns rape in a more realistic view than any other movie I've ever seen on this subject. The end has gone a long way, but I know that many victims imagine this kind of justice because the chance that the attacker is sent to prison for his crime is about 1%. It is good to see a movie that comes closer to reality than most of them dare.
