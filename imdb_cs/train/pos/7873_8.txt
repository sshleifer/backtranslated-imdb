Page 3 is a very charming and fascinating opener that cleverly reveals the hypocritical lifestyle of the Bombay elite. From false kisses to smudged smiles he does not leave any stone to reveal the shocking life of rich and famous. In every dark corner of the world of glitz and glamor there are backstabbing, gossip, corruption and scandal. Mankind and generosity are similar to the oasis in the desert in this world, where social darwinism is the predominant mentality. Everyone is constantly looking for more money, more glory and higher reputation, and makes them do the most disgraceful things that can be imagined, from the signing of a film contract to a funeral to harassing children. There is something in this metropolis where the classroom is so wide. Viewers see the ugliness of both these classes through the eyes of the protagonist. He watches the suffocating atmosphere and the mad mind he lives in socially. Bollywood, businessmen, politicians and the underworld are all connected in a totally complicated mess! Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a pretty track, just like the peppy Kuan Main Doob Jaongi. A great movie with outstanding personality development!
