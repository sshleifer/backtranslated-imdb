Without being one of my favorites, it's good to change the tempo ... even for a few minutes. Everything begins with a big fight between Tom, Jerry and Spike is renamed "Butch" here). Everybody was beaten, but Spike suddenly makes a heroic and admirable decision: stops the fight and suggests that everyone is friends. So everyone signed a peace treaty and became friends ... it will not take long. The three have become loving, patient and kind to each other. He even saves one if one of them is in danger of life. The relationship is nothing but excellent until a big steak appears and everyone becomes greedy. The three are guilty of returning to their usual struggles and rivalries. But still ... seeing Tom, Jerry and Spike as friends is really a wonderful and gratifying experience, even if only for a while. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, as an extraordinary fact, there are two songs from "The Wizard of Oz" in instrumental versions: "We're Out to See the Wizard" and "Somewhere Over The Rainbow".
