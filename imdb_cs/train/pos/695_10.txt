This movie attracts you and attracts you to keep your eyes on the screen. The writer / director is brilliant with narrative parts and uses creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives that all add to the grip he will have on you. Insomniac's Nightmare is original and refreshing from the other movies you've seen. Is it a dream or a reality? This India will discuss you about the twists and turns that go through the conscious and unconscious. He has an eerie feeling with dark interpretations of illusions. Dominik Monaghan really became insomnia. He is a great actor who is not even hard on his eyes! He really poured his whole being into this role. From happening to the way it is shot, this India is one of my favorites. I recommend this very and eager to wait until I see more of this innovative creative writer / director / cameraman !!!
