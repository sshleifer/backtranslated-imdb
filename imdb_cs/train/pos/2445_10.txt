I like this show very much. That's why I was disappointed when I recently learned that George Lopez is racist and that he fired Masiel Lushu out of the show just because he found he was not an emigrant of Latin origin but was an emigrant from Albania. That's what I learned from the people at the show. She was really one of the better parts of the show and she learned that even among those who thought they were sensitive to racism that they could hate someone just because of the country they were born of is really disappointing.
