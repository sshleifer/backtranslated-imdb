There are some things I never understand; why lingerie is in packs of three, if it is clearly not a good example. Similarly, I will never understand this movie and that's great. If you come closer to this movie and expect a real movie, you can come close to Satan, who expects to embrace; although it may be possible if you salute the Satanic characters of this movie. Take Pitch for example; the most dangerous, campless, intangible portrait of the devil since Freddy Mercury and Wayne Sleep joined forces to create a Satan costume from ten feet of red color to the body and the corners covered with condoms. However, it creates some of the most merry moments of a movie ever. Seriously, this is not an understatement. The same applies to all other characters that prevent a girl who is so innocent that it is likely to be overcompensated for some serious crime he is part of. And then, if the Santa Reconstruction Station is real in the universe, there's no chance it can be avoided for so long. Simply put, if you have not seen this movie, you do not have to be considered a serious buff. Painful humorous characterization, acting, concept, and almost racism under radar is that we have to see any movie yet (if you are pure laughter that is).
