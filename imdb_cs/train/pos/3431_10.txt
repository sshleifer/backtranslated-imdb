Simply the best Estonian film I've ever seen, though it's done by Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi. Tallin Pimeduses is a fun thriller about a group of gangsters who are trying to steal a large amount of gold, a national treasure that belongs to the Republic of Estonia. At the same time, however, it is a summary of the conditions of many East European countries at the time. In the early 1990s, the Soviet Union collapsed and many countries, such as Estonia, became independent. Now conditions in most of these countries can be better. But in the early nineties, many new nations had to fight corruption and organized crime that the Soviet era left behind as an inheritance. (And many of them still do ... at least at some level ...) Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic film of that time with credible characters and a well-written script. The actors are also very good, especially Jüri Järvetová (perhaps the most famous Estonian actor, playing Snaut in Tarkovsky Solaris), playing and an old gangster who slowly becomes tired of his way of life. But the most amazing performance comes from Monika Mäger, a children's actor playing Terje, boys' girls in her early teens, whose presence in the plot is absolutely vital. (and her name is not even mentioned in the IMDb-credit list!) W <br /> <br /> There are not many movies in the world that can be both entertaining and artistic. But Tallinn Pimeduses does it. Their other Järvi-Laturi films are by no means such successes. His first, Kotia päin, was too artificial, and his last, History was made at night, was just a strange mess.
