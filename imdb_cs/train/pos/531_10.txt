This movie has the most beautiful start-up sequence ever made. I saw this film for the first time a week, since then every day I see the opening and every time I feel excited as I felt for the first time I heard David Niven, who told the immortal words of Sir Walter Raleigh Poutas: <br /> <br / > Give me my little girl of silence, My officer of faith to walk, My bite of joy, Immortal food, My bottle of salvation, My gown of glory, True hope; So, I'm going to take my pilgrimage (?) Do you know why Michael Powell and Emeric Pressuburger's life would be likely to be thoroughly justified by creating such a wonderful opening? Because they were already in the paradise of the poets long before they made the film. I imagine that both of them are facing the trial at Doomsday and disrespectfully say to God that he is sorry: Please forgive me, sir. So you want to know what we did during our lives? Well, you will see: We wrote directed and produced: I know where I am going, Colonel Blimp, red boots? Do you think that's enough sir? It is rather obvious that these two great artists have already fulfilled their duty with God, Nature Mouzou or whatever you might call when they filmed a matter of life and death. The fact that the lives of other people would be justifiable for their deeds would not be clear to all, even though I thought my life would make sense if I had never done anything other than seeing this movie. Of course the old people will be tempted to say: They do not already use such movies as this one. They will be partially wrong; they also did not make movies like in the past. <br /> <br /> I have quoted Keaton here, but I repeat his words: Beauty is joy forever.
