My third year of French classes was very popular with this film. In multicultural, high-school, the film provided many subjects for discussion (in French in the classroom, but I know much discussion continued in English by class). The most visible is the relationship between Protée and Aimée compared to Protée and France. I always mentioned that I felt that this film had one of the "most special" scenes I've ever seen in the movie. One year, a seventeen-year-old African American shouted, "Yes!" when he found out the scene: where Protée helps Aimee lace his evening dress, they all the time explore the reflection of the other in the mirror. Directors use "mirror technique" when they want to focus on internal conflict from one or more characters in the scene: it's a perfect example of technology and it's "sexy." <br /> <br /> Most students had problems understanding the end of the movie. One has suggested that Africa's one of the themes of the film is that, no matter how much he loves Africa or Africans, one can not "become" Africa (just as the driver tried to do): one must be an African.
