I have very nice memories of this film, as I have seen with my two younger sisters when it first showed me in 1977 and I was eight years old. It was obviously a failure - and is now virtually forgotten (a videotape with Mr. and Scene - which has never achieved a fair picture or is an ambitious composition of Panavision, which is now out of print). The film is very stylized (shades of YELLOW SUBMARINE) and certainly uneven. Some of the characters and sequences are wonderful, while others are somewhat youthful and indistinguishable. The sad blue blue camel (Eeyore shades) and its blue song are really heartfelt. Joe Raposo's songs are for the most part simply beautiful. Definitely useful curiosity that is likely (sadly) to fall into a complete unknown.
