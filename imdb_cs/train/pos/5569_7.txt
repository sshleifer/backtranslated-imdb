One day Cheech wants to get to his gut, so he tries to get Chong out of the house. Another problem is Cheech's brother "Red" (Cheech is another role) in the city and wants to hang him. Reaching that he could kill two birds with one stone, Cheech stops Chong and Red. What adventure will Chong and Red get? Will Cheech get his freak? How long will Chong go without smoke? Just watch CHEECH & CHONG'S NEXT MOVIE to find out! <br /> <br /> Tommy Chong took over the directors for the sequel. He gained some experience when he did some infinite work on UP IN SMOKE.
