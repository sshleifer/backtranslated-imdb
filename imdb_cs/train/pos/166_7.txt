This was the first film Joan Crawford and Clark Gable put together, and they will continue to do several more. The Crawford star, a young rich girl who is a father, is destroyed by the stock market stock market, and there is nothing for her and her brother. They never worked before, and Brother William Bakewell gets a job with Gable, a gangster, and Bakewell thinks it's going to be easy, but he gets over his head pretty fast. Crawford will become a journalist in the newspaper, but he wants to work on big stories, but he can give him worthless things to do. It is a massacre in which several Gable men are killed, and Crawford has witnessed the whole thing. It's a good movie, but it's not the best of them.
