Anyone who has spent the years of revenge of Nerds and Girlpower will appreciate this movie. It's one of the movies that brings you everything you want in a "spring break movie" PLUS that makes the fun of the genre of a college film. It's funny, it's got a dying actress (Amy Pohler, Rachel Dratch, Sophie Monk, Parker Posey, Jane Lynch, Amber Tamblyn !, Missi Pyle!) And guarantees you to laugh out loud. Writer / actor Rachel Dratch is a comic genius, and Sophie Monk is such a great villain. Wilson Phillips! FOR GOD! (I'm just repeating now ...) It's going to live with girls who like Miranda Juli, but they feel like they're ice cream and pretending to be stupid.
