In a series full of brilliant episodes, this one appears to be one of my favorite. It's not the deepest episode, it's not a big deal or a message. But it's a lot of fun and there are some great performances. But what really stands out for me is that, in my opinion, the episode * Twilight Zone * is with a * double * snapper finish. The zone is well known by giving a great surprise at the end of the story. But this time you have a surprise and you think it is, but it turned out he was waiting for another surprise. I like it very much, that's probably one of my two favorite episodes (the second is deeper and more news-oriented).
