The faithful adaptation of the fictional and interesting French novel about cynical and depressing middle-aged software engineers who rely heavily on the narrative of the first man is not worse. It seemed like something like an intellectual, Charles Bukowski (no matter what the CB plans). This is the best film that could describe movies and novels. Mordantly funny, but also a grim analysis of social and sexual relationships, the great success of the film is that it reflects real life in such a recognizable way that you ask yourself: why are not such other films such? One of the rare examples of a good book that produces the same good film.
