If you want Scream or something similar to a horrible product in a big studio that is bored today, do not bother. This well written film let me think about what he says. The importance of myth in our lives to make sense, how children interpret the world (and the violence in it), our eradication of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends ... all here, but not smoothly on the surface. Technically, you could call it a "monster filter", even though Wendigo does not have a physical shape at the end of life, and then it is up to you and your beliefs what's going on with the legendary spirit / animal. Some standard thriller elements for those looking for basics and the movie never bored, although in reality the less you see from the creation, the better. Fessenden successfully continues George Romer's tradition of using the genre as a parable and as a discussion forum while still maintaining us.
