That movie was amazing! I can not get over his songs. I think I'm too old for the musicals, but the movie deserves credit, guys! My special favorite was Jack Wild. I, a lover of British acting, can not keep me from all those young men who face the face. I never knew when Jack was making the movie, he was sixteen! Looks like an eleven-year-old. It's short, it helps. Try to post your replies, colleague posters, so I can take your experience. Oh, and Oliver Reed, the guy, Bill Sikes, I think the drones look really good. Any idea where he played before? If so, send her, I really would like to know.
