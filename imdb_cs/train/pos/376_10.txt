Spielberg's first dramatic film is not a lot. It's a beautifully shot film without any shortcomings about the life of an African-American woman. This also proves that not all the films that have African-American ethnicity as the center of the story have to be supported by the African-American director. What I like about this film is Spielberg's ability to make it very realistic despite the fact that it was based on a book. In addition, Danny Glover was excellent as Mr.. And usually he's alone in most movies. But it's going to develop completely and there's someone else once. However, Whoopi Goldberg brings the effect of resistance to the whole movie. She's great like Celia. You will never forget these characters once you've seen this movie. Now I have heard that his musical version will also be a movie and all I can say is: I hope it's about as good as this because it's a movie that should not be missed.
