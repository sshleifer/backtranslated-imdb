This film stands head and shoulders over the vast majority of film romantic comedies. It is practically flawless! Writing, acting, production, humor and patos are great! Even music - from Dean Martin to La Boheme - is charming and beautiful! Each character is extraordinarily beautiful and unforgettable, from the leading games played by Cher and Nicolas Cage on many supporting roles - Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello - even Grandpa with his dog! Each of these artists, plus Norman Jewison as a director, performs above their normal quality in this work. For several actors it was the first film premiere, so casting is also exceptional - and we have many contemporary performances whose career has been altered by their effectiveness in this film. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie several times all the time-which can sometimes basically suppress the impact of the movie.Moreover, a few years ago I realized that whenever I got into the scene from this movie - any scene The scene was convincing and beautifully crafted.There are so many stunning and unforgettable scenes of the original encounter between the characters Cher and Nicolas Cage, where Cage tells his story about the ache, Vincent Gardenia appeared with his paramour in the opera, amidst the splendor created by his gold mines, Olympia Dukakis John Mahoney shouts for studying with his classmate in collaboration with co-workers: "Do not move where you eat!" Danny Aiello at the bed of his dying mother Nicolas Cage "takes" Cher as a thrill of aria in the background! /> <br /> There are, of course, many great romantic comedies, including Sabrina (both versions, but especially the original Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart / William Holden) When Harry met Sally, Apartment. <br /> <br /> None of them equals Moonstruck!
