This is great! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding joined together to create a powerful and highly influential film. This is the real story of the first black diver of the US Navy and the obstacles he faced in obtaining his certificate in the hands of the racist Master of the Divers. On the way, he must also face the simple old fanaticism of all his classmates, none of whom want in his class. He leaves the barracks when he comes. He eventually becomes certified and continues his career as a diver of the US Navy. Look at that! It's a great story of courage and honor. As the story unfolds, we can see how racism dissipates slowly and everyone begins to respect the men at once.
