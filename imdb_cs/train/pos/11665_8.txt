I would not know about this film if not for my "surprise" nomination for an Oscar for best animated film. Luckily it happened that I could look at this revived little treasure. The story relates to Brendan's child, who was the nephew of an impressive and overbearing abbot from the town of Kells. The main pre-ordination of the abbot is to build a wall that protects Kells from the attacking Vikings. One day Aiden, a well-known illustrator from Iona, resorted to them. Aiden opens Brendan's eyes to the art of illustration and to the love of the outside world. On the way, Brendan made friends with Aisling's white wood cabinet as he tried to revive the ancient crystal that is valuable for the careful art of book illustration. "The Secret of the Kells" is unlike most animations these days. This is a return of species, as the illustrations are done in sharp geometric lines and constructions without much care of realism as well as symbolism. The movements of these lines resemble the simplistic, yet fluid, animation style used in the initial "Kung Fu Panda" sequence. However, it is a spectacular use of color, which is the main source of miracle for the audience. Worms used in the sequence of Viking invasions are unforgettably scary. <br /> <br /> Try to capture this quiet gem of the film. It's a welcome escape from all the absurd explosions of the current animated ride, such as "Monsters vs. Aliens," and so on. The scattered Celtic music score is effective in generating the fantasy that will make the film. Okay, the story could be a bit shallow and eventually a bit wanted. I would like to know more about the book on which Brendan and Aiden work. But the bright star of this film is clearly his amazing stylized artwork, which is said to be based on a work in the real Kells book.
