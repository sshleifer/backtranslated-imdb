The least inspired by Ivy Benson's productions and all of her girls 'orchestras that performed throughout the war in the Covent Garden Opera Gardens, this film records the attempts of an older saxophonist to reform (almost) all the girls' bands she played as a schoolgirl at the end of the Second World War. Too short a playback of the original band on the stage brought us great music and helped to fill the band's background and, in particular, the girl's relationships with a lone male member - their transvestite drummer (who is trying to avoid call-ups). Ian Holm ("The Lord of the Rings", "Cromwell and Fairfax") and Judi Dench in a great lead performance such as the recently widowed Elizabeth, Patrick, a drummer. Late Joan Sims is perfect as a band leader who is now playing piano at sea, and June Whitfield shines like a trombone Salvation Army player. Cameo performances of other giants such as Cleo Laine, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Billie Whitelaw make this unforgettable experience. The film is a bumpy memorial strip, with all the stars cast, what should be, thanks to all the rights, a lot of acting games over the mountain. The only thing I can say is, I hope that at their age I look so good! Especially Leslie Caron is still an incredible fox at the age of 69. Surely my pulse still gets! When I looked at it, I had to direct the director that I was not using age-matched women. Then I looked at the girls and found out that each one is old enough to play in London in 1944 (though it may be a bit of a stretch for Judi Dench). <br /> <br /> If you like a rocking band, you are enjoying nostalgia, or you just want to see how a good woman can look fair for almost three quarters of a century behind her, do not miss this movie. <br /> <br />
