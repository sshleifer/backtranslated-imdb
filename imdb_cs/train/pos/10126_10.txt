Much has been said about the Shinjuku Triad Society as the first real movie "Miike," and I thought this kind of description could be a cliché. But, like all clichés, it comes out of the truth. There are all Miike trademarks, violence, black humor, homosexuality, taboo testing, and a difficult central position. Shinjuku, however, is one of the most perfectly crafted Miike films. In the interview he says that if he did it again, it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what it means is that the film really has a breathtaking energy and a raw edge that seems so fresh that although it could be capable of capturing a visually or technically more complex film, it could not even replicate the purity of this film. <br /> <br /> As you can expect, violence is totally visceral, bloody and bloody bouts are complemented by a fantastic scene in which the woman has a broken face on her face. (Only the movie Miike could let you escape such a sentence.) The movie has a fantastic pace, unlike Dead or Alive, which begins and ends strongly and falls in the middle. Dead or Alive also deals with similar issues, Miike is clearly concerned about the relationship between the Japanese and the Chinese in the postwar period, and this emotional subject is well worked out here, the central figure really comes to life when you begin to understand his past. <br /> <br /> I can not see Shinjuku's praise enough. I do not want to give up too much. This is Miike before he started using CGI to revive his movies and almost resembles something like Kitano's Sonatas. The central characters are greatly executed and the final twist guarantees that once the movie is over, you will jump again to solve it all.
