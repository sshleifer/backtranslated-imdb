Only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite I remembered seeing Cracker Bag. Just beautiful sentiments, and yet they never look at being beaten. There's amazing cinematography, and the lead girl is pretty great. It captures more than the nostalgia of time. It has the right heart. It is an achillian blow to childhood that is beautiful and painful. A simple story is always effective when it's done well. This Glendyn Ivina has a great future and I for one, and I'm looking at his next project. Continuing is always the hardest thing to do. It's like the second blues album for most people. <br /> <br /> I just hope that his next film will not be something lame like a shark movie. Everyone's healthy. Enjoy the cinema.
