I have never heard of this movie, even though I have made contact with George Clooney (whose company he has produced and appears in a very entertaining supportive battle) and his director of ocean 11 Steven Soderbergh. Worse yet, we've picked it in a $ 4.99 discount basket (for Canadian dollars!) What a great and pleasant surprise. But then I think if William H. Macy is in that, you can not be disappointed. It was very much reminded of those Ealing comedies from England in the 1950s. OK, with more nagging. This is a oddball and sometimes a splitting splitting film. The real robbery made me laugh so we cried. Perhaps the funniest use of the pods in the history of the film. Maybe it was the low expectations I went there but I followed with a whole group of people and we had an explosion. The best five dollars I spent in the age.
