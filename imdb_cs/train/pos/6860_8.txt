The psychotic transsexual Bobbi murders the patient (Angie Dickinson) of the prominent doctor (Michael Caine) and then seeks a prominent prostitute (Nancy Allen) who has seen Bobbi in the elevator. Liz (Allen) is a crime suspect and works with the patient's son (Keith Gordon) to capture the murderer. It can be summed up in a few words: it's very sexy (Dickinson and Allen look great), it's very bloody - with such a kind of gore, which is usually reserved for movies, and the boy is well carved. Scenario writer and director De Palma is fine but really has a back seat for human film capabilities. It is very successful at the visceral level and I really care about these figures. I can see the De Palma standard Hitchcock count - at least one of the master shots. And to start with everything, it has a professional and credible cast. <br /> <br /> This was the third De Palmy movie with former wife Nancy Allen (after "Carrie" and "Home Movies"). <br /> <br /> By the way, actress Rachel Ticotin, production assistants. There are a little trivia for you. I do not think the thriller could be elegant and bloody at the same time, but this picture pulls it. One of the best things about this is typically a remarkable musical score by Pino Donaggio. <br /> <br /> 8/10
