In what is a truly diverse cast, this show will hit your footsteps on FOX. This is the kind of sitcom that grows on you. If you only look at 1 show, you may not like it very much, but when you look at two or three, you get into it. <br /> <br /> This is because some jokes hit & some were missing depending on how you see them. As is common today, the themes are very mature. Humor is also very mature. Often the most amazing parts are parts where mature motifs collide with innocents. Red (Kurtwood Smith), a veteran actor, makes very good humor at this show. Debra Jo Rupp also plays well in this cast cast. Danny Masterson, the oldest "child" actor, is also very good. Laura Prepon (Donna) looks better in her early shows as a natural redhead (who thought she would make her a blonde?). It shows very good talent and comedy timing often. She looks good without thinking. This is one of the better contributions to FOX in the comic book department, and it's the most successful live action ever since she was married to children
