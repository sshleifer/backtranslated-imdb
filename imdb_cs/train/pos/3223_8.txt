Ok, basically it's a sci-fi popcorn movie, but it's clear from the very beginning that it's driven by great intelligence. You can count on the ten clich√©s that make up the film, but it only brings about three of them, and a couple of them have been told to tell you again that the director did not expect you to be an idiot. Kurt Russell is really great acting and brings the depth from the character that is surprising and rewarding. We recommend that if you just saw something really stupid and would like to restore your faith!
