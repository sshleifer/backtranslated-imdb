It all started with True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse. Noble Heart Horse meets Dawn & John and takes them to see the true bear heart. Later the care gauge went down and checked the Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse to see if it was Dark Heart but could not go if the club did not make it and so they would ask Dawn & John to look after the club. After Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse returns, Dawn & John is sent back to camp. Before the bears of the club and cousins ​​grew up to prepare for the fight with the dark heart. Finally, the Dark Heart has kidnapped all the bear, and children (Dawn & John) must tell Christy that Dark Heart is evil. Then they work together to save Care bears. Later, True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse discovered that he would become a dark heart and return to the care of the earth to find out he was gone. Children (Dawn, John, & Christy) are coming but they were not powerful enough to stop the Dark Heart. True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse come to help Dawn, John and Christy to free the other bears, but Christy has come to the road and was hit by the Dark Heart. The Dark Heart saw that Christy got into the fight and stopped fighting with the guardian to help her, but she could not, because Dark Heart (himself) does not have Christy's rescue care. Care carries and children help Dark Heart except Christy. The dark heart began to care and became a real boy who fell in love with Christy. Dark Heart is now a real boy and helps Christy work in the camp. <br /> <br /> This is a great step all the time and the best Care Care Bears movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Like all caregivers, I have movies and I can not wait to see Care Bears: Big Wish Movie (2005). Who likes this movie?
