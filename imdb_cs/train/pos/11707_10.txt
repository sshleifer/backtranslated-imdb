I remember seeing this movie long ago, even though it did not have any special effects, the acting was really good. And it still has the same message for today, even if technology has changed, perhaps it should make a remake of this movie, it would be interesting to see a remake. I also enjoyed the music from the film, Larry Norman was during this period a really good composer, although most Christian music is now worshiping and praising the music. I was always curious what happened to Patty after the show? She continued filming more films, eventually taking and waking up a family? I would like an update.
