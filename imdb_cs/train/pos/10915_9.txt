The RKO studies have decided to ask William Powell of MGM and Jean Arthur of Colombia to take part in one of their larger budget efforts to gain the popularity of The Thin Man. They have done it to some extent. Many people forget that except and before Nick Charles, Bill Powell also starred in several of Phila Vance's films in the title role. So this time he was very good in the role. Dr. Bradford does not do as much liquid lunch as Nick Charles, but the basic crazy Nick is still there. One difference is that while Nick Charles married an heiress, Dr. Bradford is working on living as a doctor. It helps in his acquisition of the detective and actually does it in this movie. He has two murders to resolve. The rider falls from a horse that comes to the homestretch of a large race and will die for no apparent reason. The coach suspects something wrong but is discouraged by the conventional bullet method. That's when he comes to Bill Powell for help. Myrna Loy had a more powerful influence on Bill Powell than Jean Arthur. Arthur plays it like more dizzying ladies than Loy. But it works here and she and Powell have a good chemistry. Still Reliable James Gleason is a police inspector in the role of Sam Levene / Nat Pendleton. All they needed was Asta and maybe Eric Blore, while Powell's chamberlain tried it. If Powell and Arthur were signed in this studio, we could see a bunch of Bradford movies.
