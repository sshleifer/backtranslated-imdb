So I was home and one night I was going through the canals and I came across the man who wore heels and makeup and stood in front of the HBO background. Of course I did a double trip and decided to look for a moment. I did not change the channel until it was completed, so incredibly cheerful. The next time I arrived, I made sure I would stick it so I could watch it again and again, and it was one of my favorite things. During the first few minutes, you can say that the audience is not quite sure what they think, but they quickly win them with their incredible humor and joke. While many comic adherents mix in the brain, Eddie Izzard is one of the best. His style is incredibly refreshing, and it's nice to hear jokes about things like history and puberty when most comics keep up with current events. His show then stayed with me. During the summer I went to Italy and during the time I was there I thought that "Italy is always on scooters" CIAO ... "" 10 out of 10. You see it. You will not regret it.
