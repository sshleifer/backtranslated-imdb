This movie has a special way of telling the story, initially I found it strange when jumping over time and I had no idea what was going on. Anyway, the story line was simple, but still very real and touching. The first time you met someone, they completely fell in love, but eventually they broke up and rose to death. Who did not go through it? but we will never forget this kind of pain in our lives. <br /> <br /> I think I touched a bit because the two actors showed great performance in showing love among the characters. I just want the story to be a happy ending.
