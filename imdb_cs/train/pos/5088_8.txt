I never knew when I was watching a movie designed for an idiot box. I always thought it was a very successful film of the late 90's. But when I saw on the internet that it was meant for television, I was shocked because it is absolutely fantastic for a television movie! The thing that I was most interested in was the length. I felt the one on one battle scene had to be removed because it was totally useless. It also began to move towards the end, for it seemed that the adventure never ended. <br /> <br /> On the plus side is a powerful, very interesting and captivating plot with beautiful performances by all. I just felt Patrick Frayze looked a little embarrassed. I also felt that Gogool, who looked nasty, somewhat stupid in some scenes. I was beautiful in Africa. Also the first half of the movie would make me give this movie 9. It's a great movie for television. 8 out of 10.
