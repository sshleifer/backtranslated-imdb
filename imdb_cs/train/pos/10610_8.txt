Sweet young mountain with a sad past (Henry Thomas) comes to a deserted little girl in the woods and immediately falls in love with her. Older men generally support him in keeping a child, although local temptations (Cara Seymour) have little thought of a new family. A determined little girl on a long walk and a sinister traveler (David Strathairn in his smartest) have parallel stories that come together in a fateful way. This is a charming life in Ozarks in the same spirit as "Where the Lillies Bloom" and "The Dollmaker". All three were shot down in the beautiful hills and covered the lives of ordinary - but not simple people - of American people. Minimal strong language and short, but acute violence make this relatively safe family tracking.
