This is a great track and a nice change of pace from today's hectic and louder films. It's another solid business based on real deal, which still means that much of it can be made for dramatic purposes. Honestly, I do not know, but I liked the story. The story concerns a young man back in the 1950s who is interested in rocketry and wants to enter this field instead of working in coal mines like everyone else, including his father, doing in this city of West Virginia. A big problem is the conflict between the boy and his father, who I think was overstated. I would like to have less tension between these two. The young man, still a boy, plays Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his first starry tasks. He's as sympathetic as his schoolmates do. It's nice to see beautiful kids in modern film. The other two major players in the film are Chris Cooper (father) and Laura Dern (the child's teacher who still supports him). Cinematography is decent as music from the 1950s can be heard. Again: I wish there were more similar films.
