For the first time, I have seen this totally boring documentary in its initial release in 2001, and it really has had a profound effect on me, so I decided to tell a few of my friends to see it with me for repeated projections. After all: none of my friends got disappointed (at all!). This star film is about Scottish conceptual artist Andy Goldsworthy, who creates a totally beautiful work of art using natural materials (wood, water, flowers, rocks, etc.) and creates pieces that eventually return to their natural form the temporary state of everything?) . We see how Goldsworthy creates several temporary art works, as well as some of his long-term installations in major galleries around the world, as well as several pieces in the natural world. German film director Thomas Riedelsheimer directs, photographes and adjusts this meditation on the creative process that is a real experience for both the eye and the ear (with an ambient musical score composited and performed by Fred Fritz, a generally noisy experimental / noisy textured guitar, as well as a capable ensemble of musicians). Although this movie has been available on DVD for several years, if you find a cinema that highlights the revival of this subtle film, it suddenly finds it (it's an easy movie that was composed for a big screen, the perfect sound system that really experiences this movie the right way ). No MPAA rating, but contains nothing to offend (unless the live birth of the sheep on the screen is intended for violation or interference)
