Director Sam Fuller has something cult, especially in Europe. Yet most of his films are more than forgotten. But he did one really amazing movie in "Pickup on the South Street". He got quite early in his career, the films that followed were far worse. From the first to the last slide, "Pickup" works at all levels. It is filmed with impeccable fluidity and boasts all round performances. Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter both players with an excellent record of top performances are at the top. Widmark, who was not a stranger to playing villains, although he really keeps to the core, can still reveal only the smallest humanity that makes his character fascinating, as well as the tightening of Jean Peters' character for him even more credible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> There is a scene in which Jean Peters crushes Widmark. It's really shocking in your reality. This is not the case with choreographic photography. <br /> <br /> Less conscious awareness than many film noirings of this period remains a great example of this genre.
