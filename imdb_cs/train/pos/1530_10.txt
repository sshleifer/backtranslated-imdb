View old people ???? I'm 15 and I've been watching the show since I was 12 years old and every day I copied it to the Sky + Hallmark Hallmark and BBC 1. I really wish they did not cancel or get the right farewell. But what about the adventures, all those episodes, I think I've seen them all, and nobody seems to think I did not like and enjoy it. His shame, the BBC, continues the exchange between Murder diagnoses and "The Murder She wrote" - I have never seen her and I do not intend. Anyway, the characters in the diagnosis of murder are so deep, and the chemistry among the actors is amazing. It really was a sad day when they canceled this show ........
