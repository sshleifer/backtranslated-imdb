If you have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin ... do a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about Herg√© and his life created by Tintin. I'm so brilliant and great production. The whole underlying story of Herges and the people, as well as the many different situations that have been affected, for the good and the aggravation, is amazing. Among the comic books, and that's just a very gentle and obvious connection. I'm sure to rebuild the Tintin albums in my basement. Also, the film is very well known in itself and has great ambient sound. I really hope that people will find it interesting as me!
