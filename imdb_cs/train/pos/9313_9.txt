I liked this show very much - we got the first and only one, it seems, the UK series on Channel 4. Characterization was right on the money - a bit like the Simpsons, because all the different aspects of the small town population were no laughing trace - at that time I did not see the American television comedy except Larry Sanders, and it really worked well, raising the suggestion that these hideous cops I really liked, and not just that I did it for the cameras. Overall, I thought it was a very small number that shone me upright: I can not help, but I thought maybe it was not. certain audiences. I think it would be a cult hit in the UK if it turned out to be an acceptable hour. <br /> <br /> I rounded it up with my standard commentary: Where the hell can I get to watch it again? Some ideas?
