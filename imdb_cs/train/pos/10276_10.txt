The opening of the film with Bach Toccata is a sound hint of what to develop in this intense course. All Bach composite equipment perfect for listener (and artist) to be entertained and entertained, relates to this film. There is no mutual tendency between the two leading figures, and the lead woman in the final scene that I feel is justified in claiming she was raped, even though her convict feels she has been warned to be incense. Mamet convincingly examines the emotional gap and the differences between the sexes, but I feel he is powerless about how they compliment each other because he gives them a healthy sense of humor. If Mamet ever developed a healthy humorous interest in gender interaction, I wonder how would this job end? Because it exists, it is very dark and average.
