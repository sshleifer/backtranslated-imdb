This movie is a very entertaining horror anthology film written by Robert Blochem (author of psycho). It's a good fun for horror fans and has a great cast. The film should also be required for Dr. Who's fans because Jon Pertwee (the third doctor) has a funny role as a rough and annoying horror star!
