Brilliant! My wife and I joined the wide line and saw Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival. After seeing the movie, I can understand why this line was so long. Holly is a moving story about an impossible connection between two people. She's a young girl, she's worn west. The film captured every bone in our body. There are no graphic scenes or something that is hard to follow - it's a surrealism of normality that really kicks you in the intestines. The film is beautifully shot. Among other things, we liked the scene where Patrick teaches Holly to ride a small motorcycle. Thuy Ngoyen's Pregnancy (I can not believe it's her first acting work), and Ron Livingston's performance stayed with me for a few days. Highly recommended.
