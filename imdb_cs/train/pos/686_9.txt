Ghost Story (TV movie - 1972) was the pilot of the NBC series. The film was well written and performed well, and I thought that when the 1972-73 TV season began, if the TV series is half as film, NBC has a winner. (I wish this movie was available on the video!) The series was a huge disappointment - even with William William as executive. manufacturer. But if you have the chance to see the original Ghost Story TV movie, look at it. You will not be disappointed.
