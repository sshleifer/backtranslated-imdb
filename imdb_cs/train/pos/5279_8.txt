They will not repeat everything that has already been told by other viewers of this film. In my opinion, this is an excellent film, not just as a very human story of a growing relationship between father and his adult son, but also as a small window into the world of Islamic practitioners, for those like me who do not know much about this religion. An important aspect of this story is that the young man's relationship to his father's whirlwinds and practices and how his attitude towards religion seems to change in subtle ways as we progress on their journey with them. This is a very thought-provoking, pleasant and well prepared film that I would recommend to someone with a brain and heart.
