I'll be short. I believe this is an extraordinary film. I see other reviewers who have commented that they are badly written, badly shot, have a terrible soundtrack, and even worse that it's not real in their life. OK, so it does not have to be the whole length, but this movie carries the message of hope that some others apparently missed. I hope it is not too late to save people from the terrible things that happen in so many lives. Gangland violence is real, right? It's right, no! This film carries an important social message that cynics may not like, but which must be praised rather than disparaging. I watch this film with great pleasure at least eight times, each time with the same enjoyment, and with the feeling that maybe the world might be better and not out of rescue (and not until 2008). 9 out of 10 for me. In my opinion, it is almost perfect. JMV
