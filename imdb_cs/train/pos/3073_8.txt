This is the type of movie that Hollywood needs more. No extravagant props, no pursuit of vehicles, no smart unicorns. Only people who deal with being people. William Macy plays an unlikely hitman who works for his father, Donald Sutherland. Macy is a sympathetic son, Sutherland is the dominant father. Son wants business, father will not let him. Macy loves his son, played beautifully by David Dorfman ("The Ring"). She also begins to fall in love with Neve Campbell, a girl she meets in the psychiatric office waiting room. It's an interesting juxtaposition of the character and the film follows a reluctant killer when he balances his own with his family. There are many moving scenes, especially between Macy and his little boy. And as if you were waiting in a movie with William Macy, it's a bit of humor. Also great work, actors and director. I'm glad they can make good movie in Hollywood for a small budget.
