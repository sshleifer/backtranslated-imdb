If you did not see this great movie about life in the 1990s (in L.A.), then you missed special treatment. This is one of the most amazing and powerful films about life for Americans in the 1990s, which even brings to the world we live in today. Includes everything from getting a child, prejudice (more than one way), love, adultery, empty nesting syndromes, selfishness, and the list goes on. This story builds on a perfect climax, and then when it does not matter, it always returns to love with friends, family and love for life. It helps us dig in and try to look for what we want from life. He gives us the questions of ourselves. We did enough for others, we love it, etc. ??? Sit down and enjoy a beautifully finished and emotional movie that I'm sure others will enjoy all my life. Take note of Mary McDonnell, Kevin Kline, and Danny Glover's great performance throughout this movie. These actors are amazing and really show the real glimpse and the meaning of what is being sent to everyone. These are three of my favorite actors around the world when I saw this movie more than 10 years ago. I still like it again and again. Also enjoy a great soundtrack with him and do not forget to count the number of times you see the helicopter fly and try to find out that it's a symbol for a movie ?? Hmmm ... I almost forgot that it's probably Steve Martin's first serious role in any movie he's ever made. He also does an excellent job in this film. This can be a surprise for most of you. Sit down, relax and enjoy a really good movie .....
