The movie can be great. I just watched it last night, but I did not feel able to give it an honest opinion because I first read the book. The book is much better than the movie that was disappointed with the film. If you are planning to watch "Human Fools," do not read the book in advance. On the other hand, the book is so good and it contains much more than Phillip's love affair with Mildred after you've seen the movie. I can not imagine this claim easily. On average, I read the book every 4 days and read such disparate authors as Danielle Steel, Ovid, Faulkner, Plato and Shakespeare. "Of Human Bondage" has my vote as one of the ten best novels ever written.
