This story based on two works by Edgar Allen Poe ("Usher's Fall of the Dwarves", "Dance of Death") is actually pretty scary from beginning to end. As with some old black and white movies about people in an old house (such as "Cat and Canary", "Old Dark House", "Night of Terror" and so on). Boris Karloff plays a demented inventor of dolls in size that terrorize guests. Will die soon in the movie (or yes?) And the inhabitants of the house are exposed to a number of scary experiences. I'm not going to be too detailed here, but it's definitely necessary for fans of old dark secrets. <br /> <br /> Watch it with lots of popcorn and soda in the dark room. /> <br /> Dan Basinger 8/10
