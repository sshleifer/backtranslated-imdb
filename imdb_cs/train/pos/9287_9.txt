Several young Iranian women dress up as boys trying to get into a qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain. When caught, they are placed in an area where the match remains within reach but out of sight. Prisoners want to let go, but rules are rules. Due to the genealogy of her director Jafar Panahi, disarmament was to find that Offside was a comedy and often cheerful. In 1997, The Mirror, Panahi features two versions of an Iranian girl and lets viewers wonder who is "real". In a circle in 2000, several Iranian women were out of the system; their offenses are different, but they all end up in the same tragic location. But think now about Offside, it's hard to imagine it as anything but comedy, because the situation it poses is so obviously ridiculous. Because women want to know why they can not watch a football match and their hijackers are trying to answer, the only possible outcome is comedy. What does Offside most likely mean that young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system. They are simply fans of football and patriots, and despite the fact that they are unjustly acting with them, they will never lose focus on the struggle and historic victory that is in their national grasp.
