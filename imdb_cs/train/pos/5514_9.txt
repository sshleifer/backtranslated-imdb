I was looking at the first part two days ago and today I saw the second part. Of course, both parts are apart, so I'm a little shaken by what I've just seen. I felt I was destroyed by the sense of the inevitability of Chea's death; for me, the whole film was covered. I suppose exactly what Soderbergh wanted to feel, the slowly evolving inevitability of his death. The second part was so unfavorable compared to the inevitable again, but it was positive in Cuba and was so negative in Bolivia. The policy of the Bolivian movement was mentioned only, but rarely confronted didactically. For me, memorable scenes were all at the end of the film: confrontation with the prisoner and a milder conversation with the Bolivian official, where this official Che is singing about the failure of the peasants to support his revolution. I did not recognize that national differences played a role in conflict, Argentina vs. Bolivia. I thought Soderbergh was admirably concerned with the inevitable supply problems in the revolutionary struggle; how to get food without disturbing peasants who do not have enough of themselves. I was struck by how difficult it was to try something like Che was trying. I think it's all timing; there is enough anger against the government to initiate the movement; in Bolivia was not. Che realized the terrible coronation of the revolutionaries in his letter Fidel read at the beginning of the film: If not now, when, 50 years. Very thoughtful and well-done film; try to see him.
