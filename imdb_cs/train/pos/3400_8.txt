Domini Enfilren (Marlene Dietrich) spent most of her life caring about her father. Now that he died, he is free - but he does not know what he wants. Boris Andrew (Charles Boyer) is a monk who has escaped from the monastery to taste more life. They happen to meet in Algiers, fall in love and marry. But she can not leave her past and can not live without it ... WAY overcame a romance full of hysterically wrong dialogue and situations. Dietrich and Boyer are doing the best to give good performances, but NOBODY could get away with some of their lines! Still, in a way, it's a classic. It's filmed in a gorgeous Technicolor (try to see it on DVD) where every picture is terribly beautiful. Dietrich is always dressed in 9 years (even in the middle of the desert) and hits hysterical poses to show his clothes and body. Boyer just walks around and seems to be injured (no shock). Still, I never bored. He was amazing to look at, and the constant stupid dialogue held me in the stitch. The end almost fell out of my chair because I was so laughing! Now I love blasphemous romance and I give them plenty of space, but really --- that's incredible! It also runs a very short 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> As a classic camp, I give it 8. As a serious movie - 1.
