I recently saw this movie due to Jake's recent success with Brokeback Mountain. I thought I'd see the movies I missed. I had no expectation of going to the movie, so I was amazed by the fact that I did not even notice the movie. It's a stunning father and son story, and that's also a clumsy story. I even broke the tear to the final of this wonderful story. This film attracts all ages. The only reason I gave her 9 out of 10 is that it slows a bit in the middle, but eventually returns to the end. The game was great, the story was spectacular and cinematography was exciting with the setting of the movie. READ THIS FILM! Rental, Buy, Watch, LOVE IT! I know I did it!
