A tragically beautiful movie ... brings us to Japan, which no longer exists. Despite Hollywood technical knowledge, I have not seen a movie (Hollywood) that would match the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town by the river by the sea ... This last Samurai Tom Cruise liked the last installment of Lord of the Rings trying to capture old Japan. <br /> <br /> If you love a quiet but intense story line, you have to see the movie. It's going to go out of hollow flashy films, like the last 1000 burgers you've seen. I think this is one of the better Kurosawa stories. Although it is a film about geysers and brides and the complex rules governing life in such an environment, it did not change the skin film. The characters are full of depth and work with great intensity.
