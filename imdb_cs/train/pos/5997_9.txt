Let me start by never evaluating the IMDb movie before; but I'm alone in the video. And it comes from being receptive; I can say, without shadow of doubt, that this film is what should be short. It has a very good story and another thing I love - (even better twist). The opening was very well done, I loved the video selected for him and how he was edited. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of B & W, but the way this movie uses the effect that works. And with any movie on which everything is important. The course of the film works perfectly and the adjustments have been made very well. From the technical side of things (which I normally do), everything is also very well done. There are no major technologies. things that need to be emphasized. Few is that the final credits are a bit bouncy. This is probably caused by a rendering problem. Let me also say that I'd rather see more of the love scene, but I'm a guy (so you can shake it up to a human factor). So overall I'm going 9/10. It is worth it if you are fans of India and / or short films. <br /> <br /> I apologize for bad grammar or spelling.
