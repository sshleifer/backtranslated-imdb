This is an excellent movie with stellar cast and great actor. I've never been looking at it. I particularly like the scene where Danny Glover's character and character of Kevin Kline, Simon and Mack, have a common brunch. Kevin Kline is so natural and it seems that his manners are effortless and one you would often encounter. So it's a very "real" movie. One of the strongest scenes in the movie is, however, at the beginning of the movie when Simon arrives at the scene where Mack's car has collapsed. The film also has a strong message and is unlike the stereotypical message of the film, where the audience is a person who preached his courage. Instead, actors' emotions and situations bring an impact message that is best done without the use of words. And finally, Mary McDonell is as good as ever.
