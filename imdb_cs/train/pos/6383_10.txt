I thought this movie was very nice. I was looking at a movie with my wife BEFORE my first child. That's why I did not see her as just family entertainment, and I still enjoyed it. Many reviews seem to indicate that this film is not broken on the ground, there are no unexpected changes in fences, and that the film was predictable and boring. If these people were watching this movie and expected to have religious experience, they would probably be disappointed. This is simply an animated movie; nothing more. If you want to simply sit and have fun, you will not be disappointed. In conclusion, this is definitely not the best film that Disney has created, but it's funny and I do not get the bad reputation it got.
