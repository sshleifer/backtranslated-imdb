Do you think you're tough? You should watch this movie. Carl Brashear is the embodiment of courage and determination. The reason why this man had to go through the diver should be an inspiration to all of us. And after I saw this movie, I learned that what is shown is not half! Kuba Gooding, Jr. does some of his best work on a date like Brashear. De Niro, as usual, is good as a southern redneck who trains him. George Tillman, in his second feature (after "Soul Food"), made a quantum leap as a filmmaker. To be moved and inspired, you must certainly check this situation.
