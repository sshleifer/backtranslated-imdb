Oh, what fun is there! <br /> <br /> Amy Heckerling has a taste for the direction of comedy (Fast Times on Ridgemont High, Look Who's Talking), but here she seems to have told the actors to go out and have fun. Micheal Keaton merges into John's role, more easily his best performance on screen. Joe Piscopo is great as a well-known Danny Vermin, what a pity the directors have not picked up on. And I even mentioned Richard Dimitri that he plays Moronie and the unique vocabulary of the character. I do not think it's a coincidence that most character names are written by MORON. <br /> <br /> Good lines are sprinkled all over the film, with Peter Boyle, Griffit Dunne. Maurren Stapleton, Merilu Henner gives a good line. Even actors with minor roles such as Dick Butkus and Alan Hale will get a good line. They recommend this to a friend.
