I've been looking for this movie for years, apparently not available in the States, so I bought a copy of Ebay. Four young hunters and three of their girlfriends went into the woods looking for a bear, apparently killing several campers. What they find is a former Vietnamese vet crazy (kills some of his victims with a long metal gauntlet and la Freddy Krueger). When the night falls, one of the girls goes on a walk after a brief argument with her boyfriend, kills her. Once one of the groups finds their body, they all hide in their rocks and wait for the daylight. As soon as the sun arrives, everyone will try to solve it, but they become victims one at a time. Seven bodies that are not lots of blood, but a few good murders, deaths. The boys are killing somewhat bloodless ways (blowing in the car, shooting, knife in the head). <br /> <br /> Overall, INFERNAL TRAP is a nice movie slasher from the late 1980s. Nothing new, just working well, quick and some pretty ladies. 10 out of 10.
