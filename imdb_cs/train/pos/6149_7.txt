I have just bought a restored version of the movie, which I remember with a great affection from childhood, and it is definitely for a curious afternoon fun. Bedknobs definitely makes more sense in its entirety, the dropped scenes (especially those with McDowall) combine the events together quite neatly. What is a little worrying is the way the scenes were changed. It is obvious that the soundtrack of this track was lost or damaged, so some bright spark at Disney decided to play the scene with a new interview. Which would be great, except that half the cast was not about it (some of the better reasons than others) and the whole thing has poor quality for him. Some of the lip-synching are quite poor and David Tomlinson's voice was called a boy who sounded absolutely nothing like David Tomlinson (I think there's actually a hint of German). However, it is good to listen to the full versions of all the songs (even though "Step in the right direction" is still missing) and the moments of magic in this movie still live. And I urge you not to giggle when young Paul looks so innocently on Angela Lansbury and Coos "but what does it have to do with my knob?"
