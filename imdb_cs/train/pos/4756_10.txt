This is one of the more adventurous twilight episodes, with an entertaining dialogue and fun characters that interrupt the tension of some creepy moments. Is there a usual dancer with a blond pattern (what happens to Serling's hobby for such a character that he still shows up in different episodes?) And other varied characters, but he's an "old man" Jack Elam who completely steals the show. I think this is a funny and reckless version of "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street" - or perhaps the 20-minute Twilight Zone parody "The Thing". In the next note: I thought a young lover of this episode might be someone who went on with other things - he looked good - but it seems that "Ron Kipling" disappeared after two TV credits in his name.
