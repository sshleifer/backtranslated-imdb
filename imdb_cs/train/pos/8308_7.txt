It suits the musical Sunday to draw your heart and no one can do it better than Little Richard. The man could sing the ladies' drawers and define rock and roll. Look at Leon to provide a definitive characterization as he did with David Ruffin at The Temptations and Jackie Wilson in Mr. Rock 'n' Roll: The story of Alan Freed. It was a fascinating biography, as we saw Little Richard struggling with his father, with his church and with himself who it was. He won the battle and no one else has his voice or his style.
