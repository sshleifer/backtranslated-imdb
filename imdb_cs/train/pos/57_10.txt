I must say that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen! I was boring and I looked at the t.v. and found "Home Room" and it's been about 5 minutes, but I'm addicted. It was so interesting and moving. It shows what can happen in someone's life. I give him 10 or more if possible. The director / writer and the actors did a great job. I think teens should watch this movie and learn from it. It was great, drama, secrets, and more. I cried for hours! I think the director / writer should write more movies like this one. I loved it! I did not even know about this movie, which is sad because it was so good. I wish she could go to the movies to see more people.
