Far from my favorite favorite cartoon movie Spielberg, I did Animation. Even if the rating was low, the fact that I still enjoyed and loved it was so funny and I loved casting where Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were just fantastic, the whole movie was great, especially the legendary Frank Welker. I would like to see this cartoon again, it was so amazing and the jokes were great. I also remember the funny moment when the Brain appears, you hear his voice and it's the instrumental theme of PATB, it was just fantastic, I love it in those cartoons when actresses appear. I wish this cartoon and Animaniacs were back, I loved them
