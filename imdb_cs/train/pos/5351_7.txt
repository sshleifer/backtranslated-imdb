Although this film is somewhat filled with 80th cheese, I have a place for it on my DVD stand and I do not know why. I think I like it because the moral of the story is "television is garbage, so turn it off and go and get your life." For those of you who choose to listen to the message, then you should try to read the book, its nothing at all like the movie at all. To destroy it at the end of the story, the fatally wounded Richards will end up breaking a plane into a network building, killing each other inside and closing the network at the same time. I read it many years ago, but today it would be difficult to compare it to 9/11.
