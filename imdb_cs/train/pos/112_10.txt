EUROPA (ZENTROPA) is a masterpiece that gives the audience the excitement that had to come with the narrative movie's birth almost a century ago. This film is truly unique and a piece of genius. Camera and editing are great and combined with the narrative tropical scenes used in the film create a mysterious and unforgettable movie experience. The participation of Barbara Suwkowa and Eddie Constantine in the cast are two wine pleasures to be seen and enjoyed. Max Von Sydow tells his great voice as a narrator. <br /> <br /> A unique movie! Four stars (highest rating).
