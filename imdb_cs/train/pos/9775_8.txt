Kali tears are an original, yet horrible horror film that penetrates the history of a cult group in India composed of German psychologists who have learned to control their will and their bodies to the point that they can cause others to heal radical techniques (which can to cause hallucinations at night-time and physical pain and torture) to release the upright demons inside them. The film is portrayed as a series of testimonies about the Taylor-Eriksson group - the above-mentioned culture. The first segment is somewhat slower than the rest, but serves gently to set the prerequisites for the rest of the movie. The rest is played as a movie "mindf @ ck" with some key clips in the mix (a full queue of nudity, some gore) to keep you happy. <br /> <br /> I would say check it out. It does not have to be spectacular, but its concept is pretty neat and brings it to the right places. 8/10.
