I consider myself a great admirer of David Lynch's work because he gives viewers unique movies with typical "Lynch elements". When I saw most of my works, I naively thought I could predict Lynch's next step. I was wrong. Dumbland is something I could never imagine under the name of David Lynch. Still, after my recovery from the first shock, I began to think about this extremely primitive person and I came to the conclusion that all the absurdities, cruelty, brutality and disgust that we present here mirror the bits of reality and emphasize the distorting ones. There are things in our lives that we hardly emphasize because they are either nasty or terrible, but they surround us, so I dare say that Dumbland focuses on these pieces. It's not a movie that you could enjoy, even if you ever laugh at a strange, perverse sense of humor, that is the animated reflection of all the things we rather refuse to observe, its simplicity, morbidity and absurdity. Take it as it is, you do not have to like it. It just exists. Finally, if you are careful enough, you will also find features typical of Lynch. I recommend it for tolerant people !!!
