I have long been disappointed - even if the film also has sad moments, especially when it changes from hyper-fun to fair and serious. Characters are mostly real, sometimes sappy, but fairly believable. I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's show - I'm sorry about the people involved. This movie is instead satire and it makes it great. It is a pity that all the fools were * destroyed while broadcasting on public television that enjoys it. I'm going to rent this movie to enjoy it. <br /> <br />
