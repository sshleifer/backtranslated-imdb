This movie was very funny. Soundtrack (Bian Adams) is simply beautiful and inspiring. Even more interesting is that Brian Adams does all the songs in French. Score is also uplifting and dramatic. The film is made from a mixture of traditional animation combined with computer-generated images. The result is truly stunning. I look at this film at least once a week with my children and we never talk about it. The story is convincing and well illustrated. I do not understand anyone who would drop this film to less than 7. Definitely a goalkeeper in my home.
