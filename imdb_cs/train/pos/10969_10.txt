I knew about it, but I never saw Gray Gardens before I saw a musician of the same name on Broadway. My friends warned me that if I did not see the movie, the musical would not make sense. It did, but it also encouraged me to borrow the film. At first I thought it was a wreck of a train, full of strange, gruesome characters, and it was extremely difficult to watch. But the ability to stop it, spend it and come back to him, I realized why Gray Gardens is considered a memorable document. <br /> <br /> Both Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable and their total lack of self-confidence is worth seeing. Both remain beautiful despite the fact that they are overweight. They have a relationship that will cool any woman (and undoubtedly some men) and make you reconsider your own relationship with your mother. At a time when television and cinematographic reality is common, it is fascinating to see the work of the Mayleses three decades ago and to realize the influence of the film. <br /> <br /> I repeat what other posters said: how were they allowed to get into such a misfortune by their family? But how could two people living in the 1970s escape reality in such a way? Or were they simply considered too foolish to help them? I highly recommend watching it with commentary, which gave me another preview of the movie.
