The woman in black is fantastic in all respects. It's awesome, exciting and so realistic that you can really see how it's going on in real life. I first saw it on TV in 1989, and with all the lights turned off, it was probably the most scary experience of my whole life. I managed to get a copy and now I'm sure I'll take it out of every Halloween and show that they are unsuspecting family members who have no idea what they are, and all I can do is laugh with joy. As for the movie: It starts with a young lawyer appointed by Arthur Kipps, who is assigned to go to the market town of Crythin Gifford to satisfy the recent deceased client, Mrs. Alice Drablow. <br /> <br /> This film begins as a fairly solid and interesting story of spirits. But then Arthur takes part in the funeral and we do not feel safe from the scene. We are constantly on the edge and biting nails, and it goes on for another hour or so until the final, exciting final. Warning to all new viewers, however: Do not look at it yourself. ..
