As much as they know, Mexican cinema was very poor after the so-called Golden Age of Mexican cinema, fortunately in the late 1990s and early 21st century there were great films like La Ley de Herodes, Bajo California, Amores Perros, Y Tu Mamá También and of course El Coronel No Tiene Quien le Escriba appeared. El Coronel ... is a wonderful film that tells the classic story of Gabriel García Márquez by eliminating the elements of magical realism and replacing them with a brutal reality living in Mexico, not just by people like a colonel waiting for their pensions, but more than half the population Mexico, who live in total poverty. The characters of the film are a satirical representation of classical characters in a Mexican society, such as the Nationalist Colonel, a cool and even ambitious priest, a hypocrite, but at the same time a loyal coma, a tolerant and patient wife, a hidden homosexual, etc. The film must be seen if you want to know more about Mexican society, and especially if you want to watch a wonderful film, one of the best Mexican directors
