If I know the real guy who plays the main actor saw his performance and said it was a great portrait, I agree with him. It is a fantastic film about relatively gifted boys / men with a special body that helps him. Oscar and BAFTA, and Daniel Day-Lewis, Golden Globe nominee, plays Christy Brown, a crippled, polio-engraved man who spends most of his life on the floor, on a wheelchair and carried by his family. He has a special left leg, can write with it, paint with him and keep things with him. They learn to talk later in the movie, it's very good for a man like him. Also, the Oscars Home Alone 2 victory and the Golden Globe nominated Brent Fricker as Mrs. Brown and BAFTA, who won Ray McAnally as Mr. Brown. He was nominated Oscars for Best Director for Jim Sheridan, Best Song, Material Based Blueprints, Best Picture, BAFTA for Best Film, Best Make-Up Artist, and Best Adapted Screenplay. Daniel Day-Lewis was number 85 on 100 of the biggest movie stars, was the number 20 on the 50 greatest British actors, was number nine on the UK's top actors and was number 15 on the world's biggest actor and the film was number 28 on the 50 largest British films. Excellent!
