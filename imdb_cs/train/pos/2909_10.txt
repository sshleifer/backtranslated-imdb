I love Paul McCartney. He is, in my opinion, the greatest of all times. However, I could not afford a ticket to his concert at Tacoma Dome during the Back in the USA tour. I was angry to say the smallest. Then I found this DVD. It was almost as good as it was there. Paul is still a man, and I'll enjoy it for many years. <br /> <br /> I have one complaint. I'd like to hear all Hey Jude. <br /> <br /> Also, Paul is not dead. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest DVD concerts ever. <br /> <br /> ** Except *****.
