It's a movie that I can watch over and over again and never bother with it, has a lot of laughter, weapons, action, crime, good deposits and a decent conspiracy with Donald Sutherland's top, rather a comedy role like Assassin. Tia Carerra looks as hot as she has ever done and can act, Thomas Ian Griffin is great in this position as the main character "Max" agent DEA Diane is the agent of the FBI played by Carerra and John Lithgow of Frazier on TV, bad man, "Livingston". The plot is focused on the fact that Max and Diane are trying to capture Livingston as they fight and quarrel about who gets the money for their respective agencies, throws them into the Assassin Sutherland mix, which has almost all the good linery, that's the perfect criminal the usual love story, but it played very differently than you would think of Carer and Griffith. You also have a Russian mafia, an Italian mafia and the Chinese Mafia, mixed here, the film is shot in Boston, where you have great shots and local, great photography and music in this movie, this film is just the embodiment of a crime comedy, what one might ever want. Look at the Sutherland toilet in a particular scene, very unusual. this movie is a rebellion and will laugh at you with a really hard 10 plus for me.
