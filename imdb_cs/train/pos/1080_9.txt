Film "comedies" are usually 100 minutes of toilet humor, dirty tongue and muscle kicking. Modern comedy appeals to the lowest common denominator, an undemanding and slow brain. Certainly, occasional good comedies come but they are becoming increasingly rare. "Mr. Blandings Buildings of his Dream House" shows how Hollywood was able in 1940 and is just a funny cry. Jim and Muriel Blandings (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) decide to build a house on the outskirts of Connecticut. The film follows their story, ranging from house hunting expeditions, stormy construction of the house to a complete household - with a "zuzz-zuzz softener". Grant and Loy are their ideal role, of course (Grant is especially fun when he sees house costs out of control). But the film was stolen by the wise lawyer of Blandings, who played Melvyn Douglas excellence. Trying to steal every scene he's in, Douglas is horrified when he looks at how Blandings gets out of the crisis into the crisis. Reginald Denny as Blandings' crazy architect and Harry Shannon as a crunchy old drill well of water wells are also amazing. I watch this movie many times and it always laughs at me. I think it's a good movie that can be watched when you need a lift, whether you're building a house or not.
