I have to admit I did not read the original story of M R James, even though I read many of his other supernatural stories. I also saw most of the previous BBC Christmas stories and in my opinion surpasses most of them, just equal to The Signalman. I can not really break the view from the hill - direction and "mood" are perfect, as well as acting, lighting and, of course, story and writing. I was confident that I liked it and I just hope it will have more of that quality than the same director and production team. I understand that the BBC is planning to do something more (not necessarily based on the stories of M R James), so it promises to do so. <br /> <br />
