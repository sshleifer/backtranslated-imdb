This whole movie is worth watching just for a great ending moment - it's the best end of any movie I've ever seen. Perfect, beautiful, funny, just amazing. I found this movie wonderful, even with the fact that the French itself behaves very seriously. I loved it - it's a great love story. And I loved the way the Algerians wore - and by the way, the music during the final credits is great. I want a CD!
