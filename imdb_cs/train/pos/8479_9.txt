I looked at it several times as a child, that was quite an experience 15 years ago, and now that I found it again, it still has a movie experience like a few others. If it is risky, it is a great example of morality and life lessons recommended for family watching with young children. While still staying as an adult, I was lucky to have learned many times from her years ago. I'm trying to find it today is pretty tough. . . but believe me it's worth it regardless of age. Anime fans especially find this great entry to Masami Hata's filmography. With impressive artwork and unique designs, Chirin No Suzu is a great experience. While some lyrics are not so hot when they are recorded in English, the music score is nevertheless charming. But voice acting is much better than today. Unfortunately, in the mid-1980s I got RCA Columbia Home Video last week, and in my opinion there was not a new version of the format in the US. Look hard and you will be happy! It is an artistic, intense, fun and important landmark of Japanese animation.
