I love horses and I admire hand-animated animation, so I did not expect anything surprising from Dreamworks of the new animated film Spirit: Stallion Cimarron. I think you could say I'm a little disappointed. You have a wonderful animation and first what looks like a perfect story. A story about absolutely nothing but horses in the wild. Animals sing cute songs or even speak - a significant plus. Sadly, the film has an unwanted story to tell Matt Damon; Bryan Adams' sparkling soundtrack; and enough action scenes to compare with Jerry Bruckheimer's production. If the filmmakers simply stayed with simplicity, we should have a masterpiece here. It's not a great movie, but it's good fun for little kids. I would recommend this movie to families because it has its heart in the right place and its only thing that right now is that it is not offensive for young children. It's not bad, but it could have been much better. Very nice visuals.
