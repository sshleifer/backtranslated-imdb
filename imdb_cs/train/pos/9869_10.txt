I have to say that this is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. I liked it for the first time, but I really realized it at the second watch just weeks ago. I see why this great work in the box office continues. It seems like many people like this movie. <br /> <br /> A beautiful color palette (man, it looks good) and a lot of good adult (but pure) humor makes it a great winner. Opening a 3-4 minute Scat scenario is great as well as other interludes with it. "Sid" Lenoch (expressed by John Leguizano), however, provides the main humor in the film. He's usually got a laugh in the movie. Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the great figure of the movie, literally, while Denis Leary is a furious bad guy - the reverse good sabertooth tiger <br /> <br /> It's not just about humor and nice colors but a nice, sentimental story about how a small baby softens a couple of hardcore characters. This is not interrupted with lots of songs, and only one short and nothing dirty, linguistically wise. If animated movies were so good, I would have owned more.
