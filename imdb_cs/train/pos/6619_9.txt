Blade Runner (Deckard's Replicant!) <br /> <br /> The city of lost children (enlarged senses or whatever is used and abused and mostly, well, gives us much less than we can dream of) and <br> <br /> <br /> Dark City: <br /> <br /> You really should be added. <br /> <br /> After a while, I'm waiting for an animated movie that could influence just like Miyazaki's stuff. This is the first. <br /> <br /> Hmm, scratch the "animated" part of it. <br /> <br /> I have an intense relationship of love and hate with the movie noir and hey, if you do not leave, it must be love, is not it? But there are so many sci-fi and noir themes completely immersed in this film that it's just a miracle to watch. <br /> <br /> These people did an incredible job!
