In this truly fascinating dark movie, a young poor student sells his soul to the devil for a lot of money, in return the devil has his mirror image (this is done great in the movie and a great foreboding when Balduin, the student is an older fencing practice in front of a mirror), a visual metaphor for a "man in war with himself", which testifies to his immediate future. The student enjoys his money, but the woman he loves is unreachable (he has entered into a covenant with the devil, is forever cut off from the love and other wealth of the soul), you can have love or exchange your soul for money, you can not have both. Balduin is persecuted by a pair (they are surpassing it well). Some scenes are unbelievable, the sense of destruction when the devil disappears with Balduin's mirror image is amazing, as well as the sense that his covenant forever cuts it (a scene where he escapes from the double and ends in a "wasteland" on the outskirts of the city, no longer human (lost soul) is like a hunted animal outside of human society There are many other things that can be said about this incredible movie: Paul Wegener was an amazing actor and director, my cultural hero Helps when you know a little about German history at the time this movie is shot and about German doppelganger tradition (do not change google, get the right book) Do not forget it's a very early film, it's a bit clumsy at times, but given what it's supposed to say and it's a tragic finale it's one of the best in the past (Yes it is!)
