The quote that I used for my summary appears in the middle of Good Earth as the captain of the Chinese Revolutionary Army (played by Philip Ahn) apologizes to the crowd for not having the time to shoot MORE from the looters among them because his unit has just been called back to the front lines. Of course, the other story to be found and filmed is the main character of the film, the former O-Lan slave kitchen (whose portrait Luise Rainer, now 99, has won her second consecutive best Oscar). Another scene finds that O-Lan obediently delivers his bag of devastated gems to an undervalued husband, farmer Wang Lung (Paul Muni), triggering a classic dichotomy of man upward mobility is a direct inverse of his moral decay. For a movie that deals with the topic, including slavery, false accusations, misogyny, starvation, domestic invasions, family feeding, mental retardation, child murder, riots, civil war, mass massacres on the streets, bigamas, child beatings, adultery, insect wounds of biblical proportions, GOOD AREA is a surprisingly heart-warming film. in the form of another classical quote, from O-Lan itself (her precious soup was admitted, her son had just admitted to returning to the kitchen utensil after her husband Wang Lung angrily threw her on the floor of the dirt on the other side of her cottage): "Meat is meat".
