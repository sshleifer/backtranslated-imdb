That's what I expected when the premiere star DS9 appeared. Not for the mild DS9. It was a great show, in itself, but it never gave fans more of what they wanted. Enterprise is the show. While the similarity with the original trek differs so much that it is original in its own way. This, in turn, attracts our exploration ideas. And that was one of the main ingredients that made the original so loved. Another add-on to success was the relationship that developed among crew members. The audience really cared for the crew. The company also has a great promise in this area. The chemistry between Bakula and Blalock seems very promising. While sexual tensions in the show can often become crunchy, I feel that business tensions can lead to much greater and say more than typical. I think that when we deal with such generous characters of different races or species, we get some very interesting ideas and television. We should also notice the performance, Blalock is very convincing, because Vulcan T'pol and Bacula have a truly amazing and powerful character that brings great performance. The rest of the cast also brought good performances. My only boys are the following. Topic. It's good that it's different, but a little bit to bow down. We need something a little bigger. It does not have to be orchestral. Perhaps something with a little more electronic sound was enough. And my other complaint. They sell too many additions. They could solve this by selling fewer ads or making all exhibitions two parters. Otherwise, we will finish the last concerts too fast, just like one of my Voyager complaints.
