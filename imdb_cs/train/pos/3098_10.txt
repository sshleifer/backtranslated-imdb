I loved this show so much, and I am so incredibly sad that I canceled it. I thought it would come back, but only two silly weeks. That's terrible. I hate how we never know how everyone ends up. it's upsetting. Return it back! ABC has stupid shows like Supernanny and what not, but it does not give good time like Six Degrees. If they complain about ratings, it was probably because they had a bad slot because it was a really good show, something I could relate to and expect. JJ Abrams has released, it's amazing, I wish ABC could only trust him enough to finish the story. I loved the whole cast. I could not wait to see someone suddenly meet one day. The story of everyone is now incomplete, now I will not know if Steven and Whitney get together or Carlos and Mae. I wanted to see what happened to Laura or Damien and all the others. That's really such a downer.
