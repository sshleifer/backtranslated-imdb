What happens to the emptied rock-n-roll stars in the late 1990s? They start a return / reunion tour. At least that's what Strange Fruit members are doing, stadium (fictitious) 70. <br /> <br /> Tony (Stephen Rea) has concessions on condom machines when he encounters his son's promoter of the famous music festival. It was at this festival in the 1970s that Strange Fruit broke down. The 1970s are "retro" and the time is right for the wave to be wide. She starts looking for other band members. Part of what was splitting the band was death and the replacement of Keith, lead singer and brilliant singer. The group was known for its excessive lifestyle, and now they are all back among the working class they came from. Beano, a drummer who played Timothy Spall (who was great in secrets and lies), is a bass player, a bass guy is a roofer and their singer is still rocker. While possessing a magnificent mansion, he was forced to sell it because his fortune had lasted. Brian, the main guitarist, is dead, so the young guitarist is hired to replace him. <br /> <br /> Relatively reluctantly, the group agrees to try to meet. They leave their daytime work, begin to rehearse, and their manager approaches their label for the re-release of their albums. But they want to start the tour again. And so they got into the club circle in Europe. The club scene is not kind with these overweight, dated, old rockers. <br /> <br /> On the tour, the film actually begins to evolve. All the old conflicts appear, with the characters of Keith and Brian floating. Everybody hangs in because everyone is looking for a second chance for the size that had escaped them before. And again they discover part of the interpersonal chemistry that made it difficult to play together. <br /> <br /> Still Crazy begins as Spinal Tap II, but it gradually becomes a film dramatically focused on band members' relationships. While it's still a very entertaining movie, characters are developing to try to deal with the deaths of Brian and Keith and their own demons that make the film.
