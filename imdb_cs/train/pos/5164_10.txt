I went to Chesapeake camp. It was located at the head of the Chesapeake Bay in the northeast of the river in MD. It was like a summer camp with cabins. It was founded by Coatesville, PA YMCA. I started out as a young camper, and later I became director of Junior, an older adviser and later director of Waterfront. If the camp were to continue, I would do everything in my power to become the director of the camp. Unfortunately, the powers of the YMCA decided to close the camp and sell it to the state of MD. I visited the former camp a few years later with a boat and was horrified by the neglect of MD and natural destruction by my mother. The land of 350 acres has served so many people with all the benefits of contact with natural offerings. A black man named Curtis Ford and his family were residents and custodians of property. Mr. Curtis was my friend and mentor. I admired his every creature. Although he could not swim, he was a waterman. When I asked him where the fish bite, he marked the place and I would have the ball. It was also a family camp at the end of the summer. These memories will be with me forever.
