*** I could not think of it as a spoiler, but I'd rather be careful than careless *** I never saw this movie when I was little. I fell in love with him when I first saw her with my three-year-old daughter. I can watch it over and over again. For the little acting that Ilene Woods did during her life, she was a great voice for Cinderella; very attractive; very believable. Music really fits the movie great. The game was great; loved the mouse! You really "hated" Lady Tremain and the sisters; they were terrible. Cartoonists have very well described chaotic behavior. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie, especially if you are in love stories. My daughter saw the movie about 25 times and is still excited at the end.
