What can be said, really ... "The tenant" is a first class thriller with the same amount of tension and full paranoia. It's a complex rendered movie - every detail seems to be included for some reason - though conspiracy seldom makes sense, and much of it is neither objectively solved. That's why the still unstable Trebkovsky (Polanski) - a humble Polish man who got the apartment because of the suicide of a former tenant - to lead us through the world of rising fear and uncertainty. After a group of harassing cohorts warmed, Trelkovskij gets under the elevated, seemingly inexplicable oversight of the other residents in his building; the rest of the film chronicles his mental deterioration and gives us a thorough mentality * to the same level as David Lynch's later efforts. "The tenant" is, however, much more stupid and most terrible, coupled with unexpected comic relief, subtle performances, and a terrible result. It's a movie that's better than the one that's been described.
