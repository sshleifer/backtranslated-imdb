Passionate, dramatic, riveting like Flamenco itself, the movie is just amazing. It is located on an immortal bizette of music. Original music was written and performed by one of the greatest classical guitarists, the leading flamenco-style proponent, Paco de Lucia, who plays a musician of the same name. Legendary flamenco dancer and choreographer Antonio Gades who wrote the script and choreographed this wonderful version of the famous Georges Bizet / Prosper Mérimée novella / opera. He plays the lead character Antonio, a famous dancer / choreographer, who is working on telling the Flamenco-style Carmen story that combines dance with singing and rhythmical clapping of the hand, and has a highly charged level of dynamics that really likes viewers. /> <br /> Brilliant and graceful Cristina Hoyos, whose technical perfection corresponds to the elegant art of dancing gloss in a supporting role. Hoyos became the first dancer at Gades and a protagonist of three films by Carlos Saura of Gades' thirteen great performances: "Bodas de Sangre" (1978), "Carmen" (1983) and "El Amor Brujo "(1985). Beautiful Laura del Sol is a young dancer named Carmen in which Antony sees from the first view another Carmen, who was immortalized by two Frenchmen, the writer of Prosper Mérimée in his most famous novel written in 1846 that inspired the world-famous Opéra Comique version of 1875. as in opera and novella, Carmen in Saura's film is a desirable and deadly, ultimate femme fatale that must be free over anything else. She could not tolerate the sacred love of every man and preferred death before serving. There are about 50 movie adaptations of the story and the opera on the screen, and however different, they all share the only possible tragic end. The film Saura / Gades is unique as the most sensible of all and really Spanish. I fell in love with her since I first saw it more than twenty years ago, and today it's as strange and beautiful as it used to be. Highly recommended.
