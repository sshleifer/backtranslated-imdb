This anime seriously shook the socks. When the anime first opened, I felt it was too slow; the story was not going well, and Shiro was a totally insignificant male leader. Once you learn more about watching and learn more about Saber and the Holy Grail itself, tell a story and you can see more aspects of moving together. It was fantastic. I also thought that the way the characters evolved were very true to create the way real people evolve in the real world. It was not a stupid, obvious thing; the development of Ilya and Rina was interesting to watch, but I think the way Shiro and Saber grew in their own personalities was just interesting to watch everything on it. Some of the "surprising" people who appeared (Gilgamesh?) Also seemed unique from the rest of the cast, which means we did not replace "Generic Bad-Ass A" with "Generic Bad-Ass B" he died. <br /> <br /> Anddd, I loved music. The opening music rocked and the finishing theme from the last episode only ... She really moved the theme of the last episode even more. Good work, Type-MOON!
