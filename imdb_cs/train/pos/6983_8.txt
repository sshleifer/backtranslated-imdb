I loved it because I was a fan of the original series, I was always interested in what the story would be back - I was not happy. I also love the fact that I did not recognize one person besides Eric Stoltz - it is refreshing, like BSG. She introduced me to the whole wealth of new talent - I can not wait for the series to start broadcasting. Good work for Ronald D. Moore and the team - great work. Special effects, dialogue and negotiations were all in place, and I felt emotionally in the process. I know there are purists who probably disagree with my assessment, but I felt Caprica was far superior to most Sci-Fi things made over the last decade.
