Absolutely cheerful. John Waters honoring the people who loves the most (Baltimoreans) is a twisted little ditty with a lot of look and laugh. It's as if you are relaxing in the kitsch museum! In the theater, I have not felt much of a mum since the series. I loved seeing old friends from Dreamland, Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe, back in front of the Waters camera. Cast is just great (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton). It utilizes the best elements of past water atrocities (especially underestimated Polyester) and lots of new surprises. I was sick, wonderful. Thanks, John!
