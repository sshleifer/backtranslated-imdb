Was the script more suitable for a 30 minute sitcom? Yes, but it still works! I thought the actors did a fantastic job with an otherwise insignificant script, especially Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Most people on the album really hate this movie. I personally do not see how it can be, but Envy is just one of those movies you either love or hate. Just like Napoleon Dynamite and every Leslie Neilsen movie ever made. Do you think it's one of the worst movies ever shot or one of the funniest. Do not bend this movie for reviews. Look at it and find out if you are one of those who really like it! If you do, I guarantee that it is worth your money. If you do not like ... well, you know.
