Hell, it was a lot I got. It was quite perfect, though I would say that the adjustments had much to do with it. I can not believe that the guy remained in good shape with a lot of people (especially Anton) to get all these shots without any serious ... beef. The Dandy had a good deal, the middle class kids who took advantage of their situation (and right!). I felt bad about Jonestown and especially for Anton, which may not have been what many other people felt. Big piece of film and great choice of subject (s). I recommend it to every fan of music / film. You'll probably learn something about making movies.
