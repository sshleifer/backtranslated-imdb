It has occurred to me that I have captured this film at a screening in Brooklyn - it's hard to describe a plot; he has a lot of annoying characters, but let's just say that I could hardly pick the one who made me laugh the hardest, I would not know where to start. Even peripheral roles are well written and well acting. There are many small touches that make it unique and very enjoyable, it has several "devices" that pop up and add another funny layer. It is refreshing to watch; not some recycled stuff I've seen long ago. If this film could reach a wider audience, I'm sure it will be a real crowd, a nice story, misfortune and misunderstanding that created the ultimate act and dramatic conclusions. Cross Eyed is a very funny movie with a heart tone; it's a touching story with a fast-paced comedy all over the world. It is definitely worth seeing!
