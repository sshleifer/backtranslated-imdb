This movie is funny, charming and easy to become popular for those who enjoy light entertainment. Hollywood is barely a place for serious history lessons, so I simply accept it anyway. Bing, in his usual inimitable style, works pretty well as a blacksmith, Hank Martin, who accidentally transfers back to the next age, King Arthur's time. Beautiful Rhonda Fleming is breathtaking as Alisande, or Sandy, the subject of Hank's affections, though she is engaged to the bold and impressive Sir Lancelot played by Henry Wilcoxon. I love that episode when King Arthur (Cedric Hardwicke), Sir Sagramore (Wm. Bendix) and Hank (Bing Crosby) dress up in torn clothes and take a high trip with their backpacks to experience the kingdom firsthand. King Arthur's commentary: "I say we're not alone," and despite giving his dirty clothes a good scratch, it's one of those funny moments in the movie. The portrayal of William Bendix is ​​ridiculously ridiculous, not to mention his attempts at the quaint "you Olde English". <br /> <br /> The story is not deep, but in my opinion it's done well and I like it more, every time I see it. It's also great family fun. <br /> <br />
