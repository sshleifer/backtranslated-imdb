I do not think this movie is for everyone. But I saw it this week in Seattle and I thought it was so funny. During the long film, I did not smile in the movie. I thought the whole cast was doing a great job. From the first moment you will laugh at the last scene. I suspect that some visitors to the audience (especially those who are too busy) will be turned off by this brand of humor. I do not. The film was a real surprise. The entire theater showed up during the show that I thought a lot of people liked it and was happy that they were happy in the movies to change. I can not wait to see it again! If you're in LOL, then it's for you. Funny funny funny funny!
