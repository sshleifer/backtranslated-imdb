I watched the first series naughty but I wondered if I would be back after a long break. However, I've tuned into the episode one of series 2 and was addicted everywhere again. This is really great telly; top things like Mission: Impossible in the 1960s. The figures are well rounded and expanded as the series progresses, changing as they adapt - more recently than others - to the new environment, but cleverly remain strictly characterful and yet it is more than possible to have the sympathy of someone you would never dream of I'm sorry if something happens to them really crushed. I hope he will be "lost" for many years to enjoy - and I really do not mind if I never know the answer to all the mysteries!
