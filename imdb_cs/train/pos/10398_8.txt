Though time has shown how some effects have been made, this story of love and adventure is still strange. If you've never seen this movie before you're shocked, how many later the filmmakers were stolen. I looked at it with a friend who was amazed at how much Disney's adorable Aladin had been out of the movie. They loved the film and looked forward to being such a touchstone for so many other films and filmmakers. The film I gave 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of ten, which is where most of the movie dominates, because in the last 15 minutes the movie breaks in stages. Everything is submerged as if they suddenly came to an end. From the point of departure to the end, it seems more sketchy and the painting completed. The film will not kill, but will weaken it. <br /> <br /> It's still a required tracking for anyone who loves a good fairy tale or even a great movie.
