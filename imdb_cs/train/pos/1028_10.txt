I have to say that from the beginning when I was watching Stargate, I was not blown away, or something like an average science fiction movie, with a lot of POTENTIAL, although the film was not such a thing as amazing as other science fiction films like the Stars of War or aliens who if u are scifi fanatics and admit that one of these two titles is amazing, even though I'm not such a hard scientist as some people, I do not remember one line of one of these films, I'm not a big fan who wears the Star Wars Shirts , in fact, if you saw me, I would look like the average person on you ah, it is that you do not have to be a sci-fi fan who would enjoy this great series that unfortunately ended in 10 amazing seasons without falling quality as she approached at the end of 2006. <br /> <br /> Although I did not like the fact that I was looking forward to the first season in 1997 and let me tell you that the special effects were just one of the best-tested stuff about the series, the chemistry between the characters just blew me off special influences, they were as good, if not better than most scifi shows that are running today. I have to admit that I never went to Scifi if it was not for the star and my dad, who actually got me into science when I was like 6, and I'm glad it did, the other wise I did not see brilliant shows like SG1 that in my opinion, set a benchmark for almost all science fiction and film series, basically if the new science fiction series is not better or as good as SG1, it is not worth watching. basically this is the best scientific exhibition to date, and if you do not follow, you have no idea what you are missing!
