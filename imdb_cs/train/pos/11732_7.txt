OK, I saw it in cinemas when it came out, and I do not know why. I have not seen it since then, but I ended up on this page because I realized I was interested in this movie - I do not know why again. But the fact that I remember it speaks of volumes. Comedy is heavy - much harder than a drama. Doing it right makes it look easy but it does wrong ... is something worse than bad comedy? Steve Martin, be careful, you fall into this category for some reason. <br /> <br /> Elvira Mistress Of The Dark has to do the right thing to remember this movie kindly. She did it quickly, tongue-to-face, and knew it was not the story of Philedelphia, having fun from start to finish. Brain Donors is another that fits right into this category (most often it is unreasonable jokes). <br /> <br /> One point of dispute - the end. It seems that the writers / directors had no idea how to finish a comedy. The end is trying to be a love story, which somewhat undermines a wonderful quick dialogue up to this point. Then the scene "tassle" appears. While it has to be seen (male opinion), it's so over the top and out of place it's like a shock. One more transcript for the end was needed. <br /> <br /> It's not a brilliant comedy like Spinal Tap or Producers or Holy Grail. But if you do not try to dissect it and just let the hams and sappy fun come to you, you laugh, I guarantee it.
