I loved this show. I've been watching it since it was first broadcast in the late 90's until the last episode. In my honest opinion, it was such a wonderful family drama today. Surely a performance that you can watch with a friend or your kids. Yes, things have changed with Jomi since the last time we saw her in books, but it's still compelling stories and good lessons. The actress, who portrays Jo Bhaera (Michelle Burke), does a great job as well as an actor starring Nick Riley (Spencer Rochfort). Throughout the series, we look at the growing romance between Joe and Nick as well as everyday stories and lessons for kids and students are learning. I recommend this show to someone.
