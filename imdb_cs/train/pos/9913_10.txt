Apart from being a very entertaining film, I can add that the costumes and scenery were wonderful. This kind, fun loving woman had a lot of money. Unfortunately, she had two greedy daughters trying to get their money to their money. This woman has been lonely since the death of her husband. He designed it in a theater that would be destroyed. To prevent it, she bought it. Her daughters were afraid they defended "their" money and decided to take action. The character actors in this movie were a great addition. I would like to give almost everything to get a copy of this movie in my videotape, but it has never been released. Sad.
