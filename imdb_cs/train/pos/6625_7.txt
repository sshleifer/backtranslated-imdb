If you've ever seen a trailer for "The Recruit" with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you'll never have to see the movie. Obviously, Renaissance has similarly a revelatory creator of trailers. The story of Renaissance is about a detective investigating kidnapping a young woman and a doctor. This setting is futuristic by Pariz, and features of science fiction are all over the world. The special thing about the Renaissance is its visual style, not its story. Renaissance is a 3D computer animation, like Final Fantasy, but highly stylish black and white with ultra-sharp contrasts. The result looks stunning (though the problems with human 3D animation are still noticeable from time to time: slightly robotic movements, lightly facial expression, etc.) As a highly stylized, beautiful film noir, Renaissance succeeds in a stunning audience, especially visually. However, the story and the writing are not on the same level as the visual. It's not a bad story (and probably, if you did not see a trailer, it's a lot more exciting than it was for me). But it's a story that's not very original, and it's going to be crazy. Several orders of dialogue were painfully corrupted, so writing is the first beginner. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend Renaissance to my friends. It's something I've seen before, and I think its originality itself is a useful experience. It's also an observable story, though not perfect.
