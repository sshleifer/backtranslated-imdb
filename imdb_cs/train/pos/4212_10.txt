Director Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the script, is Pickup on South Street, a hard, brutal, well-paced film about his pocket (Richard Widmark), who inadvertently receives top-quality microfilms and becomes the target of spy agents. Jean Peters was also a harsh broad man, used as a courier by his evil old lover, Richard Kiley. It's a film noir in his best and though performances are very good his actor Grand Thelma Ritter, who steals the film. Because Moe is a tired street that sells neck neckties (and who also sells information), she is awesome in the role she has earned her next Oscar nomination. It's amazing that Miss Ritter has been nominated six times for an Oscar and never played. This is the role she has done for her!
