Extremely interesting and interesting film. Similarities with David Lynch (which is even quoted by the presence of red curtains in the film) and the novels by Franz Kafka (the house owner in this film is called Mrs. Grubach, as in Der Prozess ...) are obviously present, but in this case they are accompanied clear references to the colonial past of Belgium in Africa. The exact content of the film, which I can not clearly describe: this colonialism is an important part, as well as the inability to cope with such a past, but also personal recollections of the main character are the central theme and its pursuit of social contact and love. These are the symbolic themes I have drawn from the film, but in fact they are just prints. But even if you were trying to follow a linear story without these symbolic environments, you are still discovering an extremely fascinating film full of beautiful pictures (beautiful beats, larvae and other ugly insects alternate with great dream show and dark atmosphere adds a special style to the film). You might say I did not get the movie, but I watched as hypnotized for 1.5 hours, deeply impressed by the visual quality and fascinating mystery.
