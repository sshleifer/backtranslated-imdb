I've loved this movie since I first came out. I was about nine years old and now I'm 27. I remember playing a video game on Sega Genisis. I had so much fun, I would like to show this son to my son. He likes Michael Jackson too and I know he will love this movie just like me when I was a kid. Although he is much younger than me when I first saw it. I can not wait to see it on DVD! Hope it comes out on DVD! Please let it ride on DVD! I'm dying to see it again! Well, that's my note. I hope that one day I will come across this film. I love all the videos in this movie. My favorite mini-video is Badder!
