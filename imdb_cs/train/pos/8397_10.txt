This movie won every one of the ten votes I gave him! Thank you for filming a movie that's worth watching. You have shown the world, you can still write, direct, produce and play in a black film without negative stereotypes. The poetry was also amazing, hats were played by poets and musicians. Last night I watched because I loved my darling again. I add it today to my film collection and I recommend it to my friends and family. <br /> <br /> Continue producing quality, do not worry about the amount .... <br /> Thank you again and wish you the best wishes and blessings!
