I swear when I first saw this movie, I cried out my eyes! The star is unborn is a movie that lets you know what love is really like over obstacles John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) face. You also experience how it is to lose such love to the end of the movie. Streisand and Kristofferson have great chemistry and the music is fantastic! When Streisand sings with the fact that I'm still looking at you. Watch this now, it's pure spells! This movie made the song Evergreen one of my favorites and Queen Bee is such a fun song. I also like seventy-year-old fashion (except Streisand's Afro, plus beauty). The Star Born is my favorite movie number one. This movie is a joy to watch and the end is a heart breaker.
