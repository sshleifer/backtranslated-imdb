The most important element of "Dan in Real Life" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) is meaningful and realistic. Setting Oscar winner Juliette Binoche as Dana's love interest was an excellent decision; she is extremely talented, intelligent, naturally attractive, and, thank God, has been adequately aged for this part! If this film was shot together with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would be a disaster. Another amazing aspect of "Dan in Real Life" is that it is a perfect adult film that is interested in a mature comedy that omit the three pillars of the frat pack: naked youngsters, chauvinist boys, and restless jokes. "Dan in real life" is funny and fun, intelligent laughs. While other comedies include or are almost exclusively based on jokes that shock the audience with laughter, jokes from "Dan in Real Life" are more natural and smarter and involve some thinking by the audience. <br /> <br /> My only problem with Dan in real life is that Brittany Robertson, the rebellious, middle-aged daughter, plays too proudly. It's hard to say if it was a personal choice from her side or a director's choice. In any case, her character is unrealistic and annoying. But this is just a minor flaw in the movie and it does not remove it from the whole story. Overall, "Dan in Real Life" is a great movie, fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and unbalanced comedies. The quality of writing, directing, acting and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It's just a beautiful, cheerful comedy.
