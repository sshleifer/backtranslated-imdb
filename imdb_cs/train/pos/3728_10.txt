He never heard of this movie, he saw it on DVD.Great Movie, a perfect example of a movie that took every member cast to make it work.Not bend a typical Hollywood movie with the same old overhyped actors.Not the current Quote "A" list actor could have pulled all performances in this film.Brought back memories of my own Vietnamese military military experience.It concentrated on the people who were sent to fight.As been portrayed characters who had fears and emotions, though some voluntarily on duty. They were ordinary people, some were simply not excluded from military life, I remember some of my experience - they could not adapt to military life - but I would never forget them - should stay in touch. I highly recommend this and then think about those who serving in Afghanistan at present. Basic training is a trip, note the sergeants who are not morning people and may need a "sensitivity exercise" HA! HA! HA!
