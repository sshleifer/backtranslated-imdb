New York never looked so good! And none of them have this movie. While the script is a bit light, you can not help him, but this movie or one of the characters in it. You almost want people to really exist. Recalling actors is what it really did (John Ritter, Colleen Camp and late Dorothy Stratten are especially good.) Go and borrow or buy this movie, you will be glad you did.
