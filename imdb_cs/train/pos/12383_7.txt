Christina Raines plays a beautiful model in New York who is looking for a new apartment and begins to meet strange neighbors and unveils the secrets of the building and slowly sets herself up to the end of the film. This film has all kinds of pure conspirators from the Roman Catholic Church and the devil to the gate to hell, bizarre rituals, growing conspiracy, and ultimately a host of talented famous actors and actresses who flood the film. Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Orbach, Deborah Raffin, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Slyvia Miles, Beverly DeAngelo, Eli Wallach, Martin Balsam, Christopher Walkin, William Hickey, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum. forget about John Carradine as an old priest. Many of these actors can do it - especially Burgess Meredith, who gives excellent comic / dementia performance as one of the neighbors with a small bird and a cat. Meredith is unforgettable, just like Balsam and Chris Sarandon. Some artists practically have nothing to do, such as Jose Ferrer in an ungrateful role, although it is nothing but casual. Sentinel is a gentle horror movie with plenty of psychological elements and some really scary scenes. The final scene is repulsive and yet cold. I found a mistake with some of the gratuitous sex and violence in the movie, especially the entire scene with DeAngel and Miles. Was it really necessary? I think not. Also the father / daughter was a bit too good, but overall the film works and has a winning pace. Director Michael Winner works as a worker and effectively creates the tension and frightening moments of the film. Scenarios with Carradine are particularly effective.
