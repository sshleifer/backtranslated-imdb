I really enjoyed it - I'm a big fan of movies that spoil you and leave you with the many questions and ideas to be discussed, and that was a stellar example. But then Terry Gilliam is always good (well, almost always, we just forget Jabberwocky and Brother Grimma, right?). I enjoyed how it dealt with travel time and avoidance of paradoxes - the way in which events in the past and in the future intersect and transfer each other. It was also really well done aesthetically - the artistic direction was really great and I wish I saw it on the big screen. Future scenes had a similar feel to Brazil in many ways, and even the current scenes were often really visually convincing. But maybe the most remarkable thing about it was that it represented two actors, which I'm not normally like Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and both played a wonderful performance. Pitt in particular - I saw one or two movies before I realized that he really could actually act (unlike what I originally thought), but that really overcame it. In fact, I found out that one day I would ask my friends. "Are you sure this is Brad Pitt?" This is probably the most memorable performance of his career (though it certainly does not say much).
