This film is one of many "Kung Fu" action films made in Asia in the late 1970s and early 1980s, full of low-cost sound effects, dubbed dialogue and lightning martial arts. But unlike most of the films in this genre, he also has a decent plot and a lot of great comedy. When the workers of the Manchu Dyeing Factory are expelled from their jobs, they hire the creations (Gordon Liu) and try to scare them. When his attempt unfortunately worsens, he comes to the Shaolin Temple to learn to really fight. But instead of becoming a Kung-Fu student, the master instructed him instead to build a scaffold that would cover the roofs of all 36 chambers. Well, it turns out that when doing these tasks (stacking and binding bamboo sticks), they learn the skills of being a Kung Fu expert! It's like Karate Kid when Mr. Miagi teaches Daniel about the basics of karate by doing his routine homework - "Wax, wax" and so on. It's a lot of great comedy from start to finish and a lot of action at the end when Gordon Liu again faces his martyrs of Manchu. "This is not just a trick - this is a real thing!" Liu said, and his throat collapsed proudly. If you like classic Kung Fu movies, you do not want to miss this one!
