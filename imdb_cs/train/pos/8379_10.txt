I remember the movie when I was 12 years old, it was amazing ... I remember it for the day not like most of the things I watched at that time, I even tried to buy it but as a rocking horse sh * t! By the way, acting is a bit hot, but the story is amazing considering it was a real B movie with a low budget and the event scene was amazing to watch, I had watched it about 20 times. It was a very well filmed movie, and I loved the idea of ​​fighting giant robots, a pity that they had to spoil them by destroying "Crash and Burn", not watching the movie as they were the overall trousers! If your real scientist is science fiction, then watch it if it was done again today, it would be the winner ... I really would like to see a remake or even release a DVD from it.
