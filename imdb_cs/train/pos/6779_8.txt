George Cukor directs classic and cynical classics. Notable Ronald Coleman is the best in this piece Noir who loses in his roles. Honorable Anthony John (Colman) brought his wife Britu (Signe Hasso) away with his highly temperate mood and irregular behavior. But these two can continue to work together to please their audience. Things are beginning to change as John barks his career; he reluctantly agrees to play Othello. He gets deeper into the figure as a jealous and murderous person. He begins to walk through a thin line between illusion and reality, and eventually confuses his role with his own life, eventually killing his mistress (Shelley Winters), but he has no memory of a strange deed. Colman seems insignificant in this role. Winters is very impressive because a young woman has decided to get away from her unhappy life. Also in cast: Edmond O'Brien, Ray Collins, Joe Sawyer and Whit Bissell.
