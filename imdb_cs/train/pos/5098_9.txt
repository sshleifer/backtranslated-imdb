Even longtime Shirley fans can surprise "now and forever". The film was shot by Paramount? not Shirley's parent company Twentieth Century Fox? in 1934, before producer Fox Darryl Zanuck perfected the successful Shirley formula (cute songs, cold hearts to melt, young couples to play cupid, happy endings). So "now and forever" falls into the Shirley car without the standard Shirley story. It's an unpleasant place for every movie, but this impressive, talented acting it does. Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard star as fun lovers, irresponsible cheaters Jerry and Toni Day. The only thing this inherited dysfunctional duo seems to hate more than being together is separated from each other. When suddenly landed with care about Jerry's young daughter Penny (Shirley Temple), is it Toni? and not Penny, as many believe? who persuades Jerry to give up his criminal career. But Jerry falls on the table and desperately succeeds in securing his new family, soon returning to thieves and dishonesty. In Penny's standard device, Penny tries to melt the heart of crunchy hairdresser Felix Evans, who is the victim of one of Jerry's infidels, but her attempt fails because Evans is revealed as an artist himself, and excuses Jerry to help steal his jewels. Drama, engagement, death, and sadness that all follow, make this movie very unusual for Little Miss Sunshine. There is no happy end, no dance and just one song (the cute number "The World Owes Me a Living"). But that does not mean Shirley fans should avoid "Now and Forever." Rather, it is the difference from the usual Shirley story, which is more interesting and unforgettable than many other films. But be careful: You should avoid the color version of this movie and you will see it in black and white if you can. The color is bright, stocky and unrealistic, and in many scenes Shirley's famous curls are really red instead of blond. So!
