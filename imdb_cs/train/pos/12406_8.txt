The long, imprisoned prison that has been closed for more than 20 years is reopened and Ethan Sharpe (late, great character actor Lane Smith), once shot there, is introduced as an administrator. When convicts are released to work to make sure they are ready, they will get directions to get to the old execution room. This unleashes the harsh spirit that causes ruthless confusion to the guards and prisoners; (Viggo Mortensen, who shows real poetry in the early role), is betrayed as a hero. I know it's reluctant to praise the film for its atmosphere (filmed in a real abandoned prison near Rawlins, Wyoming), but this horror film highlights it. It has a great feeling of premonition, established right from the start. Director Renny Harlin made his fourth directorial effort here; received "Nightmare on Elm Street 4" and effectively launched an impressive career in the mainstream of action films, thrillers and horror films. She can have stock figures but is capable of casting and bringing them to life: Chelsea Field as a young woman fighting for prison reform, Lincoln Kilpatrick as a tired veteran Cresus, Tom Everett as a rabid horse Rabbitt, Ivan Kane as leaving Lasagna, Tommy "Tiny" Lister as a slightly spoken giant Tiny, and Arlen Dean Snyder as Captain Horton. It should also be noted that Kane Hodder (as a vengeful ghost) who helped him settled the concert of Jason Voorhees in the series "Friday 13th". The dignified special effects, the moody lighting of the polite genre cameraman Mac Ahlberg, the ghostly music of Richard Band and Christopher Stone, great visuals, the incredibly gloomy location, and the generous, glamorous and intense presentation make it quite fun. It's ugly, terrifying and fun for horror fans. <br /> <br /> 8/10
