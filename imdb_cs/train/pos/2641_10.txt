Green Eyes is a great movie. In today's context of support for our soldiers, it is interesting that this film showed that there was no respect for soldiers during this period. From the historical point of view, the war in Vietnam ended with everyone with whom to remember and learn. Gene was very proud of this film and earned the credits he received from writing "Green Eyes". I agree, I do not understand why this movie is not shown more often or not at all. This movie is a movie that should be shown on television every year, just like the Wizard of Oz. The initiation of one man to the lost son moves completely. I was a friend of Gene Logans and I was proud to know him. Rocky
