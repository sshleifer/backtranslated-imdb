I have never seen the Next Action Hero show and until I read more, I did not know that this movie is a "prize" of this competition. I was just turning the channels and bumping on it, and I found myself looking, dare eagerly, to the end. Yes, the fence was done (the most dangerous game, etc.) But I was hoping and almost gotta gotcha - how the hero eventually the hero would defeat the hunter. I think high-tech was exaggerated (GPS) and gave me cold sweat flashbacks Night Rider, but it was not too exaggerated. The basic problem I had with this movie was the SOD (Suspension of Disbelief), which was demanded from the viewer. Do we really think anyone flying on a helicopter can pay countless burnt grenades on a public bridge and NO COPS appear to investigate? Could the limousine make countless donuts at the Las Vegas Junction and not see the COPS? She had pleared. Too many of this kind of thing - fun to watch but keep it at least reasonable, thank you very much. The final solution was good, but the end was disappointing, with the taste for a bad episode of Star Trek. At least now I understand why acting so straw - except Zane, which is not as close to the work IMHO deserves - were the winners of the reality show.
