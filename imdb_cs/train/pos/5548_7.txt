Star Pickford and director Tourneur - along with their two favorite cameras and helper Clarence Brown, who makes the adaptation - bring this story of poor, isolated Scottish islanders to great beauty and intelligence - the same territory that Michael Powell would have experienced twenty years later his first great success. The vision of wind and waves, the silhouettes of sun-lovers are not just a story, they are the story of the struggle against the stumbling blocks. Actors bring the dignity of the proud people to their role and Pickford is great as her character fights with her duties as the head of the clan, thinking between comedy and thoughtfulness, here with her father's brother screaming the islanders coming to church, sitting with her guest's hand in hand like a scepter and discussing her lover who plays Matt Moore. <br /> <br /> See if you can select the future star Leatrice Joye in the report. I tried, but failed.
