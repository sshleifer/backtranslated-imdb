I had to give this film 10 just because what had done so many films that black audiences threw did NOT BE USED. This movie was invalid from all kneeling girls video and also missed gangsters, rappers and dirty tongue. She has explored several relationships between doctors, African Americans, and African-American relationships between men and women at an entirely new and refreshing level. I was very interested in the film of a careful mix of light humor with some nice and difficult issues. The movie lets you be happy and sad at the same time. I also saw it at the Boston Film Festival. He was premiered at AMC Loews Boston and I really hope that this film will bring a much larger audience. Black people (and everyone else) would LOVE such a movie - if it was just so bad to get out there! <br /> <br /> As an extraordinary doctor, resident, doctor, pre-school student, married to a doctor, have a doctor's sibling, have a doctor in the family or know a great doctor's time - he would also love this movie. He expressed his place of residence and practice in a way that was truly recognized by physicians, residents and medical students who viewed the film. Dennis Cooper's full-time internship in home medicine - he has so much applied his / her film experience and it's very clear.
