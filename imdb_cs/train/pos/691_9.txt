I will come clean. The only reason I learned about this DVD was that Dominik Monaghan was a favorite actor. When I heard the name of the movie, I thought it would be ... different, maybe not so good. <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. After reading what few reviews were about this short one, I was really excited to see it. I sent my copy as soon as possible and got it a few weeks later. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. The film follows Jack, insomnia, which often afflicts the conditions that cause him by doubting what is reality and what is in his head. I will not do what will happen, but I will tell you that the movie can sometimes be frightening in its realism. Direction is fantastic and focuses on what is crucial to the story without allowing it to lose all fun or thought-provoking moments. Overall, I give this great movie 9 out of 10 that goes far beyond what I thought a short one could achieve.
