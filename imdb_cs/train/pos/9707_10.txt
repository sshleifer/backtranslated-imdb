A year ago, I finally gave up American television. I have been thinking of giving up television completely until some friend who lived in England has shown some programs that included the Office, the Extras, the Blackadder, and the League of Gentlemen. That's when I decided to switch to British television. Among all the above shows, The League of Gentlemen is the most darkest and saddest of all, providing wine laughter and material that was not in any other comedy I've ever seen. The characters involved are the most unhappily married couple, a butcher who gives the ingredients to the meat that are unlikely (probably for the best), an unpleasant couple who is looking at a local shop that only cares about the locals and the worst vet ever. This program is one of the best I've ever seen.
