WOW! <br /> <br /> This film is, in my opinion, the best living testimony of what happened in New York on 9-11-01, compared to what's in the mainstream media. <br /> <br /> Those stores can show you just what happened out there. This film shows what happened at INSIDE. <br /> <br /> It begins with the focus of a New York Fireman rookie and waits for a few weeks for the first big fire to be called to fight. The subject suddenly rotates ONLY WITH EXISTING PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE FIRST PLAN WHICH LIGHTS ON THE LIGHT. Then you got the seat on the front line as firefighters rushing to the scene to Tower One. <br /> <br /> In the minutes before the crash of the second plane and the subsequent fall of the tower two, you see that the firefighters react to the disturbing sound of the people who land over the hall. It's a look that you will not soon forget. <br /> <br /> The heart is shattered, torn and from the first minute to the last, convincing, "9/11" deserves, from the best documentaries ever made. <br /> <br /> We must never forget. <br /> <br />
