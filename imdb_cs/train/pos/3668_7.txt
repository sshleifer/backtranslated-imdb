I recently saw this movie and enjoyed it very much. it gives insights into indie film making and how much work is really involved when you have a low budget but you need a label actor / actress to make people, all people come to see it and put a movie exposition. Bobby Myeres, who plays Modine and his partner Saul - Paul Linder, creates an excellent mix of eccentric Miachel Bates, actor "NAME" starring Alan Bates was the perfect decision in film and film. My favorite cast member was Sandy Ryan, who played the wonderful and underestimated Debra Kara Unger with her own special performance again in the movie in the movie. If you like thinking while watching a comedy, then it's for you. A low budget meets a lower budget with high laughing content.
