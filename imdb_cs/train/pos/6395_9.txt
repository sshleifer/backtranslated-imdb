For me, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. Surprising racism, which is a challenge to life and proves that it is not just a "cookie", Carl Brashear is a wonderful game that gives Cuba its best light, the best performance in his life. No Niro, a living legend, gives it SOME film.Hoval his figure in the film, but gives so much good acting to this film, a great performance. And the look of the beautiful Charlize was and as always is a great contribution to every film. So if you have not seen this movie, I recommend those who love bravery, a magnificence that seeks inspiration. You have to look at this great drama. My vote 9/10.
