BEAVER TRILOGY is undoubtedly one of the best films ever made. I was fortunate to have done this together with director Trent Harris at the NY Video Festival a couple of years back and then bought a copy of Trent's website. This movie must be seen being believed! I sincerely recommend looking for Trent's name on the web and then buying a movie from his site. He's an incredibly nice guy he could learn. Do not be fooled: a cameraman in fictional sections THE BEAVER TRILOGY IS NOT Trent! When I saw TRILOGY several times, I have to admit that I could have no Sean Penn version. It's like a proven version for the "Orkly Kid" section of Crispin Glover, and it's more interesting as a curiosity if you're a fan of Penn before it's a good video. But Penn is pretty funny and you can see what big stars are in this devil black and white video. This is probably also one of Crispin Glover's best roles and I would like to see an updated documentary about the original Groovin 'Gary. When you see this movie, you'll never get back from Gary's nervous laugh again.
