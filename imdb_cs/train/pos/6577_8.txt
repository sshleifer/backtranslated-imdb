With a few exceptions, most of George Bernard Shaw's games of today have practically disappeared from the theater. Too arc, too talky seems to be a general verdict. This BBC version of one of Shaw's most entertaining games does not reverse this verdict. It's definitely arched and talky, but it's also beautiful. And because of the quality of the British theater, actors are fully occupied who - except for Helena Bonham Carter - most of us probably never heard of. Carter is gorgeous as a Bulgarian girl who is hiding a professional "chocolate soldier" (Pip Torrens) and later falls in love with him. One could argue with a particularly ridiculous commentary by Sergio (Patrick Rycarto), a Bulgarian cavalry officer who led the allegations into enemy lines and succeeded only because the enemy had bad ammunition for his machine guns. However, the role has led to excessive talks, and Rycart was clearly told to be acting excessively. Other players are perfect letters. Carter as a self-dramatic Bulgarian "aristocrat" and Torrens as Swiss soldiers are, of course, at the center of the game and are great. Yes, "Arms and the Man" hit the movie game. But it is unlikely he would ever see Shaw's film that did not lose his origins. Land is generally clever. However, Shaw is about dialogue. The action is minimal (even in St. Joan) and the sets are insignificant. Enjoy it for what it is.
