So the biggest TV comedy started! It was 12 years since the first episode, but continued with the same spirit until the last season. Because that's where the "Friends" is located: on quotes. Extraordinary situations happen between six friends who never leave our hearts: Let's say thanks to Rachel, Rossi, Monica, Joey, Chandler and Phoebe !!! In our first meeting, we see how Rachel folds the guy (in the church, how does ...) (she understands), Monica is looking for a "perfect guy" (there's no perfect guy why are all those women obsessed?) And how your marriage can be destroyed when a partner of your life finds out she is a lesbian. As long as we meet Joey, Phoebe and Chandler in the following episodes ... FRIENDS OF FRIENDS!
