Well, I'm going to go against the grain on this movie, so it looks like. As a fan of the horror I confessed, I sat down that he did not know what to expect. After 2 or 3 minutes I was really afraid (quite rare). The film, of course, has a small budget and is set around a charing cross station, but films lack money does not separate from the story. Yes, the story is a bit crazy and it does not explain well, but CREEP is a class law, and it continues to slash and slash everything that's coming. LADY NEWS !!! There are some parts of the movie, which should be in dependence or the best of you! you will understand when you see it. Overall, a good film and change sees a good movie slasher who really is afraid
