<br /> <br /> When I was nine, I saw Glacier Fox in the theater - I listened to my parents to take me back three times. I started looking for her video about five years ago and finally I discovered a copy at the online auction site but I would like to see it either picked up by a new distributor and re-released (I understand the original video was small) or have rights purchased by The Family Channel , Disney, etc., and displayed regularly. It's a fascinating film that attracts you to the story of the life struggle of the fox family in northern Japan, narrated by a wise old tree. Excellent soundtrack compliment the film well. Today it would be a good seller, better than many poor offers for children's movies today.
