My favorite film "Imperialism" and one of the best action adventure movies ever. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks dominate the screen with courageous and wise cracks to please everyone except the most "PC" movie visitors. Memorable scenes multiply - 3 sergeants and their 20 sepia battle with hundreds of Thugs; MacChesney & Cutter gives Bobby Coote a pointed blow ("save some elephants"); Cutter on MacChesney - "I'm Design"; ("What do you think I'm trying to break out of?") And an incredible scene with Cutter that sings and then announces brave as brass - "You're all well arrested!" <br /> <br /> I could go on but just tell me that I'm trying to capture this movie whenever it's turned on. For the chairs of adventurers and generals, it's hard to imagine better 2 hours.
