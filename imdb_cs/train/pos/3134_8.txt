It was a well-written story of Creating Batman Sitcom, and it really connects our hero to a great quest and also offers the history of his television shows. Unlike Brady and Partridge's documentary films, we not only look at the past and present of Adam and Burt, but also see them in action. Fulfilled with Kapow, Catwoman and Riddle (ami), Batman is back well known, a story that not only gives us a satisfying closure of the Batman series, but it fills a modern fan into all the Hollywood stories about them, to be heard in 35 years. <br /> <br /> Kudos !!!
