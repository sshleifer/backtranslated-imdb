This is hard to follow - as the senior reviewer says. This is amazing in view of the horrible movies that emerged right after the Second World War - especially the "liberation" of the Dachau. Obviously, since the middle of the war, they knew exactly what happened to the Jews. The sequence that shows "transport" is alive, almost as if it were based on real news (the Nazis like to know their atrocities). Knox like the Nazis is great. It describes the course of the Nazi career. This mapping is especially clear when it contrasts with the reactions of other Germans, first laughing at Hitler, then non-believers and finally helpless. This difference, however, allows us to believe in the "transformation" of a young Nazi officer into an anti-Nazi stance. It happened as witnessed by several attempts against Hitler, most notably the Staffenberg plot that occurred when the film came out. A powerful film that uses feedback effectively predicts the routes of Nuremberg and others that would occur after the end of the war.
