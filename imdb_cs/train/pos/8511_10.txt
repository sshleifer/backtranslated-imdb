This film discovers the expression "spring figurine". Hans, a fat one of the group, shows his talent as this generation, Chris Farley. Johnny Kansas, the "King of the $ 1 Bet", shows that he is constantly raising bets in Kansas. Kyle's laugh is really contagious and offers ladies an eye-candy (just like Matt). The dwarves, while having their own moments, did not match the Mexican hat they deserve. And finally we have our hero, Ed. It gives hope to all of us who are diving, spasmodic, gangly, pale people, who are still looking for something special. And hope is a small place called Cabo San Lucas. While this robot simply missed the theater, it is a necessity to rent because we can all concentrate on one of these spring figurines.
