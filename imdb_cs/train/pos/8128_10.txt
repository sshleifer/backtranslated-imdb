I first saw it as a child living in East London. Hitler's Luftwaffe's scars were too obvious, and the landscape of the film resembled our street. I remember having nightmares when I saw it. The special thing is that it is not really dated if it is considered part of social history in cinematography. <br /> <br /> In addition to the globally destructive war, the size of the machines was bad, more Nano-technology now, but overall excellent and well-worked. It was interesting to see how space travel was at that time. I would think burning a spacecraft from a gigantic gun would almost certainly kill the astronauts. However, it was quite right. Mans desire for war, man's inhumanity to man. Warfare as a catalyst for development. <br /> <br />
