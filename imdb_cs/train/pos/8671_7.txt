Armageddon PPV <br /> <br /> Last PPV of 2006 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> . Kane v. MVP. It was a good match. No match here. It was visual. Overall, it was not bad. There were a couple of tight spots where Kane got too close to the fire, but Kane eventually won with hooking the MVP into the fire back. Nice opening. Let's continue. Teddy Long announces new match for team titles: London and Kendrick will defend: Regal and Taylor, The Hardyz and MNM IN LADDER MATCH !!!! Let's move! <br /> <br /> Match two: A fatal four-way ladder match. It was a total massacre. According to three of the four teams you would expect chaos. The places were amazing. Total spot-fest. One Point Jeff went after poetry in motion and London moved and Jeff hit the ladder! Shortly thereafter, Jeff will stand on the top rope with two ribs nearby, when MNM kills Jeff, Matt stays and Jeff strikes Joey Mercury! Mercury is injured. His eye is quickly closed and difficult to open. Mercury is eliminated from the game and Nitro is still there. He will fight for titles himself! Regal and Taylor are coming to London and suppressing their face - first into the ladder! Jeff climbs the ladder and Nitro in a murderous place, jumps through the ladder and leaves Jeff! Amazing! Eventually, London and Kendrick keep the titles of team brands. What a match! <br /> <br /> It was crazy. I can not see why WWE has not yet announced this fact. The buyer would grow enormously. I'm sure the playback value will be good, though. <br /> <br /> Mercury suffered a torn nose and tearing his eye. He's in the hospital now. Get yourself a good boy. <br /> <br /> No other way to be here. <br /> <br /> Next step: The Miz v. Boogeyman (Ugh) This was nothing. Will Boogeyman ever wrestle? Miz is also angry. After the crazy crowd, the dead kill. DUD. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit v. Chavo. It was a strong match. I enjoyed it. Chavo hit one superplex killer! Benoit struck eight German enthusiasts! Benoit won the sharpshooter. Good thing. <br /> <br /> Helms vs. Yang-Cruiserweight Championship title. That was a good match. Unfortunately foolish fans did not care. WHY? Helms and Yang are very talented and are fighting well. I agree with JBL. She went to the crowd. JBL is 100% correct. Learn to appreciate or get out. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kennedy v. Undertaker-Last Ride. There is not much here. It was a slug with a few exceptions. At one point, Kennedy threw Taker from the top of the stage to the floor. The place was fine. The reaction was disappointing. The final place was Taker's Tomb of Kennedy to a friend and won the match. Unreal. Kennedy needed this victory. They both worked hard. Still, Kennedy needed this win. The trickster was supposed to lose. Creativity gets stuck again. <br /> <br /> A stupid diva is another. I like women. This is not. At least Torrie was not here. That's refreshing. According to the listener, Layla should win. WWE wanted Ashley. Let's think your bathroom breaks. Other. <br /> <br /> Main Event: Price & Batista v. Finlay & Booker T. It was also nothing. Emphasis was placed on the award by Finlay and Batista v. Booker. Batista and Booker can not work well. Finlay tries to make the Price look good. The success was an adult. Finlay hit Batista's knee in a chair and Batista did not speak and finished the match. Lame. It's not the main caliber at all. <br /> <br /> Overall, Armageddon would have achieved less, but the ranking was a major event. That was enough money. Several others were solid. <br /> <br /> The last word: A good PPV with the ladder being a rescue worker. Smackdown is not a bad show that is not convincing enough. Smackdown needs to stop leaving tag tags together. Let the Smackdown stand on your two legs. This show proves that Smackdown can do it.
