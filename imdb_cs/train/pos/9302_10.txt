Most of the comments were positive, but I'd like to add that viewers should also focus on files. Set designer has used a lot of beautiful artistic decorations along with beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture and so on. It is worth paying attention. The film is driven by a characterization and symbolism that is very rich. All gangster actors were busy - it was like seeing old friends and it was healing. Dialogue was sometimes fun, but sometimes inclined, and I suppose it should have been. This is a movie movie. They were people, people who love the medium. Do not miss this.
