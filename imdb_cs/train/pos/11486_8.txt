The film was seen at the Rotterdam International Film Festival. You may want to ask some decisions of the creator - as if he chooses a mocculentary form for such a sensitive and terrible subject - but this film will surely hit you in the intestines. Especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch. I hope he gets the distribution he deserves.
