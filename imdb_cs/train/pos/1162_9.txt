Like most people, I've seen Jason Priestley on TV and I think it's great. But I did not know he had a sister! Justine Priestley is simply "mah" gorgeous as a contemplative second woman. Good music, intrigue and death scene involving Amanda's revenge on the abusive Dr. who will be with you for weeks. I'll leave it in it. Glory.
