John Waters has become the most exhausting, sincere, dark, personal little film I've ever thought I've ever seen (maybe Fast Food Fast Women is coming just behind) The visions of directors are incredible ... the narrative is moody, the characters are personal and strange reflections about the family and their own inner life ... the tone never forced or stylistically exaggerated. <br /> <br /> There is no demanding shot, ennui or magazine rating ... Martha Plimpton is amazing as a sister .. Eddie furlong is inspired by casting. Grandmother with talking Mary, burlap, recycled clothing, yesterday's waste becomes art today - and the lesson of the film is that the most important thing we can appreciate is the family ... and humble life.
