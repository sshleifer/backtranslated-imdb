The brutal, impatient Michael Myers strikes his sister to death at the age of six at the age of Halloween in 1963; On October 30, 1978, he escapes from a psychiatric institution and installs a new government of terror in his hometown of Haddonfield, Ill. All the time he is pursued by a psychiatrist (Donald Pleasence), who knows how evil this young man is. It opens with a bang and creates a truly thrilling and atmospheric cooling unit, which is in fact superior to many slasher images that helped inspire. It's fine compared to the ugly bloody spas that were in many other movies; delicate and frightening. It keeps me able to transform me even after repeated viewing. How many movies do they really exist that can still be scary even if they've seen them before? Not much. <br /> <br /> Pleasant is great in what was probably the definitive role of his career; Jamie Lee Curtis, in her debut film, became a bona fide cry by the Queen after she had worked in Halloween, as well as several other Slasher pictures, and she is the intended victim for her rooting. What writer / director John Carpenter knows about what works in this movie, thanks to the excellent use of shadows and dark skies; Notice how most movies are set after dark. With this picture he and his former collaborator Debra Hill have created a permit that created seven sequels, many imitators and the upcoming "reconstruction". He is very sensitive - who could ever forget Dr. Loomis' (Pleasence), which describes Michael Myers Sheriff (Charles Cyphers, a reliable repertoire in several earlier works by Carpenter)? It's fantastic and worth a look. This is my favorite John Carpenter movie of all time. <br /> <br /> It's not completely infallible - after all there are script holes - but it has a big impact overall. <br /> <br /> 9/10
