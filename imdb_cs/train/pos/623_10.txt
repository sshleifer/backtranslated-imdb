There are not many movies around that made me feel like Stardust did throughout the movie. As a magical fairytale story like the Princess Bride, Stardust is definitely the most amazing fantastic spectacle of the 2000s and 1990s. Exciting, cheerful and equipped with beautiful paintings and unforgettable characters, especially Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro, I invite everyone to look at this film without a smile. From the first ten minutes of the movie, you know how it ends, but it's a journey, not a goal that captures the viewer from start to finish. Ten stars and no decimal places less.
