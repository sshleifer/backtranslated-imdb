Robot Jox is trying hard, but it's basically a series of combat scenes that are connected - a robot against a robot, a man against a man, a man against a woman. The assumption had the potential, but it seems that the script was not really the result of several other proposals he needed. Still, it was quite good for a science fiction action movie. Part of it was because the script was Joe Haldeman. For those who do not know this name, Haldeman wrote the award-winning science fiction novel "The Forever War". It is considered to be one of the best-fought armament warriors, with Robert Heinlein's "Starship Troopers" and John Steakley's "Armor". And this film really resembles a giant powered armored combat film, rather than giant robots. It is closer to what the fans wanted instead of the transvestite, which was "Starship Troopers" by Paul Verhoeven, which was inconspicuously similar to the novel on which it was founded. Despite some assumptions, it is not really based on Homer's "Iliad". Several names are all they have in common. Achilles, who had a robot's scrubbed leg, did not have a parallel in Iliad that did not include Achil's death. Not even old Achilles was a noble warrior. He was the most powerful, but even vengeful and tiny. Even the robot jock killed in the first scene does not sit. He was named Hercules, while Greek Iliad would have Herakles. The effects were relatively good for time and budget. It is true that a year later it was not comparable to "Terminator 2", but the movie was ten times as much. The trapping movement was almost as good as the robotic pedestrians in the "Empire Backs" and "The Return of the Jedi". In fact, it's much better than a lot of Ray Harryhausen, which is very acclaimed but rather long. <br /> <br /> Do not go into that great expectation and you will probably not be disappointed. It's better than a lot of other low-budget movies and even big budget puzzles that have better effects but much worse scenarios.
