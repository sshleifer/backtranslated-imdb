Good action and interesting plot. When I saw the original, I have to say that it was an interesting improvement and it turned out more of the film. A good shot .. a meaningful actor .. though it would be nice to see some further expansion in the action scenes rather than the background story. A fun movie that keeps track of you and keeps you all the time 7/10 is the right vote I think!
