Kate Beckinsale is excellent as a manipulative and yet irresistibly glamorous Emma in this television adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. When I read the novel, I was sometimes quite dubious about whether the protagonist really deserves to be considered the hero of the story: for frankly, she is so terribly fair and guess she is tempted to seriously dislike it. Kate Beckinsale's interpretation of Emma itself, however, imposes: it is portrayed with the whole innocence and generosity of its character in full view, and one can not help, but is given and liked (say no love) despite its less attractive qualities. Kate Beckinsale is the main but not the only reason why this TV series is so beautiful; Raymond Coulthard is as perfect as Frank Churchill, who fully expresses his personality magnetism (which is all the more obvious because Ewan McGregor in this adaptation by Eman McGregor is not very well ruled by Emma in 1996) and Mark Strong, Samantha Morton, Bernard Hepton and Olivia Williams is all as they should be in their respective roles. This production is simply a great success and multiple views with increasing pleasure.
