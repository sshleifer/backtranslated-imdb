I have read more than 100 Nancy Drew's books, and if you are not so clear that you could capture them, Nancy Drew's film was younger than Nancy Drew, not an 18-year-old who does not go to school, that all the books are about. That was sixteen. So naturally she would not be as clever as the one in the book that she considers to be only in the 10th grade. Besides, I thought the movie was very cute. It was clean and good for everyone. It was fun sometimes. I thought Emma Roberts was doing a great job. She was distinctive and cute. I liked the clumsiness that Nancy and Ned had around them, obviously not old enough to be in a serious relationship they had in the books. It was a cute, PG film I enjoyed because, unlike most people who live at my age, I enjoy movies without sex, drugs or dirt.
