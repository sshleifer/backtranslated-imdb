I thought the kids in the movie were great. I deal with children in this age group and I thought their behavior was very plausible. I had a problem with a reference to private components made over five years. I did not think that the commentary was necessary and really slightly reduced my opinion on the film. <br /> <br /> I think Luke Benward is a star. I would like to see him on the big screen. I liked his reaction to the situations in which he found himself. Often children in this age group do things without thinking consequences. Almost all actors have done it all the time. I also think that the bullying report must be investigated more in films with this age group. Today it is a major problem. <br /> <br /> The end was completely unexpected. Billy's thoughts about winning or not winning were very surprising. How he dealt with this situation was excellent. Too often today, children are not willing to compromise. Actors in this film have shown that compromise is an important part of life.
