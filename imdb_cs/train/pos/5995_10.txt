I'm not sure if it was right or wrong, but before other notes I read before I look at the short. I have to say that I disagree with most of the negative comments or problems people have with it. <br /> <br /> For the first time, the director / producer of the "lone wolf," I like to see things I can do, not necessarily from professionals, but from people who get wet like me. <br /> <br /> It's also from the first timer, as I read, I appreciate the effort. Simple work then in this regard! It was a few comments about the music. I thought it was pretty nice for a piece. Some say it's a bit droned for a while, but I found it created a tension without (we) necessarily aware of it, and when he pulled his weapons and the guitar began to chirp chords, it was as if we knew the train was on the track, but realize that he's moving now. Yes, there are 180 degrees slip / clip, but shi * happens. Did anyone else see Hugh's dirty white shirt (near the end, in the rain) in "Australia"? See how much money and people were behind this movie! Give baby a break for the gods! Overall, I think it was very well done. Only two things I mentioned are hardly worth mentioning - Do not go with the camera on a glossy brass photo frame and I would just point at shooting shots at the beginning so people would not have what it is. <br /> <br /> My previous experience has taught me that it's not that hard to make a movie, it just takes a while to learn how to do it, then time, and then you should still think about all the details, you will need to cover before you call "postproduction time!" IMHO, it seems that director / writer Ryan Jafri has done his homework, and if it's really his first reporting card, I would give him a "A". The rest tells you the directors' office to come back to you.
