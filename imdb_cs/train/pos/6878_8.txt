For 35 years, Groove Tube looks like a real television today! Special niche nudes, a binoculars booklet called "Traders" (ala Weeds and even before the 1978 Cheech & Chong Up In Smoke), strange beer commercials (Butz Beer, no less bizarre than Bud Bowls), dirty (Pee Wee Herman's cry), even Chevy Chase, who makes horror humor a year before his debut on Saturday night in 1975. And thanks to the infamous startup sequence that Groove Tube got the initial X-rating I still can not hear Curtis Mayfield's "Move On Up" without thinking of naked dance hippies ---- For similar sketch-style movies, see TunnelVision, Kentucky Fried Film, Amazon in Mood, Monty Python's Beyond the Fringe, Dynamite Chicken and all you know is bad.
