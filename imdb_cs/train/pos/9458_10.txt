This is a noble piece of film. It flows at the right pace. Accompanying music is perfect and is pleasant to the ear. Funny parts are funny, and this is even more of a very depressing tragic nature of the film. However, despite a lot of comments about my own tragedy, it was unpleasant to watch for me. I have enjoyed it intimately so that I have not experienced it for a long time. That is, it is excellent and yet without all the common trappings of modern movies such as; gender, violence and unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> "Dan in real life" lacks anything that would be without regular witnesses. It has a completely mature land that it simply does not require, and would indeed be destroyed by another decoration. At the same time, the subject is totally mature. It is a work of art in itself, which completely encapsulates you and you want nothing more than it already offers. There are some scenes that feel a little "Waltons," but they really make sense in the long run, as they contrast with more dysfunctional moments. Růžička makes the way for a tragic, which then moves into an idyllic one that turns to a darker, etc. This wavy landscape of emotional cinema creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of lithium stability. Peaks and troughs are fine, but more than adequate in the pleasures they instil. I highly recommend watching this movie no matter what genre you like. Put away any prejudices, because it is necessary to see!
