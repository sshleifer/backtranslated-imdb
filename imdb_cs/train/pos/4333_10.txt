seeing it in the preview - great movie - amazing characterization - funny and intelligent dialogue - the actors were fantastic - Peter Falk will list the Oscar - Paul Reiser was charming - the photo was amazing Reiser was in the theater when we saw the movie and he made a vivid picture of shooting film - it was a long dream of writing a semi-biobiographical description of the relationship between sons and fathers and more specifically between him and his father - it was achieved in a dramatic and fun fashionable - supporting cast was well chosen and gave the film a feeling of family - I recommend this film to everyone , who long for intelligent drama and gorgeous performances
