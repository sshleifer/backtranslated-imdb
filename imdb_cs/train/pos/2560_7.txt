Brando plays the ace pilot who is back from shooting the MiGs to the Korean War. On vacation will discover his Madame Butterfly, he falls in love. Lovers both see the foolishness of racism and cruelty that conservative cultural standards can bring to human relationships. This movie is an excellent romance with a nice twist that rejects the racist, conservative standards, the dominant for a time it was done in 1957. "Sayonara" will laugh and cry you. Beware, sometimes the musical background will make you there, although Irving's Berlin home song will long attract your memory after your theater lights are heard again.
