Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily impoverished Polish Countess in Paris who finds himself in Paris in 1900, who is hunting for the French most popular general and enchanting counting - and it is at the top when he deals with monster shoes. Such is a no-favored concept that attracts one of the most delirious drawings in the history of the film. There are political machinations behind the backstage of the generals' manipulators, the downed balloon and the ecstatic days of Bastille Day, but the heart of this gorgeously photographed film is the frantic up / down intrigue involving randy servants and only slightly more reserved aristocrats. Yes, they are the Redux Rules. Before it happens, even Gaston Modot, a jealous champion in rules, appears - like a gipsy kapo, no less! Things become a bit too fat and fast towards the end, which leads to some confusion for this non-French speaker, but what the hell - Elena and her men is another deeply human Renoir masterpiece.
