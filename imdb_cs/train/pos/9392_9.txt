One night I went home and turned on the TV to see Siskel and Ebert summarize their selections a week. I have not heard of "Red Rock West", except two inches up and see you before he left. It should not stay in the theaters for too long due to problems with distributor money and lack of support, but they thought they deserve better. The following afternoon I followed their advice. They were right, it was one of the hottest movies I ever had. As some readers point out that there are a couple of holes, the last 10 minutes seem to never stop. But it is worth it, for the fine craft that went into the first hour. It's the best role I've ever seen for Nicholas Cage, but almost everyone seems to be perfectly occupied. Dennis Hopper is almost over the top, which is stupid, but it strengthens how well everything else works. Sets and music contribute greatly to almost every scene. When I rented it for my family later, it did not work. The long scenes that built the tension in the theater were difficult to appreciate, scattered at home. It deserves full attention; turn off the phone, make sure you are not disturbed, watching and listening to each scene, especially at the beginning.
