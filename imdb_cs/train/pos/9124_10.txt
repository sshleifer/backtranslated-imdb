The bar of some dubious acting (there musicians at the end of the day), in the words of Quentin Tarrinn, is "Best Rock Film Ever Made ... Season" Think 8 Mile, but without rapping - a young musician who tries to prove to the local community while trying to deal with a broken home and rival band. Win a sexual interest and truly exceptional performances, this is a true 8 million Prince gives you solid performance, just like Morris Day and Jerome Benton. Dignified script, good direction, great plot and spectacular performance. Do not forget some of the best rock / pop / funk music you've ever heard.
