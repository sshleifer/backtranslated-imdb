This is a family movie that some people have shutdown automatically. It seems that too many people do not want to see films that are not burdened with bad arms and legs, trouble-free violence, and enough enthusiasm to fill a New York phone book. This movie is nothing of that. It's a clich√©, it's a formula, but it's also fun. He does not ask you to think, it does not require you to accept the film as a reality. He simply does what a good film should do, which is to voluntarily break the distrust of two hours and enjoy the adventure. Cast is good, though not good. As another commentator said, John Williams' sound score was as usual excellent. And the fact that a lot of the movie was shot in Huntsville in a space camp is even more credible. <br /> <br /> It was ironic that the original release of the film was delayed for several months due to the Challenger Shuttle disaster, which may have played a major role in its original theatrical opening, but eventually the movie helped focus the dreams of many young people back into space and possibilities , which lie in them. So sit down with your kids and get ready for it.
