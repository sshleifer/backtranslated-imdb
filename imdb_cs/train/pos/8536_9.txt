I recently got the chance to see "The Waterdance" and she liked it pretty. I do not understand why it was called because there is really no dance there, except when dancing in a striped club near the end. We are acquainted with the main characters throughout the movie, the disabled in the hospital. The story shows a loving affair between a physically determined guy and a healthy woman, a very nice story. Unfortunately, you can not see such a movie today. I'm not "stuck in warp time", I do not think everything in the 1980s and early 90s was better than today, but I really think the film industry is getting worse and there's a lot we can learn from old movies - according to old films I think everything from 1920-1998.
