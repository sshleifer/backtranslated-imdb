This is one of the most fun shows ever! I laughed as my sides did not break and did not move on the floor. If someone went to America. Area 0 or 1 - please do not apply. <br /> <br /> I know it's published in the UK but it's Region 2 and PAL besides! Let's say this series is fair. America needs to know this series. Moffat is brilliant. I loved this sandy, deaf Tracie Bennetty. Of course, I liked Fiona Gillies! But Tracy was a treasure! <br /> <br /> Relax this show in America! or view it again on PBS. I have to laugh and laugh again! Please, please, please! Please! <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading.
