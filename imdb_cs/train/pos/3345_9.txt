What I expected was a slightly bitter, stereotypical portrait of a sporty fool, and the same lame stereotypical portrait of a gal that he likes still suffers when he is the second banana to be too keen on his favorite sports team. <br /> <br /> What I got: A story with a straight hand where both a boy and a gal finally admit - to themselves and to each other - that each one has a passion in life, but everyone can forgive another to save love , which he shares. <br /> <br /> It sounds like sappy, but with continual humor and amazing performances this story works! Barrymore is a classic Barrymore: a perfect blend of sweet, strong and adorable. We expect her to deliver her. But Fallon is a surprise in this film. It brings a perfect combination of a sporty walnut combination to the reinforcement for normal things in life, such as caring for children and their girlfriend. Fallon delivers his lines with gentle perfection. It can take care of you ("You just walked through the fields!") And in the same breath he admirably blinded his love for the red Sox ("How did the grass feel? Somewhat spongy?"). Fallon's portrait "shot" the movie. Hopefully, this film marks the beginning of a better career in the Fallon film, something over the sophomoric humor typical of SNL alums (ie Will Ferrell). In short, a movie that could have been the victims of stereotypical male and female characters that have overcome this limitation and provided non-stop spot-on funny lines most favored with the brilliant finesse of Fallon. Hey, I saw it with my wife - not a baseball fan - and she loved it the way I did. It's not "Guy Flick" or "Chick Flick". It's a great make-you-laugh. Go for it!
