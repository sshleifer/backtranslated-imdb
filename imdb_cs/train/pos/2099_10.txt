This is excellent - it works amazingly, series, clothing, music - but above all the story itself. <br /> <br /> I'm amazed, there are no more reviews of this movie - definitely one of the best 1980s. It is also a wonderful film that is seen in tandem with a great "random harvest" that has a very similar initial crisis <br /> <br /> - Medieval English unknown officer is in the hospital until the end of the war, suffers from shaft shock and complete amnesia without a hint of his name, his background, or wherever he belongs - he turns out to be a very wealthy man - when he "recovers" he will not remember the years before the war - but the similarities of films end. The most fortunate thanks to all the actors involved - especially actors Ian Holm, Alan Bates, Ann Margret (what a great and surprising choice casting), Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie. <br /> <br /> This man will stay with you forever.
