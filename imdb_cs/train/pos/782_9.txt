This is a very moving picture of about three forty best friends in the small town of England. One finds passionate love and a new beginning with the younger piano instructor, When the tragedy strikes and the heart changes forever. Definitely a movie that has a tissue box with you! Powerful piece of work. This is definitely one of my favorite films of all time. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER !!! WARNING: SPOILER !! SPOILER !! * <br /> <br /> The main character is her young, handsome piano instructor and passionate romance. Her two jealous "friends" play an immature joke that quickly leads to tragedy. He loses his love and friends in a single fight. Eventually, the unexpected surprise draws together (in my opinion, her forgiveness is not guaranteed)
