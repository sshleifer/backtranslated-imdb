I only saw this movie about 25 years ago, and I've always told people that it's probably the best movie I've ever seen. Since there was no oral dialogue and only a thoughtful dialogue, I found that the film was fascinating, and I even realized I was holding my breath to make no sound. I highly recommend this movie, I wish it was available on DVD.
