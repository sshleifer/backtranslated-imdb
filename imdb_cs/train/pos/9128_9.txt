I have to admit that Purple Rain is one of my deepest pleasures. Purple rain not only crossed borders, set decades, costumes, music, behavior and dance! To date, my friends and I are still jamming for the Purple Rain soundtrack and pretending to be a prince and a revolution. Now the movie itself, I just thought what I said in the title, because for most of the time, this film is recorded with music. Playing? Please do not let me judge because it is one of my most favorite pleasures because I know it's not Oscar worthy of any means. But I think the duo that took this movie was Morris and Jarome, their talk about slogans was just fun. I just want to rate this movie at the concert sequences because I felt it was what the movie is doing. Prince is a musical genius and has created beautiful music. While movies and acting are pretty bad, this movie is still fun, which can be watched at night and even dancing. This movie defined the 1980s, so just have fun with it. The prince would want it just to get down to the party! Oh boy, that sounded feeble. <br /> <br /> 9/10
