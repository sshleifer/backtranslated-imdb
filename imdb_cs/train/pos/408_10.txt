I can not tell you how much I love this movie. I have read reviews that say this step is "too misty" or "like swimming in dry concrete". I say these reviewers have no imagination! For anyone who loves Fantasy Fiction, this movie is for you. If you've ever loved playing Dungeons & Dragons ... this movie is for you (especially if you've gotten into Oriental Adventures). I'm just sorry I did not show up on the movie. (More motivation to get your own big screen :-)
