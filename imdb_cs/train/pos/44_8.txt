When I was told about this movie, I thought it would be another cat. I was wrong. This movie sends a strong report on the evaluation of others. I was deeply moved. Everyone I met, I recommended this movie. No one came back when he said it was bad. Busy, she also had a great job with her role in this film. I do not know much about her acting career, but wow, they, as she pulled it out of the end, was great. At first it was a bit slow. But after she went to the hospital ... wow, the movie rises again. I have no idea why this movie was not entrusted in the film. My wish would be to release this movie again and advertise another ... because it sends a powerful message in just an hour and a half.
