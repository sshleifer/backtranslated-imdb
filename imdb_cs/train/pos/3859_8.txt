De Vierde Man (Fourth Man) Paul Verhoeven is one of the most amazing thrillers I've ever seen. It was a really pleasant surprise. The story concerns the bisexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) because he is attracted to the relationship with the beautiful Christine hairdresser (Ren√©e Soutendijk), but in the twisted mind of Gerard could be more of a story. Verhoeven and cameraman Jan De Bont create a beautiful and dense atmosphere full of surreal and dirty sexual fantasies that really draws you into the story, you do not want to watch but you can not turn away. This is by far the best film of Verhoeven (maybe only the second on Robocop). True Fourth man is not for all, some sexual scenes are totally inappropriate (just ignore them, but trust me if you watch for at least ten minutes, you'll be hooked.) That's one of those movies you need to know how it ends. It's true that it's in Hitchcock's tradition, convincing, controversial and exciting. I even like a spider's metaphor. <br /> <br /> 8/10
