Suggesting that Anton Newcombe from the Brian Jonestown Massacre could also use some therapy, it's a slight one. In Dig! who won the Grand Jury Award at Sundance, we are watching him and his self-sabotage band for seven years, while Dandy Warhols' former friends and contemporaries are provoking comparative grandeur (a mobile phone ad, anyway). <br /> <br /> What does Dig! over the contemporaries is the enormous, almost biblical comic tragedy that unfolds: depressing the honest treatise on art vs. trade and compromise. For all of his "look at me, I'm a bloody genius", attitude, Newcombe is actually revealed as a uniquely gifted, albeit tremendously confused, musician - much more talented than his rival, Dandy Courtney Taylor, who tells the picture. If Newcombe Dennis Hopper, Taylor's Peter Fonda. Even more sad, it seems that Taylor realizes how his frantic and confident voice shows: he knows his band won the battle - but what is the cost? In fact, they sold out, made India-Lite records, kept their teeth nice and clean, and probably had their hair dripped twice before bedtime - and so won a record deal and a big bus. And deprives all credibility in the process. Newcombe, on the other hand, lives in dirt, is constantly damn, defeats band members on the stage, kicks hecklers in his head - and last saw them in Dig! when he lost the right to see his child. Two of the best films about the rock subculture were directed by women: Penelope Spheeris' The Decline of Western Civilization and this? an instant classic at the time she was released.
