Mild Spoilers <br /> <br /> In the near future, Arnold stars as Ben Richards, the wrongly convicted man forced into the 'running man' game, a deadly TV game show where people have to keep up with trying to escape brutal deaths in the hands of " Stalkers ". It is expected that people will eventually die to Arnold to prove that the system is bad. I did not read Stephen King's book, but it's a great movie no matter what. Doing what best works as an action man brings death by unforgettable one-time lines. The classics are probably "It was a real sore throat" when she strangled a guy with barbed wire and "She had to split up!" He referred to the place where someone was just cutting vertically. Dawson is utterly irritating as a TV moderator, and all "stalkers" are well-camped. The action is violent but its action movie. That's it. The film moves fast and it will not survive in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> With Stars and Hutch Paul Michael Glaser on the rudder and made by the success of The Terminator, before, this film was probably considered to be another soulless action vehicle for Arnold and was very attracted. Today, however, anyone who watches a lot of television can see how the film is approaching reality. I would not be surprised if I turned on the television in the "near future" and I will see a show that is not far from that. <br /> <br /> On this depressing note, however, I have to recommend 'The Running Man' for anyone who likes the 80's, Arnold, ridiculous acts or violence or just a good movie. 9. 5/10
