I saw the trailer of this movie in the 1970s when I was barely 16 when watching another movie. Ach !!!! how excited me and my best friend. we can not wait for the moon or as long as it does not come. I saw this movie 17 times that year in the theater. I love, I love, I love it. Kris is so ideal for the film. He's rough and a little scary, but Babs is shy and uncertain and so cute he looks at it again. When they are sung by the ubiquitous in the studio and ringing with their torn voice, which is very different from the perfect remarks that come from it, I always thought this was one of the best scenes in the movie. The way he looks at her and he is so proud. I could watch this movie every day. We tried to dress as much as she, even the long sweater and the cap that was the same as she wore. it came to television on time and I got my daughters to watch that they are teens and they love it. Maybe it's just that I was so busy when everything was extreme, I do not know. The end I always have in my tears today.
