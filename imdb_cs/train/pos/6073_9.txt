My professor says Othello can be Shakespeare's best drama. I do not know if I agree with him yet. I bought this video version of the movie. First of all, I like Kenneth BRanagh as Iago, he was totally complicated and he worked very well in this arrangement. It is no surprise that he did not, but played a part. Lawrence Fishburne shows that American actors can play Shakespeare as well as British actors can do. not that it was a British and American problem. In fact, when we all work together, Shakespeare can achieve the mass they deserve. In addition to other Shakespeare tragedies, it deals with the question of race. Something that has existed since the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could have been better and showed the complexity of their union together. While Othello loves Desdemon wholeheartedly, he is weak because of jealousy and fear of losing her to a Mauric man like Cassio. It's a pretty great scene at the end of the movie, but I do not end. IT is worth watching. I think most of the lines were edited for 2 hours, but they always modified Shakespeare.
