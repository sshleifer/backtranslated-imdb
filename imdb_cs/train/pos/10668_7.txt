As many reviewers have noted here, the film version differs from the scenic version of the story. I have never seen the story version of the story, and therefore I have a better overview of the movie than many other reviewers. Perhaps Richard Attenborough was not the best choice for a film director, but the film is still a fun story of some dancers trying to make a great time in the Michael Douglas choreography. The film does the right thing by not selecting any famous actors or artists in the final test group. In this way our attention is focused on the movements of the dancers and the individual stories and struggles that unfold during the marathon day of the tests. Douglas is also probably not the best choice for part. It seemed that some of the songs were released in favor of the new one, and was added a backstage clich√©-sparkling story of a romantic connection between the dancer and the choreographer. I have to say it was the weakest part of the film. The repeated attacks that Cassie did during the trials seem to mirror the almost desperate reasons we often have to do when engaging in artistic professions without talent and happiness. However, this aspect of the film was a death in the past, and it is curious to see that this tired old shoe kicked his heel again. The unveiling of the dancers themselves began to be promising enough with the number of "I Can Do It," but then a bit grew in different places as the dancers told their stories. Frankly, their stories differed from real people who never have such a chance. *** from 4 stars.
