"Guy Thing" may not be a classic, but it's definitely a good, fun comedy. The story focuses on Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up in the morning after her bachelor party without memories, and Becky (Julia Stiles) is naked in bed. Before he finds out what happened, Becky pulls out of his apartment because his fianc√© Karen (Selma Blair) comes in. Then, as you can imagine, there will be chaos. Almost every scene in "A Guy Thing" brings loud laughter. The funniest moments come from when Paul presents what can happen when Karen says. Selma Blair is a really talented comedian, and the worst part is that he does not like this movie. Although it appears to be more entertaining than the Stiles character, which is not really that interesting. Of course, not every comedy is perfect. <br /> <br /> As I said, "Guy Thing" is not classic, but it's not bad, 7/10.
