The film was much better than the other reviewer said. It's a nice family movie. It has a fun fantastic aspect of some time travel. The story revolves around a 14-year-old girl who accidentally finds a way to return to the old elevator of her apartment building in time. Of course, no one believes her when she tries to explain her disappearance. She finds out and makes friends with a girl of her age and is able to help the girl's family in many ways. He is also able to help his father in the long term. Reminds me of Hallmark, so give him a chance and decide for yourself. It seemed to be more focused on children aged 6-12 (maybe a little older) and it's a lot rated PG or G. I'm an adult who can appreciate a nice "family" movie - I think the second reviewer is not.
