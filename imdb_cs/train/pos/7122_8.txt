In the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, healthy minds in Hollywood tried to move away from the soulless flagship waving, a natural component in the war effort. The "Best Years of our Life," and even the Gentlemen's Agreement, explored the way Americans looked at each other after the war, but Delmer Daves's "Pride of Sailors" was defeated. <br /> <br /> The film is about Philadelphia's clever alter John Garfield, who goes to war as a naval and after night mumbling night in foxhole, with Japanese soldiers screaming scary at him and his friends "Mariiines, tonight you die!", He is blinded by a hand-grenade, and he has his girlfriend back home, rather than having to rely on her after returning home. Delmer Daves is uncompromising in his portrayal of those men who are courageous, as if it was by accident They are there at the bottom and when they are shot they respond so much to what happened for heroism but they do it and then come alone anger, dark and gloomy sense of humor Garfield is in an angry denial of his blindness, and the film does not justify "there is no free candy in this world" as his friend says. ame a guy, a Jew who played Dane Clark, reminds him: "Somebody gets it in the war, and you are it. Everyone has trouble! When I get back, some guys will not find me because my name is Diamond." Big movies are made with such guts, and if the first half hour of "The Pride of Seafarers" does not get fully lifted, it has since evolved into a true artistic work, weeping and thinking, paining and hoping for hope. Well, simply: art. <br /> <br />
