Peter Sollett has created a cute portrait of real people living in poverty on Lower East Side in New York or Loisaida, as local people know. <br /> <br /> Sollet's heart is in the right place when he examines this dysfunctional family that is typical of the different "inner cities" of the country. Mr. Sollett highlights the positive story he represents. They are essentially good children, children of parents who have left them, and whose grandmother has taken their wings. <br /> <br /> Instead of introducing his characters as losers, Mr. Sollett shows the positive side that everyone has. These children are not drugs or stolen because they are poor. If this story took place in Hollywood, we would see a stereotype show, instead of children struggling, but deep inside, they are not defeated. Victor Rasuk, like Victor Vargas, was a revelation. It's natural. Also July is Marta. Her character shows us no nonsensical girl who will not be deceived or forced to do something she does not want to do. Altagracia Guzman, like grandmother, is excellent. He is frustrated that he is not able to direct his grandchildren to things he believes and which are so important to her. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a great painting thanks to Peter Sollett.
