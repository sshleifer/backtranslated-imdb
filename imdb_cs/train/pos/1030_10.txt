I nominated it and BABYLON 5 as the best television science series. They both act in my mind because, unlike the early STAR TREK series, there is consistent development of drawings and characters. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK: TNG, it was great shows but there was no general theme or plot that would link all the episodes. In many ways, you can usually watch shows just outside the sequence without any difficulty in understanding what's going on. That was less in the case of DEEP SPACE 9 (with its giant battles that took up all the last seasons) and another TREK shows because there was a bigger story there that united them. This consistency seems to have evolved as a concept with BABYLON 5 and has seen it even more with SG-1. As a result, in many ways, this series was similar to family observation or a long novel that slowly developed. Sure, there were several episodes that were not associated with the rest, but they were very few and far away, and they were usually quite fun. And I talked funny that I loved that SG -1 From time to time kept the mood light and was not so serious. That's how I actually enjoyed more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great figure with his sarcasm and love for Homer Simpson - it's really bad that he slowly disappeared in the series. <br /> <br /> To really appreciate SG-1, you should watch it from scratch and see how intricate the plots work. This coherence gives the exhibition an extraordinary constant strength. And if you do not like SG-1 after you give him a good chance, science fiction is probably not a genre for you.
