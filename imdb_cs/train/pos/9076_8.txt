It would have to be one of the most entertaining television comics that came out of the States since the demise of "Everybody Loves Raymond". Warburton is always cheerful and complements the rest of the file, which is quite perfect. David Spade continues to humiliate my funny bone with an incredibly unique delivery of her lines. After I went through the British "Combination" series, I can see where they were the creators of the "Rules of Engagement," but this is not intended as a "brickbat" - an absolutely brilliant dialogue and a way forward to set this particular series apart. But it's more than a competent cast that brought success to the new series, especially in a very difficult comedy. After taking part in professional TV comic work in Australia for the best 7 years, I can especially appreciate the role of the director and the receptive and creative talent of the cameraman. One of the few troubles I have in the series is obviously "preserved" by laughter. Certainly, a live audience could be used when shooting a series.
