"California" is a great movie that makes us look at each other. The film has a great cast, Brad Pitt (Johnny Suede, A River Running Over It and Legends of the Fall) as Early Grayce, David Duchovny) as Brian Kessler, Michelle Forbes (Star Trek: The Next Generation, Murder: Life on the Street and LA Escape) such as Carrie Loughlin, Brian's girlfriend and Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers, Cape Fear and What's Eating Gilbert Grape) as Adele Corners, Early Girlfriend. Brian Kessler is a writer who is a liberal, is about to write a book about serial killers. Brian and his girlfriend, Carrie, decide to move to California, so Brian puts a college ad for somebody who wants to go to California to share travel expenses. <br /> <br /> Early Grayce is an ex-con and sociopath at summons, who recently lost their job that the mirror factory in the city is in debt, owes its owners money. Early refers to seeing him and telling him about the job. law and sees advertising, later tells Adele, his girlfriend about going to California. Ely and Adele meet Brian and Carrie at the bus stop and leave town. Brian and Carrie do not know he's the killer who just killed his landlord. In a moment, Brian and Carrie thought Early and Adele were different, but they knew them and became friends. Carrie and Adele have become real good friends. Their journey is very learned. Though Brain and Carrie do not know soon, he's the killer later in the movie. The question that Brian asks in this film about the differences between murderers and us is a very good question. Ery Grayce is a sociopath who does not see the error of his way, goes downhill and pays for the price. This movie is a great movie, I give it 10/10 stars and 2 inches up. I love songs in the movie, especially at the end of the movie, the song "Look Up To the Sky" of Indians.
