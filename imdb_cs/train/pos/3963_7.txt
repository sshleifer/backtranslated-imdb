The FBI's history, as she said from a Stewart's point of view through a flashback, intertwines with his personal life story. Stewart and Miles (as his wife) are pretty good, just like Hamilton as a serious agent. The problem is that the episodic nature of the story complicates engagement. It's like watching bits and pieces of dozens of different movies when we look at who's out of gangsters. Some of the episodes are too long, some are too short and some look out of place (Stewart's daughter is a school succession). Overall, it takes too long. However, it is worthwhile to look at its nice manufacturing value.
