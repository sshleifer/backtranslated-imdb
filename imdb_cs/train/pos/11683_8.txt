I really liked this episode, which was a great surprise because of the bad reputation it seems to have gained. From a purely written view, the "16mm shrine" is absolute treatment, with the fantastic dialogue and character analysis typical of Sterling. In particular, I enjoyed the philosophical indulgence of the episode, solving the themes of existence and reality, and equating it with other psychological themes such as denial, pride and desire. The "sixteen-millimeter shrine" is an episode of how these ideas based on reluctance to accept change may seem to alienate man from the rest of the ever-changing world. It's also a fantastic example of Twilight's brain zone; which examines the mind rather than the world outside of it. These elements come together very nicely to create a thought provoking and unbelievably interesting 25 minutes. The episode is not without defects but mainly in Lupino and Leisen shoes. Paradoxically, I felt that Lupino was not convincing, with only a few scenes that could be remembered. This, of course, is absolute shame when we consider how Sterling wrote her character. Moreover, it seemed that Leisen did not know what to do with most of his characters, sometimes letting them stand alone, which is happening next to nothing - which probably explains why he took half the time of bad performances from Lupine. Fortunately, Balsam does a good job of hiding a lot of weak spots, helping to redeem the show at least in terms of acting. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, if you are a fan of classic film and brain sci-fi, this should not be as bad as it is sometimes. In addition to the writing I mentioned above, the episode also contains some fantastic photos (it still amazes me that the show looks good nearly fifty years later!) And a decent decent set-design. Overall, the "Sixteen-millimeter Sanctuary" is a great episode, and above all, it's definitely one that thinks about you.
