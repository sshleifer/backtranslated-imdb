Rated E Never owned Nintendo 64, but I have played many times. In my opinion, along with the Conkers Bad Fur Day, Super Mario 64 is one of the best video games for Nintendo 64. I played this game a lot of times and it's good every time. If you have N64 and you do not have this game, you should find it. The original Super Mario Bros games were side scrolling video games, but Super Mario 64 has 3D Mario in a nice 3D environment. The game is a bit weird, but there are plenty of things you can do in the game. You play as Super Mario and you have to rescue the princess and 120 powerful Bowzers. you can do it in a 3D environment. Super Mario 64 is a very fun and good N64 game and I recommend it. <br /> <br />
