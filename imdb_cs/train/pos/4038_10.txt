This may be the only film that really comes close to filming a film of the virtually incomprehensible world of American academic experience from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Go ahead, name another movie that is even close to this: "Getting Equal"? "RPM"? These are cartoons. The "Secaucus Seven Return" has its moments, but it is a retrospective film about (obsessed) people more than a film about time and place displayed * at this time and place. "Drive, He Said" renders - with subtleties and nuances where it should be, and a quick kick in the shorts where it is the only appropriate way - the counter-movement, the ambiguity of college sports (especially when there is war on), the sexual revolution period and general unreality of the day. Trust me, it was so. The entire cast deserves the awards (as well as the director, of course), but a special praise should be booked by Bruce Dern, a basketball coach and Karen Black's hero is very unusual - except then - loving interest. William Tepper, as a leader, also appreciates the real applause, both for the perfect capture of the student athletes of the season and for the real playing of real basketball in the movie (remember Anthony Perkins in "Tall Story" Yikes!). <br /> <br /> All in all, a classic of its kind - and the last movie anyone would write in the 6th grade ("boring", "repellent" - um, right, please go back to your movies Arnold). Why is not this movie available from imdb?
