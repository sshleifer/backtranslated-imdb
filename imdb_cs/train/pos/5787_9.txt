This episode is very dated (like most episodes of the Twilight Zone), for example a woman's incredibly sexy military "uniform". And some things are as incredible as easy access to clean water. Still, consider the year when it happened and the time, and you will quickly understand why this episode is as exceptional as you are watching. It's a pleasant feeling of hope, some of Twilight's Twilight Twilight, as well as an interesting female figure (though seldom talking), which is something else in the Twilight Zone. "Two" is a great example of how the Twilight Zone, in just 20 minutes, could pack more emotion and drama than it does in today's two hours. And it's great to see two people who have become American icons so early in their career.
