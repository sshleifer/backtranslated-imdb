"Woman in Black" is easily one of the smartest British fantastic stories ever made. A young lawyer, after arriving in a small town to deal with the property of a dead client, is haunted by a mysterious woman dressed in black. with an extremely exciting atmosphere and seizures are calculated and provide the maximum effect possible. The action keeps the viewer deeply involved and the final is quite disturbing. The effect is excellent and the stress is almost unbearable at times. So if you want to see a really scary horror movie to make it one look. It dares to watch someone "Woman in Black" alone at night with lights off. Highly recommended.10 out of 10.
