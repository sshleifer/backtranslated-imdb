I was at the same screenwriting conference and saw the movie. I thought the writer-Sue Smith-made a very clear summary of what the film was about. However, the film really did not need an explanation. I thought the themes were very clear and inspiring. A film that focuses on the ability to dare, to face fear - especially to fear passed on from parenting - and to overcome it, and thus to accept life's possibilities, is a film to be appreciated and enjoyed. I liked it much more than a lot more "Somersault". I also think Mandy62 was a little ominous to Hug Weaving. As a boy of his year I should look so good! I agree with the fact that many Australian films have recently been insignificant, but "Peaches" supply goods. I'm glad I saw it.
