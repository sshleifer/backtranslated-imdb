I'm a 53-year college professor. I went with my wife and 12-year-old daughter. We all enjoyed the movie. The film is original, funny, fast and absolutely charming. The plot was easy enough to be 10 years old, but so filmed that adults were interested. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job and the rest of the cast was cool. My only criticism is that Los Angeles sets were not as interesting as they should be. They were functional, but nothing existed. On the other hand, makeup, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and direction were excellent. Overall, I thought it was a really nice experience. I am disappointed that professional critics (almost all adult men) brutally attacked the film. They seem to have something against films that show strong, intelligent and independent young women. Their writings reveal more about their own sexist nature than about anything about this wonderful family film. I strongly recommend it to every child and all parents.
