A fascinating downer about a male cheater in New York forced to live in a convicted house with a crippled horse. Extremely cruel exploration of today's moral and social decline, extremely well controlled by John Schlesinger (who never ends his job here) and was greatly done by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. It packs together, but the "fantasy" scenes - some of which are played for laughter - are slightly disturbing, just like the "mod" drug party. The relationship that develops between the two men is sentimental, but the filmmakers are careful not to bend, and that gives the image a border that he might not have with a smaller director than Schlesinger. Originally he was X-rated in 1969 and Oscar winner for the best painting; screenwriter Waldo Salt (who adapted to James Leo Herilhy's book) and Schlesinger also won sculptures. *** 1/2 from ****
