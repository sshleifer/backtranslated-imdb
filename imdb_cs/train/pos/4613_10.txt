This movie has one of the most preserved lands I've seen. It makes me so amazing! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at what they achieved in the original Munsters series. While there was less slapstick, they still worked amazingly "comically". I ask Yvonne De Carlo, like Lily, to join the conspiracy. She showed she could make a comedy in the original series, but she was mostly useless in this movie. This movie also plays great Sid Caesar but unfortunately has no relationship with Gwynne and Lewis. I think there could be some better work out of it.
