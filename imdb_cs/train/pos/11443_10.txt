This movie is fascinating with its beauty and creativity. The deep vision of the artist, his art that intuitively stems from his natural resources, brings us inspirational Hosanna who combines his creations with trees, white water jumping on rocks, fields and rain ... Andy Goldsworthy makes the audience happy to be alive, that we are all of the clay of this wonderful country. We do not spare his occasional frustration, but we see a miracle when we enter into art with nature. Of course, the credit is also devoted to Tomáš Riedelsheimer, who directed, photographed and edited the film with incredible sensitivity and perfect timing. If you have the feeling of beauty, nature and art ... do not miss this fantastic movie!
