This movie does not happen so much, but a lot of meanings. The woman thought she had everything she could in life, but that was not true, and she found out when she met this person who was doing some research for her next job. Such films should really be more, I do not think it's as old as it is considered "mature" (im 13 by the way), and still have the idea and aim of the film. The main point is, in my opinion: I THINK THAT you can not have a better life, just because you are just this one. <br /> <br /> Although I have to admit that I was thinking about watching another movie, but after reading all the reviews and seeing the trailer I decided to do this even though I knew that so much action would appear in the movie. I recommend someone to watch this movie because it has very good points in the movie and is really a good end.
