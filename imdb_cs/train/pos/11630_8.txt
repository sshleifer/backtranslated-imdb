Red Eye is a good little thriller that can be watched on Saturday night. Intense acting, great villain and unexpected action. Some may not want to see this movie because it's a very short 85 minutes and 88% of the film is on the plane and just talking. You do not have to worry about doing a very smart and fun dialogue. PG-13 appears to be a new reason for director Wes Craven. But surely the most violence in this thriller. <br /> <br /> This is the most powerful film in his cast. This film needed good actors to give dialogue and excitement. If they did not have the actors, the movie would be lost and boring. We had Rachel McAdams of Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers. Cillian Murphy from Batman begins and 28 days later. Rounding up this cast is Brian Cox of X-Men 2. <br /> <br /> The motion in this movie was great. Just when you think it's going to be boring, they'll be thrown at you. Fortunately, it is not a long film and it does not even feel it. Much better than the other flight plan plan. <br /> <br /> Here is my note on the flight plan: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 <br /> <br /> I recommend. It's not too long and not too shabby. <br /> <br /> 8/10
