This and the "Hidden Fortress" are Kurosawa, which are the most expensive for me. I do not make 10 like candy, but it certainly deserves if nothing at all. Although it is relatively long (just like all Kurosawa it is quite), he has dealt with the problem I miss with most of his films; the story is often too loose and slowly developing, which contains scenes that are useless or too prolonged without any real purpose or description of the character. Dodesukaden gave me the same experience as "Hidden Fortress"; despite its length, there was not even one minute I'd cut off. It's also a very unusual film Kurosawa way, it does not have a story, but few independent stories that are based more on the description of the character than on the story, unlike the other Kurosawa films I have seen so far. It also relies heavily on a dialogue that works well (especially in the story between father and son planning his "new house"). <br /> <br /> Still, what makes this masterpiece work is how the subject is as tragic as it is, capable of being described so humanly and compassionately, without showing any finger at any moment. From the beginning to the end, the whole emotional range ranges from laughing to tears in perfect balance.
