I loved this movie! I'm impressed because I'm a huge Disney fan, but I really enjoyed it. Action begins at the beginning of the movie and continues on! This is a bit of a break for Disney, it does not spend much time on the character's development (my husband pointed it out) and there are no musical figures. It's a strict action adventure. I really enjoyed it and recommended it to anyone who loves Disney, whether young or older.
