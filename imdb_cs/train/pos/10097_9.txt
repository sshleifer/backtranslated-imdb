One of the first OVAs ("original video animation") I've ever bought is still one of my favorite anime titles. Cyberpunk sci-fi action comedy built against unlikely (for comedy, that is) background near future contamination in dystopian society. The "Heroes" of the Dominion are Tank Police, formed with philosophy "if we can not beat the crimes, we will have bigger weapons" and who, as the name implies, patrol the city in tanks instead of patrol vehicles and who are more dangerous than other criminals are trying to catch. Most, if not all, of these policemen are borderline (?) Psychopaths and neurotics, give new meaning to the phrase "free cannons". Equally colorful and entertaining are their opponents, the terrorist Buaku and his hench (wo) men, Twin Cat Sisters, whose existence always means giving Tank Police a tough time. Animation is not the most modern, but it's very nice otherwise; color palette and cartoon appearance of the characters and mecha fit into the comedy atmosphere of the Dominion. <br /> <br /> English dubbing is a lot of fun again. The soundtrack of the English version is also very good. I wonder if they would ever make a soundtrack album ... <br /> <br /> However, the Dominion Tank Shelf is great. It's a Japanese cyberpunk SF with a lot of comedy, filled with completely supernatural characters and situations, and making sure it's never taken seriously. Highly recommended.
