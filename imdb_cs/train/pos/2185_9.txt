Poor Basil Rathbone, an egoistic composer who has lost his muse. For some time he pretended to buy texts and music from various sources. The problem is that two of the sources (Bing Crosby's music) and (Mary Martin's words) meet and fall in love. And then they find out what they're doing. The complications result, but everything is correct at the end. <br /> <br /> Crosby and Martin are singing amazing. Mary signed the Paramount contract and doubled as regular on the Crosby's Music Hall radio show. For reasons I do not understand, the audience of the film did not join her, so she returned to Broadway and made One Touch of Venus in 1944 and stayed there. Basil Rathbone in one of the few times he played comedy, does it very well. His ego is constantly blown away by Oscar Levant's assistant, and again I am surprised that they did not make more films together. As with most Crosby Paramount cars, no big serial numbers, but I agree with the previous reviewer about the title of the melody happening as an impromptu jam session in the pawnshop. Good work for everyone. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly original plot and great fun.
