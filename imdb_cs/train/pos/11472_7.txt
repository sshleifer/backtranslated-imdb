As a fan of looking at the phenomenon of school shooting, this film was interested in this idea. It is a series of videos made by the two men (I can not mention people who kill like boys or teenagers), months of preparation leading to a zero day (codename for the day they attack), the film tries to visualize the situation on the opposite side of the weapon. It seems that the intention is to portray the pain it suffers, yet it focuses on literal preparation. The problem is that little in terms of emotions is delivered directly. The only point in which the emotions became overwhelming was the end, as expected. But until this point, it's never clear why they plan. We tell him it's ridiculous, but it seems like the film is also in contradiction. Without destroying the movie, it is easy to say that it was a great attempt and had the same intentions, but it is falling because of the careless filmmaking. All overhead is amateur to support the home video concept, but the story and continuity is weak. The film seems to want the audience to decide a lot but also did not provide information for such an event. The end is violent and does not feel like finishing all that the film has started.
