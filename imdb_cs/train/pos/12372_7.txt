Sentinel is a film my father recommended many years ago and I have seen him many times. I always have fun, even if it's really scary. Flashing scenes are what really did. Cristina Raines' father, with all the crawling movements, with two scary women, always messes up my spine. it's your typical good and bad thing, but at least it's fun. The end I consider to be one of the best in the history of horror. He has a lot of shock and strain because Burgess Meredith is doing his thing like Chazen, sitting on the edge of the seat. Sentinel has perfect tension. We are never completely satisfied whenever Allison is on the screen. We know that something awful is waiting for her, and it has made things even tense. This movie is often neglected among horror fans, but I personally think it's one of the best, and it's definitely enough for all horror fans to make their way. Performance. Cristina Raines has her wooden moments, but she has largely come. She's beautiful to look at her and her chemistry with Saranadon felt natural. Chris Sarandon is great as a friend of Michael. He had an immediate presence on the screen and I could not help him but I loved him. Martin Balsam, Jos√© Ferrer, John Carradine, Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Sylvia Miles, Deborah Raffin, Jerry Orbach, Richard Dreyfuss, Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenger all have memorable roles or small cameras. Burgess Meredith is amazing as Chazen. Looks like a normal old man, but what we find out is totally scary. Eli Wallach and Christopher Wlaken do well as annoying detectives. Beverly D'Angelo has one cool scene that they will not spoil. <br /> <br /> The ultimate line. Sentinel is an effective horror film horribly neglected by Horror fans. It will give you the excitement and the fears you need to satisfy. It's a look. <br /> <br /> 7/10
