Ok, so he borrows a bit of "It's a beautiful life," but it was 44 years before this movie, so why not a new attempt. Belu≈°i is 35th birthday. He did not get his coffee, lost his coffee and lost his job. Capper is when his car describes a "big blue sh ** piece" car breaks down at the end of the day. He enters the empty bar to ask for a lift. While waiting, the barman (Caine) is recognized as a child who lost a championship baseball game 20 years ago. It makes him think how life would be if he won the game. He finds out that Caine, when unnoticed, is giving a cup of potion to the domination of the estate, the ball queen (Russo) as his wife and makes him the president of the sports goods from which he is of the can. Caine later reveals himself as the one responsible for this change, but Belushi is not on board. He is never fully edited, and in the development of a plot that does not kill the film but is still strange, he tries to judge his wife (Hamilton) from his real life, who is now married to someone else. A good step is that it does not spend too much time because they are basically breaking off the "Ghost," while Belushi constantly tells Hamilton things she might know. It also brings a hokey dramatic element, like two of his lovers in the shadows, the new wife Russo and his unbalanced lover Cox. But the keys to the film are somewhat tedious start and a happy ending. Also good work from a large and recognizable cast, because Belushi is very sympathetic, VERY attractive ladies, and Caine is absolutely easy to go as a home guy. What's strange is that it was the second Belushi film of 1990, which dealt with the acquisition of the alternative lifestyle of wealth that appeared in "business care." Even though they are similar, both movies are at the same level of laughter. So check it out for fun exploration "What if?"
