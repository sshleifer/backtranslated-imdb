While this movie will not drop in the annals of the big cinema, it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family. The film is finally released in a video where it should debut first. The film is about an eclectic group of friends who gather for the dinner they called "The Hungry Bachelors Club." Jorja Fox plays a woman who serves as a replacement to get a deposit on the restaurant she wants to open. Bill Nunn plays a Cadillac-loving mysterious man who becomes her mistress. Fox gives an undervalued and moving performance, and Nunn is as talented as ever. Micheal des Barres is a senior lawyer. The ensembles - made up of known faces - work nicely together to bring this frantic group of characters to life. It is a good rental and one of the few that you can watch with the whole family.
