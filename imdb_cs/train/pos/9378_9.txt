It seems Dahl was under the influence of American friend Wenders. Innocent Nick Cage recruits for a hit. Dennis Hopper plays real Hitman. Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous.

Just as the forerunner mentioned above, this film has lots of drawings and turns that seem unlikely, but all of them lead to clarification of their own cathartic.
