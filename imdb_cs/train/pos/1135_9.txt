I first saw it in the cinema when it came out, and the crowd was really in a movie that made the experience even more fun. This is a great cast of characters, many of the great names in it, some of which are not as well recognized as they are now. I think it's a great idea if you watch one of these actors or love them in other movies and add them to your watchlist. Some scenes really remind me of the type of well-done comedy, like The Birdcage or even The Clue, a strange, spontaneous comedy, with some really professional delivery from these beloved actors. The movie had a great job when it gave you some surveillance, perhaps very realistic, into the daily soap culture.
