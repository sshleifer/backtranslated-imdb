Moon Child, where the Japanese rockers Hyde and Gackt played, was a better film than I expected. In fact, I was very impressed and immediately became one of my favorite films. Set in Malleppa, the story follows a group of sulfur streets, Sho, Sho is brother Shinji and Toshi who make and murder to make a living. On one of the robberies, Sho meets Kei Hyde's vampire who burns in the sun. Through cruel events, Kei's true nature is shown, but nobody avoids it. Time flows and suggests that the immortal, constantly changing Kei raised Shoa and both have an extremely close bond. Sho and Kei then meet Son in an enemy gun fight and become fast friends. Both Kei and Hyde fall in love with son Yi-Che. Time jumps forward to show adult Sho, this time empty Kei. It also explains that Sho and Son have become enemies. <br /> <br /> Through the tragedy after the tragedy, this film is immersed in the reality of life, and it is all a problem with a focus on friendship and love. It's a really moving film that is both sad and beautiful. As for acting, I think Gackt has done a great job. Hyde did a great job for the first timer. Shoots were beautiful, but the movie had it's rare and short terrible shots. Everyone in all, I have to say this movie is amazing, moving and I highly recommend it.
