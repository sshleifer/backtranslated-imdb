I was pleased to see she had black hair! I've been a fan for about 30 years and I was disgusted with two older attempts to make stories. I was pleased that the scriptwriters updated the period to include a computer, you would not lose it in any way. In fact, I watched the movie twice in a day, a sign that it is a standard. That's what I do with books that I like the same way. I thought all the characters were well-drawn and represented Blaise's early days very well, as shown in books and comic stripes. I would also have to disagree with the comment that the senior reviewer wrote about baddies having to be ugly. Did he actually read the books? I thought it was a very good movie and I look forward to continuing with the expectations.
