I thought this movie was a fascinating study of a family in crisis. When Leo, the eldest, announces that he is HIV +, the reactions of family members were mutually independent and touching each other while being strange. I have never seen a family that was physically like this; nor one of those who shouted at each other. I did not understand why the family felt that the youngest could not deal with the news but when it was difficult I found it to be a very moving film. <br /> <br />
