The Korean War was called America's Forgotten War. There were buried so many unanswered questions along with the 50,000 men who died here. Sometimes we are interested in a game or movie that deals with this distant, ghostly frozen cemetery. Here is perhaps one of the best. It's called "Sergeant Ryker". The story is about an American soldier named Sgt. Paul Ryker (Lee Marvin), who is the commanding officer selected for a secret mission. His job is to mind the North Koreans and offer their services against the armed forces of the United Nations. So successful is his packaging, proving it to the enemy invaluable and getting the rank of Major. However, he is then captured by the Americans, judged as a traitor and spy. When told to be commanded, he unfortunately taught that his commanding officer was killed and had no proof of his innocence. He is convicted and sentenced to hang. His conviction, however, is doubted by Captain Young (Bradford Dillman), his prosecutor. Convincing commander Amos Baily (Lloyd Nolan) will be given a new trial about his doubts and will be executed if found guilty. The theater in the courtroom is top-notch as well as the cast that includes Peter Graves, Murray Hamilton, and Norman Fell as Sgt. Max Winkler. Korea was far removed, but the possibility of condemning the Communists and hanging it in the 1950s very close to home. Thanks to his excellent screenplay and strong message, this track has become a classic courtroom. Excellent viewing and recommended for everyone. ****
