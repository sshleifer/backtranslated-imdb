ODD COUPLE (3+ from 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Like most people, I will always feel that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are the definitive "odd couple". Their unbelievable work on TV series from the beginning to the mid-1970s was a high-tech TV spot for television ... it easily surpassed the stage and screen versions of the story. However, how can you go wrong with Jack Lemmon / Walter Matthau? Matthau is in a particularly good form like Oscar, slob. Lemmon gets a little used to Felix, especially if you've seen Tony Randall's outstanding performance before. The script is good ... definitely Neil Simon is the best. (I notice that Neil Simon is probably one of the worst and most overrated American theater dramatists.) The story is simple: Felix, a pure bizarre and newly separated from his wife, moves with Oscar who needs to help save money for nutrition. Their living arrangements resemble a marriage that culminates in some fun cries and tips. Lots of fun and some great disposable lines.
