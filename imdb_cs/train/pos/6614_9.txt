I read that it is not good that the story is not solid that Volckman feels he has failed in some way. <br /> <br /> I do not agree. First of all, it is well done. Volckman is trying not only to try out a new technique, but to focus on what it is worth thinking about: immortality will lower the value of life? The big question ... I see it is difficult to create a feeling and not a compromise. It is pleased. I'm sure it was an interesting exercise that builds the characters in such a form. I have seen artists shrinking the form to the minimum and building the momentum of the moment. I identify this movie. <br /> <br /> It is much more interesting than the rotational focus of Richard Linklater, and Volckman's story is more important than Linklate's later stories of unnecessary drug life. Old news. Everyone knows, but no one will do anything about it. Renaissance has something to offer, something new to think. And there are plenty of other stories with lots of holes in them that far better. Well done, Volckman. Good job.
