I had an uncle who committed suicide after giving birth in Vietnam because of the mental problems he had experienced on his return. So when I saw part of the movie one night on a pay-for-view channel, I was impressed. I wanted to know what his uncle had gone through and felt when he prepared for Vietnam. I went out and rented this movie and I must say it's a movie I've ever seen. I bought the DVD immediately after the rental. The way emotionally stretches you in so many different directions is something I've never experienced with any other film. As for film films in Vietnam, I think it's best, although Platoon is second. Besides, I think he's also the best actor Colin Farrell as an actor. I like him in most movies, but he was incredible in this. I gave it 10 ratings because it's one of my top five favorite movies.
