This is a special film for me because after reviewing a nice movie from a new filmmaker (FAR OUT by Phil Mucci), another writer / director Ryan Jafri turned to me and asked me to watch and re-evaluate my film THE CURE. I do not understand movies normally, but what the hell - I like shorts and I could not wait to see another. Interestingly, when it turned out I liked THE CURE, I was not excited and let Jafri know. To his esteem, he encouraged me to re-evaluate him to appreciate him honestly. The film has a huge style, and when it comes to the direction of Jafri, it's exceptional - especially for such an inexperienced film maker (it's his first film). The combination of the exceptional possibilities of colors, steps and music that suits the film has created a great atmosphere. You were really shooting in the movie and that's the merit of the movie. A thing I did not love was one of the scriptures. While the basic idea was great, the end was too easy to predict. I really would like it to end if it was more of a surprise, or there was an unexpected procedure. However, given that this film comes from someone who would not be able to make such a professional film based on his experience, it is good for his future. Good work.
