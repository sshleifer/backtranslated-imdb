This show is worth seeing. He has the best talent I've seen for a very long time. The presumption of the show is unique and fresh (I think ABC's management is not much used because it was not another reality show). However, this show was believable with sexual characters and stunning stories. I'm probably not in the age group we expect as a show since I was 40 years old, but many of my friends also loved it (late 1930s and mid 1940s) and dying for quality shows with talented members. I do not think this show was given enough time to get the audience. I think that, given that this show would have more time, it would be very good. Again, ABC does not provide a real opportunity exhibition with a real chance. With so many exhibitions they get coincidental and not worth it! They need to give quality shows a real chance and time to actually click and get an audience. I really liked the characters and was looking forward to seeing each episode. I watch episodes on ABC videos and the show is getting better and better. Even though I think we owe another episode (number 13?). We want to watch what we can! Bombard ABC with emails and letters and see if it is possible to save this show from extinction. He certainly worked for Jerico. Some things are worth saving, and this show is definitely one of them.
