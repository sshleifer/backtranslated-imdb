The Sarah Silverman program is very similar to Sarah's own attitude; It's so over the top with prejudice that you can not take it to heart. The fact, however, is that while most people will "get" it does not mean that everyone will appreciate it. It is a very polarizing and one-dimensional show, so if you do not like it after 10 minutes, you can also give up on it. If you like it after 10 minutes, stay tuned because every episode is as good as last. <br /> <br /> Like all shows, it's not perfect. I personally like the program, but there are huge mistakes. Rascal songs are fun, but older are much faster than Silverman seems to realize - the problem I had with "Jesus is magical". It seems that Silverman has given an episode quota to an episode that does not have to exist. Not to mention that although the lyrics of the songs he writes are good, the music is not so good. <br /> <br /> Another thing to keep in mind is that while this show for some reason will appeal to fans of Monty Python, the Upright Citizens Brigade, etc., it's nothing like those shows. I can watch Monty Python all day, but as I like it, I can not watch more than half an hour at a time. It happens very quickly. Repeated value for this show is too low - the second time around the episode is quite fun, and third, in my opinion, it's boring. Yet for the first time it is very important, very funny. Try it.
