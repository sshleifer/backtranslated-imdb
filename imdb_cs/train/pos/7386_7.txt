OK, so it seems the Oscars every year a little more. And I rooted "Gosford Park" to win (come, Robert Altman has earned the Oscar for years!). I think it's high time for the African-Americans to get the best actress. Unlike the previous reviewer, Halle Berry's role in Monster's Ball was much more original than Nicole Kidman in "Moulin Rouge"; I would never think I would nominate him for anything, especially in the year when Mulholland Dr. appeared. Among the things I predicted were things about the September 11 attack; I knew they would say something about freedom. Yeah, yeah. Robert Redford should know better. But compared with previous reviewers, Whoopi Goldberg is not the worst host (Bob Hope, for whom I have no respect); I really liked her apple tree with John Ashcroft. So, even if I did not make the best film "A Beautiful Mind," the "74th Annual Academic Awards" still pleased me (I have to admit, I like the Oscars more than my own birthday). And the day after we and my parents walked around the dwelling in Bandalier, New Mexico - that was a spring break - I thought about myself that when Jim Broadbent won his Oscar, most people were asking "Jim who?" "I wonder if Woody Allen does not take part in the Oscars again and again.
