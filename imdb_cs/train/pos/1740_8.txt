This film was not very popular in Greece, although he had good actors, a great screenplay, and rather good photos were not in my country the so-called "blockbuster." The film itself is very strong, it's a difficult time for a newcomer to go through when he returns to his home village after being released from prison (medication) by the end of 5 years. The end is somewhat sad ... Mourikis tries to keep up with his part and treats it pretty well ... Lambropoulou is great and very sexy strange and of course Hatzisavvas is once again close to perfection ... 7 of 10 because only few Greek films make such an impression!
