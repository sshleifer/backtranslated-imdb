People forget that there were several King Kong ripoffs - Congo, King Kong Vs. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), all of them diverge, but YETI stands alone. It lends only one element from King Kong, and that's the attraction of the animal with one woman. The YETI myth is based on Bigfoot (not as King Kong) and archaeologists have been fascinated, but at the same time there is no scientific evidence to prove it. This movie is hard to find, but it's worth watching. For the first time in the early eighties, I watched it be on Elvir's Lady's Dark Shots. She sent me the flu like a baby, especially when YETI was crazy. I saw it again, about 1:00 in ABC about 2 to 3yrs. When I saw it again, it made me more awards, it has some good overall effects (for my time) and the story includes a mute boy and his dog and a bad trader who wants to kill YETI for his own purposes. Also, the music is pretty cool, it's very YETI like. :-) <br /> <br /> Gianfranco Parolini and Yetians create a great monster atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Vote 7 and half out of 10.
