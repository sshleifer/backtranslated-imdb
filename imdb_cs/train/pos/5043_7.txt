Very promising directorial debut for Bill Paxton. Very Dark Thriller / Who-Really-Done-It's Recommended by Stephen King. This is a powerful, well-drafted horrible story about the pious but demented man in Thurman, Texas, who goes after the murderous spree after he has been ordered by God to remove the demons who are trying to conquer humanity. A few plot conspiracies and an amazing final make your money worth. Most violence you do not really see, but it's enough to double your stomach. Director Paxton plays a twisted man who is to be known as the Assassin's Hand. Matthew McConaughey is as impressive as the oldest son of the most popular man who finally tells the story to Dallas FBI (Powers Boothe). Boothe, as always, is solid and flawless. Miraculous white clutch! Highly recommended.
