Liam Neeson portrays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century. He's a real actor. It enchants viewers with their charisma as they do in all their roles. Jessica Lange is excellent as his wife, Mary. Marie is such a beautiful woman. It's her love that makes Rob the legend, but it's his passion that makes her love immobile. They need each other. Tim Roth as the evil Cunningham is perfect; anyway, when you look at the movie, you find Cunningham disgusting. Scotland's scenery is beautiful. The environment and weather conditions are shown quite well. If you love history, romance, passion and love, you will enjoy Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but it is inevitable to tell this story as it should be said; no gratuitous violence. And you will have to listen carefully if you are not accustomed to the Scottish accent. One important point that makes this film so good is that no actor or actress is enchanted; are dirty and in fact they look uninteresting in different scenes. It's their skill as actors that attract you, do not rely on names of markers, popularity or sex appeal symbol. That's special.
