This movie is huge for the resurrection of spirits. Every time I look at it, I see and hear fun things I missed before. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is incredible. Mick Jones (Alien) and Chris Difford (Squeeze) have written songs, so Strange Fruit is the best thing ever to hit today's music scene. Unfortunately, Strange Fruit is a strictly fictional flushing of the 1960s and 1970s, from which it has never been a good start, because of drug use and internal fighting. One is wondering what might be, and listening to their fanatist soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Fruit draws inspiration from The Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, David Bowie and The Who. <br /> <br /> A member of the fruit is completely unforgettable. Stephen Rea star as dead and broken Tony Costello, who is asked by the promoter of the festival to unite his group for a reunion tour, with the hope of earning money. Costello is approaching Karen Knowles' ex-roadie starring Juliet Aubrey to help him recover the flame of a long past. <br /> <br /> Juliet assembles bitter Jimmy Nail (Les Wickes), who inadvertently Timothy Spall David 'Beano' Baggot) and extravagantly glamourous Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Another ex-silk is the swinging hockey player Hughie (Billy Connolly), who never let the flame burn. When Julie searches for the latest members of her colorful band, elusive guitarist and songwriter Brian Lovell (played by Bruce Robinson), the assembled members quarrel, as well as the old times, fighting against the horny talent of each one of us. <br /> <br /> The band then has a small Dutch tour to prepare for the festival. With young Hendrix's Luke Shand (Hanse Matheson), who has taken Lovell, the crew will hit the road. Sparks fly as their memories flames forward, threatening to burn their unfinished goals ... Be prepared to laugh, sing, cheer and cry because these memorable characters etch back to your hearts ...
