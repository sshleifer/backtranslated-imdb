I love and admire Farrells brothers! How come I saw that great movie just three years after his release? That made me laugh, wept and my heart was warm. Big time. It's hard to describe in my spoiled English - but I have to try it: <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent all over the world - from the lead to the supporting roles, the acting is great, the dialogues are great and the film is perfectly directed and edited. I think Farrelly's brothers' films are often underestimated - they are not light comedies - they are deeeeeep! She talks about what life is about (I will not tell you!) <br /> <br /> In my case, this film confirmed what it is about. <br /> <br /> You love someone: free them, let them - try to share passion and pain and always get to know each other. <br /> <br /> I am not sportingly hateful but definitely sporty unconscious. But in this movie - vibrations will get you. I felt the atmosphere of baseball. Finally, this film explained to me what a fan of a sports fan can be for you, and what fancy fan family must be out there. <br /> <br /> Thanks a lot, Pete & Bob! <br /> <br /> PS: If you have not seen them - please look at KINGPIN!
