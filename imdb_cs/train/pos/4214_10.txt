Best of the seven Sam Fuller films I've seen (including Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Verboten !, Shock Corridor, Naked Kiss, The Big Red One and this movie), Pickup on South Street counts as one of the best movie noir. It represents Fuller in his most inspected. I like him when he's out of control, of course, but almost everything in Pickup is perfect. The movie is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark star as a pocket that stole a microfilm that was designed for communist spies. Jean Peters plays a woman who wore a film for her boyfriend played by Richard Kiley. Peters is forced to find Widmark and get him back. He finds it through the dove, played by Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters are attracted to each other, which changes Peter's loyalty (that is, learning to work for the Communists, Cold War stuff is really interesting). The love story happens a bit fast and is not entirely believable, but it's not that bad that it damages the movie (unlike Fuller's previous movie Park Row). Richard Widmark is great. That must be one of his best roles, but I'm not so familiar with his career that I can definitely say that. Thelma Ritter gives the most memorable performance. Her role gives the film unexpected emotional resonance, and her last scene in this movie is as touching as everyone in the cinema. I'll never forget it. 10/10.
