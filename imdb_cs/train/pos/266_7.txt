This story has never been among my favorites in Christie's works, so I was pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed this adaptation. The butterfly mouse was effective, if a little thought, there are bones of the story, although more emphasis is placed on the subculture "crime in the past". The students were all the same as I imagined, though it is a shame they are not a cosmopolitan group - perhaps the revision of the thirtieth revisions did not allow it! I thought that there were so many courageous risks in the shootings. perhaps because I did not read the book for a long time, but it seemed to me that it was obvious who was a killer of their appearance in some exposed shots soon. <br /> <br /> Humor was much wider in these early Poirots. Sometimes it works, but in this episode I found a lot of the fact that I was very hard on this episode (although I smiled on the line "Lemon sole"). Overall, however, a solid entry into the series, though not one of the best.
