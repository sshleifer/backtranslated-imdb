I really enjoyed this film and returned within a week and saw it twice more. <br /> <br /> Detmers learned the performance - she was like a hungry cat on a corner playing with her prey. She tried to get angry and lust, took a "too young" lover, and crushed hundreds of her mother's small porcelain pots on the ground. <br /> <br /> The film was full of beautiful touches. Maserati, a beautiful wardrobe, flower boxes along the roof. I especially enjoyed the ancient Greek class and the recitation "Antigone". She felt "The Story of O" -that means that people who have the means of committing an unconditional sexual adventure. When walking around a fantastic flat in buff, it's fine - and why not what is to limit the "devil in the body"? The whole movie is a real experience!
