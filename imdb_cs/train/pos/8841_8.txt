"Before you know that you are dead, it's one of the best movies I've seen for a long time." "Philip Seymour Hoffman will perform incredibly well and is electrifying every time he's on the screen." Ethan Hawke the scene is a scene, and Albert Finney just chews the screen, but Marisa Tomei is not critically exploited, but she looks amazing for her for 42 years, the script is excellent, the story is linear, but unpretentious, Sidney Lumet, though not known for his barracks, jewel with this!
