They had me from the first show. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Trinity County. A sleepy little place like Mayberry with one slight difference. The sheriff is really a satan. There's a spoiler. No, as if you did not notice it in 10 minutes. Oh, but that's not all. It turns out that Satan has a son named Caleb. Some people try to keep him well, but it's a desperate battle. Sheriff Buck (Satan) knows who is Caleb and likes to spend time teaching him the way of darkness. Subtle. Captious. He does not always look like evil. Mostly he is a hero. Everybody owes him a great favor because he often causes misfortune and protects them. So every time you think someone is finally taking off, one of his friends will come out of nothing to be tamed. <br /> <br /> In one of my favorite episodes, Lucas and Caleb were in the cabin in the forest, and some guys with their weapons decided to rob them. Lucas used it as an excuse for Caleb to teach the lesson of evil. <br /> <br /> The robber (Ted) hesitated to shoot them. Lucas told Caleb that Ted was half conscientious. If he had no conscience, he would shoot them now. If he had a real conscience, he would never become a criminal. So he called him Half-Ted. It was quite funny. He was a criminal. And of course he stayed 10 steps ahead of HalfTed all the time. And, of course, he was totally under control. In fact, you preferred Satan. <br /> <br /> Very good show. it was one of my favorite horror performances of all time. Twilight Zone Night Stalker Circle of Fear American Gothic Supernatural <br /> <br /> This is a good company.
