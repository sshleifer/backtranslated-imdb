Let me get to the bottom line here: I have 3 children aged 5 to 10. I think the way to the theater is successful when there are no talking animals. I've seen most videos of our children in our collection at least 72 times. I can tell you when the movie gets in the Sorcerer from Oz, in the sexual joke in El Dorado, and in the tragic flaw with the end of Rudolf the Red Nose. I could not just tell the story Nemo out of memory. What made me support one of my baby (that is different) that suggests this title for a family movie night? Word: Sprch√°k. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span>
