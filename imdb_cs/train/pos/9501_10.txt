I saw this movie when it was released and when I was 12 years old :) And I still remember the beautiful scenes as a hero / heroine escapes each time they face danger :) And the best feature of the movie was portrayal! I think many so-called action movies copied from this movie a lot of "escape scenes"! And not only that I will never do it when I see such a copy, it still increases my recognition for this masterpiece! :) The leading actors were beautiful. The slow and realistic development of chemistry without a hero and a heroine was extremely natural and beautifully portrayed. As children, we felt the love they developed was very natural :) The way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations is something that can help children realize the value of true love, sacrifice and care. I recommend that everyone see this movie when they get a chance! --Vijay.
