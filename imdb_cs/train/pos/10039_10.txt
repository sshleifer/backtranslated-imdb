Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this film did not have a solid ten, overall in IMDb users rating. Perhaps, it's just great that I do not give Titanic credit today, but when it was the first time, it was really something. When the movie appeared, people got to the theaters. When my sister came out on the video and I watched her twice a month for the whole month. It was certain we were obsessed and for good reason. Some of the catastrophic scenarios were hard to forget, like a frozen child or a guy who committed suicide after killing someone in an unfair crowd. Many people have died on this ship, and putting it on the film with the immediacy and emotion they needed is a difficult challenge James Cameron has raised. And do not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose. Whatever their relationship was a false idea to someone, it was beautiful. They barely knew each other, but they would have died each other. They trusted each other. Certainly hell give Romeo and Juliet their money. "I'll never leave, Jack." Titanic is a great movie that is very important. It's a powerful story told through brilliant acting, excellent cinematography, beautiful music, and a crew full of hard and devoted workers. It really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie.
