The best film of Modesta Blaise I've seen so far. It's like a good pilot for a TV series. I even think it's a bit of a "cult" as if it could easily touch the magic of Quentin Tarantino or something like that. They captured Modesta's great character, but I confess I skipped Willy Garwin a little. Even though I read many comics and Peter O'Donnell's book, I'm not disappointed in this film, on the contrary. The positive surprise of this story of Modesty and her childhood. I have kept my expectations so high because of the bad film of 1966. So maybe I would have a little overdone. But if you like comics and other stories about Modesta Blaise, you should definitely see this! can not wait for the next ...
