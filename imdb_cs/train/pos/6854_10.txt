The intelligent, stylish and convincing thriller from the brilliant Brian De Palma is a modern classic that is definitely one of its best movies! When a troubled homewoman is brutally murdered by a stranger, the son of the victim joins a prostitute to expose the murderer. <br /> <br /> Dressed for Kill left a strong impression on viewers of their day and for good reason. De Palma creates a beautifully dramatic story that begins with an interesting arrangement and builds into a horrifying mystery full of intense tension. Finals and finals are especially "nightmares". It's the real edge of your fucking seat. The more elegant direction of De Palma, which adds to this film not only tense tension but also a unique and dark atmosphere, is even more impressive. Dressed to Kill is also a very erotic film, but especially strangely beautiful. Pino Donaggio also adds a beautiful musical score to the movie. Cast is another strong feature of this film. Michael Cain makes a wonderful change as a psychiatrist. Angie Dickenson is amazing as an unhappy housewife. Nancy Allen's performance as an entangled street-walker is solid. Young Keith Gordon also appears to be a good supporter as an investigating son. Many criticize De Palma for having the features of Hitchcock, and this film was no exception. But any similarity between the works of Hitchcocks and De Palmas can only be seen as a good quality, because calling this film as a "rip-off" would rather be humiliated in a gentle thriller. Kill-dressed is essential for all film fans. <br /> <br /> **** of ****
