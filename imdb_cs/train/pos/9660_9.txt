It was only after some contemplation that I decided that I liked this film. And after reading the comments of all the other posters and thinking about it even more, I decided I liked it very much. I love American movies - probably because they are so telling. They usually have a well-defined beginning, middle and end. "Presque rien", on the other hand, makes no such attempt. I disagree with other posters that say it's "too artistic." In any case, this film is meant to evoke your sensual memories. So often in the movie you feel like you're there ... you feel the summer sun, breeze, warmth, winter cold, society, loneliness, etc. Atd. <br /> <br /> In any case, the director takes you into the lives of the characters - that's why so many people feel so strongly that the film is disappointed. After watching her perfectly, I felt the same. But after some consideration, I realized that this movie had to be: "the story" is not a story, it's the emotions that you (the viewer) feel. The lighting, scenery, and camera angles immerse you in scenes - they are rich, beautiful and vibrant with details and nuances. Although normally I can not capture movies without a fully developed plot (after all, it's not a story-telling film), this movie is definitely one of my new favorites.
