HOLES is not your average Disney thing - it's very, very entertaining, even for adults who usually collect in a cute, thoughtful group of "family fun" that the studio from Uncle Waltse goes through live action. Perhaps the secret of the success of this movie is its loyalty to the original book, which is a bit darker than your average child's stuff. The action begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to a prison camp for boys, where all prisoners are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of retrieval. But as the story progresses, Stanley's story blends with a reputable treasure, and this adventure is ten times more entertaining than any Disney movie about an all-powerful prison camp has a right to be. Jon Voight is especially ugly and varied, and Sigourney Weaver is beautiful, as always.
