In panic in the streets, Richard Widmark plays a Doctor of the US Navy, who has been brutally interrupted by a dead body containing a plague. As a policeman Paul Douglas rightly points out that the boy died with two balls in his chest. It is not a problem here, they both become reluctant partners in trying to find killers and someone else who is exposed to illness. <br /> <br /> As pointed out by any number of people, for some reason, director Elia Kazan did not bother to think of small parts with someone who would look like they were from Louisiana. When I was in New Orleans where the story takes place, I can personally confirm it. Richard Widmark and his wife, Barbara Bel Geddes, can be justified because a naval doctor might be there, but for those natives it does not work. But with the infection there and the secrets secret, the New Orleans PD launches the claw of the underworld of the city. The dead man came from a ship from Europe and had connections to the underworld. New Orleans wise guy Jack Palance jumps into a number of misconceptions and begins to harass the cousin of a dead man who begins to show plague symptoms. Palance gained deep reviews in the first movie where he received the announcement. <br /> <br /> Personally my favorite in this movie is Zero Mostel. It happened just before Mostel was on a black list and around that time he specialized in acting would be tough guys who are really parents. He plays the same role in Humphrey Bogart The Enforcer. Unfortunately, I can identify with Moselle in the last scene where Palance is chasing Widmark, Douglas and half the New Orleans police. Seeing the weight attack Zero tried to keep up with Palance was something else because I'm in the Zero League at the League Department. <br /> <br /> Kazan kept the action on a good clip, there is very little down time in this movie. If it were less, it would be Indiana Jones' film. Panic In The Streets won Oscar for Best Original Screenplay this year. Kazan also used the New Orleans embankment and the French Quarter. Some of the same types of shots are later used in the embankment. In fact, Panic In The Streets is about people who do not care when they really have their own interest. Very similar is again on the waterfront. <br /> <br /> Panic In The Streets makes every proud person connected with him. Now why could not Elia Kazan get a decent New Orleans that sounded like small roles.
