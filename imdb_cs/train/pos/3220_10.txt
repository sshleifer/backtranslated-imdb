Soldier does not have to have acting academies or special effects Lucas, but he definitely does it for me. I will not tell you what it is, I'm sure you read the summary. It's a great intentional futuristic action / sci-fi movie. Kurt Russell does not say much, usually he has a scary or drone on his face, but that suits him. There are great events and combat scenes; some scenes are unrealistic, but Hollywood believes the country that we should escape our normal life. I did not see Soldier 2, but this is one of my favorites. I'm so lucky I have a woman who digs up guy movies; we both love this movie and we recommend it to anyone who likes hard boys / sci-fi movies.
