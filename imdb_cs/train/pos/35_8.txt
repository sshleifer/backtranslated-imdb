When I saw a complicated DVD box for this dreadful Red Queen, I felt certain I was great disappointment, but surprise, surprise, I loved it. A shortened nonsense, of course, and unforgivable, that such a complicated farewell should be rushed to a point where it would hardly be able to read subtitles, let alone be a ridiculous explanation. These pieces differ from each other, but the movie is a dream. Fabulous ladies in beautiful suits in beautiful surroundings and the whole thing that is constantly moving and accompanies Bruno Nicolai's magnificent score. Maybe it's not Morricone, but it could be in those lighter bits. Really pleasing with lots of colors, lots of sexuality, few killings, and minimal police intervention. Super.
