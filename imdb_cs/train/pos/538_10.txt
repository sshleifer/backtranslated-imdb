Go back to the lake cabin is perhaps one of the few sequels that can live up to the original one. She had black humor, good suspicion, nice looking girls and, of course, a psychic killer. What are we lacking? I don 't think anything. Besides, we left with a small amount of gore and nudity because it was made for television. Besides being one of the best successors, he is one of the best thrillers to watch as a family. Recommended for everyone.
