A very well-shot film in the early 1960s of Communist Yugoslavia. Five young actors, who are teenagers at the heart of the story, give a strong, honest and emotionally deep performance. A clear picture of how natural native confidence and naivety can be easily manipulated and how it affected the rest of their lives. Highly recommended.
