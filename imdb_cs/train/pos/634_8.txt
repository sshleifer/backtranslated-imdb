I was one of about 200 people who were lucky to see how this film was intermittent. Stardust follows Tristan's young man on the way to find the fallen star and bring her back to the woman he loves to bring her love to her. The only task is that the star fell on the other side of the wall, the door between England and the magic kingdom known as Stormhold. This movie was just a joy to watch, has something in it for all, all the action scenes are playing beautifully and the comedy is scattered throughout the movie making it funny without being furious. If I had to compare a similar movie to another movie, it should probably be The Princess Bride, a classic. All performances are excellent, beautiful Claire Danes will pick you up in her imagination about Yvaine's trusting naive star and under rated Michelle Pfeiffer brings the star over top performer like Larnia ... but the performance you are talking about is Robert De Niro ... In every the scene he has in his hand steals the show ... <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a fun fantasy love story, it's a movie. Boys do not get off with the description that there is enough action comedy, not to mention a lot of eye candy with Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer to have fun all the time. Cinematography is dead and preserves the feeling of the film ... nothing in the film seems to be forced.
