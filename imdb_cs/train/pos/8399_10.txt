Love Trap is not short, it's a feature-length feature-length full-length feature film with a running time of 105 minutes. <br /> <br /> While writing this, I can also talk a bit about Love Trap. I often ask what Love Trap does differently ... so I answer this question: 1) It features signs - especially - that have never been seen in film, period. <br /> <br /> 2) Reveals more truth about love and delves deeper into the concept of love than any other American film he has ever done, in my humble opinion. 3) Structurally, as in the way the story is narrated, it's unlike any love story you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 4) Offers a very timely insight into various cultural issues, both within and within the Black Community. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> With time, people come to love Trap as a completely original work that can be at this time, beautifully refreshing, authentic and honest. This is a rare moral game full of thoughts. <br /> <br /> Visit www.lovetrapmovie.com to find complete and accurate information about this movie.
