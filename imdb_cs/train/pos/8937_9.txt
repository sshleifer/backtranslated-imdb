This was a good example of how an interesting film can be made without the use of big stars and great effects. Just tell the true story of the struggle of two African American women in a turbulent century. This movie invites us to look at our personal prejudices and see that people are people, not white, black, etc. <br /> <br /> A good movie with good news.
