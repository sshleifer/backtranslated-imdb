Wendigo is a pretty good psychological thriller, the movie has some great drama between characters and some good scary scenes. The game is good, characters behave like a normal family. Wendigo's effects are good, Deer's form reminded me a little of the Rabbit in Donnie Darko. The film sees the family staying for a while in the house but accidentally struck a deer, a group of hunters arrives and one of the hunters named Otis begins to argue with Father George, leaving the car to the house. Son Miles shuddered a little about the deer, but his parents were trying to say that it was natural for such things to happen. That night when he's in bed, he's starting to see some special stuff in the bedroom, the next day they go to town and Miles meets the man on the counter giving him a small statue of Wendigo when Miles shows Kim's statue and tells her that the man on the counter gave him the owner says he works only there. As soon as George returns home, he takes his son to sledding, and when they are sunk, he is betrayed from the deck and Miles is chased by the wind, after a gathering they seek George, they find him behind the house where he tells them he was shot. Hospital Kim tells the sheriff that Otis may have shot him, Shrieff goes to Otis' place where he hammered over his head while Otis heads down the road and finds out that Wendigo is after him. <br /> <br /> Wendigo is a pretty good thriller that has a cool time. Look at this. 10/10
