They just saw the Australian premiere of the Xizhao show at the Sydney Film Festival. Program notes say it was - Perfect joy - made, touching, fun, dramatic and meaningful. I could not agree more. I just hope the rest of the festival films come to this level of entertainment, and I look forward to the fact that other Chinese films will be held in Sydney in the coming months.
