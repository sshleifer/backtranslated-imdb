Orson Welles "The Lady From Shanghai" does not have a brilliant "Citizen Kane" screenplay, such as Charles Lawton Jr. Cinematography, unforgettable scenery (such as the aquarium scene, Rita Hayworth's nautical scene, a stunning blonde singer " and the wonderful amazing culmination of the Mirror Forces) and the beautiful cast (Everett Sloane in his best performance, Welles in a beautifully incomplete role, the above-mentioned Miss Hayworth - wife of Weller at the time - on her most beautiful) will make a very unforgettable movie experience. The bizarre mysterious murder plot is fun and convincing, not at all impartial. The viewer is surprised by the twists and turns and Welles' closing line is an endless classic. The "Lady of Shanghai" will receive four stars from this impartial arbiter.
