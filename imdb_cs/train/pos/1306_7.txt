Extremely straightforward shareholder who played an actor and shot a director who apparently took the material seriously. Imperfect, as you can expect from a movie that is clearly filmed on a tight budget, but the drama includes - it's one of the movies that when you repeat the ad at Cinemax 2 or More Max, or whatever they say, you end up watching roughly 40 minutes blocks when you're about to work. Together with W / "Deathstalker 2", "Chopping Mall" and "The Assault" reminds that Wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his low-budget colleagues who have a true ability to pace the genre film when they really care about the material (Mancuso, Ford, even Gary Sandy for chrissakes) have really put everything in their best roles in years - what do you mean? Grieco has a good look, although his acting is a bit of a note - it is clear that his character should be self-destructive throughout the film, but Grieco does not quite say it. I checked the IMDB and I see that the writer also wrote "Sorority House Massacre 2" and "Dinosaur Island" for the director - both minority classics in their own rights but of course "stupid" like Cinema like Roger Cormon - some better Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Kaplan B-seasons of the seventies - which gives you an exploitation element, but it also offers drama - a real step forward. Not "Citizen Kane" and comedy final moments are a bit disturbing but well written, a supernatural supernatural shareholder with direct access to the video. Small successes like this should not be overlooked when they arrive, which is quite rare (as I reminded myself when I tried to sit Albert's pyramid monstrosity called "Heatseeker" last night - these cheap things are not as they look - but that's another story!)
