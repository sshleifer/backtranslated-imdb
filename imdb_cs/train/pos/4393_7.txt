Ang Lee obviously likes to ease the film, capture action, characters and build on the hoof as they appear. Covering the accidental end of the American Civil War through the random action of a young militia, unformed in mind or masculinity, is an ideal approach. The film appears to be the formation of personalities, adulthood and relationships. Lee also shows gorgeous mid-south panoramas as silent characters, lasting conflict as a perennial parent. James Schamus' script is probably the standard bearer of this film; there are many well-known performances that admire him. Only the name of Jeffrey Wright could have the movie for me. There is a great but slowly burning role: instead, we were treated with very good (not-obvious) performances from a large, often recognizable set. A noble, optimistic film. Be careful if you do not think of a harder, hot-rolled Cold Mountain or claim. 7/10
