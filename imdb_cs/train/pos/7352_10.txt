This was my first introduction to the Bollywood world and I am now addicted! Well, it takes a different mind to watch American movies, but once you have the pleasure of enjoying yourself for what it is, you will not be disappointed. The songs are excellent, melodic and very catchy. Actors are visually convincing especially Karisma Kapoor, who is certainly one of the most beautiful actresses anywhere in the world of film. Location, color is magical. If you want something different and want to be uplifted, encouraged and encouraged, I suggest you capture this film.
