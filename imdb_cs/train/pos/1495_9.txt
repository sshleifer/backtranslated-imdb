This is an amazing amorous horror drama with 3 great stories and fantastic performances! Only disappoint the last story. All the characters are amazing and the movie is quite cool and thrilling, plus Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are just amazing in this! It's very underestimated and my favorite story must be the third "Sweets To The Sweet", plus all the characters are very sympathetic. Some of them are predictable, and the last story was incredibly disappointing and quite faint! However, the end was really great! This is the amazing amicus horror anthology, with three great stories and fantastic performances, only the last story disappoints! I say it must be seen! "1. Story (" Method for Murder ") This is an amazing story of great tension, and Dominik is really terrible and is also very good at acting!" This was the perfect way to start the story, and it was unpredictable , plus double curvature ends shocking and quite spooky! <br /> <br /> 2. Story ("Panoptikum") This is a solid story all around, with wonderful performances, but the end is quite predictable, but it's still creepy and tense, Peter Cushing did a terrific job and I could not believe how young Joss Ackland was, I really liked this story! Grade B <br /> <br /> 3rd story ("Sweets to the Sweet. "This is the best story here because it's extremely scary and unpredictable in its entirety but also has a nice twist!" Christopher Lee did a great job and Chloe Franks did a great job as a young daughter and onec is quite shocking! I do not want to pamper you, but it's one of the best horror stories I've ever seen! Grade A + <br /> <br /> 4th story ("Cloak"). It's a terrible story that is really weak and unfortunate Jon Pertwee has upset me, but I was a bit surprised and Ingrid Pitt was great as always, but it's just boring and it's been done a lot, plus where was the creativity? Grade D <br /> <br /> Direction is great! Peter Duffell does a great job here with amazing camera work, great angles, adding some scary atmosphere and keeping the movie in a very fast pace. <br /> <br /> The efficiency is amazing! John Bryans is great here as a narrator, he had some great links, I just wished he had more time on the screen. John Bennett is very good as a Det., And he was quite intense, he was especially good at the end!, I enjoyed a lot. Denholm Elliott is great as Charles, he was vulnerable, showed fear, was very sympathetic, and I loved his facial expressions, he swung! Joanna Dunham is incredibly beautiful! And she did a great job to do as a wife, she also had a great chemistry with Denholm Elliott! Tom Adams is unbelievably creepy as Dominic, he was spooky looking and got his job extremely well! Peter Cushing is amazing as always, and there is amazing that he is sympathetic, focused, charming, and as always has a class tone! (Cushing's rules !!). Joss Ackland is always fantastic and he looked so young, I barely knew him, his accent was not so dense and he played a different role I loved! (Ackland Rules). Wolfe Morris is scary and he did what he had to do well. Christopher Lee is amazing as always, and he's amazing here, he's incredibly intense, very focused, and as always he's had a huge, intense look on his face, he was especially amazing at the end! (Lee rules !!). Chloe Franks is adorable as a daughter, she's a little scary and she gave one of the best baby shows I've ever seen !, I loved her. Nyree Dawn Porter is beautiful and was excellent as a patrolman, I liked a lot! Jon Pertwee was tormented by me, and he was totally insignificant and completely unhappy; he had no chemistry with Ingrid Pitt. Ingrid Pitt is beautiful and makes her the usual vampire thing and does it well! <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is doing well. Overall you have to see! **** of 5
