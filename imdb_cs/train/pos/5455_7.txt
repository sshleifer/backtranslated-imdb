The infamous pre-code movie, really the movie that caused people to insist that Hayes's law was strictly enforced. Barbara Stanwyck plays as a young girl whose father, who sells alcohol, has no problem exporting her to customers. When she dies in an accident, she is released into the world with the knowledge that her bloody body can get her what she wants. She went to New York and continued climbing the corporate ladder, one bed at a time. Though apparently there is no real sex, the film is quite dirty. Unfortunately, after the initial value of the shock disappears (the whole time Stanwyck screws up the railway wagon inspector to travel for free), the film becomes repetitive and boring. Stanwyck alone is the only thing that keeps the movie in the sitting. As always, it's fantastic.
