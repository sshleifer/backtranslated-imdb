The endless limits of our inhumanity to our own kind will never disappoint me. This truly amazing story of the terribly abused and largely unheard of population is convincing, well documented and enraged. As an American I am constantly humiliated by the behavior of my country and it is just another in our long catalog of international humiliation. We were screaming. That's probably the first John Pilger document I've seen, but I wanted to see what he's done. My only complaint and the reason I gave this film only 8 out of 10 is that Pilger shows us this travestor and the shocking cooperation of the United States government and the United Kingdom demands that our viewers / citizens be complicit in our own inactivity. but does not provide any suggestion how to help. I do not know about Britain, but the Americans made it almost impossible for the citizens to take part in their government. A gesture in the right direction could help these islands.
