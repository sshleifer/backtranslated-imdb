I voted for 10 out of 10 simply because it's the best animated story I've ever seen. Animation is stunning. The artwork behind every country was beautiful. From color to illumination to the unusual art of art. I was amazed. Overlapping beauty on the screen, you are immersed in a story that is both timeless and fresh at the same time. Character development is short, but these torque moments are exactly what is needed to make the viewer feel what and why and how the figure gets where it stands. I'm amazed at the whole thing and I think it must be seen for the whole family.
