Keep in mind that I'm a fan of this genre, but you first saw this movie for the first time. As I have overlooked all this time, it is a miracle for me. For me, it's a better movie, then a very praised "High Noon". He is a great western with a great actor and a great story. The DVD is beautifully black and white with excellent cinematography. If you love Westerns or James Stewart, do not miss this movie.
