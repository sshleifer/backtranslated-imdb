The first one was good and original. I was not a bad horror / comedy movie. So I heard it was the other one and I had to watch her. What this film is doing is Judd Nelson's character and sometimes a clever screenplay. A pretty good script for a person who wrote films about the final destination and direction was fine. Sometimes there are scenes where it looks like it is shot using a home-camera with a grainy look. It's been a rental and probably worth buying, just to get that nice exciting feeling and watch Stanley Judd Nelson, who does what he does best. I suggest newcomers to look at the first before looking at the sequel, just having an idea of ​​what Stanley is and getting a little history.
