I have rented the movie (I do not think it has a theatrical release here) and it is even worse. Thumbnails made the movie look terrible. I was really very surprised, she was very attentive; it was free scripting, almost like a movie set. She had some very entertaining moments inside her, and although she was a faint satir on the show and the people on the show without being too fragile. It's flawed, and it's a terrible soundtrack of the effects of "comedy," but overall appears to be a frank and generally true form of show in Almanac or Larry Sanders. when fashion is critical to Jerry Springer is also an easy target. Springer could have made Citizen Kane and would have been declared "the worst film ever to make". I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the show. Bad but innovative and interesting movie.
