At first I enjoyed this film. It all worked. However, I do not understand the notes I hear from people about surprises. I did not know anything about this movie, except for some "get-see" recommendations, but I knew where the plot was going in ten minutes. (I will not mention what I thought to destroy a good film for others.) Still, I still seemed self-evident and I was still looking. It was nice to see how everything was done, to fill in the details and the nature of motivations in the later stages. <br /> <br /> I do not have to hate it when I think it ended early in the movie. I hate it only when the way to the resolution will be lined with boring scenery. <br /> <br /> Will Smith's persona screen is simply sympathetic, even though he plays such a restless figure. He is energetic and trustworthy in everything I've seen. Seven pounds is another great performance. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson is a solid artist who displays an unpredictable, somewhat optimistic character despite the end heart conditions. Beauty is in the eyes of the viewer and Rosario, if you do not find it beautiful, you should think about replacing your eyes. It was nice to see Woody Harrelson back on the screen. I have not seen him much lately, but it could be just me. Woody did not have a huge amount of time on the screen, but he sold his merry, piano, blind characters for what's worth. Excellent. <br /> <br /> In short, the research of the medulla meduza tells me that the poison is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic. I think it's a controversial choice for both pet and conspiracy. Overall, I have to recommend this film not for rendering, but for some very good performances and the fact that it tends to trigger some of the tragic feelings we generally try to avoid.
