Paris, is t'aime (2006) is a film composed of 18 segments. You can do it in mathematics - 18 segments in 120 minutes means that each director has seven minutes to tell the story. The film is based on the premise that you can really tell the story in this short time. The premise works. Almost all segments are strong, complete, and satisfying. Each of them presents another aspect of Parisian experience and almost every director gains excellent performances from the cast of great and almost great actors. In this movie, there were so many strong portraits that it's hard to pick one or two favorites. Probably the most memorable for me was Juliette Binoche as a sad mother in the "Place des Victoires" segment, Gena Rowlands as an old beauty in "Quartier Latin", Catalina Sandino Moreno as a servant in the Loin du 16ème segment and Margo Martindale as a carrier in Colorado he learned to speak French in order to visit Paris (segment "14ème Arrondissement"). <br /> <br /> A special mention must be made to Gulliver Heck, probably the smallest boy who has ever bothered an American tourist at the Tuileries subway station in Paris. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie. My wife and I chose to rent it in a couple of months to capture some of the gentle points we've certainly missed. However, Paris is so beautiful that I would recommend you to see it on the big screen. In any case, do not miss it!
