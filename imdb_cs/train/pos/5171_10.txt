If I could come back, even as an adult, and live again the days of my Year spent in the camp ... I would have been there so fast. The camps I went to were not so great. They were in Texas, where mosquitoes actually brought people, but we had horses and fishing. Film cinematography was stunning, characters are funny and believable, especially Perkins, Pollack and Arkin. Sam Raimi's character and subantitics were invaluable. So who thought this movie was lame ... I have deep regret because they can not stop their distrust so much that they can imagine life in the camp again as an adult, or they never went as children. The whole question was that these people had the opportunity to regress and become young again, doing so at all occasions. I wish I could. It was funny, intelligent, beautifully scripted, brilliantly occupied, and the art takes me back to look again and again just for the scenery. Sorta like Tance with Wolves and LadyHawk ... good movies, but the wilderness becomes a character just like actors. Lose it, check it out, buy it and watch it over and over again and again ... you will never get hold of it. ; 0)
