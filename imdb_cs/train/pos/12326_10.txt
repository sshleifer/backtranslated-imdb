I first saw this movie at the Berlin Film Festival, and before that I had never seen Hong Kong cinemas. I felt sitting in a roller coaster: the action was so fast and there was no boring moment throughout the movie. It has martial arts, love, special effects and fantastic land. My favorite scene is when a taoist drinks, sings and fights for himself - one of the many scenes that emphasize the extraordinary musical component of the film. This film is a must!
