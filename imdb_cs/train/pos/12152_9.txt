I just saw this movie on HBO and it was really good ... a tragic love story really! I really realized that the man had lost his legs in the heart of the story in an accident. It is rare to see a love story that involves someone who is physically handicapped. The love that developed between the character and the woman who came into his life developed quite well, as I would like to think that love can heal one's heart. Laura Leighton ... all 27 when she shot this movie ... she was great as a woman so full of life that she could revive this man's heart. Unfortunately, because his family is rich and not her, it is not a "problem". <br /> <br /> It's played on HBO several times this month.
