Unlike the Tinseltown version of HELLO, DOLLY !, Jay Presson Allen Adaptation Screen Ira Levin's hit Broadway thriller could not wait for it to be a stage incarnation to the shutter before putting on the silver screen so the producers wisely decided that as much as possible is the lengthy White Way running! The film opening and closing scenes are shot at the in-theater Music Box in New York, where DEATHTRAP has been playing for almost five years. Even the last fadeout of the movie on the stage mark is a version of the famous logo of the scene. (Although the marketers chose the funny icon of Rubik's Cube) <br /> <br /> Now on an affordable DVD release, DEATHTRAP looks as fresh and inventive as ever. The cast is right (better than their scripts) and the guys should be pleased to find a suitably haunted house for our "one room, two action thrillers" to be held. Open in a surprisingly simple and innovative way, director Sidney Lumet wisely describes any "new" material at the beginning and end of the film and leaves Levin's dirty center alone. The last scene of the film is the main Hollywood departure from the boards and slightly undermines one of Levin's plot shows from an earlier movie [Helga (about a dagger): "Another woman will play because she plays."] Just like Robert Altman THE PLAYER, our new finale helps the movie fall back on itself and blur the boundaries between the scene, the canvas and (is it?) Real life!
