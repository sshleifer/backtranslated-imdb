What a great jewel. It's an unusual story that's fun. Yes, he has a singing, but he is very nicely processed in the story and is very melodic to hear. It was nice to watch; I liked it from start to finish! The film takes place in England during the Second World War. It is a disciplic witch who is looking for the missing part of the spell she needs. She uses her rough "spell" to bring her and her three children under her care to various destinations to find her. They are joined by a correspondent teacher who is surprised that the lesson from his school really works! <br /> <br /> Although it seems to you that the special effects first dated a bit, once you get used to them, they become part of the magic of this movie. The film actually won Oscar for these effects! <br /> <br /> The film is innocent and fun - and it's hard not to like melodic songs. The characters are very interesting to watch. I think someone at any age can find something they might like about this movie.
