Halloween is one of the best examples of independent film. It is very well made and has more psychological features than you would at first sight realize. It's a simple movie very well. Music is perfect and is one of the most exciting scenarios ... If you have not seen this movie yet, you have to look. The cast is amazing. I wish that the follow-up failed. The first one was by far the best and should end as it did without a sequel. It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. She did not seem to be old (she is just as beautiful today without having hairstyles and seventy clothes). Mask scenes are one of the most awesome things!
