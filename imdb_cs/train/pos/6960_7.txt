The desperate boy tries to hit the beautiful girl on the bus. He rejects him, but when he runs for someone trying to steal his purse, they also meet. And it begins - a relationship that is a bit marked by the fact that he is a jealous and neurotic superhero. It can not be a secret that there will be a problem between them. <br /> <br /> In short, a story that could promise to grow into a great movie. And IMO, it succeeds in being a nice movie. It's not a masterpiece, but it was in my tears when I laughed more than one occasion - the two leading figures are rotating each other in a crazy love that is, even when the superhero is going on, believable. <br /> <br /> So. A thin story, but it worked really fun and so good cinema. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 broken hearts
