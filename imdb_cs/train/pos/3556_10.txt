Oh, it's such a beautiful musical. There's a little miscasting - Frank Sinatra is as crazy as the Jewish Nathan Detroit, although it only appears on "Sue Me", a clearly Jewish song. The filmmakers have decided to release one of the best songs from the show, "Marry the Man Today" and replace it with a bad Sinatra. With these two flaws, the film is otherwise wonderful. Jean Simmons shines like Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando can not sing the beans at a price, but he'll pull it off. Stubby Kaye rewrites his role in Broadway (wrote for him). Damon Runyon is language and movement and humor. This is on my list "see-it-every chance".
