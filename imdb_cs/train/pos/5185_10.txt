I watched this movie over 100 times and I love it every time I watch it. Yes, it can be very furious, but it is also very fun and enjoyable. The campsite featured in the movie is a real camp I've been visiting for over 7 years, a real camp, a great place to spend the summer. Anyone who ever went to camp wanted to go to the camp or sent a child to the camp, he would have seen this movie because he would bring you wonderful memories of you and your children.
