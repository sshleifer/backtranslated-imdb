This "tragicomedy" written by the famous Serbian theater / film writer Dusan Kovacce is probably one of the best films ever made in the comedy category. And yet his appearance of the play, transformed into a feature film, has no value. The masterpiece should not be missing (preferably with subtitles, not nicknamed). On an old bus on the way to the capital of Belgrade, he decides how the war is waging a passenger. Two Gypsy musicians sing their miserable lives, but they also assume that tragedy will come; their singing splits and connects the scenes in this extraordinary road movie (real life Kostic brothers are amateur actors, but together with Stanoj Milinkovič as a farmer who is plowing on the road, gives real performance). The character's spectrum gives the brilliant idea of ​​a society facing the war, insight into collective nationality: everyone realizes that war is just beginning, but trying to live its own life as best as possible, hoping ignorance can avert the tragedy. Using a simple film language, director Slobodan Sijan draws a picture of the society that had been dissolved by the previous wars (World War I), but also successfully portrays personal portraits: singer province, inexperience of newly married couples, the honor of a veteran of the Great War who is on the way to his recent visit a detained son and gloomy predictions from a man who seems to be a German spy. Brilliant in his narrative, with an unforgettable soundtrack (especially Gisps songs) and a modified atmosphere, well (Sijan's feature debut) was only an introduction to a series of directors of hot-sweet comedies that will define Serbian cinema of the 1980s: "Maratonci trce pocasni krug" "Like a Systematic Unist of the Idiot" and favorite of another director "Davitelj protiv davitelja").
