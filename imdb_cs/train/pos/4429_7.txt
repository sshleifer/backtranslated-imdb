Personally, I thought the movie was pretty good, and Tadanobu Asano was very good at Ichi the Killer glory. I really can not tell the story about it, but there were parts that made me a little confused and overall I thought the movie was too tedious. In addition, the film contained great acting great fighting and many places were beautifully shot, great effects and lots of swords. Another solid effort of Tadanoba Asano, in my opinion. Well, I can not really say about the movie anymore, but if you only look at Asian cinema, it's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or House of Flying Daggers, I suggest you try to rent it, a tough Asian film fan I'd say it must be in your collection a very good Japanese film.
