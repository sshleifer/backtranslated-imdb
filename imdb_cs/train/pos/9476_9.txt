For romance, like a married man. The following two movies are recommended. <br /> <br /> 1. A brief encounter with David Lean (1945) in Great Britain <br /> <br /> Well, when a woman goes to the railway station, something can happen. And it happened! How she wanted to be there, in a small pub that was waiting for the men of her dreams. But she was married ... that man was a stranger to a fantastic woman. <br /> <br /> 2. Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun by Fei Mu (1948) in China <br /> <br /> Well, when a woman goes to market to buy fish, food and medicine, she walks through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town, there is much to think about, the melancholy of her life, her sick husband in self-confidence and the lack of a future ... Just when a young doctor arrived, who was cheering, something happened ... the doctor was a middle honey fantastic woman < <br /> <br /> In both films, from the great directors of Great Britain and China, passion and restraint were so intense, but in the end, the intimate feelings did not become in any physical contact. This leaves you with a great taste, intensely sniffing it without biting it.
