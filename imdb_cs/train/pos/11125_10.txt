What can you say about a show of this size? "Soprano" has literally predefined television as we know it. Broke all rules and set new standards for excellent television quality. Everything is flawless, writing, directing and above all me, acting. When watching this show, you will find that these characters are NOT real. You play tricks that you think he is a real Tony Soprano or any character. This show is also very versatile. Some people do not watch the show because it's violent, it's not all about violence, it's about business, family, and many deeper things that depend on what you, as the fan sees. For me, I do not like people to show, mafia shows. For me, it's a family show. A family that has become a separate crowd for generations. Overall, it is the masterpiece of the show. That's what TV should be like. Right here. Comprehensive characters from stunning acting, wonderful stories from brilliant writing, and what do you get when you combine these ingredients? An example that defines perfection and dares to be different.
