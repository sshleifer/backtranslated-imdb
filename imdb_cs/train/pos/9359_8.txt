The feeling of this movie was amazing. Adam Sandler's performance was very inspirational. As he played a very fragmented and fragile character, he took his ability at the very edge and really did a role. His character was really interesting. I see that I read the screenplay of this film and that I was not interested in the part Sandler did to me. For someone who plays a comedic role in particular, he took a serious role with what seemed to be his own taste and admission. Especially I loved the scene where the characters of Adam and Don were passing a motorized scooter around the city. I knew it for a moment because Don seemed to see one thing Adam was doing to get away from it all. With his video games, music and many other things to help him think about the past, riding a scooter with his headphones, he looked like an escape from his thoughts. This film is definitely worth watching.
