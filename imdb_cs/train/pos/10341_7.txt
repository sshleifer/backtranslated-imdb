A true screaming sitcom in the mid-1970s this movie was a huge hit for about 5 minutes and disappeared from the face of the earth. I am constantly surprised by some comedic films, which are one week of great redundancy and then disappear: HIGH ANXIETY, SIMPLE DETECTOR, BLACK PIRATE, DO NOT EXPOSE NOW THAT ARE LOVED IN ......... and you have no profile today. NORMAN was a comedy of the moon in 1976, and it seemed that everyone was seeing it, laughing about it, and never ever mentioned it. Famous that he was shot on a videotape and transferred to a film, at that time an experiment, NORMAN is a nasty, politically incorrect wardrobe that slames a farce that Farrells brothers should look for a remake today. If they did this in the first place, there would be no complaints about their content or inclination. It's very fun and YES very rough and funny. Just as it should be. Actually, as a playable 1976 film, all these horrible colors and dresses are really better today.
