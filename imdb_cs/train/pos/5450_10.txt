Barbara Stanwyck plays Lily Powers. She's a waitress for father's quarrel in a small muddy city. He also sells it to men. He runs to New York and literally sleeps to the top. <br /> <br /> Originally, I only saw a 71-minute version, but it's quite extreme - for my time. Nowadays it is quite tame. The film moves very fast and has a lot of sexual moods. Some of them are becoming nice today (but fun). It moves so fast you can easily ignore that most of it will never happen - not even in 1933. There is nothing classic or monumental - it's just a fast, joyfully dirty little movie that's a lot of fun. It breaks down at the end with only a little "moral" end demanded by the censors. It sounds like incredible and stupid (I saw it in the theater and the audience laughed at him - one person rightly said "There is no"). I have just seen an uninterrupted 75-minute version that has a different, somewhat tragic and much better end. This version was considered lost until 2004, when it was discovered by mistake! I believe this is the only one in the release - but be aware of it. <br /> <br /> Actor is good - Stanwyck jumps into her role and plays it upstairs. She believes she likes to be cruel and asleep. There are also strong supportive performances from handsome Donald Cook and George Brent. Look also at the performer John Wayne, who is cheerful as a gentle and mild office worker! Fun, dirty and fast. I give it 9.
