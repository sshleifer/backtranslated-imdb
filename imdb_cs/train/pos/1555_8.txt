After seeing Madeleine Lily (1969) on television show Julie Andrews this afternoon, I saw a rather obscure spy thriller from WW1, suddenly I thought I saw a much better spy thriller from WW1. All I remembered was that it was produced by Dino De Laurentis. She briefly scanned the IMDB and found Fraule Doctor. As soon as I knew the title, the memories were floating back. It's a fairly well-created story for your time that rotates around real events such as the death of Kitchener and the 1918 German offensive. It also has a spy that is much more believable than Julie Andrews! As with other reviewers, the first and strongest memories of well-made combat scenes and of men and horses in gas masks were. If you are interested in war films and especially WW1, it's a movie that's worth seeing if you have an opportunity.
