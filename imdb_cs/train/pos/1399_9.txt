This is one of the most horrifying episodes in that the plot really looked like an excuse when you just enjoy it. But I appreciated this conscientious approach and this is really one of the best episodes that is on a purely fun level. Think about it - crew members meet with a white rabbit and Alenka of Wonderland, a Bengal tiger, a samurai warrior, a horse knight who kills McCoy and a host of other seemingly bizarre events that just do not make any sense at all until the end. Despite all the dangers, you can not take everything seriously - it's just fun and the whole episode seems very unreal. So at a purely non-static level it's a great thing.
