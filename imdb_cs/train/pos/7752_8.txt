The bartender just wanted to make a movie because he wanted it. Just as well, he succeeded. Not only in its goal, but also in creating a wonderful film, especially visually. He knows how to use beautiful, smooth ways to use the pelvis, slow succession, watching shots, crane shots, etc. This gives the film a very pleasant feeling. The story is about the lives of 8 very different characters that have nothing in common except one thing: the party they all visit, which is also the turnpoint of this film. The beauty of this image is not the question of how the characters have an effect on themselves (compared to a similar, of course, better film than Magnolia). I just do not think it was the Barman idea. Beauty is based on the various details of the experiences people experience that cause or break their lives. The bartender is very successful in telling those little stories that describe insignificant experiences. He knows people ... and Antwerp. The soundtrack of the film is also excellent, but it is no surprise, as we know that the Barman is also a very successful composer and musician with his band dEUS. Music is sometimes hot and relaxing, which contributes to the sun's, smooth feel of the movie. Otherwise we will hear funky pop / rock melodies that give some scenes the power they need. <br /> <br /> There's only one mistake, and it's the last half hour. Was it the run that broke me? Or was it not the last scene that was fresh and accurate than the scenes until then? I can not figure it out ... <br /> <br /> A beautiful sunny film, which will raise Belgian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> the breeze that carries the perfume of that beautiful girl who sits next to you in the park you just met a week ago, it's a breeze .....) <br /> <br />
