I was looking at the film today and it just snapped my mind. It's a true masterpiece of art and I do not understand why most people think it's garbage. The main idea of ​​the movie - take your ego away and then you will have the real strength! It was the main battle at the end of the movie, and Guy Ritchie showed it magnificently. "The greatest enemy is hiding in the last place you ever look like" - do you remember it from the movie? Because our real enemy is in us - it's our ego ... That voice that always tells us that we are important, it gives us our pride that tells us not to, but only to take it, it creates our aggression wants to dominate, creates all negative feelings and thoughts. GR has expressed this idea incredibly and has shown that the only way to get true control is when you lose control and you leave your personal importance. Excellent movie!
