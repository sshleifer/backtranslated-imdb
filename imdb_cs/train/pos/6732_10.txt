That was the best document I've ever seen! I just saw the gentlemen of Dogtown and wanted to know more about Stacy Peralta and was surprised and satisfied when I found out that it was one of his films. Great work by Stacy! I was last week to work at work, bore O * & ^% less and this movie appeared. I grew up in Orange County in the eighties when I was surfing up and down the local beaches and my daddy as a teenager. I grew up on the beach, my parents took me every weekend, surfed my body, got on board and then moved. This film just captivated me. It was much earlier than mine, but it was amazing to see what these men went through ... TRUE PIONEERS! This movie is a collection of collectors.
