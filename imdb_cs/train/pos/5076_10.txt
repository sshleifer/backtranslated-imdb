It's almost five years since the release of this stylish action flick.I watched this movie almost 10 times and it's a great effort Gautham.From my point of view, I feel that this movie is virtually flawless. Surya as ACP Anbuchelvan - Undoubtedly .. class. Jyotika played her role very well. The character suits her very well. The character capturing the attention of the filmmakers was Pandia. Jejvan played the role of Pandie very well. Brother and Fear .Jeevan deserved the Best Villain Award in the ITFA 2004 category. Support for the occupation of Daniel Balaji, Devadharshini and others performed well. An amazing script, perfectly timed dialogues and a brilliant tale by Gautham. Harris Jeyaraj are all gramophones, while BGM throws the film very well. The cinematography by RD Rajasekhar is rich. Peter Hein choreographed the pieces well. Anthony's editing is accurate. Kaakha Kaakha is the perfect cop movie full of the right benefits of action and romance. Even a Hollywood superhero film compete with Kaakha Kaakha ... no doubt.
