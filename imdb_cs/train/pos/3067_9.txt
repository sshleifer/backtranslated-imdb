What a surprising treatment will come upon late television. If I just read a short plot before appearing on the TV, I would have gone through it. The idea of ​​a film about hit-man-seeing-shrink-want-let-the-business-and-falling-in-love .... It sounds trite. But the movie works. Since the beginning of the movie, it is clear that the man has a weight on his shoulder before even telling the word. The movie looks and is perfect. darkness, but not so obnoxious. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In addition to the family aspect of hit-mana, which adds a touch of surrealism, Macy's character behaves with his marriage and his father. Macy shows suppressed sadness and interviews with his young son are amazing. The young boy shows his acting skills far beyond his years, and the interaction between father and son is so natural, personal and loving. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I can not believe I came to her on a nightclub accident.
