In the introductory scenarios of this film, one fired through a hotel room into another man's bathroom and tossed all the lights. It had to be very hectic for 1936, but rather a way out and had nothing to do with the movie, Robin Hood did not appear as far as I could see. However, Bette Davis (Daisey Appleby), "The Whales of August", "87 was very young and attractive and played one of her best roles in her long career in Hollywood." Daisey never stopped working on her yacht with George Brent Jones), "Spiral Staircase," "46" became very sexy with her nightgowns and so-called Swim Suit. "Daisey even suggested marrying Johnny in the Ferris Wheel upside down and even black eyes." Davis and Brent made a great pair, one he was supposed to be very rich and the second very bad reporter Davis and Brent had a real stormy love out of reality, which is a good reason why sparks came in. If you like Bette Davis and George Brent, that's the movie for you!
