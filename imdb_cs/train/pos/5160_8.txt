Dr. McCoy and Mr. Spock find themselves trapped in an ice planet in the past, while Captain Kirk is in the colonial period of the same planet. However, she is a former couple who has the most demanding time. In addition to the frigid temperatures and shrines found only in caves, there is a third resident, beautiful and so sexy Zarabeth (Mariette Hartley). When Spock spends more time at this time, he slowly begins to return to the patterns of his ancestors' behavior, to feel the natural attraction to Zarabet, and the "gently wind" to ever leave this place. With McCoy's uninterrupted "remarks", Spock can handle reality. This attitude is one of the few when the character appears to have some "emotions" and Nimoy (Spock) plays it on the handle, approaching the knocking beheesis of Deforest Kelly (McCoy). Surprisingly on the previous installment, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) did not have the opportunity to get the girl, another advantage for this. Permanent "old man" Ian Wolfe examines the role of "Mr. Atozo," the librarian responsible for sending the trio to the past.
