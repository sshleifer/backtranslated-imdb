It was an excellent 2-episode episode, though I never saw the elders, I never thought the doctor would go against everything that is paranormal, extra tertiary, of course, but not paranormal. <br /> <br /> The episode brings the things we are most afraid of and how we humans fight in the futuristic time and beat the real live evil when most chances say it would be impossible. Because it is a family film, I am surprised to have brought some things like fear and faith, especially if it would have been entertaining the American audience. But who cares about what Yanks says is rock! The Doctor, who has shown his potential since the new series since 2005, is so innocuous from scary, entertaining and serious, from light to dark. I hope many old fans will one day soon tell "Old Doctor Returning". <br /> <br /> 10 of 10
