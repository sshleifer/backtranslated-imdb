I've always been a huge fan of "Murder: Living on the Streets," so when I heard that a movie with a reunion was coming, I could not wait. Let me just say he was not disappointed at all. It was one of the most powerful 2 hours of the television I've ever seen. It was great to see each other again, but the greatest delight of all was that Andre Braugher was back because the relationship between Pembleton and Baylis was always the strongest part of the great show.
