Another channel 4 is greatly prepared long before time is up. Convincing acting by Phil Davis and the rest of the cast. Sexy, smart and fun. I remember how I looked at it at that moment, and even when she asked, nobody ever heard about it. But trying to find someone who can remember it is even harder. Perhaps Channel 4 did not do his job well enough by drumming the necessary enthusiasm. Either it or the general public has too much interest in vomiting the TV that is Big Brother. I have a clue. Downloading Garth Merengie's Dark Place invited Channel 4 to release the DVD of this series. Let's hope this can happen to the North Square.
