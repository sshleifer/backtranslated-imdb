DOCTEUR PETIOT, headed by Michel Serrault, is a brutal story about a brutal man. A doctor who treats sick in occupied France, even though their ability to compensate is not there. Still, it behaves most in the population. Pictures and cinematography are excellent and add to this complicated story another macabre. He is the perfect psychopath. Aquatic and altruistic, intelligent and caring, computational and murderous. A sure film that the viewer will soon not forget. Kudos to Mr. Serrault for his cold display.
