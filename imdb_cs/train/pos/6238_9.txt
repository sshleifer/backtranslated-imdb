The uncompromising view of the 21st century suburb of Vienna, which blends stories of six character groups with former documentary filmmaker U.Seidl, is a provocative, minimalist and intense piece of observation cinema. Following a worldwide expansion from the Big Brother reality show, Hundstage takes modern wolves to a disturbing and deep level. The hard-hitting but irreplaceable work of the European art cinema may seem cruel and frantic, yet it can still show a nihilistic, alienated, feeling of modern society in a praiseworthy manner. Must for lovers of world cinema.
