It could have been better if it was driven by someone with more experience. Shumlin did not do a bad job, but it's not a great piece of film art. But it's a beautiful movie. I loved it because the local channels showed it. Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century. Some pretty bad films were made from his novels and stories. (Many people love "The Fallen Idol," but I'm not in. I think I've seen "Brighton Rock" many years ago and I liked it, but maybe I just thought of the novel.) That's great. Charles Boyer is not, of course, in Spanish. It seems, however, that he has a perfect temperament for this character - tired, careful, careful. Lauren Bacall is attractive as a British girl who belongs to him. But the supporting players are the best: Katina Paxinou is excellent. Her performance is a little Grand Guignol, but that's what I've attributed to the director. Peter Lorre, whom we first encounter when giving Boyer a lesson in Esperanto, is excellent - as always. And Wanda Hendrix could break the hardest heart. It seems like a premature young teenager. The character wants to be useful. She does the best. I recommend this movie highly. Not without reservations. The reservation is primarily that it is a little cramped. But the story and acting can hardly improve.
