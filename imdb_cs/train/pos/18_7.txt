'Stanley and Iris' is a movie that warms hearts, two people helping each other and helping them overcome their problems in life. Stanley's life is difficult because he has never learned to read or write. Iris is a widow with two teenage kids working in a bakery where he meets Stanley. He decides to teach Stanley how to read his home in his spare time. Over time, they are romantically involved. After Stanley learned to read, he went to good work in Chicago just to return to the Iris and asked her to marry him. It's a really good movie without nudity, violence or fury, which is rare in today's movies. A good movie everywhere. <br /> <br />
