If you love Sci-Fi, Monsters and Ancient Legends, then you will love this movie! <br /> <br /> Special effects are by far the best I've ever seen since Juarassic Park hit the big screen years ago. While acting may have been a little less than desirable, the story line and its effects were adequately compensated. I wish I could see it in movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inches If you like non-stop action, amazing visuals and the taste of myth and tradition ... you have to see this movie!
