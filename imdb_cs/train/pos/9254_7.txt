no film with dennis magazine, gary busey, erika eleniak, tom berenger, dean stockwell, marilu henner deserve rating under 5 years. This is a bad mans version of the movies as 16 blocks or a timeless run at midnight except the prisoner who is transported here is very easy on Eleniak's eye. Tom Berenger plays another adorable soldier military type, and William McNamara plays his novice - to eliminate the film. The act on the face is absurd because I lost the number of times Eleniak had and could have run away, but it's a fun movie that's fun, and all the above-mentioned actors who keep the film moving are good cameras. It's not really a family movie, because there's some talent and a rare nude scene with a sparkle but it's a lot better than some of the other manga that came out this time.
