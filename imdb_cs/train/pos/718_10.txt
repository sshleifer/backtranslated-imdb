Rock 'n' Roll High School was one of the best movies ever made! I think the only reason why it was so amazing was because of The Ramones! You could not make the same movie and put something like Sex Pistols or The Clash instead of The Ramones, it just would not be the same. dey young, Clint Howard, Vincent Van Patten, Mary Woronov, Paul Bartel and the Monters Hall, just added to the film. The entire movie is about The Ramones ... especially Joey! So everyone saw seeing Rock 'n' Roll High School if your big fan of the real PUNK. Not even the unfortunate new crap ... but a loud and fast sort. Only Ramones could do it. R.I.P (Rest in Peace) Joey Ramone 1951-2001. Dee Dee Ramone 1952-2002!
