There is no doubt that the Ealing comedy is good, but for me this film is one of the best. The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered part of Burgundy, not the United Kingdom. Then we follow the lives of the people in their struggle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes and avoid black traders who soon realize they are exempt from British law and there is no proportionality. When they become prisoners in their own street, because the government has decided to close the guard, we see that they are afraid of the system. <br /> <br /> They are forced to give water and food to their stand for what is right. In fact, they get worse than before everything started, there's morality. It's when they lose all the food they think they are defeated, and they ask for surrender, just to make the entire London react to their situation by sending food is a lot. This will allow them to continue their struggle. This film hit is the right story, the acting is wonderful, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren. It's right, not too sentimental, and the moral of the story that did not go down the throat. It's worth viewing
