I gave the movie 8 out of 10, booked 10 for example Amadeus and 9 for the Slumdog Millionaire last. This film is close to the Slumdog, but it is hard to judge such a film without understanding the Balkan life, mentality and soul that Kusturica presents masterfully. To understand this, you really must be one of the Balkans. It is an amazing film, much better and more contemporary than its previous films, which are currently boring, I think Kusturica is moving forward with this film. I like humor (Balkan humor), photography is art in its own right, every scene is artistic to the end. The story is probably a fairy tale, I do not remember it, but do not forget to read my daughter - to go to sleep like a story.
