Made by the French brothers Jules and Giddeon Naude and narrated by Robert De Nirom and Hasic James Hanlon, it is a compelling and heartbreaking story about how the best day of New York is on the darkest day. I first saw it when I was a young 12 year old naive and at that time touched me. Knowing how seriously 9/11 really saw it spread the full effect of 9/11. We found out who the heroes were, how they composed everyday lives, and how they put their lives together in a situation where most people would just run away and save themselves. These courageous men have put their lives in line, and I was looking at it only increases my admiration. Watch out if you can, it's the best document I've ever seen.
