I'm myself from a small town in Illinois, I can immediately connect to this movie. Because that happened, the burghers look as uncomfortable as many people I grew up with. Yes, the conspiracy is so-so. And yes, acting will not soon be nominated for an Oscar. But that's no reason. The goal is to suspend reality and simply have FUN. And this movie has great fun. From a greedy, ruthless banker to a meaningful but confused deputy, this film was shot to talk to the SciFi genre and a small town living in the best. Who can not smile looking at Enforcer Drone or Vern Droid? and I loved FarmZoid. I wish I had one when I grew up. Overall, due to the technology that was available at the time, it's a nice step into the childhood when you can sit on Saturday afternoon, popcorn in hand, and laugh at the rising city housing. It's a movie I would watch again and again, if I had no other reason than to have fun with myself and a small town.
