Since I have not seen all the films released in 2002, I can not say it's the best film of the year. I can say it's the best movie I've seen all year. <br /> <br /> Most American films with black people either obsess over American interest in "racial relations," or fall into the clich√© of the ghetto of the inner city, with every sterotype imagining that the ebenic phrasal slang spreads. Antwone Fisher stands proudly alone in this respect: race is irrelevant, with the exception of one fight that may or may not be caused by racial annoyance. The story of Antwon Fisher is the one to find resonance with every empathic person. He is inconspicuously and thoughtfully portrayed by Derek Luke. Denzel Washington, who apparently uses his starring power to film, is mostly in the background and allows the film to be a story of Anthony Fisher. <br /> <br /> At a time when BET and popular culture generally want to preserve the ghettoization of a large number of Americans (and Canadians, you know), it is a film that speaks to humanity in all of us. I just hope that the black audience will see this film for this humanity rather than avoid it because they feel that there are no characters or actors in the movie they can identify with. That would be a sad comment on racial relations in North America on its own. <br /> <br />
