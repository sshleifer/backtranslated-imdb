I can only agree with the taximeter that it's a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience. Fantasy on the screen, visual interpretation of the script, humor is always surprising. The two wires are great and they actually carry the film. My advice would not even be watching a trailer, just borrowing a movie and watching without expectation. I was chased away, so it's easily accessible in Brisbane, not everyone will like it, but I think most people will have an opinion and it's always good if it's not just "that was stupid." I loved this movie, you just can not see gems like this everyday. This should become a favorite cult. Try it, you can feel the same way like me.
