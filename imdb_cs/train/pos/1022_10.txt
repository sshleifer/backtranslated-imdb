Stargate is the best show ever. All actors are perfectly perfect for the role. I love the connection between the characters. If you have not seen this show I highly recommend. Although this program is compared with Star Trek a lot of time it can not actually be, because it is quite different. I'm a star trek fan, but I would definitely rate this show over any star trek. Unfortunately I live in New Zealand and we will not have Stargate on TV, so if I want to see, I have to buy a DVD and the season 10 is not here so I can not see it for a while (which is highly depressing). However, this program is very good and needs to be seen, but note that it is very addictive. So in the summer I love Stargate (and Amanda Tapping).
