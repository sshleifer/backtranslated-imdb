Tian's remake is not good at all. I just click on his remake documentary to see Wei Wei, the original actress back in the 1948 classical movie that says a few words to the crew. We will meet Wei Wei this Sunday (March 28, 2010) after Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun's performance in Hong Kong Film Archie. Wei Wei is almost 90 years old in silver hair, her portrait in Hong Kong is always a surprise for fans. This year's Hong Kong specializes in the Fei Mu program, the director of this epic film and Wei Wei, still shot by the film, is seen all over Hong Kong. My son, who is growing up this year, is surprised that Wei Wei was so beautiful.
