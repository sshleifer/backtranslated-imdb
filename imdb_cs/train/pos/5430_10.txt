Of all the British imperialist films, such as Four Feathers, for example, Charge of the Light Brigade, this film excels as a crop cream. It reflects the period when "the Sun never fell into the British Empire." Transfers over it. I will not go to why, because so many others have expressed many reasons why this movie is great. I visited the Alabama Hills and photographed the passage through which the British marched and remained as it was, unchanged by time and interference of man and vandals. And although I know it's coming, Din finds dead on the stretcher and when those lines are read <br /> <br /> "Yes, Din! Din! Din! You Lazarushian skin Gunga Din! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> me, Gunga Din "<br /> <br /> I still have misty eyes at the age of 54 and anyone who says they are not, is a liar. The range of emotions in it is a sign of a great movie. Like the end of another great movie Mice and Men.
