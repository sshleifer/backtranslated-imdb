Although I was too young to remember the first show of the show (to be a child), I later rehearsed it in TV in the late 1980s, just as I was interested in the war and all its aspects. He was my grandfather who first showed me a series and also gave me his first interests relating to the stories of his time in the Royal Navy in Malta and later in the Pacific. Since then, I have used many books and have seen many television series of World War II with mixed views. British TV stations are generally very good at producing, as World At War can easily confirm, with many gems made by both the BBC and independent companies. I strongly recommend such titles as "Nazis - Warning of History", "Blitz" and the BBC series about Dunkirk. "Britain in War in Color", with its accompanying series "Japan", "Germany" and "America" ​​are very high standards. World War is by far the best, and despite age, it never succeeds. There will always be new revelations about the war that will continue the revival, which of course are not included in the series and of course the Second World War took place over such a large screen that it would take more time and money to create a series with every detail, if such a commitment was even possible. What I feel like I have to say to those who say it does not include everything is that the World in War can not physically do it as a series, but it is certain because heck can call you for further research - and make it pleasant. It certainly worked for me: now I have a very large library of books, videos, DVDs and tapes and CDs. Recommend anybody who is even interested. The series has been so well done that it's hard not to agree that it's high-quality programming and highly informative.
