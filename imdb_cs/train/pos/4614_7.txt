This movie is ridiculous! That's exactly what I like about this "Guilty Pleasure". It is easy to condemn this film for not including Pather and Butch Patrick, the original Marilyn and Eddie. But look at the year and do math. Pat Priest and Butch Patrick have grown up! Time makes young stars. Yvonne De Carlo, who chose her role as Lili, pushed Big 6-0 (although she still looked good and was still perfect "Lili"). It is a pity that Yvonne De Carlo did not get much of it. Still, it was good to see Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis in roles that are so famous! During the two seasons when the MUNTIES were in prime time, it was Gwynne / Lewis chemistry that made the series such a success. The rest of the cast supported the cast members, not to say they were not needed. They were! The TV series would not survive until it was without them. Due to the choice between Butch Patrick or Happy Derman (the original "Eddie"), the choice was too easy. Yvonne De Carlo was also a better choice than Joan Marshall. Though this film is not going to the original TV series, it is still good and is one of the better "reunuin" TV specials that plagued the ring tube during the late seventies and early 80s. <br /> <br />
