This movie is as good as it's hard to find. The hero of the film (and the writer and director) is Simon Geist - a man with a program. He creates a fake magazine just to have the power to talk to Los Angeles pigs - actors, models, musicians - who believe they do not feel their own exhale. With a smart dialogue, Zucovic will succeed. Sure, the budget for this movie was probably what you paid for a used car, but this movie is so solid and so well written that it works very well. Any person who can refresh "The Scream" of Edward Munk in a refinement of silver trashbin at a local caf√© should be nominated for some kind of awards. Give this movie a chance and listen to what it says ... because they have been producing the same car since 1986 ... it's called the "car". Bravo, Zucovic, bravo!
