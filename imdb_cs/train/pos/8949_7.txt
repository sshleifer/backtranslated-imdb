Vertigo co-stars Stewart (in his last turn as a romantic lead) and Novak is uplifting, Stewart's next movie, "Christmas Movie", which is hidden above the middle entertainment. Chemistry between these two stars leads to a relatively moving experience and another revelation can be revealed from the movie if witchcraft is considered a metaphor of private pain that hinders many people's relationships. Overall, it's a nice turn with legendary stars, 7/10.
