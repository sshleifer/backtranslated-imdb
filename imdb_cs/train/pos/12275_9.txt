I have never heard about the book, nor did it happen to me, but a movie I probably see many times. The film is unforgettable, perhaps with the richest pictures I've ever seen in the movie. It was like looking at the paintings many times, which I think is an idea. Wonderful movie, story, actors and cinema. Full deep emotions from every angle. Though I do not like romantic movies, I loved it and was deeply surprised by Winona Ryder's drive to the end. Iron earned the prize for his performance, and Close was never better. <br /> <br />
