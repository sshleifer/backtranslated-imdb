Rob Estes, Josie Bisset and the damned burden of children who do not look like any of them. <br /> <br /> Basically, Rob and Josie have a shotgun wedding on a drunken night during Vegas holidays. Each of them came home and found that their respective children already knew about wedding rights due to tabloids as not a feed. They, Rob and Josie, move both of them and eight children into one or the other house. I think Rob builds furniture that's close enough to work on Frank Lambert's (Patrick Duffy) construction much more similar to Step by Step, which guarantees the everlasting mockage. <br /> <br /> Josie is a queen who does not make a cookie even though she does not seem to be doing any cookies. She is not close enough to the hairdressing work of Carol Foster (Suzanne Somers), which really reminds me of the similarity of the mockage, but it is cheerful and pointless to justify the criminal mocking. Unlike the Step by Step, they were a few before the holiday and actually knew another surname of another, or so one assumes that their so serious relationship to the trip is together. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there are eight children; Moira, Sandy, Jeff, Lily, Daisy, Nathan, Andrew L. and Andrew B. I personally think they should call younger Andrew Andy. <br /> <br /> There are many placement products, especially for soup in hand (which is foul) and Listerine Pocket Packs. There are also some stupid, absurd moments. It's not even a great movie to support happy families. But hey! Rob Estes! It concludes my reviews "Step by Step ... on some really bad drugs." Watch out for Robes and his nice eyes. There are some great nice eyes.
