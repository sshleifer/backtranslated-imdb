Now I was delighted to see the contaminated man for the first time when he first released the TV series in December 2000. William Hurt will lose his family when an unknown disease enters the house and kills them. Now it's a few years later in Russia or somewhere. I'm not sure where exactly, everything I know is somewhere in the area. However, due to a budget cut in the infectious disease lab, they are forced to dismiss most of their staff. One of them, a dissatisfied security guard named Joseph Muller (played by Peter Weller, best known for his role as an indestructible Robocop), goes there and asks for him to return to work. He needs this work because he is divorced and needs to pay for child support. So it goes there, the fight is going to erupt, and some things are knocking on dangerous things. Soon it was found that Muller was infected with a lethal pathogen. In fact, it's so deadly, one drop of his blood kills a man in seconds. Soon the word comes and the disease expert (Hurt) is called upon to investigate and later associate with the American reporter. Now Muller is determined to get home to see his wife and son, and he stops in nothing, even if he has to infect the entire Russian population. Now, as I said before, this movie is much like Falling Down. We have a distraught person (Weller here, Michael Douglas in Falling Down), who stops in nothing to reach the goal, even though he has to kill a few people in the process. Next, we have a hero type (Hurt here, Robert Duvall in Falling Down), who is both sympathetic and determined to stop the opponent. <br /> <br /> A contaminated man is actually a very good movie with a good story line and some very good performances. <br /> <br /> 8/10
