Although this film is somewhat disinfected (because it was made at a time when people simply did not talk about sex), it is very useful for a short film that shows premature girls so they know what to expect during menstruation. It is no surprise that Kotex paid him even though what Disney produced this film was very surprising because they released many educational films during the 1940s and 1960s. Whatever it is, the film is, even though I think the creator was missing a real opportunity. Instead of a beautiful female narrator's voice and relatively inconspicuous visuals, it would be great if they used Minnie Mouse and the rest of Disney! I know it would give the old Walt a heart attack, but that would be a great movie! By the way, although the concept of sex is hardly suggested in the film, it explains enough menstruation. However, some details (especially sexual intercourse) are missing, which I suppose have been included in the accompanying brochure. Now that I can see why I was watching the cartoon about menstruation.
