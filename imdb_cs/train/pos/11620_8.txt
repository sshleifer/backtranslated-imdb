Great little thriller. I was expecting some sort of silly horror movie, but what I got was a short short thriller that did not lose any of our time. Most of these films have to get into the nature of the backs, so we either feel sympathy with them or hate when people start killing. such foolishness here. Yes, you see a few characters, but it's really just the principles. As a wife at a motel whose room was canceled. We saw them to prove how effective Lisa was, and how inefficient a new hotel clerk was. We see this little girl simply because it will have a very small but important role in the film when all the hell breaks down. Flight supporters, because we especially need to move the land forward. The thief needs it in particular at the beginning of the flight. The cruel boy at the airport was also important for the movie. The only two characters that had only five inserts that were of no use were the two youngsters on the plane. That was smart because I thought they had something to do with the story. From the first scene to the last female figure, she runs a young manager named Lisa. Even if Jackson shows his true colors, he does not get involved. He thinks what he can do to stop the time. Any other film, intelligent executive women would act like idiots. But not this one. It was a very short film, and I waited for the usual fictitious device to appear as the film seemed to be coming to a close. Fortunately, none of them have been used. The new hotel clerk did not make the usual call and told her what to do, which was panic when the phone went down and ran out of the hotel without saying anything or asked her boss and told her she had to drink a lot and only let her go. Craven should do more of these types of movies. Also the last comment. Brian Cox is in the movie, but I did not know who he was. I had to come here to find that Lisin was a father. It's totally unrecognizable.
