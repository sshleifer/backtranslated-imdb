This film is one of the most underestimated films of its time. When you look at this film, filled with action, and when something really does not happen, humor is not responsible. A brilliant song for a movie that was created to give us a bloody mix, a game show where criminals are competing, and a near future where the general public all thirst for blood. Also Arnold will not let us down with some of his best one liners. I do not want to spoil anything for you, but I'll tell you when Arnold gives his "I'm going back" he gets the best answer all in this movie. I hope you will like this jewel just like me.
