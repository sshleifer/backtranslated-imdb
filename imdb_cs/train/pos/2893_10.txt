CINDERELLA by Walt Disney tells a story that everyone gets to know and adorns with humor and tension while retaining the underlying spell of the story. Disney artists give the film an attractive look, based on a pleasant fairy-tale atmosphere. It's beautiful if it's conventionally animated; the peak is a breathtaking scene in which the fairy cat transforms the pumpkin into a majestic coach and Cinderella for a dry gown. Mack David, Al Hoffman and Jerry Livingston provide beautiful songs like "Dream is your heart's wish" and "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo," which enhance both screenplay and character. The story of CINDERELLA is predictable, providing a thrilling melodrama that shares the fears and anxieties of the title heroine and her friends. How a wicked stepmother and her terrible cat Lucifer pose a dreadful threat that threatens the dreams and desires of Cinders and Mice. It is this threat that provides a story of a strong conflict that keeps the interest of the audience. The diminution of the film is, however, balanced by quiet sweetness, especially in musical numbers. It is in these segments that the attractive Cinderella and her friends reveal the audiences to take care of them. Overall, CINDERELLA from Walt Disney is an amazing family fun that has become remarkably well for half a century.
