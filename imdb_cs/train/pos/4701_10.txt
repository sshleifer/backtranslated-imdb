"Roman Troy Moronie" is my commentary on the film. What else can be said? <br /> <br /> This character really brings out the moron of Moronie. A harsh gangster with the inability to pronounce the frantic word, it seems frustrating to be hard and yet not to act intelligently. <br /> <br /> Roman Moronie will go down in the annals of film history as one of the greatest of all crazy. <br /> <br /> Among other characters, of course, is a great comedy. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. and so is Joe Piscipo. I really like the fact that Moronie kept the movie from the "R" rating, because he could not say nausea.
