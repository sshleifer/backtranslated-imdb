I read the book Schneebaum when it was published for the first time and was deeply impressed by its ability to see the way of living a decent life through many ways of "alienation" (its own and the people of the Amazon with whom he lived and loved). His subsequent books were not so strong, but showed his continuing expedition. His description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was much earlier than in the 1960s, but his honesty and openness was welcomed. This film surprisingly expresses both the delight and size of man, but also the view of the inevitable destruction of innocence (which in this case is not a morally positive term) that occurs when "civilized" men interfere with traditional societies. Still, Schneebaum himself moved into a higher innocence, indicating the possibility of saving mankind from its own destruction.
