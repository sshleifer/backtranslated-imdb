William Powell is Philo Vance in the movie "The Kennel Murder Case," 1933 as well as Mary Astor, Paul Cavanagh, Eugene Palette, Helen Vinson and Ralph Morgan. Dog show, in which Philo entered his Scottish terrier captain, serves as a background for the secrets of locked places with too many suspects. The secret is very clever and the layout is complex and interesting. Since the band is still relatively young, working with the camera is a bit static, but Michael Curtiz is a good workman who drives this action. the whole film brings the film into a notch. A lot of actors play Philo Vance, including Paul Lukas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hyde-White, Edmund Lowe, James Stephenson, Alan Curtis, Warren William and others. Powell played the most (five times) and is best suited for the role - very relaxed but serious at the same time. This was filmed before a "thin man" brought him to a big star - by that time he spent about 12 years in the film and began his career on the stage in 1912 at the age of 20. A remarkable man, a remarkable presence on the screen and a remarkable actor who lived almost 92. We are lucky that his films are available on DVD and TCM today. "Kennel Murder Case" is a great story and a fun movie - do not miss it.
