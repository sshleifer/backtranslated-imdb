Many of the classic films of the late 1960s retained their ability to distract and confront the audience. "In cold blood," he did not lose much of his power. Its exceptionally well-done power brings the viewer to think. Some have complained not only about the film but about the source of the novel "Trump Capote" that the central report is bad. That may be true, but that is certainly the case where the lack of ambiguity does not worsen the film at all. Its refreshing, especially with regard to today's simplistic and manipulative moral dramas, to see a film with a convincing political voice that was not afraid to get the audience to consider their opinion. To be honest, I'm not sure I agree with the main message of the film, but I still admire his doubts. Even if you disagree with the mission against the image, there is plenty of admiration for the film. Negotiations on both sides are amazing. Scott Wilson (who is still one of the most underestimated actors) is cold as a nihilist leader who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses. Robert Blake is also cold because he is more flexible and the other with conscience. His character, of course, has a voice of reason, but he is scared to go against Wilson (that's a considerable amount of homoerotic subtext of his character). Cinematography is stunning, elegant, but harsh and really implies that the viewer is watching the documentary. Add another classic score from Quincey Jones and you have a masterpiece. (9/10)
