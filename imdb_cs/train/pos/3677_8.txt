Luckily he saw it on a plane to Singapore recently (I thought I was driving it to the Cinemalaya filmfest). Paris, t'aime is a collection of 20 short films (about 5 minutes each) from 20 directors who show love in different pockets of contemporary Paris. One of my favorite segments is "Parc Monceau" by Alfonso Cuarn (Great Expectation, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), which was made in one continuous shot by Nick Nolte. Coen Brothers' 'Tuileries' starred by Steve Buscemi as a tourist in the subway was merry! Julie Binoche and Willem Dafoe in "Place des Victoires" attacked. For Maggie Gyllenhaal as an American actress / druggie in the "Quartier des Enfants Rouges", she portrayed foresight and malice in such a short period of time as it was simply great. Elijah Wood as a vampire victim in the Quartier de la Madeleine was quite unreal, while Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell played a cute couple in the movie "Pre-Lachaise" by Wes Craven. Natalie Portman was just as beautiful as an actress girlfriend of a visually impaired French boy in "Faubourg Saint-Denis". But despite many pictures of young love, the more mature execution by Geny Rowlands in 'Quartier Latin' was equally all-inducing. This movie is perfect for those with ADHD, because each sequence is powered and thought carefully. <br /> <br /> There are also many unforgettable quotes. Especially it's one of a fraudulent husband who eventually leaves his mistress to stay with his dying woman in the last days: "Pretending to be a man in love, he became a loved man."
