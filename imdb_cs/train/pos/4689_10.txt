I agree with the comments made so far. I remember this document as one of the most amazing and informative I've ever seen. As already mentioned, I remind myself that I started to watch, I thought it was just another natural study - interesting, not necessarily strange, but I was so bad. Not just the incredible story of the colony, but I remember that music is just as part of his appeal. If I remember correctly, it was the native American tube (similar to music at the end of One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest). I was also looking for a copy. This should require observation for someone, but especially for schools. He should be released again.
