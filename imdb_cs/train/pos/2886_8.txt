Cinderella is a beautiful film, of course with beautiful songs. In fact, it is one of the best films of the 1950s. I think all the characters are surprisingly rendered. You can see the cruelty of Cinderella servants and her stepmother, the sweetness of Cinderella. Mice are also fun and sweet. I think they changed the story a bit, but I think it's best. It's such a nice movie, and I do not think anyone can take a deep look at it. <br /> <br /> I give it 8/10. I do not think it's the best Disney movie. But it's definitely a real classic.
