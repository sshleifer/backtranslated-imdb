Greetings again from the darkness. Mary Heron collects a list of films that allow them to look into their specific era. Her previous "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho" were at their best when commenting on the delight of society during this period. Although "The Notorious Bettie Page" is of course Mrs. Page, it's just like the top of the curtain in the world of shy pictures in the 1950s. The film is entertaining both from the point of view of the story and from the technical point of view of the way it was shot and assembled. The B & W grain film and photographs capture the time and the color rendering in Miami Beach through photos of Bunny Yeager is very well done. Support is very strong with David Strathairn (freshly from Edward R Murrow's role), Chris Bauer (Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The star of the film is a gorgeously talented and underestimated Gretchen Mol. Mrs. Molov√° always brings a border and a spirit. She was totally fascinating in a small sight, Jason Alexander directed "Just Looking" in 2000. Here is the famous Bettie Page. Her smile is breathtaking and her body is flawless. He seems to be delighted with this role, and helps us understand how the Pin-up Queen may be the underworld next to the Tennessee girl. As you might expect, the soundtrack of the time is amazing. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the leading artists. Although the film suggests that history has been brought to this industry, the last of them falls, which prevents pure film magic. But the spell of Gretchena Mol and Betty Page make him a fun movie to watch and one that will bring endless shots to HBO in the near future. Now, will somebody return Mrs. Molly to the star she ought to be?
