Good thing about this movie: The concept is interesting and there are some fun scenes. It also thinks about the little things that could greatly influence the life of someone else without knowing it. It's a small world and this little film shows us. <br /> <br /> Bad thing: There are too many characters and it's hard to tell who's the main character, but it's still a great movie. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie and many people compare it to Magnolia I did not see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Not rated --- I would have liked PG-13 for short violence, certain language and sexual situation.
