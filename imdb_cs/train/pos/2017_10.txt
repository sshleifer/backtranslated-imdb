After reading the two notes of this text as a lifelong fan of Bronte, which begins with Olivier Heathcliff and takes many versions of Charlotte's "Rochester," it is more than the eyes of seeing that she is the sister of UNsung Bronte who gave the lie to the male chauvinist period populated trio. Of course, the "miracle" in all three versions of British 19th-century domesticism is that "the girls" were all "spinsters" and their only realistic brush with "men" were their vicar's father and their killer? brother. Finally, it is ANNE Bronte, who in its one test showed a "feminist" point that precedes the current types and includes a "franchise vote". However, history tells more than a few who preceded, including the Greek hetera and Sappho and much like the old emperor Yang Kue-fei. What about "Eve" and her apple?
