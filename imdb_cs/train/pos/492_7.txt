Let me first say that when I saw every StarTrek episode at least twice, I do not consider Trekker or Trekkie. They are people who live in their parent cellars and participate in conventions that wear costumes with pointed rubber ears. I gave this film seven revelations of the fictions of historical mistakes. The game was better than average, but the plot did not make any surprises. They tried to reverse the technology very hard, but the special effects were only a great temptation. As far as historical mistakes are concerned, if you tell them that the first captain who piloted Enterprise was commander of April, then Captain Pike, Jim Kirk, etc. According to Rikaer and Kirk, we divided the Klingons and educated them and gave them technology (that is, why the primary directive was created) but, as I said, there is no reason to discredit this delicate series. I hope the land gets deeper, and then special effects can get to the back seat.
