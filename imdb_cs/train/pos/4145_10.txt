This is not the Masterpiece theater. You should not wait. It is a pure FUN girl with the most fantastic cast of female leaders. Just like someone else here said, it's a Baby Mama movie to be. And the only downside that I see in this film is that it was not Tina Fey - except that it has become the smartest and brightest girls on the planet. The film is purely silly on the surface, but if you really watch, you'll know that a lot of messages and deep meaning for all of us who want to be able to go back again in life, knowing what we know now. PURE FUN and I recommend it to anyone looking for a great escape 84 minutes.
