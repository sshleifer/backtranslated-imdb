Sure, Titanic was a good movie, you see it for the first time, but you really should see it for the second time and your opinion on the movie will definitely change. When you first see the movie, you see the basic story of love and think: ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I'm not the only one who thinks it) is just annoying and you just sit by watching movies when this d ** n ship is sunk ??? And it's not as impressive as you see it several times. The effectiveness in this movie is not bad, but certainly not great. I was glad that DiCaprio did not get Oscar for the movie, I think who he thinks he is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He does one half of a good movie and will not make a movie for less than $ 20 million. And then everyone is surprised that there are almost no movies with him. But enough, in my eyes, the worst character of the movie. The performance of Kate Winslet was, on the other hand, fabulous. I also think the director is very talented to film a movie so great. One lesson to learn about this movie is too many stories of love, filmmakers should not try to add a crazy novel to each single movie! Of the possible 100% I give this film only 71%.
