I think this movie was probably much stronger when it debuted for the first time in 1943, though today it seems to be a bit too preaching and statically raising it to size. The film was founded in 1940 - just before the United States entered the war. Paul Lukas plays a very serious and decent head of his family. He is a German who spent seven years fighting against the Nazis and avoiding capture. Bette Davis is his very understanding and long-suffering wife, who has managed to educate and educate children without him. As the film begins, they cross the frontiers from Mexico to the US, and for the first time in a few years they release and stop running. The problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent - which makes them a clear positive propaganda instead of a real family that is suffering from real problems. While at the time it had a very noble goal, today it seems to be fake. Especially the incredibly weird and extremely sketched dialogue that children used to do was not truth. It sounded more like speeches against fascism than the voices of real children. As a result, they were extremely annoying - especially the smallest who ever came as a writer. The only ones who really were, were Bette Davis and her widespread American family, as well as the dirty Romanian who lived with them (though he had no distinct accent). It is really hard to believe that the ultra-famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialogue because he simply does not sound true to life. The story was based on the play of her lover Lillian Hellman. And the basic idea of ​​the story and the plot is good ... but the dialogue is just wrong. Overall interesting curiosities and a movie with some great moments ... but that's all about it.
