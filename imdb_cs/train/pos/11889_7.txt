A well-done, but basically horrible, low-life melodrama, which, according to an accompanying interview with Isabelle Huppert, writer / director Pialat wrote a lot of autobiographical detail; since he is mostly obscene, it does not give him any compliments - and he seems to be a troubled person because Huppert also says that Pialat has often disappeared over the last few days! <br /> <br /> However, the negotiation is equally excellent; Huppert and co-star Gerard Depardieu (as the title character!) Were, despite their relatively young age, already at the forefront of modern French stars - a status that they hold with varying degrees of success today. /> <br /> I have 3 more Pialatos in my "VHS To Watch", though all in French without English subtitles; because of this fact, but also of the overwhelming realism of LOULA - despite his undeniable artistic merit - I can not say that I am in some special hurry to look at them now ...
