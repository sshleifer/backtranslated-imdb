Paul Reiser travels from the ceiling comedy reflector to write a pleasant humorous and gentle story about the family - what we see and what we do not see what we expect and what surprises us. The case for my films does not set any new standards for the film, but it's a great little story that reminds us of the important ties that the family represents. Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) was sometimes workaholic, sometimes pushing his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan) and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) in the background. One day, Muriel will leave a remark that she leaves after years of marriage! Her daughters, along with Ben's wife Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins), immediately begin to look for her place of residence and leave the bewildered and upset and disturbed Sam to settle things on a road trip with Ben. A trip is a time when both men learn about each other and either of them means that they are father, son, and family members. Sam is released for the first time in life, and now Ben's workman presents joy and joy in life. The trip ends and makes a call about where Muriel is and why she left, and the regrouping of a wiser family draws the story to a warm end. It's not all that seemed: it's better and different. Falk and Reiser play each other as professionals, but in many ways it's one of the short moments when Olympia Dukakis is on the screen and reminds us he's one of our strongest filmmakers. It's worth watching. Grady Harp
