Murder: The film proved to be a good thing for a well-written, well-run and well-acting series. At the end of the final season the free ends were not properly solved. The whole series, and in particular the film, provided life in life (and death) in Baltimore, a culturally unique city with an extremely high degree of murder. My attraction to the series began long before I moved to Baltimore, but as soon as I spent my life here, I realized how realistic she was. And the movie definitely kept that ghost. I definitely miss the new original episodes of the series, but I am very grateful to NBC and the producers and to the fact that we were looking at the dark side of Charm City on the last side.
