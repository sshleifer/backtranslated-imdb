The magical journey created by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. These two TITANs from British cinematography have mixed some wonderful ingredients for the production of the movie championship! Some of the most exciting early Technicolor, SUBLIME and shimmering musical score Miklos Rozsa along with the teenage whims of Saba, the theatrical and malicious villain Conrad Veidt and the beautiful beauty and voice of June Duprez as Princesses, work great. Miles Malleson, who plays Duprez's father, the Sultan of Basra, also wrote a perfect script that is appropriately grandiose. DO NOT TAKE THIS! Since publishing the above comments, I have recently released a DVD and I can honestly say that I have never seen the picture correctly until I see this version of DVD - The clarity and resolution are so accurate and the colors are so lively that I was amazed - This amazing classic can be watched again and never fails to enchant and delight the viewer. Again, MUST YOU!
