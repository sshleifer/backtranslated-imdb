This is one of the best bonds I've ever played because: <br /> <br /> Missions are very fun to play that they have a lot of action in them that can be really hard sometimes it makes even the more amusing weapons you use , they are really good. Vehicles in this game are really good. This James bond game has a good story. The voice over the actors in this game is really good and it's cool that Broznan puncture them in this game and the way the characters look is really good because they look like what they look like in real life, which is really cool. Also, the graphics in this game are pretty good. <br /> <br /> Total score ********* of **********
