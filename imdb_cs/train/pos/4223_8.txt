The film has a great written genre story. It contains all the usual Columbo ingredients; The way you get it. Columbo approaches his suspect as his secret falls apart, the Columbo's dog, the cat and the mouse game, which is a great and fortunate release of humor, which usually includes the Columbo. It's all written despite the fact that it does not even have a truly original concept. Columbo hits a detective / murderous novel writer has done more than once in the movie Columbo. It's also an exceptionally well-managed film by James Frawley, who then made another five Columbo films in the 1970s and 1980s. He provided the film in style and some really great and memorable sequences. It's one of the slowly moving Columbo films, though they do not have too much run time. This style and approach may not always work well in Columbo, but it does in this movie, which may not be due to the film's acting performances. Most of the movie Columbo either played a famous star or a star from the beginning of the movie, as a movie of his killer. This movie star has a rather unknown 81-year-old Ruth Gordon. During his career he has not played in a large number of films, but is still well known, mainly because of his role in "Rosemary's Baby", which also won the Oscar. She had a realistic and somewhat unusual style of acting that some people do not like. She earned four more Oscar nominations throughout her career before her victory for Rosemary's Baby in 1969. She also has a great interaction with Peter Falk in her sequences. <br /> <br /> The movie also stars the still young GD Spradlin. I say young because I know him only from his last production from his career, even though he has been 57 years old at the time of producing this Columbo. He is still alive, but since 1999 he has left acting. <br /> <br /> Even better than the usual entry to the Columbo movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
