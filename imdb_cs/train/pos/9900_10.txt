it's such movies that lead you to never pick a nerd growing up in school. If you liked this movie, I would recommend you watch Valentine. I just discovered that the guy who played Marty (Simon) just killed a little after filming, which is a shame because he did well. I wonder if it's because of the part he played in the movie. It starts when Carol encourages him to go to the girls' toilets to act as if they should. When he changed into showers, carols with their favorite friends slipped into the bathroom and got everything ready, camera, electric shock, stick. When Marty opened the curtain back naked, he realized he was being cheated. They try to cover up the shower, but the children open it, grab Marty and start to be okay for him while the camera is rotating. They picked him up, they aimed his head in the toilet as he was flushed, and they were kind of electric. When the children are in custody given by the coach, 2 boys give Marty a joint that makes him fall. Skip breaks one of the glass windows in the gym with a brick so the teacher can apologize. While Marty is in the bathroom, he jumps to the Science Lab and mixes some things that look like cocaine, but they are not sure what it was. The lab will erupt badly. Five years later, the children who worried him were invited to a five-year meeting with the school at an old school that burned the day she exploded. They kill one another after another. I do not understand how the girl who drowned really drowned. she could come back when Marty left. She almost got out for the first time.
