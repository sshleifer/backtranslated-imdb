Woah! One thing I can say about this movie is one thing. Personally, I'm one of those people who love cats, so it would be a big part of the film, but I loved cats getting everyone's revenge at the end. <br /> <br /> I like to admit it was because I found out that Brian Krause, who played Charles Brady, is very irresistible, I think it was better for me to watch this movie. There was one thing I was disappointed with. I watched Charmed before, and Brian Krause is married to Holly Marie Combs, his kissing scene was O.K. in Sleepwalkers, but really bad compared to my kissing scenes with Holly Marie Combs, I do not know if it's because Krause and Combs have great chemistry or maybe more, that's the only disappointment in the movie, but I think it was created with Brian Krause was in the tight-fitting jeans in the movie. If you are using Brian Krause to see Holly Marie Combs as a heavenly husband, and her son's father, because of the great surprise with this movie, he was nothing like a boy. Though now that I think about it, it would be great to see Kraus's character on Charmed, who took over the evil that made him something similar to his Sleepwalkers. I also have to say that the music was in this movie too!
