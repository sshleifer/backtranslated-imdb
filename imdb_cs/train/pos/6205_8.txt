Curious, furious and unlikely, Fay Grim is hard to sit down, but Parker Posey is really the only actress who could take this story and run with it. She immediately touches, funny, cunning. This is also supported by actors. <br /> <br /> I do not even want to say this plot. It includes characters from Henry's fool Hartley and is trying to tell the story of international espionage. <br /> <br /> The film works well if you continue with it - understanding it. in a sense, absolutely absurd. It's becoming more ridiculous as you grow. (I resisted the temptation to turn off the DVD twice.) Fay Grim requires an adventure filmmaker who wants to fight something that is not a cookie-cutter. Finally, he will offer something that opposes the description.
