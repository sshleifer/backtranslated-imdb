Thank God, ABC chose Fox instead. The best description (for those who know) is really Wonderfalls meets Dead Like Me in the best possible way. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the experience of death and fate early in life makes me a fan of Brian Fuller, but I definitely enjoy his productions. I also like checkered floors, cakes, talking toys, gravel and other harmful items :) While a little "Burtonesque", I certainly think it has its own place that does not require J Depp or HB Carter to be a wonderfully imaginative playground. Here we can find the joys and grievances of childhood and adulthood that come across everyone and really make sense and make us live our lives as much as possible!
