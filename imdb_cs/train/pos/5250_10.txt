The world is made up of two different types of viewers ... There are types of "English Patients" who can not bother to enjoy everything that is not good enough to appear on PBS, and there are "Happy Gilmore" for which hour and half of the genitalia is definitely worth $ 7. <br /> <br /> It is certainly the gray area, but you know which side you are leaning on. If you are an English patient, save time, save money and save us all your "Oh, this movie is so childish and stupid" comments. I know you're enjoying every movie that you do not like and every person you like, but maybe you can only stand it once. But if you are a type of Happy Gilmore. .. go for this ... You will find it cheerful. Tim Meadows created a cheerful character and Will Farrell is still cheerful in everything he does. Go ahead. You will be glad you did. And that's fine.
