Robot Jox does not suffer from the story or the bad effects. This was 1990, if you know what I'm talking about. RoboCop 2 still used the stop animation because most of the films became in the 80's. If you look at your biggest stars at this time, most of them did what they could, with the special effects that were available at the time. Only in the following year Terminator 2 was issued: Judgment Day, when a technological breakthrough occurred and the story of the boarders began to use this motif. But you'll have beautiful memories of Transformers, Gundam Wing, even the Power Rangers if you're watching this movie. Enemy robot is very threatening. It does not want you to face men without a really good backup plan. And in this movie there are some great moments. A traitor / spy is working inside their centers. Whoever thinks you are on your side and supports you all the way, you may be the person you did not expect. And that's very unpleasant when you think so, do you agree?
