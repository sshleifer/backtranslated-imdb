Since their divorce from Disney Company (with Disney's Miramax brand), Weinstein seems to specialize in above-average films that are poorly advertised and seen only by a few. FLOCK is an example. A story about civil servants who have ugly work in monitoring registered sex offenders, this picture tells you more about sex crimes than about the whole time of the law and the Order - SVU. Richard Gere gives his best performances as a soft-spoken agent worn out by the task. Claire Danes has one chance to get into a solid role (instead of what is normally stuck) and she plays the most of a beginner. Cinematography, transitions, editing, all this is the first speed - and I have not seen a trace of lack of attention - lack of camera jumping around or surplus cutting of the camera that others complained about. The topic is handled with care, but it's still a heavy object that can make you worse. Fifty years ago, there was almost no problem with such kinds of sexual crimes, which are listed in abundance, tired. Followed by the Supreme Court's decision, which at the same time binds police arms, because the "rights" of sexual perversions have opened and America has become a trade paradise for sexual perversion, both willing and unwilling. Every such meeting was met by a praise of liberals who celebrated the evil actions of Warren Court with shiny covers on Time and Newsweek. Everyday liberals also praised the lawsuit and mocked those who disagreed. In 2007, how many Americans know that pornography that portrays violent violence and torture of young women can be signed, and its delivery is subsidized by the US Post Discount Magazine. Only one part of the problem - a problem that can upset someone's family. Richard Gere is a liberal, but he gives the best in this performance. Maybe at the age of adolescence he has gained the degree of wisdom.
