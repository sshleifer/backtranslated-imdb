I loved the idea of ​​this film ever since I first saw a trailer. Einstein has always been one of my heroes and his image as a kind, playful, slightly mad genius was enough to see the movie. Added spice from Matthaus as Einstein has improved it. The story is purely fantastic but beautiful. The car mechanic falls in love with the beautiful woman who becomes Einstein's niece. With the help of four fairy-tale physics tribes, Ed sets out on the path to Catherine's heart. Take the jealous fiancée (which is an example of the worst experimental psychology) and Eisenhower into the mix and you have pure fun. The film is full of great characters and wonderful sweet and daffy performances. Walter Matthau plays Einstein as a malicious imp; cupid with the feed rule. Tim Robbins is so cute when Ed and Meg Ryan are a step above the normal Romcom level. Stephen's Smiley is a joy like "RRRatman" and Ryan's fiance; which lacks a romantic bone in the body. The film has fallen under most radar, but it is a tremendous treasure that does not grow with repeated views. It is characterized by first-class writing and performance and is a delicate treatment in a less than gentle world.
