I can admit that the script is not very good and has some slow parts, but all the critics of this film have to learn how to have fun. (Michael Douglas, Kim Basinger, Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria, Michael Douglas proves that she still has it, and Kim Basinger plays a very interesting character as a cheating wife, Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria, playing a dynamic duo, both adding your incredible talent for sweat. And secondly, this movie is the most fun I've had in years in Theodore. Simple and simple if you want to go to the movies, and have a lot of fun to see, The Sentinel.
