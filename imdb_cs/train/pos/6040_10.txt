I just never hate watching FREEBIRD. My husband was extra, so I was involved from the beginning. You have been in contact with Jon and helped promote the movie both in cinemas and now in the DVD release. Even to the extent of distribution of promotional postcards for ferry ferries and in various locations all over France. FREEBIRD was professionally written and directed with the perfect combination of fun and serious moments plus a selection of casting. Only Phil Daniels could play the role of Grouch. Great privilege to meet Jon and the actor at a party after the premiere in January. Anything else you'd like to do Jon just ask, either by e-mail or by phone, you know how to get me. Sue xx
