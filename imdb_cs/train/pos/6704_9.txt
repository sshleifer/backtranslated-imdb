During the first three years, Sabrina was hidden on the TGIF (and later on in the morning school afternoons). Every episode had a maniac, soon energy and a quick fire that overcame an occasional inconclusive joke. Melissa Joan Hart radiated an enthusiastic talent for physical comedy, especially in face expressions. Her two aunts who played "straight men," or as well as two witches, could have been great comic timing and general chemistry with Harte. Salem, like a talking cat, could speak freely in any crazy plan he was interested in, and he could laugh and take it all because he was, after all, a talking cat. Sabrina's friends incorporated a social experience from a school where he was also a typical "bad cheerleader" and "totalitarian director". Perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the show was the ability to merge pop culture (eg Jerry Springer's bands of time), archetypal human condition / morality (eg the importance of friendship, the spirit of Christmas) and the literal representation of such related metaphors in the magic realm. Unfortunately, like so many other TV shows at the time of the television, the show has reached the top in the first three years, coinciding with Sabrina attending high school. The beginnings of the fourth season meant that moving to college would worsen the overall quality of the show, especially when the writers chose to portray Josh as Harvey's rival and prepare excuses for Aunt Hild and Zelda to remain on the screen as key players. The final season, when Sabrina is working in popular culture magazines, was clearly a disappointment. And eventually Sabrina (especially in high school years) remains a unique approach as a hybrid sitcom with magical elements that highlights it over the difficult ride that is produced each year in this genre.
