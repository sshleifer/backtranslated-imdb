I really enjoyed this film because I have a tremendous interest in America's history ... about the years of Antebellum and, in particular, the Civil War. I bought it recently from a stand with previously viewed videos on sale in a supermarket, and I was glad to add it to my collection of video clips. Although not from the caliber of Civil War films, such as "Glory" or "Gettysburg," it provides a lot of history of pre-civil war fraternity between cadets at West Point. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's gray uniforms, youth, or military discipline, but I'm fascinated by a story of a cadet from around the year 1830 to the brink of war. I imagine how it had to be sitting in class with other young men, how to learn how to make war, and later give the lessons they use against their classmates! <br /> <br /> In fact, there were two classes graduated in 1861 in one class in May and the other in June. the film does not mention it at all, except for Henry A. DuPont, the first graduate of the May class; and George Custer, the last grade of the June class. the reason for both classes was not so much about the war, but it was the result of a return to a four-year study program, after several years of experimentation with a five-year course (I think the first class had taken part in five years, the other four). As the film looks, the cadets were like brothers and often nicknamed each other ... George "Fanny" or "Autie" Custer; Alonzo "Lon" Cushing; James "Beauty" Stuart (for JEB Stuart, class 1854), etc. <br /> <br /> I say that this film is "Santa Fe Trail", as it was due to the 1940 film, History . Cadets from several different classes are graduated together. JEB Stuart and George Custer are portrayed as best friends and are next to each other when the John Brown rebellion was halted in Harper's Ferry in 1859. In fact, Stuart and Custer were never friends, but enemies during the war. In 1863 they met with the others (for the first time, I think) in Gettysburg (Stuart was at Harper's Ferry Raise, but Custer was still a cadet in Boda when it happened). <br /> "Fanny" Custer plays a role in "Class of '61," though his classmates, Dev O'Neill and Shelby Peyton are fictitious. I believe they are based on Particular Henry O'Rork and John Pelham, the two people you can find. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm really enjoying a movie or movie that provides a window to the mid-19th century America.
