The young woman (Jean Simmons) is convinced by her intimidating and dangerous aunt (Sonia Dresdel) and uncle (Barry Jones) that she loses her mind and in a very sensitive condition that requires their supervision, which turns out to be more manipulation because you try to keep as far away as possible from external human contact. The only other person he sees is the real estate manager, a lascivious figure played by Maxwell Reed, who caught the unpleasant eye of a middle-aged aunt. All this, aunt and trustee, experienced uncle of butterflies, who has a serious bottom and a receptive niece in the middle, would do for a darker and more sinister film. As in the case of the murder, Trevor Howard sends a police secret to the police and captures the "Police Net Close In" photographs on the front, jumping on buses, and liquidation, as Trevor Howard (a freelance secret police official who took a job in butterfly catalogs) in Liverpool, where they meet some of the great cast characters and eventually face the greedy and murderous aunt and uncle.
