Prison cell. Four Prisoners - Carrere, a young company director of fraud, a 35-year-old transsexual in the process of transformation, Daisy, a 20-year-old mentally challenged idiot, and Lassalle, a 60-year-old intellectual who murdered his wife. Around the stone slab in the cell that had mysteriously pulled out, they discovered a book: a diary of a former prisoner, Danvers, who occupied a cell at the beginning of the century. The diary contains magical formulas that probably allow prisoners "Malefique" is one of the smartest and most intelligent horror films I've seen this year. The film has a dirty, shadowy feeling influenced by the work of HP Lovecraft, which makes a very scary and disturbing atmosphere. There are quite a number of ghosts that deal with some imaginative and brutal deadly scenes, and the characters of four prisoners are surprisingly well developed. It's a shame that Eric Valette did a terrible remake of "One Missed Call" after his amazing debut.
