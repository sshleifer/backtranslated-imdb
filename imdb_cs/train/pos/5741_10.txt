One of my favorite movies I've seen in Seattle. Tom Hulce was amazing, with exhaustive words to tell his feelings and thoughts. Actually, I sent Mike Ferrell some gifts to distribute the film. It's good. The system says I need more rows, but I do not want to give away things. I was in audiences in Seattle with Hulk and the director, my writer and Mike Ferrell. They talked about an hour after talking. The house is not really a dry eye. Why is Hollywood still stupid, I do not know. (actually, I know it's our fault, check out what we are watching) Well, you get what you pay for boys. Get it and look at someone special. It's a gem.
