I like movies that do not provide a typical "happy ending" and that's my main reason why I liked this movie. Alice Marano (Danes) and her best friend Darlene (Beckinsale) are detained in Thailand for smuggling drug addicts after a tip called anonymously to Thai authorities. The film makes a strong effort to keep audiences guessing whether (or which) girls are involved, and Bill Pullman is perfect as their furious lawyer. Jacqueline Kim is well identified with his beloved wife, Yon, who is also a lawyer. I wish the girls in prison were abused more, as another commentator suggested, because I have heard that Thai prisons can be quite brutal. Where this film catches me is the end of it. Alice has been sentenced to 96 years in total to be forgiven for Darlene, and we (the audience) realize that they are both innocent. Every film that moves away from my expectations from the end gets more points with me and this well-done drama certainly deserves.
