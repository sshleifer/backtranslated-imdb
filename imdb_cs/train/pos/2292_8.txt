Just looking at this early Bugs Bunny (the first he named here) and the Elmer Fudd cartoon on ThadBlog as linked from YouTube. This was Chuck Jones for the first time when he directed "iscally wabbit" and as a result, Bugs has another voice provided by Mel Blanc than Brooklyn / Bronx one we are more familiar with. In fact, according to Thad, he brings Jimmy Stewart (his "shy boy" personalities of that time). Anyway, after Elmer buys his pet, Bugs pervades his radio everywhere and pretends to die after his master repeatedly throws himself out of the shower and says, "Turn off the lights!" whenever Elmer caught him in bed. Even with another voice, Bugs is definitely his dirty self, and I've laughed all the time! According to Thad, there was another scene at the end of Elmer, who gave the house to the Bugs after the hell he had gone through, but it was probably considered too sad because at that moment he suffered from a mental disorder, so it's as good as he is lost. Anyway, I highly recommend Elmer's Pet Rabbit.
