I was delighted that last night I was watching this beautiful movie with a wonderful addition to the question and answer with the director after watching. I suspect that the first commentator never lost his parents or anyone who was very close to him. I've had a lot of this kind of loss, and this movie spoke to me. One of the main topics is how to deal with our loved ones with issues / issues / stories until it is too late - before it happens, they are too incompetent or dead. Talk to your loved ones, listen and record your stories, tell the people you love to resolve the differences. I loved the message that there are no mistakes. I like the director's portrait of the relationships of both daughters - as one of six siblings, I understand that he understood how complicated these relationships are. His history as a cameraman also comes loud and clear - how beautiful a movie! Casting is exceptional - a movie you can not miss!
