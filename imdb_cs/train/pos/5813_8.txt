This movie is great. Now I tend to like my movies heavy on the story and the dialogue, but since then something like Moonwalker comes in and it is observable despite numerous shortcomings. /> <br /> This movie is just a very fun Michael Jackson ad. He begins with a patient with a "People in the Mirror" video that portrays his achievements and bits of his career, goes through all the peaks of his life, then collapses into a really entertaining segment that acts as a fun music video for "Bad" and " Speed ​​Demon ", after the adventures of MJ, when running from the maniacal stop-motion fans and eventually dancing against rabbit costume. Stopping motion is not as bad as anyone would believe. It is passable. <br /> <br /> Then we see a great video for "Let Me Lonely" and right to the main feature. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is ridiculous. Very ridiculous. We see Michael coming out of the building and then shooting thousands of soldiers. Then we hit the flashback, showing MJ and three children struggling with underground lair. "Big Lord" (Joe Pesci) is a shameful villain who intends to get every child in the world for a "drug" attack (no specifications are mentioned) at an early age. MJ and the little girl she was about to catch, then pursued ... yada yada yada. The story is not really an important part. We get two very cool sequences where MJ turns into a car, then a robot-space thing and, of course, the amazing Smooth Criminal sequence. It's so-so movie, but it's fantastic for anyone who likes MJ. He has most of his biggest hits and some great little pieces and some very good special effects (especially the Robot / Spaceship Sequence) are worth seeing, especially as if you could pick them up for about one quid on eBay. It will make babies calm for a few hours, as well as a maximum of 20 somethings who were children when it was first released.
