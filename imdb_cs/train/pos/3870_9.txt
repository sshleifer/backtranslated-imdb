It is an extremely dense, dark and complicated film that slowly spreads, reveals unbearable details, such as the attention paid to the novel, and looks at this film as a "watch" of the novel. While I was not interested in the narrator because I felt he was not in balance with other performances, this film contains some of the best performances I've ever seen, and the management of Summer Phoenix is ​​fabulous. Her innocence and naivety some may find unlikely, some cross between Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. I can buy this criticism, but she's still wonderful, partly because it's unlike anything I've ever seen. The movie is incredibly beautiful, shot by Eric Gautier, and part of what is so unique this movie is is that it never shows what you would expect. It's always surprising, and despite the length of the movie, it never shows more than it needs. At 163 minutes it's extremely brief, the mistake I would say, which is one of the wonders of this film. It's filled with short moments that are just amazing, some of the best you'll probably see throughout the year, and all these moments are ultimately added to the extraordinary movie experience. Family moments are unique, Ian Holm is great, and what this movie is about the theater has not been seen in movies since the beginning of Cassavetes' Opening Night or Limelight Chapel. But believe it or not, this movie is far less conventional. I never knew where this movie was going, and now that he saw it, he still has many possibilities. It is a powerful, incredibly provocative movie.
