Although Cher and Cage are central to this story, Gardenia and Dukakis are good counterparts for them - that's where Loretta and Ronny have been in their fifties - are still in love. The entire cast does a nice job from Aiello to John Mahoney - it shows the real piece of life. Even though I've long seen it - I'm glad he eventually catapulted Cage to the place he was recognized for his talent in Hollywood. From music to scenes in the opera to the arguments of the kitchen table - it's a very funny movie.
