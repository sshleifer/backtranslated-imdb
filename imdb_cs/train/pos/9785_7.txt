Let me be the first non-Australian commentary on this :) I have a movie for Hugo Weaving and I've been watching it to the end. It is one of those films of the "drama of life" because my mother called a movie that portrays a real life story without extraordinary events and which is mostly descriptive. I like light and girls. The rest was without too much mistake, but without much merit. I longed for something like the Interview, or at least some matrix villain here and there, but nothing unusual. The story teaches a man to face his own fate and get rid of the environment others are building for you, but it happens when the life maze in the area is about to close, so there is not much effort to change things. <br /> <br /> The "smart" American beauty of sound like a background song could be part of a larger soundtrack, but just playing it again and again became annoying after 100 minutes of the movie. > <br /> Finally, I think he was able to imagine part of Australian life, but it was not particularly Australian for me (it could be located anywhere) and it did not seem like an attractive story. <br /> <br /> I think you have to be in a mood to enjoy the movie.
