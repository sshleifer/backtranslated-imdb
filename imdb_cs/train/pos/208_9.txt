Sunshine Boys is an amazing comedy about two ex-vaudevillians who reluctantly join TV special despite the fact that they despise each other. The comic genius of two masters at work, George Burns and Walter Matthau are stellar! Some of the best scenes are when the duo fights over the strongest little trivial things! The material is fast and funny, appealing to all ages. MILD SPOILER ALERT: There are some slightly sad moments at the end of the film that deal with the indirect influence of aging, which gives the film a soft, honest, gentle, which shows this reviewer that what the couple really needs most for success are each other. <br /> <br /> If someone loves The Odd Couple, you will adore this movie. Great movie!
