Miriam Hopkins is "Lady with Red Hair" in Leslie Carter's biography of 1940, also starring Claude Rains as David Belasco, Richard Ainley as Lou Payne, and a subtle cast of supporting players including Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory. <br /> <br /> Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains give a wonderful performance. Hopkins was a beautiful actress who really feels for Mrs. Carter. The rain is great as a glamorous, egoistic producer / writer / actor / impresario David Belasco, one of the great names in the theater. Although the other Mrs. Carter's husband Lou Payne was the advisor of this film, it is a bad illustration of Mrs Carter's real life events. It is true that there was a lot of propaganda and hot divorce, and she was undoubtedly seen as a scandalous figure for it and for becoming an actress. However, she cared for her son Dudley, so there was no caretaker battle. As soon as she moved with Belasc, she did not come back to her, and she actually started working at vaudeville and finally filmed some films at the end of her life. She really marries Lou and has become her leading man in many productions. The driving force for Mrs. Carter at the beginning of this film is once again gaining a bond with her son, but she finally realizes that her time from him is closely intertwined with her father. In the movie, too (and I'm not sure if it was true in real life), she traveled with her mother and lived in a theater guesthouse, giving the movie some interesting atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, probably not a Carter or Belasco show. One of Mrs Carter's most famous moments was in the heart of Maryland, where she wore a six-leg wig. In the underground fans fired their hair as it hung 35 feet above the stage holding the bell to stop. Quite visual.
