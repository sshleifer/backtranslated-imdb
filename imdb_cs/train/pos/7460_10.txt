I think a lot of people wrote it as another of the strange films Tom Cruise (Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut), but Vanilla Sky is definitely his own film. Many people said it was strange; it was not. It was different and confusing, but not strange. Strange is Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore. Different is The Truman Show. Conflicting Matrix or Game. And unlike Kubrick, this film has a conclusion. Everything makes sense - maybe not immediately, maybe even today, but it makes sense. Vanilla Sky is confusing because David Aames (Tom Cruise) is confused. That's it. There was a so-called "strangeness" that critics stood. If they bothered to "open [their] eyes" as an original Spanish film in 1997, they could see it. And if that's not enough to see it, check out the music. Cameron Crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack; he uses it to set the "feeling" - a notorious element that many films lack. With songs such as "Good Vibrations," The Beach Boys, playing on the dramatic and emotional climax of the movie, creates an overwhelming, yet stunning, "right" feeling. The wonderful film, in her screenplay, music, acting and imagination, is Vanilla Sky, a sad, superficial film that critics steal to look intelligently. Excellent: A +
