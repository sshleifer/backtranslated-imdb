I do not understand what the fans of the genre do not like about this movie. It was really fun. The special effects were amazing. In general, I agree with the IMDB voters' reviews, but this time. I was waiting for her to return to the home video, which I thought was another reason why I did not like the movie. I believe films with special effects must be seen on the big screen, but it was not. For me the film compares two films that were released at the same time. Blair Witch and Mum. Both films I thought were terrible. Blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time. Mummy was doing pieces of money and it was a clean place. People like it because they are special effects. Movies like Mummy and The Haunting are not rich in character development, they're more like fun. With this analogy, Mumie B was the place for the Haunting E-ticket.
