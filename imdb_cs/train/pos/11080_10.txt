First, when people hear GUY RITCHIE, they immediately think about SNATCH. Yes, Snatch was a good movie, but the problem is that they all associate Guy Ritchie with Snatch. They do not expect to explore new borders. This REVOLVER movie is different than snatch; it is much darker and is very complex. The reason I got 10 points is that I had to watch the Revolver three times to understand everything. So this movie plays with your head. It's very cleverly written. <br /> <br /> This movie is different from Snatch. It was great, cinematography is beautiful and you know how Guy Ritchie has a personal style (directed by director). What won me was the protagonist's complexity and how we had more questions than answers.
