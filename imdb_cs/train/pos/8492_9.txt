Gung Ho is one of those movies that will never tire me to watch. Michael Keaton has always been my favorite, and he is absolutely cheerful in this movie. Just as step by step is Gedde Watanabe. Two of them are working together. Although this film is a comedy, I also like how it shows that Hunt (Keaton) and Kazihiro (Watanabe) are fighting in their roles as leaders of their respective groups. They both struggle so hard to maintain peace, and eventually get into the fight (which is a hysterical watch). First they are both on the floor. Then Hunt jumps into a chair. Kazihiro jumps to the table. Hunt jumps on a table with him. The fight then spills from the office to the factory. I am glad that after the workers are separated, you can say that they both feel bad because they leave things so out of hand. There is also a scene where you can see the influence Hunt had on Kazihiro. He is in his house and his boss from Japan comes and says he would like to visit the factory tomorrow: Kazihiro: Tomorrow is not a good day. Sakamoto: Why not? Kazihiro: The factory is blocked and we can not find the key. Tell me he can not imagine Michael Keaton anything like that! <br /> <br /> I think I really enjoy this movie because it's really funny and also shows how people who are radically different can not only learn from each other but also become good friends.
