My 2 year old likes to show Doodlebops, it seems to keep his attention for a while. The characters are interesting, lively with primary colors and all. There is not much educational content that could benefit a target audience, but it seems that everyone has a theme and is trying to teach children about sharing and respect and other basics, so I like it. It is well manufactured with high production values. But it's really just an average show like most television shows these days. We do not buy goods into the corner of the goods and let our son wear everything Dooblebop can do. I do not think we would spend money on a live show if they ever came to town. Going to the Zoo or the Science Center is a much better experience for all involved and, in my opinion, the money is spent better.
