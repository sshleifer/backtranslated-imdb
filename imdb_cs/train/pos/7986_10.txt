This is a great, heartbreaking movie. It's by far the best thing I've seen is that it depicts the current reality in Latin America ... abductions, corruption, ruthless and greedy police officers, and heartless chaos towards innocent victims. Denzel Washinton, in my opinion, has the fastest performance in his career. Dakota Fanning is an amazing young actress. The relationship between Washington and Fanning is beautifully written and portrayed, I believed every minute. Cast is great, Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke are great as ever. Walken illuminates the screen like no other actor on the screen. I would like to see more of them. Authentic sites are remarkable. Working with the camera is interesting and different. There are many well-known Latin actors in the actor's cast, which is all the more interesting for people familiar with Latin American cinematography. I highly recommend this movie.
