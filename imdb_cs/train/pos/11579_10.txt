this film is a masterpiece of a young woman's story during the war and it really does not come as a movie, but it's a great story, I was impressed by film, acting and story where I like the movie because it's a true story, that it was Giff that I was there, and I'm sorry that the rector who plays Maruschka Detmers because he wants life to end this way. I recommend everyone to see this movie, especially young and me, when they learn something from this movie. You can compare this movie with an orange soldier or some real story that happened in the Second World War.
