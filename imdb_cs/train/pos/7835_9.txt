I saw this movie last night at a special cinema that took place in Nuremberg, and it was great. I have to admit that the original musical composition of a cello and percussionist / xylophone player influenced the mood of the film, but the film itself had a strong power in the performance of the tragic Nibelungen saga. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in silent movies or Nibelungenlied, I recommend this movie. The costumes were fantastic and creative, the sets were enormous and exotic, and the acting was dramatic and breathtaking (as is typical of the silent film tragedy). Unfortunately, I did not see the first part of this film duo about Siegfried. The story of this second film begins after Siegfried's death when Kremhild (Gudrun in the Norwegian versions of the story) begins planning his revenge on his brothers. I also watched this movie in German; I am a native speaker of English and I have basic German knowledge. It was hard to read subtitles (what do you say in silent movies?) Initially due to the old German script, I recommend that if you follow in German, make sure you can distinguish your k, f and s in the old script. :)
