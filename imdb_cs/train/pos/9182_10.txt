Those who love Jane Eyre's book like me (it's my favorite time and I read it at least once a year) will like this version. Timothy Dalton is just a little good, looks like Mr. Rochester, but he does a terrific job showing the upset Master Thornfield. Zelaha Clarke may have been too old to play 18-year-old Jane, but when I look at this film, I do not think for ever. Dialogue from the movie is almost literally from a book that was very clever. Sure, this movie may seem a bit long, but it's the only version I've seen that contains part 3 of the story. I wish the people who shot this film were involved in the newer Zeferelli because it would help that the film mess. I also realized that I last watched this video played by Judy Cornwell "Aunt Reed"! It's so versatile that I did not recognize her. She plays Daisy in Maintaining Appearances, and also played Ms. Musgrove in Persuasion 1995 (another great adaptation). UPDATE: I have a DVD this week, and it's amazing to see the original unedited version. At the beginning, there's so much more (Young Jane at Gateshead and Lowood.) And finally, they've resumed a lot of things (I've always been interested in why St. John had a piece of paper when he found out he knew who Jane was because the part where it tears her image was modified from the US version of VHS!). Rosamund Oliver is in ... she was completely cut off from the VHS. If I did, I did not think of any part of Timothy Dalton, so there's nothing new there, but it's great to see the whole miniseries in the whole of the years of VHS use. Thanks, BBC (PS ... I would pay more for a special DVD release ... with some interviews with stars ... or performance)
