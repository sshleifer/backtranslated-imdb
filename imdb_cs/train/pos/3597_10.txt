(spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was averted with this film. I chased a little on movielink and I decided to check this movie. It seems that a lot of boxing films overlap the blood. It shows amateur in this film. Even though I wish it was possible to raise awareness, perhaps improve it. The film highlights the problems that some families face in their sex. <br /> <br /> I was a bit worried about the end. But the end was not disappointing either. I think the title was clear to win. It was unexpected that these two of them got back to the end. <br /> <br /> They loved scores for some scenes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span>
