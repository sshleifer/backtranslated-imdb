This is a great example of the fairly simple film Noir, which is extremely manageable - thanks to the outstanding leadership of Otto Preminger and beautiful acting performances. Dana Andrews stars as a detective who is too often used by fists instead of his brains. Soon after the start of the film, Andrews is punished and warned that if it continues, it will be out of power. A little later, the suspect attacked the crime investigator and Andrews was forced to fight to protect himself. This time, he does not use excessive force, but the attacker is killed. Andrews is panicked and assumes he does not believe him, so he tries to cover up death - though instead he is guilty of an innocent man for a crime. <br /> <br /> The film is much more than this - including a plot involving slimy villain (Gary Merrill) and love interest for Andrews (Gene Tierney). Overall, this is one of the best examples of the genre - with a big smile, excellent lighting and a simple but very effective story. That's the way Noir should be.
