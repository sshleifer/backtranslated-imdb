Genre: Dinosaur, Animation, New York, Time Travel, Circus. Main characters: Rex Tyrannosaurus rex, Elsa pterodactyl, Dweeb Parasarolophus, Ooo the Triceratops, Cecilia and Captain New-eyes. ? Actors: John Goodman (Rex), Yeardley Smith (Cecilia), Martin Short (Felix Kendal), Felicity Kendal (Elsa) etc. What happens: Four dinosaurs (see above) "cereal cereals from the brain" dinosaurs who will be dear to children. Are they going to New York, with great plans? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: This is a cute animated movie. Animation of dinosaurs, when they are cozy and friendly, are a little discreet and not so good, but they look nice. I like dinosaurs when they are cunning and friendly, they are nice, friendly and good. I like (almost) all the characters, especially Elsa and Cecilia, but of course I like the others. Overall, I like this movie a lot! :-) Recommended for: People who like animated movies of good kids, people who like dinosaurs, John Goodman and people who think circuses are not always what they seem to be? Enjoy! :-)
