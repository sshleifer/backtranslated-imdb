14 years since this show has taken place and is still the best performance. The font was 1st class, and the production was insignificant. This show would never be done today and it is a pity. I hope that if you are thinking about finding this show to watch what you are doing. <br /> <br /> AG came out in the year when I left high school at the time I was having a TV show, it was a set that gives you an idea of ​​why I first got to this show. AG was a much better program with better writing, but he only had one reason? I know it's not the only one that has only one season, another example that comes to mind, would be a lone shooter (x files separated), had good writing and was funny but also had only one season. It does not look good to me! <br /> <br /> We also have to remember that this show was before the show as a twilight created the dark 'cool' shows, so I think it can also let the show go uphill. <br /> <br /> Watch this program and enjoy it! 10 out of 10 for me.
