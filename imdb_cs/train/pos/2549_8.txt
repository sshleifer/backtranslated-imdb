The beautifully urban Ronald Coleman is presented here as in several of his films. He is literally in every scene and this comic film stays fresh for him, not over him. He is handsome, funny and very clever because he is a step ahead of his traveling, beautiful woman - perfectly played by Anna Lee. The film is based on the French game and brings all the best qualities of this farce. Most supporting cast is well known, at least face, if not the name ... and are absolutely perfect for this very fun movie. Fantastic Mr. Coleman is a combination of Sean Connery and Clark Gable as he stays ahead of other characters. His multi-talents can be further rewarded in the classic "Lost Horizon" that every film fan must see.
