First of all, I do not understand why some people find this film so anti-American. Of course, there are moments when the US is blamed directly, like the Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach and, to a certain extent, Mira Naira. But come on, they are not naive accusations; instead, they are based on real and documented facts, and all the documents issued by the CIA about Chile confirm this, for example. But to return to the film itself, what I enjoyed most about it is the different moods that we find in it. We find children who are educated to respect all the people who have died at this event; we find an unfortunate couple that will change the tragedy of that day; we find ordinary people who have their feelings aggravated in the shadow of the September 11th events and react differently, with dignity or frustration; even to find someone in the movie for whom they fall for reason for a moment of real happiness. All of these visions, and others - as powerful as these or even more - make a consistent mixture and help the viewer to look at how different people spreading around the world responded to the events of September 11. So what we see is a panorama that is much more complex than white and black, and it can cause some people to be angry; but this is the world in which we live and there is no place for maniheist ideology, no matter what the presidents or priests tell us. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think it's a shame that there is not even the release date of this movie in the United States. It's a shame because most American people are wondering why this catastrophe has happened and this movie could give them some clues. This film very clearly - differently from what some people think of this forum - that everything we do today determines our future and that past mistakes will affect how we live today.
