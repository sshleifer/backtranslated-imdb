There have been many Zorro movies over the decade, but it is a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least visible. <br /> <br /> The Zorrova Combat Legion is a bit different from other Zorro films. First, it's a replica series in 12 chapters. And this time Zorro is not playing a top studio star such as Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas, but instead actor as actor Reed Hadley. While Hadley does not have such a powerful presence in the management as the others, he does a reasonable job, helping him not to be the only hero here; as the name implies, has a fighting law you can call. Another big difference is that this setting is not California. The story takes place here in central Mexico in 1824, when the man who lives as a living god encourages Indian residents and a group of independent people to help him in the plan to overthrow the newly established Mexican Republic. Something, Zorro and a handful of followers are planning to do anything to stop them. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, there's at least one incredible cheese moment in an episode, from corn "twang" bow sound effects to absurd behavior. But overall, it is one of the best Republican series ever and probably the best Zorro. <br /> <br /> This plot is stronger than most of the series and will never become incomprehensible or meandering. events - Indiana Jones movie fans will notice THE BIG BITS borrowed from this series.
