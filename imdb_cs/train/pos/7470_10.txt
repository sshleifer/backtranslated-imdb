I went to see Vanilla Sky with huge, huge, huge !! Tom Cruise fan, my extremely cynical brother and my girlfriend ... what can I say .. I was completely blown away by the film and above all the performance of TC, I thought it was a very moving movie and it was not what I expected. I read reviews and decided not to see it, I'm so pleased to be "forced" to see it. The strange thing is that I can not say why, all I can say is that I thought it was totally involved and could not stop thinking about it the next day. As for what I did about the film, I can only say, it's NOT STORYLINE (fantasy, psychodrama, anything) about people and events shaping their lives, and how small events like getting into a car can change everything ...... Regarding what the critics wrote, maybe the original was a stunning 2nd film for Alejandro Amen√°bara, but it was a completely different interpretation of this theme and in no way a narcissistic remake in favor of Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. <br /> <br /> I can not even consider writing a couple of trite, glib sentences to describe the movie just go and see it !!!! <br /> <br /> Yes, I know this is not a balanced and thoughtful overview, but what. It's not such a movie.
