This beautiful story of an older son who returns home and learns to love and be part of all the things he has left home to get away is feverish and moving. It shows the company that is perhaps strange to us in the Western world, with the family we lost. The story is beautiful, sad and occasionally entertaining and funny. He has a sense of realism, which is not in our western films. <br /> <br /> The performance is unusual because the film progresses, almost giving the impression that it is not a documentary film of ordinary people. This is brilliant direction and film making. I would like to see more of this director's films.
