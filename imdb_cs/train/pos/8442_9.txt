The film was excellent except for some scenes with Esposite. I liked the association of every detective on the series and wrapped some phrases that were never solved during the series (thanks to NBC ...). It was great to see Pembleton and Bayliss together with their most human and most basic people. Braugher and Secor did a great job, but as usual they overlook. It hurt to see it was the end of the Murder. The memories, tapes, and records at CourtTV are just not the same as watching it appear every Friday. The film, however, did its job and did it very well, featuring a great display of life after retiring Al and the family relationship that existed between the unit. I really liked it.
