I really enjoyed the drama by Sidney Lumet. The best word I can sign up for is crazy. It fits the viewer for one hour and fifty minutes and does not let you breathe until the credits begin to return at the very end. Trust me, this movie will guess you all the way. The story is very well crafted and almost awesome. It's almost like a more complicated story of the Tarantino type. The effects are amazing from all the guides and even from small parts, excellent cast. I also loved cinema, giving it a real feeling as if it were an independent film. Everything was great. The film is excited, exhausting and heartbreaking. It's almost hard to watch, but you'll be glad you did.
