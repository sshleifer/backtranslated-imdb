I did not see this movie! At least not completely. I saw some spooky clips that let me move to see it all. One sequence remains in my memory today. A spacecraft (very persuasive) orbits around the dark side of the Moon. The pilot releases the flash to capture the hidden surface beneath it. The moon flashes into visibility. . . . and for a few seconds there is. Parallel lines, squares, It could be ... then the light disappears and a short glimpse of what ... was ... and it's time for the spacecraft to return to Earth. Great. I've seen some other clips, but LOVE would get the whole movie.
