Although critically furious, Johnny Dangerously is one of the most funny movies I've ever seen. It is a film that should be closely watched; some of the funny bits are made in the passage and do not have the usual amount of attention on them. Take a look, for example, that Michael Keaton uses a pet cassette price ... and also in the documentary style that appears at the beginning of the scenes. It's one of those precious movies where humor unexpectedly hits you, even if you know it's a comedy. Amy Heckerling, the director, is really sharp - If you liked her famous movies (Fast Times on Ridgemont High, Clueless, European Holiday, etc.), you should look. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton is extremely appealing in the title role and the supporting cast (Griffin Dunne, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Piscopo, Peter Boyle) is excellent. Highly recommended.
