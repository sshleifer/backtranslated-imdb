Though it's not the best anime I've ever seen, I liked Lady Death. I never read a comic book and I just saw it at a video rental shop and decided to give it a chance. <br /> <br /> The animation was fine, I feel the 80's anime from what it's that's for me. Why everyone else hates what's out there. <br /> <br /> Character development was fine. I like how they brought the transition from Hope to Lady Death. For those who do not like it, they probably did not pay attention. Lucifer tells you how it happens, and she used his words. Creamtor was a nice mentor / soldier for her. its dark, wavy style was perfect for this type of film. I think everyone here who just needs it looks at it again and reconsiders it. causing everything that people did, it can be said about Everyone's favorite anime Vampire Hunter D
