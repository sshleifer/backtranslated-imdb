Although I can not claim to be a fanatical comic, I've read my share, so I think I'm part of this audience and I was not disappointed. By the end, steam is running out, it's almost full of ideas, and Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, seems to stay on the floor. Also a bit of Hank Azaria's Blue Raja can go a long way. Still, it's easy to forgive all these mistakes when you have a movie that's so fun. It seems that all actors have their roles, especially William H. Macy as Mad Crazy Shoveler and Janeane Garofalo as The Bowler. And unlike some, I found the city's design to make the joke even more fun. I really liked how disco was the music of choosing the bad ones; somehow seemed appropriate.
