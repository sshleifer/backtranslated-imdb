I always enjoyed Kenneth Branagh's version of Shakespeare's classics, because he always does a very good job, but in this film, the one who picks up the film is no one else than "always great actor" Laurence Fishburne. Surely he has a bad decision in the movies, even though he's a great actor, but in this we really gave Othello a true passion, the intensity of jealousy that becomes stronger with the purely paranoid Fishburne, and finally we got the black Othello! I do not think they would have chosen a better Othello. Who else could give him such a mixture of sympathy / antipathy, love / hate and not forget those fiery eyes ...? Branagh is as good as ever, but not at its peak, Desdemon Irene Jacob is quite good but a little nasty, while Laurence Fishburne really raises it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie. Watch it.
