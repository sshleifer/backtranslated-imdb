When an actor has to play an actor's role, fictional or factual, the task becomes much more difficult than playing a role. In Double Life, Ronald Coleman overcame Anthony John, a tortured double person. He put all his talent and sincerity into this character. Facial expressions, manners, walking, and stance spoke eloquently about what Anthony John was going through while playing Othello on stage. Coleman also performed extremely well as a Shakespearean actor in those short Othello scenarios that were part of this precious film. Clomky Coleman's face, when Othello had torn his doubts about Desdemony's fidelity, was themselves scenes that were worth attention. We add to him his desperate nature, and only someone with Coleman's depth of acting perception can achieve. It was like watching Spencer Tracy as Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, except that this double role was much deeper and most important. Shelly Winters looked so sweet, vulnerable and gorgeous at the same time and added her talent to the movie. It is believed that Ronald Coleman liked his role in this film above all the others he played and continued to win the Oscar for Best Actor in 1947. I would see this film repeatedly and never get bored.
