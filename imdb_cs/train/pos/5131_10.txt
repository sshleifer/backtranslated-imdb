Jammin 'the Blues is a short Oscar nomination from 1944, which is essentially 10 minutes of improvisation jazz in one long jam. Marie Bryant sings "Sunny Side of the Street" at one point for the film radiating and then shaking Archie Savage to bring this most fun "jam session" to its exciting end. Director Gojn Mili was a photographer and this experience shows in some of the double exposure shots of some musicians that make this one of the most innovative angles of the 1940s. According to some notes, I read that one of the musicians was white and had to be filmed in a silhouette reflecting the social attitudes of time. What a shame. Yet this is the most unusual film of time available on YouTube, so if you love jazz, I suggest you look for it.
