Claire Denis Chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating movie. The film presents a very interesting look at the household of the European colonial family living in Cameroon, giving the viewer an insight into the lives of many characters and their interaction. However, the development of these features is often poorly developed. For example, the central theme of the story is the young French inability to build strong relationships with others. Although this image is flawless, especially as Denis creates a story about the return of France to her childhood home, a girl's lack of intimacy with other filmmakers makes it harder for the viewer to invest heavily in her development (or lack thereof) as a protagonist. The general stagnation of film character development makes it difficult to engage in freely organized conspiracy. The film creates a great tension between the characters, especially between Aimee and the men in her life, but she never fully deals with this social friction, so the viewer is not satisfied. The last scene is powerful but depressing. Denis's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical point of view, but if you're looking for a movie with adventure or drama, Chocolat is definitely not the best choice.
