After the first look at it, I was infallible and devastated - many parts of GRAY GARDENS are very entertaining and incredibly surreal - not a documentary about it, it really gives Fellini or David Lynch a win for their money in strange lotteries. I was still concentrating on how these women (who are clinically far behind eccentrics) are revealing their own humanity in the most embarrassing ways and wondering if their retreat from the world was caused by something that transcends the life of life in the unbelievable blue blood universe, perhaps some abuse , or perhaps just a stream of resistance and rebellion that has turned away from its control and took its own life. This could be one of the biggest movies that get dangerously close to exploitation without going all over the edge - as the girls do their thing, I noticed things like empty jam bottles in a bedroom blurred in ruins, cats were urinating on the bed, cancer from the holes in the walls, and the final scene looked incredibly sad - like a birthday party of a child that was seriously ill. It is definitely worth seeing and looking - you will never forget it, but it is very worrying.
