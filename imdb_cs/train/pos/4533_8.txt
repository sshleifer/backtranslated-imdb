For the first time, when I saw the first feature film of Buster Keaton, I must admit I liked it a lot and I just wished I had a few years ago. Rohauer's advertisement warns in the beginning that a three-year-old nitrate print was re-discovered and rescued in 1954 just before the incineration, and many frames that looked hopelessly glued were separated. So it's rock sightseeing in places, but I saw it and I survived much worse. It was okay like 3 short films, but as to Take Intolerance, it's imaginative and funny from the beginning end: At the time of the stone with Baddie Wallace Beers the horse elephant and adventure Buster on horse pet brontosaurus; At the Roman age of Buster riding a car with bicycle shutters and adapted for tobogganing, no parking marks in Latin; In this technological Age of Speed ​​Need and Greed his car beautifully falls into pieces on the first hump. Both and Beery are behind the Age Girl, never ending. Favorite bit: Because the caveman is knocked back over the edge of the cliff, but still kisss the camera - an amazing second or two! Great things, confirming my love for a quiet film comedy.
