This is a masterpiece in B / W 35mm film. The movie gives you a strange way to start the day at 7:35 pm in the bar and how many can happen there in 8 minutes. A short surprise gets you into a complicated story with very few elements and step by step you realize that something is not quite right. It expresses a lot, makes your adrenaline tall with fine details and is incredibly comprehensible to everyone, not just for cinema professionals. But I know how it sounds: European short, black and white and low budget. Do not be scared. It's really worth seeing someone, not just experts in this genre. It does not really work because the movie lasts exactly 8 minutes (exactly) and I do not want to spoil it. I just watched it online and I could not understand why nobody spent a few minutes commenting on it. <br /> <br /> Really worth watching. 10/10.
