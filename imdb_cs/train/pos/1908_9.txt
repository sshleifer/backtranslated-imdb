This show is beautifully finished. When it first appeared, I was nothing but a reckless family comedy with quite a few good unicorns. It seemed that many families were really well expressed, with different concepts both parents and children, however, as I said, I never thought it would be a lot of watch in the evening. However, my gaze was shot in the second window when the tragic death fantastically witty John Ritter accumulated. The program stood out as ground and really praised the life of the character in a very sensitive way that touched the hearts of all the admirers of John Ritter, a fantastic actor with a talent to do anything. When the show was broadcast on Ritters' crossings, I really wanted to just give my father a hug and let him know how much he meant to me. I thought that this glimpse threw the acting talents of three children, especially those Bridget characters who were afraid of the last words she had told him. It reminded me that no matter what I do to a scary father, I do not mean and it's very important that she knows it. Great show
