Though I like EE's "Doc" Smith and David A. Kyles book Lensman, an anime that is loosely based on books, is quite a fun and somewhat innovative fair. Although the story may seem familiar to Sci-Fi / Fantasy fans, for example, a child on an isolated planet inherits mystical powers and avenges the death of his family, it's absolutely fun. In addition, Lensman was the first Animated movie to use animated animation and CG animation at one time. Sure, it may look a bit obsolete, but it's still innovation. If it was not for Lensman, none of this would ever happen (I personally think computer graphics look better in the animation that lives.) <br /> <br /> It's a shame that they only released it on DVD / VCD in few countries in the world (mostly in formats that are completely alien and different). I just wish to release the Lensman movie and TV series on DVD / VCD in all parts of the world, not just certain parts. Stay Rules! I just think it's so amazing and elegant.
