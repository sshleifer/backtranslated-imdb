Look, if I was interested in Nancy Drew's book, what would I do, pick up the book and read it. I'm not. From the moment I remember, I read people who destroyed the movies because it was not like a book. I'm sorry - in the digital age, we can no longer watch movies on flip books, but I'm sure you can still find some short silent movies in the book. When the Lord of the Rings came out, people complained. When the third was Oscar - "The book was better." When I watched how to kill Mockingbird, "the book was better." Now a lot of people are upset because Nancy Drew was not like a book. I'm not saying Nancy Drew will win some Oscars - if anything, it's one of those Nickelodeon Blimps or Kids Choice Awards. I'm saying you're gonna break the movie. It's a movie, not a paper. As a film I found Nancy Drew quite nice - he introduced the cameras by Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg (Hebrew Hammer) and supporting the role with Tate Donovan (Jimmy Cooper at O.C.) and Rachel Leigh Cook (she is all). It's the first time I've ever seen Emma Roberts in the movie, and frankly, I like her work more than most of Julie and Eric; her character remains consistent across the film and responds well to the conflict. Bright film in the spirit of Harriet Spy is nice and again. I give him ten stars because I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, I would love to see it again and probably buy it on DVD release.
