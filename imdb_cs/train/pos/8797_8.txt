Great idea: 11 stories about 11 September. 11 directors from different countries with different results. Ken Loach talks about immigrants (as usual) is just great (as usual). The French also does a very good job, while the film Burkina Faso was a surprise. But the Israeli film was a bit boring and a Mexican man should stop driving and working in a Mexican restaurant. 8/10
