The famous words of the owner of the international night club, Roman Maroni, "Dirty Cork Sprout", who spends the film not only as a rival to Johnny Dangerous, but also speaks English. Another underestimated classic that you can only find in afternoon's matinee or "Late Late Late Show" by Johnny Dangerous is a wonderful satirical hit about a good heart that secretly leads the life of the crime to help pay his mother's medical care and give his brother through law school. br /> <br /> Yes, it's a story, but who cares? The theater, which includes Joe Piscopo, Dom DeLuise, Marilla Henner and Alan Hale Jr, awaits you until you see what's going on. <br /> <br /> There are too many laughs to get here. Just like an airplane, you have to pay attention or you forget something. We highly recommend anyone who can laugh or two!
