I've seen this movie twice with teenagers who love him. This should be a culture! Best Line: "Your clothes are deeply cold!" says the prince to Cinderella. Kathleen Turner shines like a stepmother. I also like cars and motorcycles from the 1950s. The Melancholic Prince is a great departure from a typical swashbuckler. She tries to stay cool, but she can not hide her love for the fairy-tale princess. Her slippers are not glass (true to the original story), but Cinderella loses, but it gets her back from the heir to the throne. My only complaint is that it does not appear more and seems almost impossible. Hopefully, Blockbuster or Amazon will begin to store this sometime soon.
