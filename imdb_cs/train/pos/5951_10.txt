Stylishly guided, picturesque and great acting? Crosby's interpretation looks absolutely right, Hardwicke has his best role at all, while Bendix is ​​also a cure? this Yankee challenge is universal and irresistible. One of the main pleasures of the film is, of course, songs. As expected, Bing is in a good voice. And although Hardwicke's solo was cut, we still hear him sing when he's dancing cheerfully with Crosby and Bendix in their famous new "Busy Doing Nothing". It's also a funny one heard by Rhonda Fleming, who, although she liked the big scene and the concert career as a singer, was rarely in the cinema willing to be heard. It has a beautiful voice that is more than just the same with its exciting looks and looks really cool in Mary Kay Dodson's costumes. Director Tay Garnett gains from his rich budget the maximum thanks to all the resources on his command to make the most effective presentation of every wonderful scene. (Maybe the eclipse looks a bit foolish, but who is complaining?) In short, as the pendant actually describes, entertainment pleasure from beginning to end.
