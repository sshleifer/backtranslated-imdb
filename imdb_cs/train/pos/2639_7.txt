Being a fan of the first lion king, I was definitely looking forward to this film, but I knew there was really no way he could be as good as the original. I know that many Disney fans are cautious about direct video because I have mixed feelings about them. <br /> <br /> When watching The Lion King 1½, I tried to find out what the view of this movie was. Will I be so dedicated to the Royal Lion that I'm crazy about certain scenarios, or will this film just look like the Lion King's story? Most of the time I found myself embracing the other. <br /> <br /> The Lion King 1½ definitely has its cute and fun moments. Timon and Pumbaa stole the show in the first film and definitely deserved the film that centered around them. People just love these characters! My favorite moments include the Timon & Pumbaa assortment, which cares about young Simby and a surprising end representing some great portraits. I could have done it without a lot of jokes in the bathroom, though as real reasons why everybody worshiped Simba at the beginning of Lion King 1. I think the jokes are for the younger set (which is the end of the target group.) I do not think many children are really concerned about Disney's direct profits.) <br /> <br /> However, I would say that I was somewhat angry when I directly linked scenes from the original movie to this movie. I'm too familiar with the original that the scenes just rose like painful thumbs. Something would be different from music or voices that would simply turn me away. As for music, it was not bad, but do not expect that some of the classics will come out of this movie. At least LK2 had nice ballads, "Love finds a way." As for the voice, it was well done in this film. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella have done a great job as ever, and even new cast members, classic comedian actor Jerry Stiller and Julie Kavner (best known as Marge Simpson) are also a great job. You can even enjoy these great voice talents by viewing virtual Safari on DVD 2 DVD. This feature is definitely a lot of fun! <br /> <br /> So, in all, The Lion King 1½ is not a perfect movie, but it's cute and fun. I think many Lion King fans will enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is - a fun and carefree insight into the masterpiece of Lion King from the perspective of our funny friends. My IMDb rating: 7/10. My Yahoo! Stage: B (Good)
