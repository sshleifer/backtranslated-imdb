In a word - excellent. This is a movie. Go and see. Director Ron Howard ... I think director Ron Howard did a fantastic job as usual. Unbelievable attention to detail, vibrant colors and decoration, stunning Whoville atmosphere, stunning variety of costumes. Wait, it's more than that - the story is also good. It is clear that a message that is courageous for viewers. Jim Carrey is top-notch. He is probably the best Grinch possible. The girl, Taylor Momsen, is really good. I'm sure he has some great future. The dog is fine. Overall it's a very good Christmas fairy tale. If you like fairy tales, it's for you. If you like Christmas, it's for you. <br /> <br /> Read some more reviews here ... Get your life. It will spoil me every time I see people who ... well ... they got their hearts two too small.
