I'm not saying that, just like a fan of Chris Rock, I say that like a man who had little expectations for this film and turned out to be bad. The first mistake was that everything was over, that everyone had come. After error number two, I found that chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock was fake. Ultimately, the acting in this movie was a sub-par with the best actor being Regina King and the worst is Mark Addy. but I saw the mistake and saw a solid comedy. In the heads-up scenario you can watch that heaven may wait instead, it's better. So for all Chris Rock fans there, WATCH THIS FILM, you will have fun. In this movie he has some good standing. <br /> <br /> Total: 7 of 10
