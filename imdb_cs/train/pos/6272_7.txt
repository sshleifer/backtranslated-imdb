<br /> <br /> I once saw Earth without a Human (1987) - IMDB link http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093638 - and found it ok. The film is about a man who only steals Porsche. It's going in sixty seconds and it's coming 13 years later. In fact, he has a lot of scenes that are worthless. And the end is very, very bad. <br /> <br /> The Sphinx has a magnetic screen that should be better used ...
