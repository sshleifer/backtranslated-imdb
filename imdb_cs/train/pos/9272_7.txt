This was the first of the Panahi films I saw, I saw it at the Melbourne Film Festival. I was completely absorbed by the different characters she creates, and how they react and behave differently to the Aussie children, and yet at other levels alike. I think that if more people saw such films, they could see people as individuals and avoid racism, which can often be driven by the fear of an unknown. There are obvious big political differences between Oz culture and Iranian culture, but I have found the finer differences between the characters that this movie is so successful on the screen, which is immensely fascinating. The characters that seem to me are unique. I find that these characters become hostile.
