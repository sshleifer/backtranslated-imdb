What more can someone want? It is a history lesson, a foreign language interpreter, an NRA representative, and an ambassador in Burundi, dressed in a nice silk scarf and heels. I laughed so hard I left a puddle. His troubles about puberty, transvestism, public school, and in several languages ​​have made the absolute best quality routine I've ever seen. I think a few years later when I see a cake (tea and cake or death) and I hear something translated into French (the mouse is under the table, the cat is in the chair, and the monkey is on the branch) version of what Jerry Dorsey could name before before settling on Englebert Humperdinck, I really hope to see much more from this great guy who has a lot to learn and a great way to say.
