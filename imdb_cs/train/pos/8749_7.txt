I loved the film, but like everyone else said, there were some bits that were not well developed. Personally, I thought the girls were very useless before they landed in jail; surely, they should have been innocent American girls, but still ... I felt like they lacked the bond that the best friends should have. For example, in the assembly where they look at the views, the way they held each other for the photo was very clumsy. <br /> <br /> Then there are some parts that were very ambiguous. I think it's quite understandable that Danes's character did not do it, but I see how it can be confusing. Also, why did the camera after Manat's smile really spoil after putting the bags in the taxi trunk? I thought it suggested something, but it turned out that it was nothing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the movie was great. I cried when Claire Danes blamed; she is a great actress. I also wanted to see that frightened Thai prisoner kicked her ass. Talk about lack of closure ...
