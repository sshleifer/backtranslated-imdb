I really enjoyed this movie, it was good and the actors were great! Leon Robinson, who played Richard and many other classical singers, is very good at his work when you see him in a musical movie, you know it will be good! I would suggest that people watch this heart warming, a sad and special film if they want to know more about Richard! Excellent! Fresh!
