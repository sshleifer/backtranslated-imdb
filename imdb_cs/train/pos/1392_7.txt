The bizarre, trippy, forgot about the story of a low budget sci-fi about William's family living in the desert of California. They are witnessing a number of events that grow up in their curiosity; are apparently captured in warp times, where past, present, and future collide. This is an excuse for the show of very fun special effects - constant lighting and sound shows, dinosaur-like beings wearing, a friendly and tiny little ET that enchants a granddaughter and so on. This image shows a bit of fantasy if nothing else. <br /> <br /> Very nice music by Richard Band, taking special effects from people like David Allen, Randall William Cook and Peter Kuran, and, importantly, a family that is enjoyable, are key assets. It creates a sense of childish astonishment; it can be very good that it's more about children (or children in many of us) who are able to hide some shortcomings in the story or presentation. I found it hard to resist; it's a short and sweet (80-minute) diversion and a decent credit for director John "Bud" Cardos ("spider kingdom") and executive producer Charles Band.
