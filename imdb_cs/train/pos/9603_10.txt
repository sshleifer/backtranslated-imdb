I have one word for some movie, WOW! I saw "Darius Goes West" at the Tribeca Film Festival. People in the theater sobbed. This film shows the hardships that Darius suffers from muscle dystrophy. The film was very well done and you really became a part of the film, they were so emotionally moving the movie because it reminded us that we are lucky to be perfectly healthy, some people in this world are less random than we are. And sometimes we should give them a snake and help them to the end. I would give them the ten stars that Darius gave when they were not asked to do so for the money they made for a friend in need, Darius, the world should know, Darius went west.
