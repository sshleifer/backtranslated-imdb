Some have compared this to Deliverance. I believe that mice and men are more suitable. The leading man, Heaton, surely loves Spike. It is irrelevant and immaterial, be it sexual love. That's why Heaton does not leave Spike. He needs him. They need each other. As brothers, as a family, as the only connection to humanity. Settings, scenario, minimum cast are credited to fine film. Honestly, I did not care what happened to the characters. But I cared for what the filmmaker did with them. He did them well. I spent some time wondering how it would end up resembling a mouse and a man. The soundtrack and the cinematography were convincing and interesting.
