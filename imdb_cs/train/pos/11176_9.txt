Okay, I first have to point out the fact that when I first saw this movie, I was 9 years old. If I first saw it two weeks ago, I probably would have noticed it was just another cheap-made horror film of cable television with some well-crafted scenes. But when you have nine, it does not matter. That scared me, especially those Zelda scenes mentioned above (and they still do). Today I approached this film. I have to see it once a month, and every new evening I look at it with 12 pints of beer and a bunch of friends. It's like a starter for a good party! I agree a little with those people who say that acting is quite tireless. Midkiff and Crosby look like I want Louis and Rachel to look, but on the faces of these two do not see much devotion or feelings. Hughes and Gwynne are largely rescuing scenes they "believe". What I really want to say is the fact that there really is no other film that has any similarity to Petto Sematary, and I do not mean the zombie stuff. ATMOSPHERE OF THIS FILM IS SOME NEW AND ONE UNIT. Frankly, how many times have you seen a movie that looks like a cable TV on the surface, but leaves you with cold versus the only top horror guys? Well, I released some of the game spells a minute ago, but I have to say that all the pieces in this level are perfect for the overall performance to perfection. But hey, tell me if you really know a movie that's similar to Peto Sematary! I really would like to know ... And I do not mean the night of the living dead ... this is compared to these things compared to intelligence.
