Hurray! A space movie that is not prepared too seriously and everyone can embark on an exciting ride that is a space camp. The movie starts slowly, the usual mixture of idiots and high planes blends into the soup. But when it makes it hard - hard to get solved, and it's not a no-think change of figure, how can you believe there is some responsibility in their young minds. The only bug in the movie is that Kate Capshaw is extremely annoying as "I'm right and you're a bad" instructor. I would recommend it as a nice night in the movie and 7 votes.
