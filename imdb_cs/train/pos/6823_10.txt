Last week, I spent watching John Cassavetes' films - starting with "a woman under influence" and ending "evening opening". I totally and completely blew out, especially with these two movies. from the first minute to the last in the "opening night" I was completely and completely absorbed. I only experienced it a few times but the feeling that this movie was perfect lasts for about two thirds until the credits appear. everything about this movie, the way it was filmed, the incredible performance of Genes Rowlands, credits, opening, music, plot, sense of depth, tempo, tenderness, originality, characters, small moments ... for me are really noble. I could not agree more with the previous comment that I took him to the desert island because the depth of this film is something I'm looking at. if you have the misfortune of having home fire, I guarantee that instead of trying to save the secret of the money under the bed for the last time, you will instead protect your copy of this movie.
