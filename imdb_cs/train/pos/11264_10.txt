it was one of the most entertaining and enjoyable shows I've ever seen. This must be visible to anyone younger than 16 years old. This show of me and my two boys laughed from the beginning loud. I do not know if everything was true at the show, but the way it was introduced, there was no doubt that Mr. Wuhl was not only very well informed but also presented this information to the very happy college children who were present. If Mr. Wuhl ever decides to make this format again, he will have to rent a Georgia Dome-sized building to hold all the people who want to see it. I agree with the idea that this is an HBO series. It should be a great watch
