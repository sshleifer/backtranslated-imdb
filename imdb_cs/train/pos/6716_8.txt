Late, spectacular filmmaker Gramde Z, Al Adamson really overcomes this gorgeous sci-fi soft-core musical comedy, which ominously conceals deep and deep depths in the utter celluloid stupidity and stupidity of the jaws. In the grim totalitarian future of 2047, sex is considered an illegal act of a big brother, such as the impotent crazy idiot Controller (entertainingly miserable Erwin Fuller). However, sweet'n'sexy Cinderella (a vibrant blonde cutie cake Catherine Erhardt) is still determined to change things for the better. With the help of her feminine fairy-tale fairy-eyed (camper Jay B. Larson), Cinderella is taking part in a big ball ceremony with a special plan to seduce Tom's Prince (Vaughn Armstrong) and teach loved ones a positive, pleasant and fully acceptable activity. Adamson directs this ridiculous yarn with his usual incompatibility of all inches, introducing an incredibly terrible song and dance sequence with a total lack of skill and taste. The disturbing arrogant number "We all need love" with people in absurd animal costumes that are clumsily looking around the forest is a cheerful, spooky miracle; The equally nasty "Mechnical Man" routine featuring a lot of clumsy robots. Striking static cinematography by Ludwig Horvartha, tiny plastic miniatures, Groovy upset Disco scores of Sparky Sugerman, rich unconditional nudity (the glamorous hottie brunette Sherri Coyle guarantees special praise in this particular department), relentless attempts to humor humor (Roscoe Robot Code is particularly irritating), and (Renee Harmon's enormously flamboyant performance of Cinderella's unbridled overweight stepmother, who stands at the price of a big boob) is further enhancing the admirably rich cheese that can be enjoyed in this stunningly terrible jose.
