I first saw this video 15 years ago. I thought it was great and I still do it. I am a former English teacher (college and college) and a lover of English romantic poetry, so Coleridge is measuring me a lot. Anything that could aggravate the beauty of the poem or the power of the story would not make my excellent voice. In this case, everything works well to engage the viewer, especially secondary school students. The story is well illustrated for the generation that grew up on television. In addition, the voice of Michael Redgrave adds a sense of authenticity and authority. Well, there was not a big budget for the project. So it was not Star Wars and there was no CGI. Who can present the illustrations of Gustav Dor√Ω in the presentation? The abovementioned comment, which in four lines rejects the video as a piece of waste, is very unfair and unpleasant. I'm a friend of the producer, but this is not the reason for this remark. Rather, I advocate a work of art that I think has value at all levels. It is appropriate for Coleridge's poem to bring students to a way that will awaken their appreciation and awaken their sympathy for the lesson the old sailor handles.
