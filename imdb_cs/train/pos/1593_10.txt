The show features two sisters living together. Holly, who is younger, has some problems with teens, on the other hand, Sister Val has a job, a friend, a fiance, like most women on the planet. They try to support each other, they make mistakes sometimes, but they do not give up and continue. And the show is also about friendship. Priorities in life. I loved this show so much. It's funny and the actors are so good. I'm really sad that the show is over. I'm still looking at the time of the rerun :) Amanda Bynes is very talented. Jenny Garth can be a new comedy, but she is really good. It's one of the actresses I like. I like Vince and Holly's relationship, they are very natural. Gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh every time he appears. Tina Holly found a real friend, and I really like hanging out. The character of Lauren is so funny and it's a natural talent. I would like to see her more. This show will actually bring you and cheer up. I wish the show was not over.
