YES, the plot is hardly reliable and very thin. YES, acting ranges from average to laughter. YES, it was done so many times before. However, what we are dealing with is a film that does not touch these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is. There are really some original death scenes and tensions are increasing throughout the movie. Moreover, you are never more than a few minutes from the cruel killing. I urge everyone to watch this film with an unpredictable glance and see it for what it seemed to be; scary, funny slasher clicks with melody theme.
