This is a ghostly, powerful Italian adaptation of James M. Caine's The Postman Always Rings Twice, directed by the great Luchino Visconti. The film is so interesting that it transcends its source material to become something more courageous and original. (Camus also considers Cain's novel to be the main inspiration for his novel The Stranger). The film has more power and intensity than the novel because Visconti is able to create the film equivalent of Kain's narrative structure, but to offer more comprehensive gender exploration. Kain's very American novel is also uncritically fascinated by the construction of whiteness (Cora's leading figure fears that she will be identified as Mexican and embarrassed that she has married a Greek immigrant), which is not relevant to the Italian rural context, which is Visconti which allows class antagonisms, to get to the middle and dance between the heaps of a passionate, condemned love affair of two main characters. This film is a complex, exciting, enriching experience.
