Joel Schumacher When he decided for this film and this scenario, he decided, The story is well written and well laid out, and this completely new cast of 10 or 12 central characters was absolutely brilliant. There seemed to be six "leaders" and about half a dozen support, and by far this is the best thing about the film, the fresh young faces of tomorrow. It's been a long time since Hollywood touched controversial Vietnamese war films that say something about "a story to be told" (as Schumacher says) and Tigerland landed in this game of high-season war films. Yet it can not be described as a war movie because it seemed to be based more on the human spirit of Bozze and others. I think someone who wants to see a good film with all the special FX but just a good, expensive drama should go see Tigerland, of course Shumachers Best has been working for the last 8 years.
