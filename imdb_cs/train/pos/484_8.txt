Alexandr "Sascha" Lu≈æin (John Turturro) is a former leading chess player who is attempting to return to a tournament hosted in Italy. His gloss is undeniable, but his obsession with shame ended his growth in all other aspects of his life. Natalia (Emily Watson) is a beautiful heiress who came to the same resort with her mother Vera (Geraldine James) to avoid possible married partners. Vera leans to counting nicely, but Natalia is more fascinated by Saxony she met. Sascha is also accepted with Natalia and proposes marriage at her second session. But with the concentration that Sascha has to put on chess games, and when other events in its past still cause problems, will she get the heart of Natalie? Oh, and he can also become a chess champion? It is a wonderful film based on the novel Nabokov. She performs amazingly, with Watson very beautiful as a beautiful little rich girl, and Turturro confirms perfection as a shy and unpleasant chess enthusiast. James makes a fairly good turn because the mother and the other cast members are also great. As for the appearance of the film, it could not have been better. The scenery is varied, the vintage costumes are beautiful and cinematography deserves a lot of applause. Yes, this story is unusual and sometimes flashbacks say it's a movie that everyone will not appreciate. The end is also bitter. However, if you love romance, period pieces, great acting, discarded scenery or fine arts, do not miss this. You will be defenseless to resist your spells.
