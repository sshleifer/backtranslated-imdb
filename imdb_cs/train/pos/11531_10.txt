I remember being a child when I first saw this movie, it was my first horror movie (maybe that's why I still remember some of its parts). I do not really remember acting, naked scenes, or other things, but I remember the man having a grenade blowing his head, a man ripped over a tree and a man running down the truck and shooting in his head :) (Todd Schaefer, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland ). I also remember the last scene when Jennifer McAllister set off from her murderous stomach to get her car keys. It's a movie that gives you creep and is worth a look. But where can I find it? How do I download it?
