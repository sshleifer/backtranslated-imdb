It's been a few years since I saw it, but remember it and I'd like to see it again. This has become a "therapy" for me with my own personal experience. A thirty-five-year-old man is denying a college baseball game in which he "missed the ball" and lost his team. 20 years later, he thinks "if I just hit the ball" and how his life would be better for that. Then he gets a chance to find out ... and gets a little more than he negotiated. It reminds me when I was in high school, I tried my drill / dance team twice and did not do it. This team was the closest thing in their school. If you were on it, it was all. I have tried it for the last two years of the HS and for the second time I have done it really hard. I was annoyed and wounded badly just before the attempts, and I had stockings to cover the bruises, which made me fail to do it. It was in 1987. Over the years, sometimes sometimes, I think, "If I just did not make a leg, I would never wear the silly pantyhose." Now I'm not sitting and thinking that my life would be better or even different if I did, but when I saw this movie, I realized we never really know how it might be otherwise by changing one little thing back in the past. Who knows it could change the course of events so that I would not meet my son's father. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone who has interest in the past may change. Be careful what you want!
