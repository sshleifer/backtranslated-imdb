I saw True Crime when it was released for the first time back in the mid-1990s and I watched her many times. It's a big secret about Mary (played by Alicia Silverstone), an elderly college in California, who was tortured by a younger sister's classmate and killed by an unknown killer. Mary meets Tony (played by Kevin Dillon), a police cadet who sees it clear and decides to cooperate to try to find a killer. Many suspects in this. True Crime feels very "true" or real. I read a newsgroup report where someone wrote that there is a complete suspension of mistrust, and that's true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role, and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn are doing a great job just like other actors. The location is right in place, and the writer / director Pat Verducci really captures some of the teenage life and Mary's loneliness (see the scene where Mary awakes from a dream after seeing the photos she has taken from Tony). I wish Verducci made more movies. I did not see any other film that would look like a real crime. 10/10
