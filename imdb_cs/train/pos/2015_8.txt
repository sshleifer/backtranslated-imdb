This may not be one of the best movies ever shot, but overall it's a very nice, lightweight piece of foam that seems to all have a good time. We highly recommend that you feel comfortable. OK, so "acting" Frank Sinatra does not want much to be desired, but his singing is a great redemption and the songs fit perfectly into the romantic atmosphere of the film. Sinatra continued to shoot many other films where his undeniable acting ability jumped, but his first Hollywood opportunity, his voice, not his acting, is his main contribution to this film. I just watched them on TV, and it still keeps my mood as I did it for the first time I've seen it many years ago.
