Yes, some people have said that this movie is a waste of money, but I'm the kind of hard kite / world end / holy bitch action movie fan. But if it take me from my point it showed that this movie had some of the best action rings that were quite good. But his such a film that everything just dropped at the right time, or only when the evil had crashed something that had fallen to save them at the right time. Although there were some funny lines and gangs in the movie that surprised me. 3D graphics were pretty damn good. I mean for this kind of movie 3d effects were great !! The great battle that has appeared on the trailer feeds on any humorous film. The fight between good and evil at the end was, I must say it could be longer and slightly better, it was still quite good. Now on the parts that I think might have been better. The beginning was quite good, showing the parts that led to great battles. I mean, if you really do not want to see this movie in the theaters then at least it's DVDer ... Overall, I loved the movie, but the plot just fell into place to quickly and adapt to the harder plain.
