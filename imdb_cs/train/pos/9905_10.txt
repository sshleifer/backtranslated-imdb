I've lost the number of reviews I've written on Slaughter High. I read a lot of bad ones and I say that right now it's a fantastic movie. Simon Scuddamore soon became famous for his famous suicide, and although it was his only film, he made the film so great. Initially, I did not know about Simon until I read the suicide review. Then I found out that due to the current website at www.IMDb.com he was born in 1957 in Dayton, Ohio. Simon probably played the most recognizable character of a man, but his real life had, of course, his own strengths and weaknesses. He did a good acting job, who can not agree? I've always wondered how he felt naked in the movie. It must have been a little embarrassing. I first saw this movie when I was in the sixth grade 12 years. I agree with some indicators as if the girl did not experience when someone was murdered and the colleges did not have a tub! I think Caroline Munro, then 36, was the only star to have some dignified actor talent and unfortunately did not make any future movies due to Simon's death. The reasons for his suicide are mysterious and perhaps appear in the near future. When you do math on his website, he tells you he's 29 years old when he did Slaughter High. He looked like a teenager. I give this film two inches up, the best horror movie. Probably because of their terrible influence others did not make a glory in the film industry. -Jacob Young
