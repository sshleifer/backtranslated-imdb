Neil Simon is Sunshine Boys starring Walter Matthau and George Burns is a funny comedy about a strange link to life and his shortsightedness, but laughs always have a hot taste. Seeing Willy Clark (Matthau) and Al Lewis (Burns) two great theater actor comedy now reduced to imbecility from hard and constant age you can only feel anger and blue. Willy never gives up and continues to look for a job while Al is tired of the player and he's gone to the land in the house to his daughter. The couple in their old days was really funny and harmonious, but the scene was a sequel to the quarrel and quarrel, and eleven years after the break they did not speak. Now, if they work, they have to come back together once again to make one of their best tunes for a TV show comedy. Is the meeting explosive and liberating for old questions? Neil Simon's story tells the story of a jealous ghost and melancholy, and the blue amazement of many gags and laughs has made a great mix, thanks to the great pair of Walter Mattha (Best Academy Award nominee) and George Burns Academy Award as the Best Supporting Actor. These two actors are very trustworthy and real, and their harmony seems almost as they really work together all the time and that they do not take part in them. The film is also very moving due to its ubiquitous reality, because the story is narrated and the Love-Heat message, which binds two actors, is a real part of strange, but usually understandable things in life. My number is 7.
