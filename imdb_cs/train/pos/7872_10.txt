The first review I saw said, "What finally does Madhur bhandarkar mean?". He should say something so decisive. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful thing about not being a party. No propaganda at all. It's a movie that captures so many angles that are a problem (I do not know what I call the "problem" here), and although any average film does not work out a solution. I was so impressed when I realized that the film ended almost in the same scenario as it did. The film defines so many characters who have completely different priorities and different ideologies, yet they are all part of the system that is much more apathetic. I wish I could say more, but there will be more spoilers ahead of us. So watch if you want to see one of the most mature films of recent times.
