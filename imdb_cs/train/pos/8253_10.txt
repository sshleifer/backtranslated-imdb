This is the first movie I've seen last year! It's a badly funny, incredibly original, incredibly great prospect (it went on this super cool widescreen Technicolor look that's amazing to look at) and it really has a deep character and what it says about the company. It's a really sophisticated satire that infuses everything from Homeland Security to race affairs, and lets you laugh and realizes how much life is in the world in fear. Carrie Anne Moss turns into a comedy performance that I never realized will come of it! She is sweet, fun and sexy! Billy Connolly is great as Fido, who can only grind and moan! And Dylan Baker as a father is invaluable. In fact, the whole cast is perfect. Henry Czerny as a Bad Guy, Tim Blake Nelson as a Neighbor of Hot Sexy Zombie Girlfriends (Get An Idea Now?) Funny, though-provocative and just everywhere awesome! Go and check out this movie! It's like nothing you've ever seen.
