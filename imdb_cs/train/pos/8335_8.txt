While the effervescent chemistry between Ryan and Robbins is a good reason to see this film, complementary casts (including Matthau, Fry, Shalub, Durning and the joyful trio Jacobi, Saks and Maher) are another plus. Matthau shines like Einstein, Fry is perfect as Ryan's clinical fianc√© and Shalub's line of Einstein's gonads is, as noted, one of the highlights of the film. The speech that Robbins brings in his first public appearance is utter poetry. Kudos writers for having mastered this fool with joke and levity. I also thought Keene Curtis was great as Eisenhower. This could be considered a pussy movie, but I think everyone will get out of it. Eight very solid points.
