I fully agree that "nothing" is not a fantastic movie! I did not want to laugh so much when I was watching the film for ages! and David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are fantastic! they really work well! This movie does not have to refer to some people (I can not really say why it does not mess!) But everyone alone! I loved it and I strongly recommend it! <br /> <br /> The game is great and some shots are very clever. It looks as if they could have fun while filming! <br /> <br /> Although the film is actually only 2 main characters and not too scary, making the movie fun to watch.
