This movie is amazing and I would like to recommend it to both children and adults. The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting and the story is charming; much better than anything the American studio did at that time. However, there are several warnings about this statement. It's a shame that Disney has bought the Studio Ghibli studio catalog and then resolved it. My main point was that Disney nicknamed the movie, despite the original English version, which was very impressive. New cast with Van Der Beek et al. It destroyed and attracted many attractiveness of characters, eg Paz and Sheet went from adventurous companions to crazy teenagers. The original musical score is also much better than the Disney remix. The question arises as to why Disney has made such changes? It seems to me that if Van den Beek and others are to be occupied, Pak Disney can draw more money, which is fair enough, but in this process they desecrated the film. It's still a beautiful movie and I would recommend it to everyone. My main beef is that Disney destroyed the childhood movie I loved and still love. I am lucky to have original Japanese imports with an original English dab, which I will now protect my life!
