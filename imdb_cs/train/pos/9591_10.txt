Great documentation. I personally remember that she grew up in NYC in the early 1980s. This film is for anyone who was not at that time. This shows the only thing African American Gay Gay Underclass felt was theirs and the love and camadria you see is real. People are real and sadly few people are still alive, as it is written. The balls are still held, but not to the extent they were in the 1990s. That time is forever gone. This is good for the "homo thug" movie. When Queens were really proud of the extroverts. Goodbye to Storyville, it's still one more era, but a lot of hail!
