Eddie Murphy Delirious is undoubtedly the most fun thing I've ever seen in my life. When I first saw it two years ago, after a few weeks I was in the stitch. To date, I've seen it 17 times and still laugh. For those who do not know, Eddie Murphy was a great comedian before the Hollywood superstar. There is no blunt spot in this genius piece, unlike Eddie Murphy Raw, which was released in 1987, which became flat in the middle. If you are not such a person who can not complain, I would not recommend to you because you will probably hear an oath of any form every 5-10 seconds. I give it 10 out of 10 because it displays the greatest comedy genius of them all in its best form.
