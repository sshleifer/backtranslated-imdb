I first saw this movie as a teenager. It was at a time when heavy metal ruled the world. Trick Or Treat has every element for a movie that rock. With an actor who has the function of Skippy from family cows, Gene Simmons of Kiss and Ozzy Osbourne, how can you go wrong? Back bad news that are played on vinyl! Yes, it is true, they use records in this movie. In one scene, Eddie (Skippy) listens to a bad rockstar on his recorder when things get horrified. Monsters start coming out of the speakers and its stereo becomes obsessed. As a teenager I tried to play my records backwards hoping it would happen to me. Almost 20 years later, Trick Or Treat is still one of my favorite movies.
