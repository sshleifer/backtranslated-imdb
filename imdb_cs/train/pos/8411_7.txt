This initial version of "The Student of Prague" originated in Germany in 1913, starring Paul Wegener (who was also "The Golem" a few years later). In this film he plays a double role (technically impressive for a 95-year-old film that sees them in the same picture) after meeting with a mysterious old man who concludes a gold deal - the gold he needs to play the Countess he had previously saved from drowning . <br /> <br /> Moving at a fast pace (the film runs less than an hour) and relatively well written and characterized, 'The Student of Prague' echoes the legend of Faust and Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde, which begins just like a contract with a mysterious figure of potential evil and develops into the good and bad side of the same person.
