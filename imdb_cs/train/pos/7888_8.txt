Freddy Krueger, a dream stalker from ulm street returns, great actor Robert Englund is back in this sequel to Nightmare 5, sen child.i hope that I got the number right. There is so much and this is one of the best, especially for the guitar, Rosanne Barr (then Arnold), Tom Arnold, John Depp (who made the first nightmare in 84) Alice Cooper (singer) will see Freddy as a teenager, (Alice, live and let die) and Amanda Donahue (my father knows best) I was one of the people who saw it in 3d and at the end. I love 3d movies.i missed the first 3D wave in 1953 (I was not born yet) the second wave was in 1983. Like all Freddy movies. this one stands out as one of the better ones who counts the first one that was absolutely great, Freddy became a new monster of the 80s and 90s, with Jason voorheesem, Chucky, Micheal myers and leather face. Can you imagine the movie with everyone? I recommend this to all fans of Freddy and horror fans alike. that Freddy is such a cut up.8 out of 10.
