A fantastic fantasy movie in the universe. a group of children accidentally gets into space and has to go down, but they will definitely do it. It would not be a family film if everyone died. Then everything will be sad. You do not want Kate Capsaw, the front lady, to give the Golden Globe show, but sadly she and Lea Thompson did not get it. That's so bad. I can not say so much that this movie is so great, Lea Thompson, the perfect girl for this movie. This movie is best confident. <br /> <br /> We are sorry, but better than Star Wars. Star Wars is so overestimated, and the space camp was so underestimated. It should be on the contrary <br/> <br /> excellent 10 / 10- 0r maybe 11/10. I'm not good at math
