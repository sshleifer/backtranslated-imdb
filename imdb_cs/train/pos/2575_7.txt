I borrowed the film from Netflix for two reasons - I was in a mood because I thought it would be a stupid sci-fi-asco of the 1950s and because it's the first Superman movie. Needless to say, after about 15 minutes I found myself very thoroughly and very pleasantly surprised. The experimental oil gates penetrated into the ground for about six miles and was turned off by a sponsor. Lois and Clark appear to get the spoon, but they are disappointed that the deepest borehole will no longer work. A day later, strange events at the well make the story more suitable for Superman than Clark Kent. Radioactive men seem to have invaded their deep home, about 6 kilometers away, near the Earth's core. Superman and Mole Men are a simplistic but well-executed piece of social realism. Released in 1951, in the lead role of actor acting in World War II, the moral story seems to be that Americans are equally capable of becoming fascists like everyone else. To drive this point home in a typically straightforward Superman way, Reeves even accuses the lynching crowd of hunting Mole men being "Nazis" at one point. Even in the 1950s, the science behind this film was nonexistent. Six cubic meters of drilling across the continental bark would not penetrate the upper cloak, let alone the "hollow center of the earth" - which in no way exists. Forgive - keep in mind that this movie is based on a comic book of golden age. The film is somewhat unevenly developed. Although the Molemen are interesting, a little scary and well-portrayed, there are several Corman-esquire scenes that spend too much time excessively when they show us their strange behavior. The script is intelligent and economical. According to today's standards, costume is bad to fair, but for its time the special effects and costumes of this film are quite good. Cinematography is also generally very good, and acting is much better than you might expect. I was particularly impressed by Reeves, Jeff Corey and Walter Reed.
