I really enjoyed this movie. The effects of adult actors were great, even though I found the main child a bit stiff. But he did very well because he was a new talent. Humor is very noble and not like most Hollywood comedies. I.e. A necessary professor. If you have a short attention and you are accustomed to typical Hollywood things, you probably would not like it because it's a bit slower. I picked it up on Blu-ray and I have to say that the image quality is top-notch. Probably one of the better-looking Blu-ray I've seen so far. Extras were also cool. They deleted quite a bit, but it's probably a good thing, because most of the deleted scenes did not add anything.
