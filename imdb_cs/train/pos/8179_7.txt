It would be so fun to see in the theater, back in 1996. There is a corner of wine pleasure from a movie that truly appreciates really good shocking films. <br /> <br /> "Dentist" sometimes probably because people usually have strong feelings over dental affairs. Perhaps ADA has launched a campaign against it because dentists say they have to apologize for this film and for "The Marathon Man" (which has just one scene comparable to many in "The Dentist"). <br /> <br /> It's amazing to note that according to the trivia page, the film was shot in 21 days. Of course, postproduction may take longer than filming, and editing for "The Dentist" is perfect. Quick cuts increase the tension so much that in the scene where the dentist "cares" about his wife there are only two quick cuts that show what's going on. The rest is left to our very fertile ideas! Corbin Bernsen was a good choice for this role because he has a lot of experience and played psychologically "off" characters and he completely sold the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentist. <br /> <br /> For me, the motion of movies was just that. Film makers reveal the woman's inappropriateness in the right way. All the characters in the dental office look like they're real people working in a real office. There is a lot of tension when it comes to impatient people waiting for the dentist to come in. Meanwhile, the dentist is on the back of a huge psychotic outburst! Unlike many movies of this genre, the script is very tight. All victims fall into the trap of the dentist in a very computerized way. The two types of law enforcement will even engage in a small subplot, which will eventually create a shocking ending. <br /> <br /> Definitely not for a weak heart or dental phobia, but a real rollercoaster ride and highly recommended for smart gorefest fans.
