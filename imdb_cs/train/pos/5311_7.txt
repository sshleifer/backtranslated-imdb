The most accessible film, John Waters, is one of his best films, as it makes it harder for all the sparks and utter vulgarity that seem to have cast most of his previous work. Sure, nudity and sexual references are still there, at least it is presented in a fashion that can not be considered too disgusted or disgusting. Due to some great casting capabilities, this movie has really brought out a stupidity associated with the modern art and the subjective nature of your modern artist. Funny and somewhat carefree (if possible for Waters), it's one of the movies I would watch on a rainy day.
