40 year old virgin (2005) Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil and Kat Dennings. Hysterically funny high-end comedy about Andy Stitzer's title (greatly played by the permanent second Carell banana in a truly extraordinary comic breakthrough performance that is sure to be a stratosphere in the A-list), an e-commerce agent in Southern California who is (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, each about the level more entertaining than the other) decided to get their buddies averted regardless of the price. What follows is an unlikely but still very warm heart of romance with a lively mother (amazing Keener have a lot of fun here) leading to adding more fuel to the fires inside Andy. Surprisingly good and recklessly exciting romantic comedy; the most entertaining of "There's Something About Mary," with the clever attentive script by director Judd Apatow and Carell, which includes some stunning intestinal busts including David Carus's witty, accurate, impressively ripping rib, "date-a-paloozas" and demystifying gender war with irritating aplombou. Real winner and instant classic; the most entertaining film of the year.
