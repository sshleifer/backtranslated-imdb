Among the standard action liner films, where gaming and logic are controlled at the door, this movie is at the top of the class. If the person responsible for casting had a "good" cast in this movie, it would be worse (except for Richard Dawson, who really acted well if you could call yourself acting "acting"). I love this movie! A running man is most likely God's gift to man (well, maybe only men). Definitely the most quoteable film of our time, so I will share with you my favorite part: "It's all part of Brenda's rich lifestyle, and you'll make the F ***** g get used to it." Oh, more people were called "Brenda" because of the quote of this movie than I can imagine.
