What I can say, I grew up when I watched Hum Saath Saath Hain, Hum Aapke Hain Koun, and Maine Pyar Kiya. Soraj was always different. Movies are part of our life in evolutionary times. Soraj creates something that's hard to find. Love and a common family that loves and great. Vivah is the way for a couple who are trying to organize a marriage that turns on and ensures marriage. Shahid did a great job. As always, brilliant. Amrita Rao stopped working differently, though I thought it sometimes did not suit me. We saw her in Ishk Vishk and Ab to Baras and Main on Na. So finish another role you do not have. She was excellent at Main on Na and ishk vishk, but it may be that she could give a little more to the role. Anyway, great work by Barjatyou. This film remixes the values ​​we have forgotten. Sweet Movie of the Year. Great music and lyrics. I'm not sure if it's a remake, but any great story that's original. Soraya's movies are great, so we always expect something different from him. Great work of all listeners and everyone. A beautiful family movie that you can enjoy with your parents, siblings, friends and lovers. I give it 10 out of 10.
