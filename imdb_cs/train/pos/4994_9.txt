A man's lock is a wonderful example of the movie in front of the code. It includes realistic events with really nice and imperfect characters. Spencer Tracy plays Bill, a free soul without a tenth in his pocket. He makes a living doing a special job and travels to a new city when he is bored with his surroundings. One night she meets Trinou, beauty according to standards that is cool and lonely. She refused to resort to prostitution by not eating her for several days, but both of them were very good at each other and formed a relationship. His free spirit is tempting him to leave her, so life is rocky, but there is a real spark between the two, even though they live in the hut by the river. Tracy is one of the big actors in the silver screen. His characters are amazing and relatable. We can see his thoughts on his face so he can easily identify with him, even if we believe he is acting badly. Young is great in movies before the code. Her figure is very sweet, but far from perfect, making her even more mature. Predictions include skin immersion, pregnancy before marriage, and crime.
