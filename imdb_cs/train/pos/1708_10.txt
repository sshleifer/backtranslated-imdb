If you look at some of the negative contributions, you have to wonder what some people are doing for fun .... <br /> <br /> I was lucky to see the movie during its too short play. Spectators laugh at their heads. I watch the tape as I write, and it's still scary! <br /> <br /> It also has a sweet page with unexpected turns of true pathos. The late, magnificent royal Dana is especially effective as a lone farmer Wrenchmuller who is lucky. Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson are great as the main kids. And the actors in martian suits, even when limited to mime, do a great job <br /> <br /> Another thing to look for are background details. The film is full of honors, pastiches, and links to other SF and fantasy films. Check out the Martian costumes next time. One of them is wearing Marty McFly's costume, another is Ghostbuster, the third is in House Atreides uniform, and the fourth is wearing the Last Starfighter jersey.
