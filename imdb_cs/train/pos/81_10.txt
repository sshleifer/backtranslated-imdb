I was looking at McCoy's meeting and I was glad to see Richard Crenny and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez !!! I saw them now awesome because I always watched the show grew, so when the television said she was going to be so excited !! The only thing I could not figure out is why Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Lukas) were not there. I know Walter Brennan died. So I got to my computer and tried to find out about them and found out there was someone who could tell me what happened to Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke I would be grateful! everything I was lucky to learn about Michael Winkelman is to be born in 1946. This show was worth and morale, every show gave a lesson to learn. "The whole cast was undignified, the only one Than the thing to find out is to get them around to meet them because it's impossible if there is someone who can help please Thank you Glenda
