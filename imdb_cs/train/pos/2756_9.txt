I chose this film based on a summary of the plot and criticism on the back of the box. I'm not big in foreign movies and I did not know what to expect. I do not even care about the subtitles. But I absolutely loved it! It has a simple, nice quality that leaves you feeling good. I found myself laughing repeatedly. I would recommend this picture to anyone, even to those who are doing foreign movies with subtitles. This is the effort.
