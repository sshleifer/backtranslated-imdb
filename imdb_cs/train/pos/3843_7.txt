The first time I saw this movie in the theater at a foreign film festival, I thought it was an interesting, fascinating, sensitive bi-sexual artist. So very European and Dutch! I recently rented it for a second tour and I could barely laugh at the overworked theme of a mad writer with a complex of persecution of religious and sexual orientation. Capture! That guy is a freeloader living outside of society. I suspect that the real reason why these fantastic nightmares have a "spider" is that his guilt complex is born after a year when he ignores the mother's advice that he gets into the car (and bed) with strangers! Not only does she do a terrible amount of (probably taxfree) prey for storytelling (lying blame), but she's too cheap to pay for her hair and so she's struggling with the beauty salon owner. Then he has the nerves to complain to the bill! But I also think that this world has changed a lot since the filming of this film. It was fun to see some of Jan de Bont's cinematic works and one of Paul Verhoeven's previous films. Hmmm, maybe the world has not changed much after all?
