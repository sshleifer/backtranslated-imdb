Pialat films people in extreme emotional situations, usually with several violent scenes. In La Gueule ouverte deals with devastating effects on a husband and son of a woman when she dies to cancer. In sexual experiments a teenage girl leads to violent confrontations with her family. We have a somewhat spoiled young woman who leaves her husband to get a sexy ex-con. Her motivation is a bit frowned because Loulou is unable to read or discuss anything more demanding than television shows; on the other hand he has a great body (I wonder why Depardieu never created a sporting film that would show that he is a character - he would be great as a rugby player). Casting is impressive. Isabelle Huppert must not leave a gentle, subtle performance (she has many); Depardieu plays Loula with all the dynamics and spell you may want - see the scene in the bar where he is stabbed in the gut, running away and looking for treatment, and soon restarts with Nelly. Guy Marchand, with these black-eyed black eyes and desperate looks, plays Nelly's husband beautifully. it's a gentle repetition of pairing in Coup de foudre.
