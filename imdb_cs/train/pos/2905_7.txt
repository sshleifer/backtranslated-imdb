This is a very entertaining movie, easy to watch, which you enjoy almost all the time. The work of the director is recognizable and the kind of humor is his trademark. The film is a typical history of police partners, such as a lethal weapon, but jokes and comedies are of the Argentine type. The turning point is that one of them is psychologist Peretti and must go with Detective Diaz (played by Luque) for his assignments as he also helps (Diaz is concerned because his wife cheated on him). Some of the dialogues are merry around the world: it is understandable and ridiculous everywhere. Overall, it's pretty good, it would be 8, but I rated 7 because it finally drops a bit at the end. On a personal note, I have to add that it's "bravo" for Argentine filmmakers, given that little good has come lately.
