Every time this movie is on the BBC, someone in the radio magazine says how it is about satire against the postwar world of rations and the welfare state. I do not think this is the film at all. The film parodies spivs (the black criminals who run the blackmarket) and the league of the housekeeper who fought against government restrictions, but it was really a leading organization of Tory. Of course the film is broadcasting a political / social situation, but in the end people realize they need all the controls to ensure a just society, want to be British rather than alien. <br /> <br /> But I do not think they would go back to being just like before.
