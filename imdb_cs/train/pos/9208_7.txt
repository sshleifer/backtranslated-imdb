"Shooter" was another type of film for Michael Dudikoff. Although it is normally associated with action moves that include martial arts, this film, because it was Western, has allowed him to show he is a much more capable actor than it has allowed for certain lines of the story. <br /> <br /> The problem is, of course, that the film does not allow for any solid development. The artillery is actually left to the viewer. We can only argue about the sadness that caused the shooter, whose real name is Michael Atherton, the killer that he is - the killer, think that a small town, terrified by a local beast, welcomes like a hero that can emerge from his misery.
