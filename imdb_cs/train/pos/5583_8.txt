I gathered at least a few people who met on TCM on September 2. If you knew that Hedy had to change his name to avoid being linked to this movie when she came to the US. It was a huge scandal and I assembled that the original edition in the US was so chopped by censors that it was virtually incomprehensible. I watched because I just saw a documentary about "bad women," an actress in the American Premiere Censorship Proceedings, which was founded in the early 1930s. It seemed like they were gone with much more than Hedy's most "sensational" shots in "Extase". In fact, Hedy looked innocent in today's standards, and it was nice to see her beauty soon untouched. It was a nice, lyrical film that you can relax. I loved it for what it was: a simple romance. I looked at it after pre-recording during the sleepless early A.M. I would like to see the first version released in the US for comparison.
