There is a good reason why Walter Pidgeon warns Leslie Nielson and his crew from a seagoing ship that he can not dream of. As Dr. Edward Morbius, Pidgeon is the last surviving expedition to come to this planet 20 years earlier. Since then, he has married another expedition member and had his daughter Anna Francis. They are the only people left behind on this planet, once the home of ancient civilization known as Krell. The records Pidgeon deciphered show that Krell came to the cataclysmic end of an unknown origin. The machines they left are still working. Maybe they work too well, as the members of the relief party are starting to die and especially scary. <br /> <br /> I see all sorts of speculation about remake and that's one movie that can not be changed because it's as fresh as 1956. The terms would change, now we would call warp speed instead of hyper-drive, thanks Free Star Trek popularity. <br /> <br /> We could not see a man on an expedition with a relief in a flying saucer as a space ship. It may look much like Enterprise Starship or Space Odyssey 2001. It's interesting to look at sci-fi movies from different generations to see how the concept of the future changes. The story of Forbidden Planet is timeless, about the deadly beings who are trying to play God. /> <br /> You can not write about the Forbidden Planet without commenting Robby Robot. This mechanical miracle, compiled by Pidgeon with the knowledge he has gained from the Krell studio, has so far been completely affected. He gained new life in the 1960s with the robot figure of lost space. His scenes with Count Holliman, who plays the cruise ship's cruise ship and his compliance with the Earl's request for a homely mood, are very fun. Robby and other special effects were nominated for the Oscar, the Ten Commandments and the Red Sea. The forbidden planet is unlucky to stand against the founder of Hollywood, like Cecil B. DeMille. The classicists will recognize the Forbidden Planet as a futuristic reworking of The Tempest, which when you think it could be Shakespeare's science fiction business. <br /> <br /> My most favorite cast is Warren Stevens, who is a victim, allowing Leslie Nielsen to know exactly what he is doing.
