Ramones, whom I consider to be the founders of the modern punk rock scene, give them unique sounds to the incredibly twisted PJ Soles movie, which opposes the merciless, hopeless director (Mary Woronov) for rock law. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the soundtrack with incredible music, RRHS is fascinating in concept and design. It is full of restless visual gags (as a mouse experiment), a teenage spirit (probably my favorite most popular film opening) and bizarre moments outside of the wall scene. If you are looking for a movie that seems to be made of pure entertainment on a molecular level, do not go any further. But if you're looking for a nice, dignified and dramatic epic, maybe you should look a little more. <br /> <br /> "Hello everyone, I'm Riff Randell, and this is Rock & Roll High School!"
