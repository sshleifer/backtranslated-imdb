A great film, rather demanding than fun. Unfortunately, there are no unforgettable quotes, but this is my favorite: Alexandre: If you are leaving someone you love, you have to say what I am telling you now: "Come on, I'm going." But to disappear, hiding as a criminal is ignorant. (I did not see it with English subtitles) <br /> <br /> In my opinion it expresses everything. There are so many tactics in the relationship between Alexander and others, and yet everybody desires a little bit more truth. However, the knowledge of the truth may make it even worse as Alexandre is experiencing. The common interpretation is that the film criticizes the mere possibility of "liberated love" by displaying undesirable consequences for the persons involved. It will even prove it convincingly, but I would appreciate if the reasons were somewhat deeper: it is not so that liberated love itself is doomed to failure, but people (especially men, I think) should work on themselves and try to overcome the ruling morality before, and not through the exercise of liberated love. <br /> <br /> This means the movie is realistic and really worth watching.
