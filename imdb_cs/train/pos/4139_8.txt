I really wonder how this show plays in the US and in the rest of Europe. They are SO that they are an American (especially white Americans). This could be a great reason for some of the venom and vitriol expressed here on this plate. I like the show, but it is with some reservations and I feel it has solved the easy Spoiler Spoiler: <br /> <br /> Crashing and burning everything at the end of the second season. Julie slammed the door and closed any hope of reviving the show if her character did not stay in the snow in the middle of a farm. Who knows? It was a funny, angry and casual, scary show.
