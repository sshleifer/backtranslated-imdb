Delirious, almost irregular mood and if it's more LSD inspired than the devil, then we have to remember when it was made! After the awesome opening of the SM (which is not in itself what it seems) we get to fine focus and dream, or ideas or memories? Lots of literary and cinematographic references, and it is really Franko's film that Lang himself praised. The beautiful and fascinating film develops darkly but has the wealth inside each fold. Rare film that's raging. Old Jess could do it when he tried. Fine central performances including Jack Taylor and Howard Vernon. I did not even mention the Lisbon places - ah!
