I saw this movie without knowing what it was ... I'm a fan of Branagh, even more of his Shakespeare movies, and at first I saw it ... and I ended up with tears, because great, great serenity, influence and courageous philosophy on the life of Helen's girl. Recommended for people who are bored with a television program (at least in Spain).
