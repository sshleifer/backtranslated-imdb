I did not expect much from this, but I have to admit to laughing a few times in this movie. If you are not severely offended in the first ten minutes, it may be a movie for you. Likewise, if you're the guy who would watch Amanda Peet for an hour and a half mixing cards. It's definitely not a complicated job, but because of India's low budget, it's a masterpiece. To balance the playing field for comparison, imagine all the studio movies with their budgets cut by factor 100 or so and see what you get! Kudos to Peter Cohen and his network to see it. I look forward to his further efforts.
