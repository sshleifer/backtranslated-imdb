Currently, I am doing film studies at A.S. and "It's not Love" is the movie we've been watching, and in my opinion it's a film with a very simple story but a complex story. If you scratch that surface, you'll discover a thriller-chase movie of two men walking in the countryside after you've murdered: "Sounds quite up and running." uncover the true sense of the real genre. As indicated, it is a love story between two homosexual lovers, filled with trust, deceit and betrayal. We can not say about this "love" directly through the film, but the events that are happening, such as Heaton's approach to Spike, almost yell at this untouched love affair in our faces. Overall, this film is a good example of why British films should not be released as "garbage" just because they are run at a low budget. A good movie with a complicated storyline, but it is certainly a taste and probably not suitable for an average fan of Hollywood blockbusters.
