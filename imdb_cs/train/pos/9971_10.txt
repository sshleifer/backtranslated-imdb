This movie was great, I thought the original was a quiet average. But he got all the ingredients, the 1970 Hemi Challenger with a four-speed gearbox that really proves that Mother Mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars! I was in the Chrysler sky every time Kowalski stood on that big block of Hemi, and it definitely did a lot :)
