This film was an interesting Hollywood story about a novel with the same name Pearl S. Buck. While some today may think that it is full of racial stereotypes, at a time when the very thought of the Chinese protagonists itself progressed. I found out that the white actors who played in Chinese were not as bad as I expected it was not an Asian blackface equivalent. At that time, there were no Asian actors in America (and even George Takei did not participate) and Rainer did a good job with her. It was not the greatest performance I've ever seen, but for an old school that worked pretty. The grasshopper scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects. I wonder that the timing of release during the Great Depression will turn this film into allegory. Particularly political upheavals of a confused peasant farmer and how they seem to be abandoned by everyone. The film had some parallels with John Ford's style, but I think it influenced Eastern influence as well. If it were a Western family, the grasshoppers would eventually win and punish the farmer for their pride, desire and ferocity. However, here he learns his lesson, then wins.
