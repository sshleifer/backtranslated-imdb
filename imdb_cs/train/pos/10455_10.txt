It must be one of the most sincere and moving movies with the guys they've ever met. While "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Say Anything" bring nice portraits, these films ruin unnecessary subplots and Hollywood differences. This film focuses purely on watching the resurrection of beautiful romance. You never doubt that the film will lead to the romantic pairing of these two people. Almost instantly you will feel the synergy and the chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and it is simply pure pleasure to see how they found them. This film is mostly based on dialogue. But every conversation between them is also very interesting. What makes pairing so romantic is how real it is. As in all these conversations, although they often have no effect on something critical, you can feel the nuances of how these two build more and trust each other. It is exactly as you would dream of meeting that strange person. And what's so true is that it's not too fantastic to believe. It could be what would happen if you were sure enough to have an interview with the person you noticed somewhere at random. And what gives the ice cream to this film is the wonderful backdrop of Vienna in which this film takes place. This only increases the sense of romantic nirvana that the film suggests. And no matter how many times I'm watching this movie, I do not think I'll ever try.
