What begins as a very predictable and somewhat stupid thing is ultimately cheerful and fun. "The Right to Die" is not very thrilling, but it's more than it does with some unusual pieces and over the top. <br /> <br /> Spoilers here: <br /> <br /> Go to the deadly performance of Martin Donated as one of the deadliest characters that ever loved the screen. Playing the character in great "light-weight" mode, you almost feel bad for the guy when his magnificent plan eventually fails. Corbin Bernsen also chews up the scenery playing the not-so-good guy who gets his only desserts. <br /> <br /> Exit the Spoiler. <br /> <br /> As a revenge-from-the-dead movie, "The Right to Die" is heavily exploited by his artists and is more than just a way to spend less than an hour.
