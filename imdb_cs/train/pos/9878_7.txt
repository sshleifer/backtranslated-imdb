almost every review of this movie I saw was pretty bad. It's not bad enough, it's pretty good, though not great. Judy Garland might be unpleasant, but she did not allow it. Somewhere along the track I became a fan of embarrassing, overwhelming, surprising Van Heflin, at least in the early 1940s. Judy's singing is great, but the film missed a great chance by not showing more of her relationship. I gave her 7.
