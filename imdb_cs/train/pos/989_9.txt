My friend and I thought that this movie was well done. We were expecting a comedy with a light heart, but we got a full blown action movie with comic bumps. We both thought that this movie may not have been so good at the box office because the previews make us think it was a comedy. I was amazed at supporting actors and, of course, Dave Morse is always doing great acting work. Most supportive casts are veterans not the first timers and were solid. Both of us felt that writing and direction were the first speed and they remembered buying the movie. If you do not buy the rent for a good time.
