I saw this independent movie when it was in Philadelphia and it was a pleasant surprise. I left the theater with a smile on my face. One of the things that sounded like this was the fact that it was based on a real story - cheerful! He also has some great actors. Mindy Sterling is in it and she is very good. I loved her in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also awesome. I remember him from the class leader. I'm tired of all the dark movies that are still being done. It's fun and light, and I can watch and not be embarrassed with my family. I'm constantly checking when to appear on DVD. I'm sure to buy.
