I was personally interested in this movie. When I was seventeen and I was just high school, I got a job in the 20th century Fox as a member of the union of laborers and haulers. At the end of my first day (sweeping the deck carrier deck) I was told to bring the briefcase with plenty of clothes next morning for one or two weeks. When I arrived the next morning, the bus waited, and about 20 of us headed south to San Diego. A short distance from here, we stopped at the base of the army called Camp Callan or Camp Hahn. Once we were postponed, we went north several miles to Pendleton camp, a large naval base. There, on the beach, we began to build what was to be the island's Japanese base. It took us about a week or ten days before we completed the installation, which included a water reservoir, weapons reinforcement, trench sand pit, and living quarters. All of this was behind very high wages, sometimes "gold," which is three times our regular hourly wage. Our food was also in the first place = the main rib for lunch etc. - which was amazing because it was at wartime and it was very hard to get good meat at home. After finishing my work, I eagerly await a movie that came out about eight or ten months later. Then I eagerly waited for two hours of film before the screen finally appeared. Then it was not more than three or four minutes (maybe less) movie diving heroes bombing the base and blowing it smithereens. A little disappointment, but fun. <br /> <br /> Despite this disappointment, I enjoyed the film and I have not seen it since. Later, I learned that this film was taken over by the government, and that Fox was paid on a cost basis, which probably corresponds to our extravagant pay and lifestyle. Bob Weverka
