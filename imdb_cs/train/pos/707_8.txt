I have to be honest and say I did not see many independent films, but I thought it was very well done. Direction and cinematography were dealt with without scattering. The angle, setting, and lighting that had been used successfully created a nightmare in which the main character was imprisoned. Many scary and unforgettable films from the movie wand in your mind long after the end (always a good director).
