I knew I'd see it when I saw the first view. Dennis Quaid was one of the reasons, but the theme of my dreams talks about me. People talk about it as a children's movie, but I think it's a baby boomers movie that cope with aging, innocent parents, our own mortality, our children growing up and leaving us, and all the other things we've never thought of we have happened. <br /> <br /> The film does not fall into the trap of tragedy; it's about what your dream life means when you have real life. <br /> <br /> Quaid is too small on the pitcher, but it looks good, and Rachel Griffiths makes a small part as a wife in a thoughtful, layered performance. Working with the camera is slow and sweet. When they united this film, they skipped everything that was not necessary. Very nice.
