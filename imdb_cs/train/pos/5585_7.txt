It was a very courageous film for the day. It could even be described as soft-core porn for a quiet time. It was talkie but the dialogue was extremely limited and in German. The young man (19) Hedy Lamarr got trapped in a carefree marriage with an obsessive (stereotype?) German and after a short time in marriage, which apparently never reached, returns home to his father. In the famous and fun scene, she decides to go one day foolishly when her horse is scattered to others. She is then forced to run through a field that is pursuing her when she leaves her horse. The engineer picks up his horse and returns his clothes - after he gets charmed. He sits for a moment and shows her in a zen moment with a bee flower sitting on the top. This is where she thinks back to her honeymoon and the actions of her husband and insect. He knows this man is different. She returns home and finally looks for our young boy and finds her ecstasy. Here you can use your ideas, but his head disappears from view and we see how delighted he is. Since he has never been able to undress, you can imagine ... Certainly, a tribute to women by director Gustavo Machat√Ω and a shock for the audience of 1933. The only thing that this beautifully shot movie is, is the excessive guilt and the strange ending.
