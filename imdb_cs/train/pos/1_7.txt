If you like mature comic cartoons such as South Park, then it's almost a similar format for the little adventures of three adolescent girls at Bromwell High. Keisha, Natella and Latrina gave explosive candies and behave like females, I think Keisha is a good leader. There are also small stories happening with school teachers. There is an idiot director, Mr. Bip, a nervous math teacher and many others. Cast is also fantastic, Lenny Henry Gina Yashere, EastEnders Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Smack Pony's Doon Mackichan, Mark Perry of Dead Ringers and Nina Conti. I did not know it came from Canada, but it's very good. Very good!
