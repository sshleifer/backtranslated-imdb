Once you get under the title movie, "Pecker" is a great movie, maybe one of the best John Waters. The amazing performance, led by strong performances by Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, makes the story very entertaining and very real. There are some shocking scenes that are definitely not suitable for small children but are there for a certain purpose. Unfortunately, this movie was not mass produced and most of the public will be able to view it. If the opportunity strikes, then look at this movie.
