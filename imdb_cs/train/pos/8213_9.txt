Anyone who testifies to our judicial system - or its deficiency - finds this film really satisfying. There were not too many shades of gray when it comes to characters or conspiracies. Virtually every character in this film was what was the best and the worst in our society. The likelihood of this film is probably due to the fact that most of us have had to deal with marshland together with the labyrinth, lilies, melee-mouthed bureaucrats, who strengthen them in the name of "political correctness." <br /> <br /> Overall performances were convincing. I sympathized with the victims of rape - although it was delightful that I saw her wiping complacency and cruel arrogance from the faces of her former invaders. In particular, I found the dam as one of the worst characters in all the movies I saw, so it was nice to see that her former victim closed her mouth for good. The guilty man and the psychopath was just as ugly, so it just seemed that Dirty Harry himself eventually ended in a very grotesque way. This was the only sequel to Harry's dirty saga, which was the first.
