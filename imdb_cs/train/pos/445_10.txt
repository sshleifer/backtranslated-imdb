I first saw Enchanted April five years ago. I loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy of the following Christmas. It's about two women who decided to rent a castle in Italy in April and leave behind their humorous lives. They are very sad women at the start of the movie and you can not help them, but they are rooted because they are going with two other women who are calling on them to contribute to the expense. This is probably the best movie I've ever seen. It's clean and simple, no carnivorous pursuits, no animosities and no deaths. It was made with care and very good taste. You can not help him, but the whole smile - unless you cry in happy tears!
