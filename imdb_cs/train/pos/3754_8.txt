I remember watching this movie on Saturday afternoon television in the fifties and sixties. It was well presented, but I recall that a message of hope was broadcast from the transmitters emitted in the lamps in one of the last manic executions of the approaching liberation. I'm not sure squares with facts. <br /> <br /> The film still works well. The German Commander-in-Chief reports in bluntly, "The Russians are going down The Fredrich Strasse," as if everything went according to plan. It was my impression that this film and the later American, off, was based on the account of the British historian Trevor-Roper, similar to the name Hitler's Last Days. I was surprised that Trevor-Roper did not believe any credit. I agree that the latest German film about DOWNFALL was just as good as a classic. The American knock-off was a bit flat. Several personalities attracted attention from cinema as much as Adolph. Still, it seems to me interesting that none of the many movies and books that have been published ever talked about Hitler's double report that he had passed John Toland's wonderful historical work. Was it gibs?
