I do not see a reason to bury such a film in a sarcastic sarcasm, when it is by no means meant to be anything but a means of entertaining children and preparing them for another line of goods to be madly crazy. /> <br /> This is a fun movie. My children quietly sat down and loved every minute. It was thought that the villain is a bit over the top with his silly costume and maniac laugher, but it's much easier than the dark, gloomy and very morbid Pokemon 3. My kids have watched the Pok√©mon from the beginning and soon get into the ages where they " childish things "and go to the others. I'm glad we should enjoy it together.
