It starts slowly, showing the naughty life of two housewives who decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April, but do not give up. Nothing happens, but time passes gorgeously, and there are many crafty jokes (my favorite is riding in a stroller in a storm that I find cheerful). The movie is beautifully romantic in many ways, the landscape is beautiful (like Polly Walker) and the resolution in the movie is very satisfying. The film takes a few freedoms with the book, the greatest being with the Arbuthnot / Briggs / Dester business, but I actually preferred the movie's version of this (it may be more sentimental, but I felt it was more in line with the tone of the story, likes sentiment when it's done well). Excellent film, especially as a data film during poor weather.
