When I first saw the title, I already drew the movie theme - it was obviously not a reference to the British currency, so it had to be Shakespearian and about a pound of body - take them or give them. Will Smith is a good actor, so the serial killers were out. It could only be about the person who gives it, so there must be some guilt. I totally corrupted the thing by looking at it and knowing the story before I watched it because the beauty of building is the way the parts of the main person's background are dripping and slowly illuminating the audience about who is and why he does what he does. Blame is a very difficult matter to do simply because it is deeply inconvenient and sad, which is not an encouraging premise when you are hoping to ride a roller coaster - you know it will be unpleasant. I do not think the film celebrates suicide; it gets into the most extreme form of self-sacrifice - martyrdom. It is also a ubiquitous symbolism, which is a sign of the certainty that the script is cleverly conceived, and has more meaning and a deep reflective nature. The most important issue that struck me was that it not only gives the heart to a girl she loves emotionally and metaphorically but physically gave her the greatest gift she could. Decided to die, but his plan is thwarted by falling in love - what second complication he is doing. Absolutely majestic. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is a very slow run, but I do not decide whether it would be better deployed in a smaller timeframe. I did not feel the strain and his terrible inner chaos as much as I could, but maybe I'd destroyed it before. However, it is a deeply moving and original film that is incredibly strong and the thought provoked by the tragedy that deserves the awards it will inevitably get.
