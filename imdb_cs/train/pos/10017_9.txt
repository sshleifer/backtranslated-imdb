I absolutely love this movie! I'm not talking at all with all the other notes I've read about. I was totally enchanted every second! <br /> <br /> I found the story of grip, acting intense and directional point-on. I would literally jump every time the phone rings near the end of the movie. Although there was nothing "scary" about the story, I was all the time in the movie - and the rest of the evening. <br /> <br /> I found that so many perfect choices were made ... casting, script, small pieces of humor that were covered in it. There were so many points where the film could go for cheap excitement, but it never did, and that for me to put this film over so many of the media thrillers that have been published lately ... and for the last few years.
