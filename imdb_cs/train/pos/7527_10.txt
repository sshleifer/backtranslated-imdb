More pictures of the most popular film of all time than your typical biopic drawn, this fun and fabulous movie has the look and feel of a time with excellent soundtrack and everything you would like in an indie movie. I think it would be a tendency to portray Bettie Page as a sexual vixen like Jayne Mansfield. But if you really looked at Betty's attitude, she always looked happy. No, "You want to get to me", but "I'm just doing it because my acting career did not solve" the look of a porn star. And so the ladies who participated in this film (three producers, female writer / director, female co-writer and beautiful Gretchen Molová, who certainly helped influence this role by her own sweet influence) really caught the idea of ​​a sweet, somewhat naive, southern a girl who really enjoyed taking her photo and hoping it would not be too upset. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol will show a great performance in her career (she can have only the most perfect breasts at all) that I like because she has a curse. Several years ago, she filmed the Vanity Fair envelope when no one really knew who she was, and she longed for her as another actress. And frankly, it was a little nasty. I mean, it never worked for Gwyneth, but not for lack of talent. When you make a few bad movie choices when you're a pretty blonde girl in Hollywood, you can forget, I'm afraid. If this does not go back to the A-list, then I'm going to be my uncle's monkey. Intimately private, Betty has not seen the movie yet. Bettie left the party for a high note and fell in love with her old flame, Jesus. Whatever your boat honey is flying. You were a woman. I hope you are happy wherever you are. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mary Harron, you have made our culture an idol of justice.
