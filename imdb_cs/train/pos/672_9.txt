This film has a stable and creepy pace that has been backed by great acting performance (one of Chamberlain's finest performances) and a story that has revealed to us in time. In addition, music is fully in the mood and helps maintain a restless, cautious and dark tone. Weir's story is enhanced by using natives, their stories, and tensions with the dominant white population to deliver a fantastic story that is ominous. <br /> <br /> Although they are unconnected both in the story and the genre, it kept the same feeling in me as Ursula Le Guin's Turning Heart (1980). <br /> <br /> "Last wave" is a dramatic thriller with several shocking moments. Do not forget that "hacking and slicing" does not create a movie as a horror film, it is the psychological element of fear and anxiety that lies in us all.
