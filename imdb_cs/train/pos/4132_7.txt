The comedy that surprisingly worked was a small British effort "Divorce of Lady X (1938)". He is the first pair of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, before a small film about uncontrollable passion in English from the 19th century appeared. And while Olivier and Oberon are not particularly suited for comedy, it all comes fine. Oberon is Leslie, a young woman who ends up in the rather demanding legal divorce law of the Logan (Oliviera) hotel suite behind an unpleasant English fog that hinders travel. She does everything to make him irritated - but in the crazy way the movies go, it falls on her. And she will fall to him. But a serious case of mistaken identity comes when Oberon's "Lady X" (that's all Oliver leaves in the note), Olivier considers herself a married woman. To make things even worse and fun, Lord Mere (Ralph Richardson) goes to Olivier, who wants a divorce from his wife whom dear Larry thinks must be Oberon! There is some nice dialogue about sex between the sexes and fun exploration of sexual politics. You can see that Olivier is not too sure about comedy, but Olivier is a perfect professional and he adds. And he manages twists and turns, maybe not with ease but with taste. Oberon was not an actress, but she was usually competent enough, and despite the fact that she did not like the screen, she worked well with Olivier. It was filmed in the early Technicolor, which looks very primitive today (everyone looks even more white than Michael Jackson), but perhaps the need to clean the print.
