For a low-budget project, the film was successful. The story is interesting and the actors were convincing. Eva Longoria, who is currently starring on the "Dragnet" TV show, is more sexy than ever before. The location was perfect for the ganster plot, and the director shows his talent by taking on many roles for his project. Of course, this low-budget movie can benefit from better transitions and more special effects for gun scenes, but music keeps the script moving. Although this film has a share in issues such as continuity, I have to say that I will borrow another film by the director. If you were a film student, you could learn a few things from the director's commentary.
