The first word that comes to my film is "beauty". Beauty is all around, in an actor's play (Andie's as beautiful as ever), in well-designed shots and in authors - the red line - Love. I think Kenny's character is the only white spot in these three women, otherwise a boring and predictable life. His interaction makes Andie a character who lives as fun as he could be. When it is gone, it was obvious that we can not really appreciate and stick to our inner believers and sacred wishes. The fact that Andie is recovering from this loss is nothing wrong, instead it shows that life prevails in any shape, even in this small British village that is perfectly displayed. Another reason I love this movie is that it's so British in every way - all houses and "phagas" and accents :))). And Andie is doing a great job again! It is a pity that this film has gotten so low marks. 10 out of ten!
