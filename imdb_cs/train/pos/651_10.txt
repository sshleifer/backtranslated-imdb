** possible spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I like this movie and I have no problem keeping up. It reminds me of it at the age of 20, except that it's even better. Just like Veronica says, two chickens at a time. Involves in me a robe, an informal conversation, these two real animals, rather than prostitutes, and irritates us every step of the way. I also get into the interviews. Although they are absolutely b.s. sometimes, so what? Every cat that I've ever talked about and is tall is usually full of the same unjustified hopeless, unreasonable self-blessing b.s. philosophy. It's just a lot of nonsense and about as reasonable as other bs.s. chick philosophy is often in: astrological charts. The only problem with this movie is that the guy is almost as feminine as a woman is in the same b.s. and mood. The brunette is actually the most male person. <br /> <br /> I think it's a bit funny that the brunette is so obviously turned on by Veronica. She likes to pull a little blonde from Alexander, but Veronica plays her all the way. It's great. The brunette comes and thinks there is something between them, and then steals the baby boy / man, which is only appropriate because they seem to be of the same age group. Brunette knows she got to the end when her face falls in her hand, while Marlene Deitrich sings in the background, that there is a million pairs in paraphrase this evening in Paris, but I only have this chorus. /> <br /> But did they finally marry Alex and Veronica? Mmmm? I can only imagine a super-stormy relationship that ends in decay before marriage. They are too selfish to do anything to make them stones. <br /> <br /> I like the movie. I enjoyed having fun, it's a nice look and it's sexy.
