I remember when I was five and my parents thought it was a regular cartoon movie .... except when the bras and balls started flying. I have to agree that this movie will be someone and everyone upset because it is set to discriminate everyone and everyone ... but the truth is that it's funny how hell, how deep it is. I recommend it to anyone who likes classical culture. Also try Fritz the cat and nine lives of Fritz cats. If I'm right, Ralph Bashki also shot it. It includes a cat that goes through hard times with family, streets, jobs, etc. When I was old I borrowed all these movies out. Because Coonskin was an offensive title during this era, it was also referred to as Street Fighter. Ralph Bashki has also made Cool World the head of a very young Brad Pitt. Strong traffic was another cartoon that dealt with the street life of a young man.
