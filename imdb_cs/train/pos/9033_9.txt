I watched this film without knowing anything about it and found it like Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based on an exasperated relationship between father and son. In both films, the son does not want to watch his father's mines and dreams about a better life outside his home town. Both sons face the mockery of their classmates and both have a strong female model that teaches them. The main difference I found among the films was that October Sky was an infinitely more interesting and moving film. Laura Dernov√° moves and Chris Cooper plays very reluctantly father very well as he continued to do in American beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his gentle directing, very different from his other directorial features, such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001). <br /> <br />
