A warm, sweet and remarkably charming film about two antagonistic workers in the same shop (James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan) who make romance through a mailbox without anyone knowing it. The key to the success of this film is that Ernst Lubitsch has no raw sentimentality and encourages his actors to give key, unachievable performance. As a result, you will fall in love with virtually everyone. <br /> <br /> There is a strong scam of melancholy going through this movie, which I appreciated. Loneliness is a major theme, apparently represented in the character of the owner and manager of the business, which was greatly played by Frank Morgan. He realizes that his wife is shrouded and realizes that the successful life he has created for himself is not enough to feel lonely when he has no partner to share it. This makes the terrible romance between Stewart and Sullavan much more painful because they both get to this invisible other that everyone thinks of as a soul than they even encounter. Of course, we know that everything will end, but the film will not allow you to forget the deep feeling one would feel if they find that reality does not work until imagination. <br /> <br /> <br /> Lubitsch fills his film with a cracker cast that has a load of chemistry. A small group of business employees behaves like a small family throughout the movie, and that's exactly how they feel it. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful, unspoken romance. <br /> <br /> Step: A +
