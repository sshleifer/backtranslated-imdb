I never heard of this movie before this week, but I was interested in it when I heard it: The American will meet the European woman last night in Europe and spend the night together. He took my interest, but I never expected it to be so great. Before Sunrise is a masterpiece and is also one of the most romantic movies. My surprise was completely lacking cynism of the nineties. It's impossible to talk about it very much because there is no real conspiracy (although there are plenty of interesting things you could talk about, it's like My Dinner With Andre where you are talking, but it's not just an interview that matters), but let me just say, see it. See!
