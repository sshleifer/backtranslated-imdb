Welcome to Collinwood is a lot of things, but it's not one of the following: George Clooney's old Unfunny Un-Original And yes, I know the basis for the movie is another movie. But when it comes to Hollywood, this decade can be one of its most authentic outputs - and it does for me. The film is from the beginning to the end, the absolute gas. Here's why. <br /> <br /> There is not bad performance in the movie. Funny parts are funny. The nervous parts are nervous. The script does not contain a boring moment of dialogue The cinema is fresh and beautiful. And that's not in line with the Hollywood standard (you'll see what I mean when you see the movie) When I was a kid, I remember seeing movie ads. This movie went under radar after not being threatened by the box office and not even a cult classic. The reason why Transformers 2 is considered acceptable to average film visitors is that they are used to seeing Transformers 2. If the film is original and fun because it was drawn as often as several million pieces with ** t, would be a much fresher place - when "they" say they will not do them like they, "they" did not see Welcome to Collinwood. <br /> <br /> A fun, mini-masterpiece of a kaper comedy that rejects a compromise. One of my favorite.
