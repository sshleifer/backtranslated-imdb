I saw this movie on the cable, it was really funny, from a stereotypical police chief to a stereotypical big villain, jay leno and mr mayagi of a karate kid in this good comedy about the car prototype. I compare this movie with "RUSH HOUR", in which the local police officer must work with an Asian cop to resolve the case. Tracking through farmers in the detroit city center brings memories. Amazing soundtrack, good script, I give it 10/10.
