Yaitate !! Japan is a really fun show and I really like it! This was shown in our country just recently in Hero TV and ABS-CBN every 5:30. It is Azuma Kazuma, who is trying to fulfill his dream of producing Japanese bread that will represent his country. He works in the southern factory of the Pantasia branch and also helps his friend (Tsukino Azusagawa) along with other bakers (such as Kawachi Kyousuke and Kanmuri Shigeru) to defeat Saint Pierre and take control of Pantasia. They fight with other skillful bakers from many other countries and not only learn to produce different kinds of bread, but also learn to cook more food. It's really a funny and unique anime because they also mimic characters from other anime (like Naruto, detective Conan and One Piece) and famous real-life people. It is one of the best Takashi Haschiguchi works and is really a necessity for people of different ages.
