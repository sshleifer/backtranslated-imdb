That's a nice job. Very sexy and conspicuous enough to keep my interest. Its main disadvantage is that it appears to have been made for television: Full screen and although there were several sexual scenes, there was absolutely no nudity (but the boy was approaching!). Also strange because Netflix shows that it was rated R. <br /> <br /> However, very titillating, and wish Alicia Silverstone has made more films like this one. One reviewer, Netflix, said it was part of the series, but I was not able to figure out what series it is. But I would like to find out, because this movie was so good. <br /> <br /> Walt D in LV. 8/23/2005
