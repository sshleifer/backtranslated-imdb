"The Protocol" is a hit-and-miss picture starring Goldie Hawn as a bubble cocktail waitress who will save the visitor's life from an assassination attempt one night. The woman immediately becomes a celebrity and gets a new job for the US government. Will the corridors of power in the capital of our country still be the same? Hawn is as good as usual, although "The Protocol" is not as fun as her best film "Private Benjamin". But it's still a good movie, and I laughed a lot. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
