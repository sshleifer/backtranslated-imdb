This movie is light, fun and beautifully shot. The flashes are absolutely superb and colors are convincingly reminiscent of Vermeer's paintings. This is a sentimental comedy in its best form above US and French standards and probably better than English. <br /> <br /> Every character touches and the interpretation approaches perfection. Isabelle Blais is beautiful, Sylvie Moreau is better than Catherine, St√©phane Gagnon is charming, Emmanuel Bilodeau is great in this strange role, and Genevieve Laroche is the perfect best friend! <br /> <br /> Continue for a few hours to find a negative commentary on this movie, so give him a chance and add your own review.
