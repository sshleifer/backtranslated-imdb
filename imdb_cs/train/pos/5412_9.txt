As a Pokémon fan, I like this movie very much. It features a new legendary Pokémon (as every movie does) and adds depth to the relationships between its characters. But I do not expect those who are not Pokémon fans to enjoy it (This includes most adults). Some of these lines were nasty, but this may be somewhat inevitable when copying the film into English. The animation was beautiful, although there were a couple of parts that did not look good. And although the villain is a bit dirty, I think movies have done a good job of riding on different types of villains, and I guarantee that they are not all like this one. Those who did not like it, I tell everyone, but the Pokémon fans will love it.
