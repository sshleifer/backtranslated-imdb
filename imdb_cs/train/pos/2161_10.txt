How many of us want us to release social and cultural commitments and to be free? Most of us, I think. Do we dance? is not a movie about dancing. It is about learning about ourselves when we realize what we are looking for in life and we have the courage to go about it. Mr. Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese company where dancing in a ballroom is considered inappropriate. <br /> <br /> One day Mr. Sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning against a dance academy window. he is fascinated by her and eventually he enters the dance lesson. They are ashamed of their dance and are afraid of ridicule. Hides the fact that she attends dance classes of her colleagues and families. <br /> <br /> There is a cheerful scene in the mensroom in the office when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a collaborator who also dancing, are interrupted to practice some dance steps. There are many other fun and hot scenes. <br /> <br /> Termination is not a fairy tale but leaves the viewer feeling. <br /> <br /> This movie helped me to understand the Japanese people a bit better. It's a warm and very useful film.
