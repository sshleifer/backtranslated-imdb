I love this show. Time. I have not been watching for too long, about six months, but now it's my favorite show and probably for a while. I like all the characters, except I don 't care about Donna. I'm not quite sure why. I just ... I do not find her fun and I do not think Laura Prepon is a very good actress. Other than her, I find the rest of the cast quite well. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, who played the parents of Erics, were extremely entertaining. Topher Grace is also a great actor. Unlike many fans, I did not have a complete hatred of the 8th year. I'm still looking at it and it makes me laugh. But if you compare it with the show seasons, it's not good. Randy's terrible. The final was decent, nothing amazing, but good. =] I think it would be better to cancel the show after Ashton and Topher decided to leave but well. I have a fourth season on DVD, and one day I hope the DVD will have all eight seasons. Some of the most funny episodes in my opinion were "Dine & Dash", "Grandmas Dead", "Red & Stacey" and "Streaking", but I love every episode I've seen so far, most of them, I think. =] 9/10 stars, I would definitely recommend it. =]
