In this installment of the series Edmund Blackadder was stuck in Regency in Britain (during the later part of the reign of George III). This time, Blackadder's prospects are much poorer - as a royal place, he is the servant of a very, very dense George IV (price regent). Unlike the historical notes of George IV. It's about as bright as tomatoes, and as a result Blackadder is able to use it and schedule its content. The only big difference in style between this and the older is that the series ends with a very, very, very different note - you just have to see that they believe it. In addition, all the usual storylines and shows are fun. The only reservation I have (as always) is that this show is not suitable for children because of the tongue and adult situations.
