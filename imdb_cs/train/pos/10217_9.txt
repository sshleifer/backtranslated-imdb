Venture butterfly wings in the Atlantic can release a hurricane in the Pacific. According to this theory (somehow related to the theory of chaos, I'm not sure exactly how), every action, no matter how small or insignificant, starts a chain reaction that can lead to big events. This little jewel of the film shows us a number of seemingly unrelated characters, mostly in Paris, whose actions affect the lives of others. (The theory of six degrees of separation can also be used.) Each story is an aspect of the jewel of this film. The acting is fine tuned and nuanced (Audrey Tautou is light), the stories are true, the humor is right and the audience leaves the theater by nodding.
