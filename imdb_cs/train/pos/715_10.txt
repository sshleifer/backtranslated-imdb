All the people who sit there and say that Ramones's weak link to this movie would probably say that Amadeus is fine, if not for the irritating harpsichord. Rock and Rolls High School focused on Ramones. As somebody can watch it and not get kicked out of Joey Ramon's, eating beans behind the beetle backstage in an attempt to keep him in the power of being a seemingly wet quilt square father. Mrs. Trogar, exploding white mice, the hall guarded by ... instant classics. Do not forget the character of Riff Randell. <br /> <br /> If you do not like Ramones, then you do not know rock and roll and do not deserve to watch a movie called ROCK AND ROLL High School.
