I've seen a few comments about Brand using the Southern accent, some of which were considered a mistake. When this film was filmed, racism and discrimination were very strong in the south. The laws of Jim Crow were still in force. Civil rights were in childhood. Could it be a fine social comment, a southern man in love with a woman of another race? Like MASH was the subtle criticism of the Vietnam War? Any thoughts? Another comment was made about Myoshi Umeki appeared "cold". Everyone in Japan would understand. Japanese people, at least in my experience, did not tend to show emotions to strangers. There were strict social rules, especially for men who met with free women. The Americans in Japan were completely foreign to this culture, and the blunt attempts to meet women were shocking to the ladies. One characteristic of Japanese people was a smile when they were falling or discomfort, which many US soldiers considered to be a sign that their progress was welcome. Also, remember that at the time that the film was represented, Japan was just defeated and the occupying forces were reluctantly accepted. I think Myoshi Umeki gave a very credible idea of ​​what her situation would be like. Watching her interactions with American actors brought me a few memories of my own experience in the country. I wanted to meet beautiful young ladies who convinced me that I was not a typical American man, taught their language and culture during my stay in my country.
