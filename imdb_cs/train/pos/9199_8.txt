Dead to Rights is about a police officer named Jack Slate who finds his murdered father and goes to a man who thinks he killed him. Jack is later shot dead and ready for the murder of a man he suspects of killing his father. <br /> <br /> A few months later, on the day Jack is executed, he escapes from prison and looks for the town for the man who framed him for the murder. Jack's search leads him through a beep * that ends when everyone is dead. <br /> <br /> Through the game Jack uses M4 karabin weapons on his dog Shadow to kill endless streams of people in 15 levels. The game is basically "kill 30 people, find to switch to open door.kill 50 people, find switch to open door" again and again until level is finished. They are fun mini games too as playing as a stripper to avert bouncers in the nightclub so Jack can get to another area in the club, or disarm bombs. <br /> <br /> "Dead To Rights" is also a tough game. You will get to the area full of bad guys armed with Sub Machine guns while you only have a pistoli.Near at the end of the game skills turn to dust and you have to rely on luck. Dead To Rights is as cruel as it's hard. If you shoot a person in a face with a shotgun, blood will be on the walls, the ceiling, and the floor. And because there are several boys in each of them, the walls will be painted in the blood. <br /> <br /> Family fun for everyone.
