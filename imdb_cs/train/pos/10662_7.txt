Leonard Maltin had to watch another movie. (Although it seems to me that his Guide is a rather valuable resource, please ignore his comments on this.) He says "starts well and then dips" when it's really the opposite - "starts warming and then captures the fire." The plot is about as simple as it gets. Happy mummy, happy dad and happy son on vacation on an isolated beach, father dont fit in an accident, my mom runs out to get help, meets dangerous escaped convict. Mom is trying to trick the convict to help while Dad is waiting and hanging out for a dear life. A good white knuckler who suddenly discovered Ralph Meeker's electric shock (director John Sturges, a clever way to narrow you down) in the middle of the road like a frantic, desperate criminal. Meeker is an extraordinary flippant, ruthless actor (at least here and in the classic Kiss Me Deadly) and happily takes the key to telling the film and speeds up from top to bottom. His character has a childish smile and says, "Pretty clean, huh?" when he is particularly pleased with his bad deeds. In action, a fun break occurs when they get a flat tire, and strongly urges Barbara Stanwyck's hostage: "Do not go away." Fire back "Where would I go?" (they are in the middle of nowhere) and he realizes sitcom-ishls "Yeah, that's true". The friction between them is rumbling. <br /> <br /> There are mistakes, somewhat absurd. There's a scene where the police, who have been following Meeker after a while, stop Stanwyck's car and avoids revealing that Meeker rests on his shoulder as if a loving husband probably wants to pretend to sleep when questioned. A. It seems to be apparently non-male and B. I think it's safe to say that any adult who seems to be sleeping during a law enforcement meeting would certainly be suspicious. thriller, which builds on an exciting and edifice conclusion. <br /> <br />
