I'm a huge fan of Jet Li! He is the best HK action movie star alive ... and then - this movie rocked! I saw it in a video rental shop and, like in the mainstream of this main video rental, I did not first notice his presence and I had to check twice. I immediately knew what I would rent. My only humility (I suppose I expected it) is that it was nicknamed (AAARGh) and has no headlines. Otherwise, the original / strange / cool film plot and full action make it one of the better Jet Li films ... even though they all fall under this category ....
