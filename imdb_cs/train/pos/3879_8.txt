Typical Clausen film, but again typical. Clausen writes, directs and plays one of the major roles. This is really a great movie about ordinary people who live a normal life and try to make the best of it. The 4 main actors were fantastic. Fritz Helmut was convincing. You believe it is really bad. Sonja Richter plays a sister who is really an actor, but she turned out to be the best nurse to take care of that old man. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> But nothing good is easy, they have to fight to gain their life and love.
