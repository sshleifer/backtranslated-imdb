This entire movie is not perfect. It's not "good" because the story line is basically a lot of hooks to hang jokes. Some of these jokes are a little "too 80s" and tend to date. </ p> <br /> But some of these jokes are classic. <br /> <br /> You know the movie has something strange when you and your friends still refer to stupid quotes from that over 2 decades later. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are plenty of familiar faces; Michael Keaton, Danny Devito, Joe Piscapo, Peter Boyle, Marilu Henner, Maureen Stapleton, Bob Eubanks, Griffin Dunne and one of the last roles of Alan Hale Jr., Captain of Gilligan Island. <br /> <br /> There are also some enormous absurd moments, like Johnny refers to puppies with a price gun, or the pope appears in the neighborhood of Johnny. Also, the scene in which a false priest does a lot of words in Latin is excellent. ("Summa cum laude, magna cum laude, radio is too loud ... Post meridian, ante meridian, uncle meridian"). Other classic scenes include Ramone Maroney English language Danny Devito calls Griffin Dunne on 'Play Ball' Peter Boyle thinks he has lost his masculinity Fake film VD <br /> <br /> This film is not a home run. But like Porky's, he has enough classic comedy bits to remember.
