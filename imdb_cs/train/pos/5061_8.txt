well worth the attention, especially with a good twist of a journalist with dignity, you expect a big fallacy story because Gray Owl is revealed as a scam, but it does not mean it and adds to the generally optimistic and uplifting theme and drama of the story and the film. This must be Brosnan's best performance to date, he convincingly impresses as an English boy playing the Indians. The great scene is a return to his? Aunt? where Brosnan and two older ladies are doing a beautiful scene full of nostalgia and life lost with such a little conversation, only with a look and a good direction. Perfect. The story is so little known and the message so universal and all important, it's a real shame that this film has not gotten into better recognition, maybe in time it can become a bit of a classic and a sleepover. I hope so. Well Dickie Attenborough and cast.
