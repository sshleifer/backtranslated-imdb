Perhaps it is not the absolute biggest entry to the Hammer House of Horror series, but it will surely win the award for the most fictional episode! "House Bled to Death" ?? I'd like to scream this title all day, without ever getting tired of it! In addition to this amazing title, this short film also benefits from a tightly written scenario and some really exciting moments. It may require further viewing before you can fully understand the particular angle, but it is certainly an original idea of ​​a short horror. The story opens images of an older couple who drinks tea in their middle class house. The husband sadistically kills his wife and a few years later the "damn" house is still for sale. The young couple and their cherubian daughter are moving and starting to renew them, but there are mysterious events that affect young Sophia in particular. Her beloved cat is killed, even her birthday party is destroyed when one of the house joineries suddenly splashes the blood of all the guests (especially a cool sequence, this!). Is the old house really scary? Or are the seemingly useful neighbors causing all the horror? Answers to these questions are provided in the original and relatively unpredictable climax, and there is even room for real shock at the very end. The tension is masterfully built, and the home house is filled with terrifying scenery, like a pair of rusty machete used to a husband to kill his wife. A small warning, however, that the sequence with a cat is hard to follow when you are a lover of animals. Finally, another Hammer short TV series winner!
