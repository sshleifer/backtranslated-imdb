This is one of the best films Jackie, who is without opera cameras Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, has one of the best holes in any action movie and continues this way when Jackie shows some high-quality stuntmen. The only criticism is that in the middle it slows somewhat, but it appears for the frantic last 25 minutes in the movie and the final credits show what the crazy mad jackie chan is just to make us habits on the movie happy
