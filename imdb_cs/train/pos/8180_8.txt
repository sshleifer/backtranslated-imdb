it's a fun movie. in fact, it could make you disturbed because it's not some undead psychopath or sociopath, your daily doctor. how terrifying it is. he got some good actors and actresses in this film, although some who did not like Virginya Keehne like Sarah. Ken Foree, who you know from the zombie devils, refuses, and Halloween (2007) co-starred as our detective on Dr Schizoid Alan Feinstone (Corbin Benson). A brief short overview is as follows: Alan Feinstone, a guy who has a sexy woman, a nice house, and is a great dentist everyone loves. Until we take his wife to cheat with the pool cleaner. Then he gets hallucinated that the teeth of his patients are totally rotten and that women are his wife when he starts making nuts in this thriller. But before that, dear guy.
