I saw The Big Bad Swim at the Temecula Film Festival in 2006 and was totally captured by the extent to which I joined it. The film focuses on the lives of a group of people who enjoy adult swimming class for various reasons. A funny idea in itself, the class serves as a catalyst for bigger changes in student life. What surprised me about the movie was how it really was. Rarely in musical compositions the characters are processed so well. I liked scenes in this class very much, and the dramas that took place outside were very irritating. Nothing seemed out of place or out of nature and eventually left a very strong feeling, like a school or summer camp - where you can find quick friends, create strong bonds and make discoveries about yourself, yet you have to leave too soon. My only complaint was that the character of Paula had a very strong and unusual introduction that wanted to know you a little more than he was eventually revealed. I assume you will meet each class even though ... <br /> <br /> Besides, I found the film very well rounded and quite nice. See if you have an opportunity.
