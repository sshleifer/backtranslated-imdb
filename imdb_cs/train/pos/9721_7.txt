How to lose friends and alienate people is a decent comedy with a little romantic attitude. In fact, it is the story of Sidney Young (Simon Pegg), who broke in journalism and magazine writing, which is interpreted in an entertaining way. Simon Pegg looked good, a little worse than his usual. The movie is not funny or entertaining all the way or anything, but it has moments and those moments are really funny. I recommend this fun and it is worth watching Americans with an English cream comedy for all people who just want to sit, relax and enjoy the film for what it is. If you are going to watch this critical film, then you should go through it if you do not want to be disappointed and begin to discard it.
