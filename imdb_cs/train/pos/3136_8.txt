A strangely friendly effort that combines a reasonably large conspiracy involving Adam and Burt and shows of original television series. Most of the flash scenes were raised directly from Burt Ward's book "Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights" and I imagine his book was the inspiration for shooting this film. Just like the book, let the fans of the original series hunger more. <br /> <br /> If you missed this broadcast, it is definitely worth borrowing a cassette from a friend who could upload it. I'm making a copy for my kids right now.
