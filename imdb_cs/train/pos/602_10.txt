I never danced with flames but somehow it seems to me that this movie is perfect. Colors, dances of dancing, gypsies and rivals all together made a film that seemed to end too soon. I've seen other Carlosa Saura films and I agree that this film may be his best production. I feel that the best features of his past films have been assembled and aligned to create Iberia. I appreciate the use of mirrors when detecting the activity that takes place behind the cameras. While watching this movie, I felt like sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid, comfortably watching bang dancers on a wooden plank over a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this film fits like a glove. I do not know how I can get a copy of this movie in the coming years in the US. I recommend this film to anyone who is attracted to other cultures. It is certain that this movie is definitely on my favorite list.
