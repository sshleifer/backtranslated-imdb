Hitchcock depicts his already developed understanding of the visuals in this early silent film. The story of the film, which includes two boxers battling a girl, is a straightforward drama without much to recommend. Hitchcock's talent, however, lies in his amazing use of paintings. Almost every slide is filled with visual symbols. Especially unforgettable are the jewels that one boxer gives to the girl just before marrying the second boxer. He pushes her into her arms clearly sexually and in one easy move, Hitch shows us everything we need to know. Boxing scenes are well-worked with some interesting threats that prove once again how far Hitchcock was. The film also gives insight into his later treatment of women. The goal of boxer's wishes is driven by money and lust, not by reason or by love. The only other women in the movie are either beautiful girl parties that make open sex offers or old crons that help to destroy happy relationships. Overall, the ring is essential for anyone interested in Hitchcock's early work and its development as a visual story.
