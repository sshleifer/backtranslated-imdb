I saw it on Cantonese VCD with English subtitles. I thought the story was good, but there were times when some of the subgroups were rough. It was a reflection of the film, as well as quite a lame musical score which really made me really angry over the whole movie. If the musical score was better, I can overlook a few played scenes. Then the film will be much, much better.
