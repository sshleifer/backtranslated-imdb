I only know one more movie that is likely to compete with Opening Night and that's Bergman's Persona. Both films are simply amazing, they have at first sight a wealth of ideas that are hard to grasp. We have a deep meditation on the relationship of art and life as one actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), finds she is more in touch with the character she's playing on the stage than she wants. The accidental death of one of her fans, a young girl who declares her love for Myrtle and she is then hit by a car, leaves a star. She begins to ask her question about aging, which begins to influence her until the only solution becomes alcohol. But it does not help much, and Myrtle is one step away from total madness. The scene where she killed an imaginary (or not) ghost of a dead girl is one of the most amazing scenes I've ever found in Cassavets. The film ends with a brilliant expression on behalf of the director as he writes the stage scene where he and Gena Rowlands improvise the scene because Myrtle is too drunk to perform exactly. This scene was shot spontaneously, with a lively audience, the laughter is right, the chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands absolutely amazing. If you like Persona or you are interested in a movie that offers great ideas alongside great entertainment, this movie suits you well.
