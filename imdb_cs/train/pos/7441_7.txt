I personally despised the Jerry Springer Show, but I found "Ringmaster" to be the most funny movie I've seen this year. The endless satire of "guests" of Jerry Springer, which begins in the opening scene, will make you happy throughout the film. Despite the short scene in which Jerry Springer makes a faint attempt to justify her existence, I definitely recommend this movie for ultimate fun.
