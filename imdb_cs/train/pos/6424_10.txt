As a child I remember being nine or ten and loving this movie. It was a Bollywood full-action action comedy. It's Bad Boys Imitation Of course! The whole exchangeable identity, but the arrival of two more twins throws everything out of the window and then the arrival of colorful villains dancing and singing! The action scenes in the movie are not revolutionary but still amazing scenes. The film is really fun and it was a great return that Amitabh Bachan needed. Govinda is a gem as always and is probably its best work to date, shining like a side kick nd brings the best comedy scenes available in Indian cinema. Songs are ... Tracks are both funny and catchy .............. proving laughter when you least expect it ... Amitabh Bachan is surprisingly very fun and will make you laugh like "Bade Miah" ... its accent ... the body language ..... Brilliant ... <br /> <br /> 'Assi chutki naab re daal' is the best song ............. Cheerful.
