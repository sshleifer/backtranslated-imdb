I really enjoyed this movie. I am the only dad with a 17-year-old daughter who is clever, athletic and talented. I NEED that my girl was so well applied for dealing with crimes and helping others! So maybe for me it's PG level Fantasyland. I have read many Nancy Drew's books in the young years, long ago. Of course, this character was played by Emma Roberts, but she looked like Nancy Drew, whom I remembered from the books. That's because of the script, not the acting. Emma is an adorable teen, playing a confident, hardworking and proud character with good manners and good taste. She is not caught up in the fashionable competitiveness around her. There are some weaknesses in Plot, except Nancy Drew's books are not interested in trying to find out what decade we are (what is CAR)? <br /> <br /> I read the IMDb report before I saw the movie because I studied Rachael Leigh Cook from other films. This is not one of her best roles but I will continue to search for my other films. Rachael was too old to play this lead but did a great job as an adult orphaned center of secrecy. I am very disappointed with other reviews written here. Some expect perfect links with books, some expect more credible situations or adult movies. I have what I expected! Good fun well focused on young teenage girls and their fathers who want good children with high standards of behavior and success. This is Teen PG, not James Bond! Who would you like a role model for your teenage daughter?
