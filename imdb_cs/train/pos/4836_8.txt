I saw the film for several days back on the video cassette, and although it was hard to swallow in one place (due to its length and story), I liked it very much. At first I impressed on the script and then on implementing this scenario. The film takes you on the road, but it is not an easy, joyful ride; goes through time and different political regimes and shows their influence on the lives of ordinary people. What I loved was the inner logic followed by the film; logic, which, like the logic of life, was sometimes illogical and confusing, but eventually, when I thought about it, all the events and twists and turns were meaningful. It makes no sense to try to tell the story again as it spreads in more than 50 years. I really liked Nikita Mikhalkov's character Aleksi and the way he played it, as some critics saw, with a restless abandonment. What I did not like was that he later played characters that remind me of Aleksi in films such as "Cruel Romance" (Zhestokij romans I really love) and to some extent in "The Insulted and the Wounded" ("Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye "). "Sibiriada" shows what great filmmaker Andrei Konchalovski was before going to Hollywood and making forgotten movies like "Tango and Cash" and unforgettable as "Runaway Train". I would prefer them to "Kurochka Ryba" ...
