I have it a few weeks ago and I love it! It's modern, light, but full of real life. These questions and answers, like other Eytan Fox movies. That's my favorite with Jossi & Jagger. These images are much more than just the bubbles we live in. You do not have to be Jewish or homosexual to enjoy it - I'm not, but the film goes directly to my top ten films. Initially, it looks like pure fun, but it will make you think. The relationships we have to live on are superficial, meaningful, deep, fatal, you name it. You do not know what's coming, and you certainly do not know where this story takes place when you first watch it. It's worth seeing a few times. Fox movies contain great bonus material - great music video and "creation" (including title explanation, interview with Lirik Ashkenaz in the film, and Arabs with doubts about Israeli lifestyle).
