Well, I can say, this movie really got me, it's not as bad as many people say, I really loved it, though it seems so simple and somewhat boring, it's not like that. First I enjoyed the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), it really is a movie. The second story and drama of the Spirit gets your attention. One thing I like the most is that the stallions did not provide a human voice that could communicate with other horses, it's a more realistic movie, a few animations seem realistic now, but ... I do not know to make animals talk to them just so ... lame. <br /> <br /> One of the most beautiful animations in 2002, in my opinion, I recommend it to all, not just to kids :), because it is very relaxing.
