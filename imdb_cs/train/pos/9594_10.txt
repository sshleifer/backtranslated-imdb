While many unfortunately passed, the scene of the hall is still very lively and bears their inheritance. Some are still very lively and quite well, Octavia is charming and more beautiful than ever before, Willi Ninja is very successful and provides a lot of support to the gay community as a whole, Pepper Labeija has just passed natural causes last year, can rest in peace. After the transition, Anji Carmen became the mother of Xtravaganza (she was on the beach scene), and she looks more and more beautiful. Some balls have categories designed for those who have passed, they can all rest in peace. There is currently another project called "How can I look?", You can look at www.howdoilooknyc.org.
