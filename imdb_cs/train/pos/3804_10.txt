My 3-year-old loved it. I loved it, my wife loved it. So, 10 out of 10 of our family. As for the level of violence? Not really violent, most of the stick variety. No one really dies, there's no blood, no blood, no torture, so it's definitely good for kids, much more than many cartoons on Saturday morning. This movie really takes over the idea of ​​CG movies where you should go. <br /> <br /> At first beautiful graphics, textures beautifully made, with true depth, do not try to be realistic but they are an artistic whole. Moss on rocks, rust on metal, reliefs on wood and stone, all add to the whole. Modeling characters, unlike many contemporary CG films, is odd, not cute, again in the artistic ensemble. Faces may look less ductile than some other movies, but the characters are more puppet than human. I think it's a good thing, loyalty, how strange it may sound, it's easier to stop your mistrust. Hair, fur, clothing, hair, at least with such as Pixar. Just notice in the opening scenes when Lian-Chu is fighting a giant slug; Gwizdo is in front of some farmers and they all have detailed clothes that made me suspend a movie to admire him. <br /> <br /> Settings. Far beyond the borders of cars and even the wall? The universe is done many times, but the fantastic surroundings of Dragon Hunters are only comparable to some of the scenes in Never Ending Story and Lord of the Rings, but once again it's an artistic whole, and with plenty of good ideas is being defended effortlessly. Spectacular views like scenes at Monsters Inc. where they ride through all the doors through their warehouses or the Wall? E, where we see the huge towers that he did, he is abundant in this movie, everything is big, but never sits; it's just the background all the way! Interlude, where they go through the landscape with fantastic falls. Chinese wall, islands floating in the sky. Broccoli in the sky? This is really the place where I think CG should go, do something that turns you away and do it over and over again. The sound is good, the music is diverse and not only epic, and fortunately without any vocals and purely original for the film. <br /> <br /> Animation is pretty good. Rental inspiration for cartoons, especially good use of stretching and compression. Sometimes it's not realistic, but 3D models are not realistic either. <br /> <br /> Characterization is also well done. Lian-Chu, a gentle and uncertain field, is gradually growing in trust that avoids the attention of little Zoe. Gwizdo will eventually redeem Lian-Chu's poor manager as Zoe does not change at all, but who wants to change that cute baby? At least I liked Lian-Chu more than any other recent figure from Sulley at Monsters Inc. <br /> <br /> Internal conflicts within the group are balanced by external pressures as well as in the right story fantasy. <br /> <br /> The story usually resembles an Infinite Story, especially as the world separates itself. Monsters are fairly standard fares, except for those that accumulate. There is no emotional touch Wall E, which is a really strong point in this movie, but it's a much more fun ride and it lacks an unpleasant music scene that plays in the former and acts on the first scene. This movie is what you want to watch for fun and exciting time. The whole movie has as I mentioned the whole vision, which seems to be strictly controlled. <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems that the setting is ready for another adventure, and I hope somebody. <br /> <br /> One side note, French actor makes Lian-Chu sounds a bit like Jean Reno at first, but I'm glad it was not him, although he's one of my favorites. I hear a new voice for me. I give him the maximum rating, a bit surprised by average and low ratings; I've tried to deal with some concerns about the two lowest-vote reviews. Access this movie as an adventure and as a European film, not against Hollywood, but another.
