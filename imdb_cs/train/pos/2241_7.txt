Another comedy about the cheerful little country that is struggling with the jungle of the modern world (for the 1940s) with the global world, which is just an indigenous joke and is capable of driving it, is a great entry into the Ealing cannon. Terry-Thomas sparks as usual at the helm as the impeccable minister led to the brink of a catastrophe, when a nation supposedly staring for the beginnings of attracting the interest of the world, Ian Bannen creates great romantic leadership, Peter Sellers puts one of his quieter performances as a corrupt politician and uber-suave John Le Mesurier plays against the type as a robust revolutionary leader. There is plenty of fun for everyone, especially viewers; perhaps not in the very upper echelon of classical Ealing, but quite high.
