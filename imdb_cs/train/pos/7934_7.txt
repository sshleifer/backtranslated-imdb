According to this record, I think you either love it or you hate it. Usually it's about all the movies. There is no need to try with others. The only thing we do here is to issue opinions. That movie I rented last night and I would like to come and throw my opinion in the mix. I was surprised how many people are breaking him. There is a difference between the movie fan and the horror fan. I'm a fan of horror films. Most ordinary movie fans do not like horror films. Nowadays, there are many low-budget films that look like concerts. It's hard to keep up. And what makes it hard to stay in these movies is how bad they are. I wanted to come and write a review on "Hood of the Living Dead" because it's pretty damn good compared to the rest of the junk mail. It's nothing special, but these are those horror filmmakers who are trying to be too serious to make a terrible horror movie. I really liked it. Do you tell me there's no effort in this? And one more thing, I bet you have all the huge DVD collections you're so proud of, nothing but the main movies? There is nothing to do with it, but you need to know how to appreciate independence with a low budget. I knew what I got when I watched this movie. I will not get angry because I thought it would be about 100 million dollars. Some of you may have to keep track of the Matrix again and again and stop trying to compare everything with the Matrix. And if most of you are under the age of 24, that explains everything. Good movie people, check it out.
