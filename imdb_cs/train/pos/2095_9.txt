Let us discuss the use of non-Asian actors playing Asian roles. The film is 67 years old. In 1937 the head studio believed that each actor could / should be able to play any role. Actors were contract-based and did not always have the choice of what role they play. End of the story. <br /> <br /> This is a really great epic tale of love, individual rights, classes and issues of men and women. The center of the film is two outstanding performances by Luis Rainer and Paul Muni. <br /> <br /> Muni plays Wang, a Chinese farmer who is about to marry his wife (Rainer). From the beginning, she was treated with respect, at a time when women were looking at something more than hiring help. Without doing too much film, they go through the tiniest and smallest relationships, and although the story can take place in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the story and much of their feelings seem to be trustworthy. > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Aside from the fact that the film is about 5-10 minutes longer than necessary, and the performance of Charley Grapewyn and Walter Connolly are typical cartoon characters in the 1930s, it is a truly wonderful film, it has become a victim of political correctness. <br /> <br /> 9 of 10
