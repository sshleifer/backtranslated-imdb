First, I want to make clear that the average user's inability to appreciate the imagination is scary. What this show is so unique is the hyper-reality it creates. You do not have to know why Ned can bring people back from the dead or why it can be just for a minute. Where is the amazement of children's stories gone, just like a wrinkle in time. I say it's a refreshing original, because it's a polar counterpart to the lay television of all kinds, leaving no room for fantasy or amazement. <br /> <br /> It's nice to add a little leak to the TV experience. <br /> <br /> Hyper-reality is my favorite aspect of the show. The 1930s-esque setting, innocent and rare characters, and scenery and physical settings that are not meant to be considered a pure reality. This show masks the morbid nature of death, while others accept it. While entertaining, other television shows have been taken back to this series. He really revived the feeling of curiosity, imagination and wonder in television. Pushing Daisies quickly made it to the top of my list.
