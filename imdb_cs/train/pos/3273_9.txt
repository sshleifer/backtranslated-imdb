I only give her 9 out of 10, because it's necessary to see it again, in a more recent mind, to gain a new perspective. What I remember is an amazing psychological thriller that dazzled my brain and eyes as I watched him. I would look at it every time it came to HBO back in the day (about 1990 or so). Maybe I even recorded it, but that recording is long gone, I'm sure. I wrote GreenCine to try to get this title, currently not wearing it. I hope to find her in a local video store. I'd be glad if you found it somewhere. It is at least interesting. If you like movies such as Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Gummo, or something a little strange and try this.
