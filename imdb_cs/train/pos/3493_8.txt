This film is underestimated. I loved it. It was really nice and honest. A family that fights but is not in a dysfunctional family that is so typical of movies today. The film did not do it, they had little money, or they were the Dominican Republic like Hollywood. Instead, the problem is that Victor is immature and must grow up. Gradually, slowly, ends with the film. He has a way to go, but it was a real step forward. His grandmother is very cute and the scene the little boy throws out laughs at me the longest. Really warm india
