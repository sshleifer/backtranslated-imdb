I would give this film a few stars, simply because it was a "lifelong" presentation actually shot in a place that's in the story - here, New York City. Most on this channel, whether it's "set" there in rural Iowa, Oregon, Virginia, LA etc. They are filmed in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or other Canadian national environment. one deserves the highest rating - 10 * on this site, it's this movie. Certainly not for originality, because this story has been many times, in many variations, with some very similar to this particular. It has also been done very often on the big screen, with mega-stars, past and present, by Cary Grant, James Garner, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks, et al - and Deborah Kerr, Doris Day, Meg Ryan, and many others. I can think of at least 10-12, as well as the prominent, past to present, from the top of my head that could be added now and probably there are many others that could be overcome. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> I caught it by accident on Friday, when I had a television, just because I took a few hours after a hectic week. I have never experienced this film for 8 years since shooting. And since the two conductors did enough to know the majority, I was totally unknown. The only two actors I knew were Phyllis Newman (Anna's mother) whom I saw in some of her younger days, and Michael Rispoli (Henry, Charlie's best friend), who was excellent as "Gramma," a dreadful juice, , Streetista of "Rounders". <br /> <br /> Random encounters and connections between the two best friends as a story of romance and the correlation of their existence with Anna and Charlie, which was later revealed to everyone later, are often making conspiracy within the genre, but it does not matter whether he enjoys it (in fact it improves). To check some other comments, I fully agree with those that are most remarkable. The primary word describing this film is ENGAGING, in caps. This adjective describes the artist; characters; chemistry among all characters, in any combination and all supporting and even smaller roles. I love films with a "harder edge:" "Rounders"; Escape of Schwarzenegger / Stallone; "Goodfellows;" even classics like "Casablanca", "Gone With The Wind", "Citizen Kane". But for pure, uncomplicated enjoyment, this was excellent. With the hollow fracture of its budgets, it was equal to the results achieved by "You've Got Mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle." And Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan could not do better than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan; co-stars and support staff were equivalent to those in these mega-films.
