I did not admit "still crazy" to any real expectation. Just another rock'n'roll picture, I thought ... good nostalgia for baby boomers. This movie is partly, but more. Brian Gibson, director, previously treated Tina Turner's biography and is quite successful in her style. I suppose it's his last film. <br /> <br /> Cast is well chosen. Bill Nighy is perfect in his role as a frontman of the band. Actor-directed director Bruce Robinson appears as a band guitarist. He has done excellent work, even though he has not appeared on the film since the late seventies. If you're looking for a moving and fun movie (with some great songs), you can find it. <br /> <br /> 7.4 of 10
