Because I did, I did not expect too much and I was pleasantly surprised. It is a very fun little crime film with interesting characters, excellent portraits, writing that is hopeless without being a glib and a good pace. Funky looks good too. It seems that people either love this movie or just hate it, and I'm the one who liked it.
