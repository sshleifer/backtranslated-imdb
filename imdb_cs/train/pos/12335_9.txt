Warning: Contains a spoiler. Corny conspiracy and in many cases horrible acting. Fontaine is great, but some others, especially Richard Ney, the husband of Ivy, are extremely woody. Ney lies in bed, dying of arsenic poisoning, with all the hair in place. But the film is so juicy and thrilling. More faithful to this book than most films of their time. The accumulation of Joan Fontaine as a poison (and an adulteress that was just as shocking - I'm kidding, kids) was a master stroke. It's her usual Joan Fontainey. As the murderers had, it would die by dropping "feet in front of me across the floor into empty space."
