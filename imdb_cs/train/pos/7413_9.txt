The shower is kept in many ways. Almost the entire film takes place in an ancient spa house, where people offer humor, pathos and emotional touches. Love and friendship between the owner and his retarded son are deep and moving. The way an older brother is drawn into this tiny world seems unmanageable and convincing. The story is meandered, full of surprise and irony, and touched the overall feeling of what I call neighborhood in the relationships and conflicts of artists. It's a movie I'm pulling out when I want to believe in the world again.
