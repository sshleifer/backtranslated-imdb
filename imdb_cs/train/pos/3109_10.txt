The third and final film of this trilogy is finally quite clear. It's a political film more than fun. Jason Bourne finally realizes who is and discovers and remembers the torture he has been subjected to to kill his old identity: he has actually killed someone who has become his corpse. The film finally reveals that all of this was organized and planned by the CIA under the Blackfriars program, which is also clearly revealed in this film to remove all American citizens who have tried to prevent the control of the whole society by an established and limited group of people. Who was one of the CIA's major officers until 1980 when he became Vice President? This corresponds to what is said on the Internet. Then the truth comes through Jason Bourne himself, but the main person who will be able to bring this to the public and the only body that can decide on the CIA is a woman and this woman gets a senate involved in a general investigation. Woman and Senate; look away from your lips. In the US, politics are being fought in the media, and two media are crucial to every presidential campaign: music and cinema. Right now, Hollywood and beyond intelligence, academia, and intellectuals are using cinematography in general, and especially this film, to create the idea that salvation will come from women and the Senate. So go and look at the movie. It is quite fun and has the sweet smell of the end of the season and the great change that some are waiting and others waiting for, but no one can pretend it will not come. The only point is to know how deep and serious it is. Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Dauphine University, Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne and Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
