I love this movie seriously, I never enjoyed watching. The only line I really can not stomach about is when Riff calls adolescent lobotomy, but besides, everything else is perfect. I have never been a fan of PJ Soles, and it did not help to hear that she did not even know who Ramones was until she made the film, but I can mostly ignore it. Most people who watch it over and over are fans of Ramones and really ... that's the only reason I love it so much. I never feel tired of seeing DeeDee hit her pizza lines, or Joey's name again and again, haha. One of the best parts of the movie is to see how they sing, you want to dance, in the corridors of high school. I love it. The special release of the DVD has a good retrospect, surprisingly PJ Soles is not on it. Perhaps he is working on another project * laughs * Anyway a great movie, even better if you are a fan of Ramones.
