That's the best picture of baseball ever since Redford stunned The Natural Way. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths light up the screen with a great story and cast that seemed real to bring you to life. <br /> <br /> Tied to Dreams - in fact, it really falls down, the American Dream reigns again after 9.11 with a real story about the newcomer Devil Ray, who is called Jimmy Morris. Australian born actress Rachel Griffiths plays Native Western Texan better than a lot of texas I know; and Dennis Quaid was perfect? cast as a winner, gonnabe, and a humble winner with as many psychological luggage as the average viewer in the audience. That's real. Screen chemistry works. If you like baseball heaters, you will love this movie. Ingredients for the Americana and Apple Pie were all there. My popcorn has become "a la mode". <br /> <br /> And hey: buy a CD! Rocks of rock and grandstands carry the story! Synchronizing words and music moves the story forward exactly as it should, an area that more often disappoints me. Criticism: I would give baseball to someone else. But Quaid has something to teach us about all sorts of characters and hearts. Saint Rita and the nuns were a nice decoration, but they never showed them in the story to open and close around them. A little long. It is worth every minute in the last analysis. 8 / 10. <br /> <br />
