I have to say in Danish film that it's a very good movie. <br /> <br /> It's in its own class, yet it has international potential. <br /> <br /> The film has a large budget and plays famous Danish actors and some newcomers who play very well. This can be seen by anyone who likes adventure and a little "ghost" of the movie. Do not be afraid, be excited!
