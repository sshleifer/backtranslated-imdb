David Aames is a wealthy handsome man who lives in New York City. When his sleeping partner, Julie Gianni, becomes very jealous after David falls into the Spanish beauty of Sofia, David gets in the car and tells him that she is the only guy she loves and wants to be, but when she sees she is in love with Sofia, she he decides to commit suicide with David in a car with her when the bridge goes off. David survives the crash but remains with a disfigured face. He is then accused of murdering Julie. The point is that David does not know what is real and what is not, because he still has strange dreams (most of them are nightmares) and flashes, some of which just do not make sense to him. Everything will soon return to him, even though he is beginning to recognize the truth. Well, there's a cast star, including Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee and Noah Taylor, who have done good in the film. In the film, everyone was postponing different things about those attitudes, such as happiness, sadness, angry, etc. Really good. The film also features an occasional film by gorgeous Steven Spielberg. Vanilla Sky is a well-created, different, interesting and original film that heavily talks about when you finish your work. It's not just a thriller, but it's a real psychological thriller. Trailer for the movie is really good, but the film is so different from what could be done. It was very well managed and there were also some great scenes. Overall, it's a nice film that should really be paid attention. Sure they do a lot of movies "They're dead, if not dead."
