Steve Carell plays again in the light of a romantic film about elections, family and pressure. When I assessed the plot and cover art of the film, I waited for a complicated comedy, lots of laughter and unrealistic elements, but I think I was wrong. Sure, the movie had some comedy, but it felt much more out of the light of Drama and Steve Carell again gave great performance. The film itself really deals with real observations and it was a powerful element I found. But the end felt somewhat grim and predictable. Finally, the cinema was great, the acting was great, and the message she delivered was obvious, but it was very important. Though it came to an old, flat and predictable ending. I would be sure that at the end of the movie (perhaps for the bad, even others) it would be decided that the film would get better publicity. Still a fun movie.
