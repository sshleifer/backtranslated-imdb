It's a short film by David Lynch with just 8 minutes, but he got all the "Lynchian ingredients"! It's mysterious, dark, unconvincing, strange and weird; and before the blonde starts talking, it's a bit frightening! The soundtrack is exceptional for creating this special atmosphere, because it's also ominous and mysterious? <br /> <br /> The setting itself does not have the "traditional" red curtains, but it has socks of purple painted walls that give it the same effect of fury. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a girl who is locked in a dark room and she calls for help; then comes another girl who starts talking with her in a mysterious way, saying that she is there just because of her mistake? We do not know what happened or what happens? it ended unresolved and mysterious as a good Lynch movie has to end! <br /> <br /> It's a great short movie, even though it's amateur acting. Girls are professional actresses, but I think their acting could be better in this short time.
