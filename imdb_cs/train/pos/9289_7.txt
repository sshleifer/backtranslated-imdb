In THE BARBARIAN AND GEISHA, John Wayne Townsend Harris, a real US ambassador, was responsible for the real opening of Japan to international relations in the late 1950s. In front of him, Commodore Perry launched his arms in Japan in 1853 and in 1853 forced the Japanese to contract. Harris, who came a little later, submitted details and helped to ensure compliance - since many Japanese had no particular interest in honoring the first treaty. All this is true and is shown in the movie. According to some other sources, I have found that the novel between Harris and Japanese geisha is mostly fiction, and this romance is rather the center of this film (that is, the title). My first reaction is the first time I saw this movie was one surprise. John Wayne as a diplomat ?! When it is in most films diplomatic, please say, and thank you when pummels people !!!! So seeing him playing a man who is not a man of action and able to play a diplomatic game looked really weird. In fact, I can not think of too many actors in 1958 who would be unusual for this role. By the way, I saw that the photos of Harris and Wayne were not at all with him. <br /> <br /> However, despite the story of a lot of freedoms with the truth and special cast, the film is still very observable. Color cinematography is pretty, the film shows some nice views of Japanese customs and culture, and acting is not bad. All in all, a sympathetic and traceable film despite its special rendition. PS - Read the trivia for this movie. You'll find a little bit more about real life, as well as the anticipated struggle between Wayne and the director (John Huston), where Wayne apparently set off! Based on what I read about Huston and the way he got with the actors, it's an incident that I tend to believe. And it's also a nice example of John Wayne diplomacy.
