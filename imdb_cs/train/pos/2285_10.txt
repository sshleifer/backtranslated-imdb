I did not read this book, but I was terrible throughout the movie, I thought in one head: it's Vonnegut. I have never seen the author, all the intelligence, and life behind the making of a novel that was shot as well as a film. This film had the same complexity found in Vonnegut's novels: jokes were often meaningful and symbolic, and dramatic events and symbols were often jokes too. Campbell was also a very character of Vonnegut, who perfectly portrayed Nick Nolte. He had all the distinctions of Vonnegut's "hero": lack of interest in political boundaries, ironic dark humor retreating to stupid inaction in response to stress and unwillingness to push his version of reality to those around him. > <br /> Overall, I was always surprised and amazed when I watched this movie. It was the same feeling that I read "The Cat Cradle", my first Vonnegut novel, as if it were the most appropriate thing that could happen, thinking about TO, and it made it real and important. Yes, it does not just have the surplus weapons of the "White Christmas" album. That's it!
