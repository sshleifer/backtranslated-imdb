Fox's epic narrative of one of America's greatest pioneering efforts comes to DVDs with some really great "Extras". BRIGHAM YOUNG ("Frontiersman" was added for the European edition), telling the story of a great pioneer leader who brought inspiration from members of the Mormon faith (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) to Salt Lake Valley in 1847, after the mobs murdered their prophet The leader, Joseph Smith (played by Vincent Price), was brought to screen in the 1940s just as America was about to enter World War II. It was a courageous move for Chief Fox, Darry F. Zanuck, and it was fresh air for Mormon people, as it was the first attempt at a positive expression of faith on the screen. Now Fox is working with James D'Arce, the curator of the excellent film archives at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, bringing this movie to a DVD format in an emerging release. Т предпо volumearσίου, kterýiua данни ત oval месец, σώμα, ησης, σίουлнатар предполагам, че human предполната exists Hells econom Νοεμβρίου, Luxembourg, Rajin, данни, separates fact from fiction, and allows the audience to understand why these films appreciated by the Church leaders, even though throughout the film underway the improvement of truth. One of the fun things about Dean Jagger, an actor who plays the lead role. Many years after the film he married the last holy woman and was eventually transformed into the LDS faith. From D'Arch's knowledge there are many things and it's great to have it as part of the DVD! In the Fox & BYU archive, more than 100 frames and videos from an incredible premiere are held on seven theaters in Salt Lake City. Thanks to FOX for another great DVD - and thank you, James D'Arco for your great comment!
