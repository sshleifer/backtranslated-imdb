Marvelous cult movie from 1979, in which Vince Lombardi High School students are confronted with a new dictatorial title called Miss Togar (Mary Woronov). Togar is a musical hatred and blames the students' musical taste for their misconduct. An attack against her is a fun-loving riff Randell (PJ outsole), the # 1 Ramones fan, who, more than anything else, wants a rock band to record their songs. <br /> <br /> Now * this * is an impossible movie to resist. First of all, the soundtrack is incredible, with songs by such artists as Alice Cooper and Velvet Underground, in addition to the non-infectious non-stop Ramones songs. "Teenage Lobotomy", "Sheena's Punk Rocker" and "Blitzkrieg Bop" are just some of them. Furthermore, casting really gives them everything, with Soles the ideal choice for the role of Riffa; she is a real joy. Vincent Van Patten and Dey Young are as serious as Tom and Kate; Woronov is cast as an arrogant and contemptuous Togar; Clint Howard has one of his finest parts as a bathroom occupying businessman Eaglebauer and New World champions such as Dick Miller, Paul Bartel especially fun as music teacher Mr. McGree) and The Real Don Steele are fun as ever. And, of course, it's a tribute to Ramones playing alone. <br /> <br /> The film has a true ghost. The level of energy is high, the co-author of the story, and director Allan Arkush brings a great mood to work. There is also a great sense of humor. Paper plane flyer is an excellent example of this. This extends directly into the style of "wiping" scenic transitions. There are even cheerful giant mice created by future makeup effects remarkable by Rob Bottin, in one of his first concerts. <br /> <br /> As good as an authority-deflect, defend, even a self-right-to-party movie to get. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is simply a beautiful film. <br /> <br /> 8/10
