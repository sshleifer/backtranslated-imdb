A good continuation of murder in a small town. In this money and his policeman, a friend, he discovers a sticky plot with a Nazi criminal, a philanthropist witch and a family of dizziness and their helpers. Just as in the original, the spectator is treated with a nice little secret with distinctive views and sounds of pre-war America. Go for it.
