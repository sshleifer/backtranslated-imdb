Steve Carell comes to his own first role in 40 years old Virgin, who has only supportive roles in such films as Bewitched, Bruce the Almighty, Anchorman and his Daily Show, and we get only a little taste of the comedy Carell really does. You can say that Will Ferrell has influenced his "comic air," but Carell takes him to a different level, everything he does is innocent, kind and cheerful. I would not hesitate to say that Steve Carell is one of the other great comedians of our time. A 40-year-old virgin is two hours of continuous laugh (or 4 hours if you see it twice as much as I do), the perfect backing, and the superb guiding the audience through the whole movie. The script was perfect with so many great lines you'll want to see again so you can see them. The music fits perfectly into the movie tone and you can say that the director knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Fulfilled with sexual jokes, some nudity and lots of languages, this movie is not for everyone but if you like wedding crashers, anchorman or some movie in this direction, you will absolutely love a 40 year old virgin.
