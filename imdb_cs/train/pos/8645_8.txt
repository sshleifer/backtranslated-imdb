I've seen this movie many years ago and made a lasting impression on me. Unfortunately, over the years, I have hardened many movies and I could not expect to be amazed at California when she recently learned. I'm pleased to say that it's just as nervous and observable as it was ten years ago. There are two things that really give this film its power. The first is her cast. We have a tremendously disturbing turn from young Bra Pitt as Early Grace. Knowing how Pitt, like all of us, as if it were one of Hollywood's most enduring hearts, is refreshing to see how to play such a nasty and unattractive character. Pitt pulls out the show without resorting to a white clich√© or parody, and can be really scary throughout the movie. Juliette Lewis is as impressive as Grace's tragic girlfriend, who plays characters like a ten-year-old girl with a forty-year life. Lewis is able to bring compassion (for the status of her character in life) and contempt (for her naivety), but she supports her performance with a kindness that seldom sees the actor so young. Personally, I think it's a tragedy that neither Pitt nor Lewis have been nominated for any awards for their acting. David Duchovony and Michelle Forbes are perfectly occupied as juppies who unconsciously end up on the US via Pitt and Lewis. Ghosts are truly captivating and naive, and Forbes seems to be strongly cynical and closed, but both actors can convincingly portray their character changes because they are equally engaged, repulsive, and strangely attracted to Pitt. <br /> <br /> Fine casting and even brilliant playing aside, this film really captures us with a proverbial ball with flawless stimulation. At the time California was released, Hollywood released a bunch of pretty psychotic films ("Single Heaven", "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle," "Hanging," "Sleep with the Enemy", etc.). Most of these films followed the same pattern, the only variation being the nature of the relationship between good man and evil man. "California" does not get too far from this territory, but her first two acts are a perfect example of a slow-blowing thriller, and we are still at the very edge of our places waiting for the tide of tide. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When the penny sinks and Pitt is relaxed to play a maniacal evil person, the movie completely shifts the speed and the last twenty minutes does not go to the rest of the movie. This means that the action is thick and fast and the resolution is cool. The fight is over, but the scars will always be there. <br /> <br /> Much of the narrative (provided somewhat whiny, before the X-files of Spirituals) is conceived. Of course, it is from a book written by Duchovon's journalist character, so we could say that a self-conscious narrative is a nod to the sensational style in which most journalists write. <br /> <The film is largely successful and is definitely more than 90% of thrillers in the last twenty years. We highly recommend, but not for a weak stomach or mind. This film worries more than one level. But then it should be.
