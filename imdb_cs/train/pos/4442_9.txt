Ogre is a film made for television in Italy and was not intended as a sequel to demons, as Lamberto Bava even mentioned it in an interview with the DVD Sheirk Show but was called Demons III as part of the demons. Music in demons and demons 2 was 80th rock music while this is even more scary music and while the first two were the terrible horror of Demons III: Ogre's architectural horror, so it's how Demon III is not a proper sequel to the Demons but still like this movie . <br /> <br /> Music is scary and adds the tone of the castle from which the film is placed. Ogre is another thing why he likes the film. There are two more films that are classified as Demons III, and they are Black Demons (Demons 3) and Church (Demons 3). Demons III: Ogre is a good movie until you compare it with demons and demons 2.
