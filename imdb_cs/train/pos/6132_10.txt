I am glad that the users (as of this date) who like this movie are now coming. I do not understand people who did not like this movie - they seem to have expected a serious (?!?!?) Treatment! Do you know how the hell can you kill a snowman? Movie players knew it was a stupid assumption and they did not try to deny it. The terrible delivery of scenes really makes FUNNY! Yes, there are times when the budget is low (such as an explosion), but I think the expensive look would take the fun out of the movie! So if you love B-movies and you like the fucking idea, then you will definitely love "Jack Frost".
