What I loved in adapting The Stone Angel on the screen is that it was so true to the novel! Great movie! As a passionate reader I find it the worst in film adaptations that the book somehow loses translation. You can say Stone Angel's team was careful not to let it go with this movie. Ellen Burstyn was an excellent casting choice for the role of Hagar and she is definitely a film superstar. But I think that the Canadian actress (Christine Horne), who chose to play Hagar in her younger years, has also done an incredible work that guarantees great praise. I have never seen any Horne's previous work, but I'll definitely find her after seeing her Stone Angel's idea. I have heard that Canadian theatrical release of The Stone Angel will be held in the spring or summer of 2008. I can not wait to reappear on the big screen!
