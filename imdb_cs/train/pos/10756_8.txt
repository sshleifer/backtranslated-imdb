Very interesting and moving documentary about the tragedy of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. The main theme is the heroism of American firefighters who have tried to save as many people as possible. The film is deeply emotional and somewhat troubling - many people saw on the screen lost their lives! Recommended.
