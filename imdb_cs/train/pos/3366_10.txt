Ettore Scola, one of the finest and most beautiful directors we have secular citizens, is not yet available on DVD ... (it's summer 2001 right now ....) The mystery that you think. <br /> <br /> This great classic has returned to theaters in my home town thanks to Sophie Loren - summer retrospective and has seen her again on the big screen after all those years when she saw her on a video tape ... it's real gift. <br /> <br /> To avoid criticism, try to prove that I took my reluctant younger brother with me to see this movie. He had never seen this movie before, and "he does not like the Italians Oldies ..." Like everyone else in the theater, this miracle was fascinated. Even during the final titles the theater remained silent. <br /> <br /> This SPECIAL DAY is really strange. Miraculous miracle. And a big loss if you have not seen them yet ...
