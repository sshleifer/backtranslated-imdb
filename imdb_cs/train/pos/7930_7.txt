I will be honest. I have the movie to have fun. I mean, "Hood of the dead dead"? What other reaction can I have? The thing is, however, that the film (and its creators) decided it would not make fun. Instead he would have tried best to be a good movie. And you know what? It was awfully close. A little less cheese in side-by-side music, a little more professionalism in photography, acting, side-by-side (like the Best Buy Bag) ... well, it's not a classic zombie movie genre, but it's still a pretty nice little movie in itself. And acting, writing and stimulating are surprisingly better than I would expect. There is even some decent humor, because two of our leaders are discussing how to decide whether the dead zombies are really dead. If you can overlook the low part of the budget (which leaves its fingerprints in everything, unfortunately) and the almost constant stupidity, it can be quite a fun time in movies. No, it's not great. Yes, it could be better. But the creators, the actors, the crew, all tried to make a good movie (instead of a classic camp) and that counts a lot. The line of camp zombie movies is a mile long and thank you guys for adding to them. <br /> <br /> Kudos to the Brothers Quiroz. I'd love to see what they're doing next. And hey, somebody, give them a budget!
