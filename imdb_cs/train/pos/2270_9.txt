After reading the book, the film is a little "thin", but it's still one of the best movies ever shot. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and Nick Nolte is really "vonneguty". He does a great job of expressing feelings from book to film. Many movies do not engage the feeling of a book, just like Mother's Night.
