During the celebration of Kurt Weill in Brookluna, where are we going? was eventually discovered for screening. It's amazing that the screen may be missing a movie from an era that has Weill-Gershwin's collaboration. The score is high and CD material with Gershwin and Weil only underlines his merits, which are considerable. Yes, the film has its own problems, but the score is not one of them. Ratoff is not the director of this musical fantasy, and Fred MacMurray can not grasp the material. Then, the "modern" segment is also weak. But the fantasy elements carry the high-end film, as well as the work of two wonderful prominent ladies - Joan Leslie and June Haver. Both have the charm that this kind of work desperately needs to work. Like the Second World War, to greet the history of our country - though within the "never been", the film has its place in the Hollywood musical history and should be available to everyone to see and find its great merits.
