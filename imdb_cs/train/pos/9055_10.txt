This is an amazing movie and all actors and actresses and very good! Although some actors and actresses were not very popular in the show business, they seemed to be behaving since they were one year old! It was funny, rough and just a good movie. In most parts, I just did not know what to do next! I was like I think it will happen, wait, I think it will happen. All movies will love all ages! In some parts I could not laugh, it was so funny, but in some parts I was totally exhausted and could not believe what I see! I'm sure to see this movie again! It's one of those movies that can not be bored. Every time you see it's so exciting. I definitely recommend seeing this movie!
