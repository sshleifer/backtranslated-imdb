Level 1, Horror. When I first saw this movie at 10, I knew it gave me nightmares. Oh yes. Surprisingly, as I recall, it was the sound just like the sight of the monster that caused them. <br /> <br /> Second level, psychoanalytic theory. <br /> <br /> Later, as an adult, I saw a story about what it was: What if the wild, unrestrained instincts that we all suppressed manifested themselves? <br /> <br /> The third level, pure science fiction. <br /> <br /> The best way to correctly implement the "What if" scenario is through a science fiction genre. This is pure scientific fantasy, not "cowboys in the universe," which is now going through the genre. <br /> <br /> After 43 years, Forbidden Planet is the largest of all science fiction films. If you are planning a remake, SKG or Lucas, beware!
