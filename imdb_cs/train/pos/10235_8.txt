An unusual movie by Ringo Lam, which is oddly underrated. The combination of fantasy kung fu with a more realistic representation of body-swords and spears is surprising especially during the first ten minutes. The rider rides in two and his waist and legs are riding. Several horses chop. It is very unexpected. The story is very simple, Fong and his Shaolin brothers are captured by the crazy generals of the maniac and imprisoned in the Red Lotus Temple, which seems to be rather an agonizing chamber, then a temple. The general is similar to Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, when he empties philosophy and makes scary images of human blood. <br /> <br /> The production is very impressive and the setting is hopeless. Blood is everywhere. The action is very well done and mostly coherent, unlike many HK action scenes from the time. Sometimes the film goes into absurdity or the effects are cheese, but it's never bad enough to destroy the movie. <br /> <br /> Find it, it's one of the best HK kung fu films since the early nineties. Just remember that it's not child friendly.
