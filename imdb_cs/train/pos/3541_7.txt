Originally, it was supposed to be Gene Kelly, but when the creators could not get it, they got the "greatest actor in the world" and the result is pretty good. Basically Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) has trouble doing what he does best by setting up a high stakes game on cubes because he needs $ 1,000 to get a seat. So to get the money he has a $ 1000 bet with old friend Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) that he can not get Sergeant Sarah Brown (Golden Globe with Great Expectations and BAFTA nominated Jean Simmons) to go with him Havana. Meanwhile, Nathan has had difficulty getting rid of a woman who wants her to marry her, Miss Adelaide (Vivian Blaine). Also starring Robert Keith as Lieutenant Brannigan, Stubby Kaye as the pretty Johnson and B.S. Pulley like a big jula. An interesting romantic comedy musical, when Brando sings all of her own songs and Sinatra is smooth and cool. She was nominated for Oscars for Best Art Direction - set of decorations, best cinematography, best costume design and best music for Jay Blackton and Cyril J. Mockridge, nominated BAFTA for the best film from any source, and won the Golden Globe Best Film - Musical / Comedy. Frank Sinatra was number 43 on the 100 best pop cultural icons, Marlon Brando was number 30 on the 100 biggest film stars, was the number 11 on 100 greatest sexual symbols, was number 4 on 100 years, 100 stars - men, Sinatra was 35, Brando was No. 1 to the World's Biggest Actor, "Luck being Lady," was the number 42 on 100 years, 100 songs for, the film was a number 23 on 100 Years of Musicals, and it was number 36 on 100 greatest musicals. Very good!
