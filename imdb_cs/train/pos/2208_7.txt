The Joanne Murray College will assume the noble work that prepares student housing to become a flat that includes the sale of unneeded furniture. It happens during a break, so the mysterious psycho chases nearly empty spaces in the campus. "Blood" is a low budget movie slasher that is quite funny. The effect is pretty bad, the plot is predictable but gore effects are pretty good. The film was made by UCLA student films by Stephen Carpenter and Jeffrey Obrow for almost nothing. It seems to be a dreamy atmosphere, similar to the surrounding luster of fantastic Jeff Leiberman "Just before dawn" .7 out of 10. It's great to see Daphne Zuniga of "The Initiation" glory that he drives several times through the car.
