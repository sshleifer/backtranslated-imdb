The movie is absolutely fantastic! If you watch it with your friends, it can be a very nice day ... It is obvious that you have to know that the movie is stupid and very badly managed and acted (Tomba / Unziker, what couple) and this is probably the worst movie in the world, but you can enjoy it very much. We saw it in 19 and it was a very nice evening. The best scenes are the first when the criminals kill Alex and try to act as desperate and the result is a comic scene of the first category ... And then, when he shows the Left (Antevleva, what is the name "Palassio di giusstissia" and then the Levy accident that once went on my car off the road and a second later the car is completely empty! What a spell!
