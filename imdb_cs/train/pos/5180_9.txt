There is this private camping in Plymouth, Massachusetts, around 1959. My grandparents belonged to its founders, my parents had their place since 1965 and my two brothers have seats there. It has nothing to do with the movie, it takes me.) I spent the summer on Blueberry Hill since I was five years old when I was eighteen, and that's for people like me to whom this film speaks: those for whom was a camp camp in the forest, as my fiance says about "a good and happy place". If you have never experienced a lifestyle, you will probably lose the Indian summer; do not worry. It's not fast, it does not have quick cuts, the land is not at least a bit tangled, it has no explosions, the dramatic tension that exists is mild, there are no A-list actors, there are no attempts at a quick fire, just to show how smart they are scriptwriters (other than probably Kimberley Williams's murderous line about how her fianc√© should not "change her toys." This is not even the smallest degree of what this movie is, more than Godfather is slasher flick just because he has plenty on the screen gore, but the Indian summer is a birthing polar opposite, if you have a lifestyle, check out this movie, read more, just do it. <br /> <br /> It's a 9/10 movie for me.
