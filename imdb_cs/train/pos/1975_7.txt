It seems that it is fashionable to tear the "Basic Instinct 2" to the point that a significant part of the audience (including critics) considered it terrible before it was released. It seems even more fashionable when the death of Sharon Stone, who like all of us is now fourteen years older and unlike most of us still looks great. The first comments on this movie were so vicious that I had to look at myself. In my opinion, this sequel is not as good as the original movie, but it's not as bad as most commentaries make. Michael Caton-Jones is not Paul Verhoeven, neither Henry Bean and Leora Barish are Joe Eszterhas. "Basic Instinct 2" is just a fun, average thriller, and in addition to adding the original score to Jerry Goldsmith, it's little like its predecessor. Even Stone gives her character a different dimension, creating a greedy, diabolical Catherine Trimell, perfectly suited to other monsters like Hannibal Lecter. She is an intelligent actress who is not afraid to gamble and can play with a children's camp. Unfortunately, it seems to be the main target for those who like this movie. It has become too successful, too big a main icon and like all the actors who have reached this level, her time has come and she is now forced to destroy Hollywood viewers. The rest of the cast is excellent, it gives performances that are much better than the material deserves. David Morrissey is a much better actor and much more interesting than Michael Douglas: his acting is flawless, he gives dense and intricate dimensions of a different one-dimensional nature. Because it has more time on the screen and is the axis of the movie, it can keep your attention from start to finish. I do not answer "Basic Instinct 2" as a great movie; I just disagree with most of the comments on this site and the belief that other agendas than the film itself make the view of most viewers.
