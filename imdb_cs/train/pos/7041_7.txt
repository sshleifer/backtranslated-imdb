WAR, INC. (2008) ** 1/2 John Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Dan Aykroyd, Sergey Trifunovic, Lyubomir Neikov, Ned Bellamy, <br /> <br /> Hit-and-miss-21 . <br /> <br /> John Cusack? who wrote the script with Mark Leyner and Jeremy Piker? stars as a crazy hit-man named Brand Hauser who is burned out but definitely following one final assignment by freezing the Middle East oil minister named Omar Sharif (yes, not Omar Sharif but you will get a tone here from this outage on laughs) led by the former US Vice President (Aykroyd, Cusack's old "Grosse Pointe Blank" co-hort, Dick Cheney manqu√© is doing here) and making Brands Reason to Trade Show the Producer in Mythical Turaqistan (read: Iraq / Afghanistan ) for the American private company Tamerlane (read: Halliburton). <br /> <br /> During the meeting, Brand is struggling with a moment of clarity when he encounters the intimidated journalist Natalie Hegalhuzen (Tomei) and finally falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tamerlane sponsors the unlikely link of East European teen sensations Yonica Babyyeah (surprisingly decent Duff who loses his tongue) and idiot son of the country's leader. > <br /> This is followed by a humble attempt at a black comedy of the 21st century and at "DR STRGGEL", but for all intense and meaningful experiences than hits in this wide laughing attempt in the middle of a political message (an unfair warfare) outsourced by American capitalism, check out!) <br /> <br /> While Cusack riffs on his Martin Blank from the aforementioned 'Pointe' adds some nice touches to his man in black (makes Tabasco sauce footage, (except for Joan's sister who is uncomfortable as a tough assistant for Hauser and has one of the funniest laughs: "My mass communication skills will eventually pay off"). <br /> <br /> Cusack visited the wars in Iraq at the beginning of this year at 180 degrees different "Grace Is Gone" opinions to wear on the sleeve, while the overall remarkable rhythm rhythm and rhythms are largely unpleasant - thanks to the film Joshua Seftel, who here nat (and it is obvious), with the exception of possibly a good choreographer. Hauser is involved in the accompaniment of the silly Babyye fiance. /> <br /> A nice attempt despite bad guides; maybe next time Cusack will not try so hard and let the idiocy of the war speak for itself rather than heavy lifting itself.
