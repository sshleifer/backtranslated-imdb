I really liked this version of "Vanishing Point" unlike the 1971 version. I found the 1971 version quite boring. If I can stand in the middle of the film several times (as in the 1971 version) than I do, it's not so great. Of course, it could be due to the fact that at the time of the 1971 release I was only nine. However, I have seen many remakes where I liked the original and older ones. I found out that the 1997 version was more understandable and kept in principle in line with the original wording without disturbing the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion, I felt that the 1997 version was more excited and was not so "blastem". (Boring)
