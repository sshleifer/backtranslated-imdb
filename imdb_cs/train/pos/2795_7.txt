I like playing football and I thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football. It was a good Hollywood / Bollywood movie and I am glad to have won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good, and so was Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers was great at playing the ball. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) loves playing football, but her parents want to learn how to cook they want to marry. When Jazz begins to play a football team, he secretly meets Juliet (Kierou Knightlety) and Joe (Jonathon Rhyes Meyers), who is her coach. When her parents find problems, her father lets her play on her Pinky (Archie Punjabi) wedding. At the end, the parents will realize how much they love football and let her go abroad.
