The gray garden is shocking, fun, sad and fascinating. I watched with amazement as Ediths Jr. and Sr. grabbing and performing as they remembered their past. Their existence in a dilapidated estate (which they have not left for more than fifteen years) is a comedy and a tragedy. This is a movie that you will not soon forget.
