I enjoyed this movie very much because it is a true story in the Amazon, which is part of the world that has always attracted me. I believe the abridged version of the book was published in "Reader's Digest" shortly after a real event. <br /> <br /> Because I'm a "baby boomer," the character and the actress are my contemporaries, and that's why I was referring to the film. I also believe that the film is valuable for teaching survival skills if the viewer follows the nature of the streams that lead to the river and to the coastal settlements where he can get help, as well as other survival techniques. The most important thing was her will to survive and to maintain a positive attitude. Finally, I hope the audience will learn something about it, and see it for fun. I would like the movie to be released on VHS and DVD soon as I want to add it to my collection of videos. It should also be seen more often on satellite film channels.
