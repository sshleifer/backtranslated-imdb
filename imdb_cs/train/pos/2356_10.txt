Pushing Daisies was a great show. Like Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls, you can say that Bryan Fuller was created. I understand that people who do not have much love for theater, cinema, musicals and the like will be poisoned. This is not a typical television program and fantastic is too much for some. It seems these people need a little more linear and quiet tone to be happy. This program explodes colorfully, blinks on old movie scenes, buzzes with incredible music and talented performances. In elections that are made from costumes to a leitmotif, nothing is random. The story has many twists and turns but they are all very accessible because the interviews are about love, honesty, courage, loss and many other things we face every day. The only unfortunate aspect was the end of the show, which was rushed because Pushing Daisies was canceled. Do not connect to it as a typical TV show. Think of it as an evening in the theater, then sit down and enjoy yourself!
