I've been a fan of Star Trek for as long as I remember. When I announced the planning and the fifth series premiere, I was very excited. The premiere of the business was worth the wait. It was great due to the perfect setting and great acting work of all the characters. The NX-01 Enterprise is the perfect craft to show the beginnings of what many people love. Scott Bakula was just superior to Captain Jonathan Archer. Jolene Blalock gave a spectacular performance as Subcommander T'Pol. It's just two people out of this beautiful new crew who bravely takes us into the great history of the Starfleet. The business seems to be a good series that is worth watching, and I recommend it.
