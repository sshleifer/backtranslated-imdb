Yes, Shakespeare would be really proud. Laurence Fishburne was not at his best, but certainly not bad. Kenneth Brannagh on the other hand, was great. His mysteries were wonderful, just like playing with the audience. Very nice work. <br /> <br /> Sometimes there was too little drama where you could expect more. Cassio's killing, for example, was a bit hazy because too much was done, causing the viewer to turn his head to grab it. Did I mention Michael Maloney? His split Roderig was unusual; even unpleasant. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen Othella before, look at this. If you did not read Othello, look at this. If you have not heard of Othelle, look at it. On the other hand, you do it in kindness by reading it, seeing it act on the stage and hear it sings.
