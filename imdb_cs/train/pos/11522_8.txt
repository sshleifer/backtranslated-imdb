I wanted to see it the longest, James Merendino is a great director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite films, and in the first ten minutes of this movie, I thought it was a great sequel even though it started pulling. The game and direction were amazing. In fact, everything in the movie seemed to run out of the scenario. Sometimes it was that Claire Forlani was the most beautiful woman in the world. This movie was good, but I expected more. <br /> <br /> Check out great portraits by Chi McBride and Chris McDonald.
