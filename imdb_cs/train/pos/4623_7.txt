Despite its modest title, it's a light teenage dramedy. If you are not an old kitten, you probably will be sorry. It's not as good as evolving characters or situations smoothly. When you look at it, you feel like you went back and forth to the kitchen even though you were sitting and watching all the time. It's one of those movies that counts a lot with your characters character and is so tempting. Jennifer Connelly is the heart of many people, I know, but I always liked Maddie Corman's darker. Juveniles get most of the time on the screen without getting out of those annoying adults. Is it just me or most of the young men looking terribly similar?
