Ernst Marischka, one of the most respected Austrian directors of that time, made films full of beautiful scenes, subtle love and taking into account everything that is precious in life. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, if people were to hear about it, they associate the name Marischka with the SISSI trilogy (1955,1956,1957). But he did other excellent films like DAS DREIMADERLHAUS (1958), EMBEZZLED HEAVEN (1958) and definitely this, MADCHENJAHRE EINER KONIGIN showing the young years of Queen Victoria. Although this is a slightly different subject than SISSI, there are not many differences between this film and SISSI. They are remarkably similar. The film is almost identical. Style, music, photography. In fact, the crew is almost the same. Anton Profes, Bruno Mondi! <br /> <br /> Romney Schneider is one of the first major roles. It was an amazing introduction to her role as Sissi, because this film arose one year before the first part of the trilogy about the Austrian Empress. It is also a film where Roma and their mother Magda Schneider play. But Ernst Marischka was not the first director to fill the Roma to play with her mother. Rom's debut, WENN DER WEISSE FLIEDER WIEDER BLUHN (1953), was also a performance with his mother. Therefore, there were several voices that the Roma started their Austrian career on the basis of her mother's glory. In fact, it's true. <br /> <br /> Again, just like in SISSI, this movie shows a very sweet love. Victoria meets Prince Albert at a small inn in Dover. Their sympathy is based on a pure exaltation in dance and delicate smiles. And now...? What would happen? Just sex ... But is this the only thing on which love is based? <br /> <br /> I am grateful to Ernst Marischko for these films. They had a soul and a message. Some people can call them kitschitsi, but I will never give up admiring these films. They are IMPRESSIVE! DANGEROUS, HIGH CONFIDENCE!
