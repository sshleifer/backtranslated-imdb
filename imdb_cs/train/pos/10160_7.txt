I went to this movie when he thought it would be a dirty b-rated movie. I was surprised and amused. Eve was good, but Lake Bell stole the show. She had amazing comic timing. The jokes in this movie were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two jokes between them. The conspiracy was enough to bring it all together, the woman (Eve) died on her wedding day and returned to lose the woman who is married to her husband, her sounds are overcrowded, but she really works pretty well. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Overall, it's a very useful watch watch if it does not get on the DVD when it comes out.
