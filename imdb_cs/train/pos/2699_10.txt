There are other reviews, so I do not have to say how great it is or what goes on ... My opinion is: I've heard about this movie long before it was shown. I can not even remember, I just know it was over the Internet. Distributors went before they ever hit! For months I moped and complained. Please note that this site is a link to the purchase of this film and the only highlighted area is the VHS at Amazon.com in Germany. You can use the Alta Vista Babelfish translation. I know it's the PAL and DID format to change the text on the screen in German and in the beginning is a tiny narrative that was also dubbed in German but as fun and huge as this movie is really fun! If you want to see this movie and you have a place in the neighborhood that makes conversions, it's worth it! It cost about twenty dollars to get to the US from Germany. Trust me, it might look like a lot of what you spend on the movie, but if you get into the cruel b-flicks, you'll blow money left and right to get conversions for your friends!
