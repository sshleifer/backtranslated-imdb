La Teta y la Luna is a symbolic film in Spain. Everything that occurs in this movie has a symbolic meaning. It is quite different from the usual film to which a person has access. This movie is good, but it will be good only for people who want to find the meaning of everything in the movie. I have the advice that this is not a sample film. <br /> <br /> Please enjoy!
