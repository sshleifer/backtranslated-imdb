Little Richard's life and time, as Little Richard had said and produced and directed by Little Richard, was probably one of his songs. It's not a biography or even a masterpiece, but it's got good writing, great energy, and a great actor Richard. All of the music is at Little Richard, so every song jumps tight lips. <br /> <br /> The film covers his early childhood, is transmitted during the formative years in music, a wild success, and Richard is throwing everything to praise the Lord. Everything that was well connected and an apparent return in 1962 managed to stay away from the idea that Little Richard had discovered the Beatles who had opened for him. My main objection is that his blatant, anti-cultural behavior is undervalued and you do not feel how his audience was at the time. Some of his energy, which he still has, will not go through the full force. It seemed to be tampered with, in comparison to what I remembered. <br /> <br /> The best scenes are that Richard rises Lucille and writes about the bikini songs and bands in his shorts to perform that they do not have a decent place to change. If they got into the "Bronze Liberation," as Richard recalls in conversations, then it's a story. Trust me that I saw him a few months ago and still flirts with nice white boys and gives one audience a particularly good dancer. Almost 68 and still strong I recommend this movie and any concerts or TV shows will be found. Little Richard is always there
