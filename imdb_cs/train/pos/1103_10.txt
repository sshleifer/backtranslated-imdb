This movie has some of the best comedic dialogues and unforgettable quotes that have ever gathered in one movie! The story is somewhat missing, but wonderful pieces are enough to break the difference. It is a timeless film of all ages that will surely please. As a cinematographic art form it is very entertaining; and with major stars like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... how could you go wrong? Comedy dialogue and timing like this has long been underestimated and is very difficult to imitate. A good example of this can be seen in the jump of this 1986 film: Money Pit with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film dragged and received bad reviews and comments from viewers. Achieving real comic dialogue is art.
