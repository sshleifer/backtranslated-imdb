Shakespeare said we were actors who got to a great scene. But when this stage is in Israel, the work we interpret multiplies ten, and all the actions we do are full of hard style. Dan Katzir can make a spectacular portrait of part of life in Tel Aviv, but in addition Katzir is able to penetrate the heart of the Israeli people, and these people are far from being prominent characters, talking to us from the heart. Katzir's film allows Israel to escape from the dark information point in which they live, and this beautiful country emerges with light as a beautiful bird born from its ashes. It is very good for me, because the reality of the state of Israel, which Europeans know only for informational diaries or newspapers, appears to be a close and absolute human reality, the reality of millions of people seeking their place, they are exploring the whole state, the whole culture with the sole aim of feeling its component. Katzir creates a totally awesome documentary and proves that when one is shooting a passion, the deepest feelings are manifested by strength, and these feelings cross our hearts. Thank you for opening your eyes and giving us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most amazing countries in the world.
