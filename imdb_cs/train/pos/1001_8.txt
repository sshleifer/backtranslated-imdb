It's a bit of a humorous and thrilling action thriller that has Jamie Foxx as an unfortunate and fast-witted speaker who has chosen the too-demanding American Treasury Agent (David Morse) to be released in the streets of New York City to find a compelling computer hacker (Doug Hutchinson ) who stole forty-two million dollars from the box office and let the two guards shot. <br /> <br /> "The bait" is the second sophomore feature for Antoine Fuqua ("Replace Killers") and he can handle this task fairly well, although it is not the first movie. Both films have common action sequences that are flat excellent. <br /> <br /> Foxx is quite good here, although his character is uncomfortable at first but all over the movie I started catching on. Hutchinson is amazing as a master who can be ruthless like John Malkovich and patient as late Laurence Olivier was in the "Marathon Man". Morse is fine as an agent who comes with a savvy plan to get at any price who did it.
