This is undoubtedly the worst game I've ever played. It's not an average shot - it all - it moves like fps (for which I do not care much) but acceptable gfx, interesting weapons and magic, great surround sound effects ("Scryeeee, scryeeee .." , which allows you to see or hear the events that happened in the past in one of the game's locations - the only game I had to play on a regular basis just for the intensity of the atmosphere. I am involved in such a horror story, which attracts me to more games that emphasize the atmosphere and more entanglement of the story. 9/10 (-1, because I'm not a fan of fps and maybe the game was a bit short?)
