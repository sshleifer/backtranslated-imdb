It should be seen for independent film fans, but also keeps well against mainstream movies. I think we have another Woody Allen or Trentin Tarrentino. <br /> <br /> The budget is painfully low. No special effects at all and seemingly used ambient lighting (shot in digital video.) - And still this movie keeps you and never keeps you. The script is somewhat bizarre, but the actors and the director pull it out with full realism. He has humor, has an intrigue and has a pathos and it all works. <br /> <br /> There is no point in describing details. To see a separate work, a virtual lesson on how to make a cheaper budget actually works, look at it. <br /> <br /> -Oh yeah, it's also really fun. <br /> <br />
