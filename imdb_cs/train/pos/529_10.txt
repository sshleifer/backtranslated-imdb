It is one of Hollywood's most overlooked gems ever produced. - A young British WWII ace fighter, whose plane is going to crash, has radio contact with a young American woman who soothes a brave pilot and knows he'll be dead in a few minutes. For some reason, the man, who must be dead, will slip out of the debris and eventually find out he intends to report to heaven. When a deputy is asked to ask the pilot to escort him to heaven, the man refuses and asks for his "day in court" to argue his case. A man claims that his situation has changed over the last moments of his earthly life, that he has fallen in love, and therefore has become another person who has earned a chance to live. <br /> <br /> "The Heavenly Court" is a movie delight! "Peer Jury Announcement" is a pinnacle. The story, as fantastic as it may seem, is breathtaking and will keep you charmed for almost 2 hours of play. The final scene is simply beautiful and for most audiences it will require "Kleenex treatment". This movie is in my personal favorite top 10, it has the highest recommendation!
