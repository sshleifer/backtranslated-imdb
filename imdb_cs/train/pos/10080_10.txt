In China's rapid economic development in 1990, China's traditional culture is reviving, partly due to a rise in nationalism accompanied by rising wealth, and more importantly, due to the sense of spiritual affiliation after the collapse of old socialist ideology in the period after the Cultural Revolution. The renewal of traditional Chinese culture, but Confucianism, has not been without disasters, since the Chinese have accepted the whole tradition without removing the wrong part, and the discrimination of the girl she has demonstrated in this film is an excellent example. In addition, not only the part that should be destroyed, the good part to be inherited, such as the traditional opera and its technique, such as facial change, was ignored during reconstruction and faced extinction. The director used this film to criticize the problem of taking over the tradition of contemporary China. d is deeper meaning behind the film.
