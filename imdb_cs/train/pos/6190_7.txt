Fay Grim is a sequel to the story that began ten years earlier with Hartley's Henry Foole. I did not see the previous movie and I do not know if it's a good thing or not. I can consider the current film as my own merits. For most people, Hal Hartley's style is something you either like or not. His combination of events, drama, absurdity and dry ironic humor really resonates with me, and Fay Grim is no exception. She has an air of sharply written intelligent parody that has laughed aloud with me and many of Melbourne International Film Festival's audience. For the first half of the movie it was relentless and delivered with straightforwardness. It's a style of humor unfortunately missing in cinemas, and a welcome relief from the hopeless adolescent comedian that Hollywood exhausts like pancakes. During the second half of the film, humor begins to sink as a morphic film into an international spy / conspiracy thriller. Whether it was Hartley's intention, or if he managed to get ideas, it's not clear, but I think a little editing or rewriting that would reduce the film's fifteen minutes would preserve the original momentum of the film. <br /> <br /> Performance was generally good, especially Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum, who had the most time on the screen. Saffron Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina LÃ¶wensohn played a good supporting role. Visual films were nice (in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and the music (also from Hartley) was good without being disturbing. The film is well written and I enjoyed it immensely. If you like Hartley's earlier work, you probably like it.
