This film from Sam Fuller's 1953 film contains some of his best works and is sad that he could not continue to gain support from major Hollywood studios to do their things. The story line is something like that. The hard hard crazy (read prostitute) is on a subway a hot summer day, and gets her handkerchie picked by Skip McCoy. What Skip (and lady) does not realize is also carrying a microfilm to be passed on to communist spies. This introductory shot without dialogue and mostly in close proximity is beaut, one of many that Fuller uses throughout the film. Playing a baby called Candy is Jean Peters, which has never been better or better. One forgets how beautiful she is, and she does this very well. Pickpocket plays Richard Widmark, who has become his mark and set his style with the Kiss of Death in 1947 as a crazy waste with horrible laughter, and though it is a bit "softer" he is still scary. These hard features have soft patches here and there, but their noir and unhappiness all the way. Outstanding performances include the wonderful Thelma Ritters, who plays Moe stool, which saves her dough to pay for her own funeral. Ritter has been nominated for an Oscar for her performance, but she has lost Donna Reed's boring but popular performance as B Girl (read prostitute) in "From Here To Eternity". Hollywood loves it when a good girl gets bad and loves it on an Oscar, though their performance is usually terrible. Take a look at Shirley Jones, for example, in Elmer Gantry, docked and dug in New York, with a sharp black and white shot by Big Joe MacDonald and a very good artistic direction. Subway and Widmara Chateau by the River. The culmination of the Cold War and Red Fear is a villian piece of an ordinary-looking comic played by Richard Kiley, who is far more dangerous than a handkerchief who is a criminal, but it's just trying to make a living, and above all a loyal American.
