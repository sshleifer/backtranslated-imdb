I was able to watch this film in full and was deeply moved by it. I was not sure if it was really a comedy or drama - they had elements of both. Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper looked great - our image of 60-year-old women has certainly changed from Aunt Bee! They are alive, beautiful, sexy! The only downside to this film was that there was no mention of other characters in the "MTM" or "Rhodeus" shows of the 1970s. I would have thought that her sister Brenda or Julie Kavner would at least be clearly mentioned since she was placed in New York (where "Rhoda" was set up), of course, in a big apple. I hope that ABC will make this series and return to the guests all the old cast of these performances. By the way, what was wrong with CBS that makes this gathering or eventual series? Was not it the network that carried "MTM" and "Rhoda"?
