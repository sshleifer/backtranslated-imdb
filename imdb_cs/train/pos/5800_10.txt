THIS IS ON MY OPTIONS MY FAVORITE FILMS ON THE WORLD !!!!! I enjoyed it when I was 4 years old and I still like it at 16! It's an absolute masterpiece! No collection of videos is complete without it !!! I like every second and not only that the film has some great special influences, but it sends a great message to young audiences that might sound crazy, but in reality, the movie is actually very cold! Although Michael Jackson is now in the movies, people still do not see him as an actor. In fact, he is the most talented actor I know! He is so talented! It's incredible !!! MOONWALKER IS TO VISIT !!!!!!
