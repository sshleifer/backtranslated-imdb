But the main reason I made this film is that it was Trey Parker and Matt Stone from the South Park glory. However, as soon as the film started, I began to laugh at my belly. From delicate gestures towards a joke, to an obvious humor room all the time, along with constant reliance on some very humorous cues. This movie could ruin an event that is the strongest male poker face, let alone its poker lingerie. Some of the funniest winks and you will miss the jokes ever portrayed in Hollywood, along with constant criticism, to throw themselves into bargaining. I'm just going to show that not only Trey Parker's literate adept is not too old on the old play. I was surprised at the amount I absorbed in this film. However, I am very concerned that it is not available on the Internet, here in the UK. Tell the boys! I am and will continue to show all my friends unpleasantly pointing to funny bits and occasionally sneaking into my lager. Overall excellent movie if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy. However, if you do not have a sense of humor about stupid or rough things, it's clear! But I'm sure the inclusion of Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Bleeth could bind you around those prejudices.
