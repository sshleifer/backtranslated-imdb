I have seen this film more than once and always complain about the "obvious construction" of the plot. But then it's part of Petzold's play: it's playing with the rules of the genre. It's very nice to meet a very unlikely story about how the two girls (Timoteo / Hummer) meet. it is mirrored in another, yet unlikely story that girls will make up casting. This film is the way between reality and fiction, it's more about the potential, the things that could or could be done in the past in the past than about the real events. It's a thing, like a lot of motifs, Freud might be interesting for his dream analysis, just like all the "doppelgangers" constellations. <br /> <br /> I also think that "Gespenster" can be interesting compared to contemporary Asian cinema strange: Petzold's everyday urban architecture also feels terribly haunted, strangely known. This movie is not obvious. Describing it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers or as the story of an orphaned mother who is looking for Europe for her lost daughter clearly does not say very much about the nature of the "Gespenster" at all.
