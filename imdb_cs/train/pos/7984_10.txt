Man in the Fire is definitely one of the best dramatic / criminal thrillers I've ever seen. Despite the slow start, the story is so awesome and sensitive that it keeps well. This is the perfect role of Denzel Washington playing a bodyguard, called Creasy, who is tortured by his past and is an alcoholic, but he never gives up his duties to save his latest protest, Pitu. Dakota Fanning plays Pitu, a very clever, enthusiastic little girl who loves so many things and works very convincingly, has a great future ahead. As I said the story is a bit complicated to fully understand it, you have to watch it a couple of times. The film comes from two parts, there is the first hour when everybody is happy, nothing is alright, they all live happily until the abduction of Pity and where Creasy is almost killed. And then there is the other part, the rest of the movie, where suddenly everything becomes complicated and a little scary and disturbing when Creasy recovered from serious injury and began to chase and kill the numerous criminals and "La Hermamdad" who were responsible for the planning and execution of kidnapping Pity. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington shows us his latest acting skills along with many other talented actors who have a great future ahead of them. It's a real shame that this movie was not quite recognized, Washington really deserved another Oscar for his performance, just like Fanning and the director. And even possible visual effects that were of high quality. If you like excellent, slightly shaken, thrilling thrillers, this is the one you see. The most amazing thing is that the elements of this movie are really based on real story and real characters! 10/10
