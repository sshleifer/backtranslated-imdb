When Philo Vance (Edmund Lowe) stands on the edge of the balcony high above the city, seemingly hypnotized and is about to die, he immediately reminded me of the same scene in another film, nine years later, "The Woman in the Green" Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) is similarly going to jump into the universe while being hypnotized. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, both Philo Vance and Sherlock Holmes will survive these attempted murders by unscrupulous criminals. Exciting film tensions in both of these scenes. When do you learn, can not you cloud the brains of big fictional detectives?
