Steve Carrel turns out to be a great lead man in this amazing, original, breathless breath of fresh air. I'm wet about how brilliant it was. Basically, the name of the film says everything: Andy Stitzer is a 40 year old man working in an electronics store. He is a bit stupid who loves video games and comics, and has the largest collection. His peers working in a shop with him find out that she is a lady during a sex dialogue game full of poker, and then Andy has to go somewhat funny like the hell of Odyessy's gross sexual awakening but always rises, which leads him to lose his virginity, but he eventually gets lucky at the very end. <br /> <br /> Let the little ones home, but take the whole family to see this amazing romantic adult comedy. You will be addicted and cracked from the beginning, and when it's over, you'll want to wear your extra thick absorbent underwear. I just can say that it's bad Steve Carrel was not recognized as outgoing 20 years ago. She will definitely win the best MTV Movie Awards in the coming years. You can bet on your hard-earned dollar, people! <br /> <br /> I give this perfect 10!
