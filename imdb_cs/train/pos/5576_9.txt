This movie is funny! I followed this with my friend and we had to see him again. This movie is not for you movie fans who will only watch films that are nominated for academic prizes (you know who you are.) I will not recap it because you have seen it from all the other reviews. <br /> <br /> "Whipped" is a cheerful comedy that laughed at me. She does not take too seriously and should be watched with her friends, not your girlfriend. He will not win any prizes, but he just has to be watched to be awarded. True, some of the jokes are toilet humor, but it's not necessarily the wrong thing. Everyone can sometimes use some of them. Some people need to lighten and see what it is, what it is, not what it is not. <br /> <br /> **** 1/4 of *****.
