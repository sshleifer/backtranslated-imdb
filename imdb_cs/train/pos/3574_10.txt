Sometimes it's hard to say why the film is so effective. From the moment I first came across "The Stone Boy," something told me it would be a great movie. Despite that, it seemed very unlikely that I would ever have the opportunity to actually see it for myself. One day, when I looked through an online catalog of my local libraries, I saw that they recently bought a DVD release of this movie. Which I am extremely fond of because the cinematography has a tremendous depth and quality that an old VHS copy could never be repeated. And I'm talking about cinematography, I have to express it further and beyond, the most stunning aspect of this film. As a photographer who follows the almost exact visual style portrayed in The Stone Boy, I firmly believe that a great cameraman can almost helplessly wear a movie. Here he has a lot to help from an extremely talented cast and a director who perfectly understands what the story needs. But to have Juan Ruiz Anchia behind the camera, he makes virtually every scene something beautiful. And you'll never say that. Most movies would never have expected such a thing from you. Scene after scene captures some details, a little spell of visual magic that exhale you. Director Christopher Cain has a long and interesting career. If I can gather, this film is not very representative. But sometimes catching the director near the beginnings of his career, before all the big budgets and loss of focus, there is a real subtle spell. Cain returns in this movie, lets things happen with his own life and then on. Like early movies John Sayles, characters have space to breathe, time to talk. Side stories are happening because they do it, and so is life. Cain displays a remarkable, raw, or even complete painful understanding of human nature in this film. Actor binds a lot of this story together. When people talk when they exist in this movie, they do like real people who are not held back by playing characters. Scenario Gina Berriault allows incredibly talented and respected actors such as Wilford Brimley, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Frederic Forrest to spend time just out there. Whether what they have to say is tiny or deep, it all comes with the weight of pure reality. When you look at the actors or the great soundtrack by James Horner, it seems strange that such a movie will almost be forgotten. Perhaps what the "Stone Boy" does, what it was was the period in which it was made. There is a 1970s hangover in this film, which reminds me deeply of my own childhood. People talk about the 80's when it comes to modern styles and music, but that's not the 80's that I lived or remembered. The appearance of images, undervalued and dark knowledge of the quality of acting and the overall result should come under the skin of every person who grew up in or in this era of time in North America. I see myself in that. I see how I saw the world. And a movie like "The Stone Boy" sees the world about how it really is. </ p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < ), Matewan (1987), High Tide (1987), The Secret of Roan Inish (1994), Wendy and Lucy (2008)
