The contending actor finds out that the best way to get to Hollywood is to start the competition. But what makes Break and Leg a real jewel is a sardonic look at the existence of a (and not so) LA actor. He brings us into this world with a slight irony and joke. She also has a glossy look and a very good direction under Monica Mitchell. Break a Leg is one of those rare independent movies that do not threaten its production value at any level. Writing is tight, dialogue is the first. Cassini is an actor and the role really shows his talent. The climatic scene between him and Rene Garcia is an instant classic and can go down as one of Hollywood's most fun scenes of all time. I saw it on an advanced screen, and everyone in the audience laughed uncontrollably, and then snapped at him.
