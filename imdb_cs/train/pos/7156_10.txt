Holes are a wonderful movie. I love it a lot and it's one of my favorite movies. It's one of the few movies produced by Disney, which is not cheese. Holes are generally a very cool film. I wish Disney created more pictures. Holes are a really rare breed of Disney flickering shows that it's cool. Do not get a bad idea, I do not mean Disney's bad mouth, but most of them are child-focused and that's OK. Children also deserve fun. But Disney is trying to reach a teenage audience and usually fails. But not with holes. It's a type of movie that anyone can watch and enjoy without thinking it's blood. It's really a kind of movie that can be enjoyed with a lot of young hoodies, because there are signs that can be related. Holes do a good job, they are a combination of good family fun, but it's not too much cheese and lives a little on the edge. I hope Disney takes more risks and makes other nervous moves like this.
