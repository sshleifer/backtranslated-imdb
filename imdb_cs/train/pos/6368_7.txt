While there are no talking animals, a large number of song productions or villians with half white / half black hair ... it has one thing ... realistic people who normally deal in special circumstances and Walt & Roy with their era in the studio. If you thought that the "Rabbits" or "Island on the Top of the World" were not identical, or you were holding higher authority than Atlantis, then your idealism is just as bad as keeping your children up until midnight watching the cartoon.
