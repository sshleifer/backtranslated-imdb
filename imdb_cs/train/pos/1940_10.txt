I was really impressed with this movie. The writing was fantastic and the characters were all rich and simple. It is very easy to join them emotionally. The creators of this film really hit the nail right on the head when it comes to creating real life characters, and getting the viewer absorbing directly into their world. Music is amazing. They were employed by some independent person who would score and some of the soundtracks and do a fantastic job they add to the film. If you have the chance to capture this movie in a small theater or film festival (just like me), I strongly recommend that you see it. Also on a personal note, Paget Brewster is beautiful in this movie. That's enough reason to check it out.
