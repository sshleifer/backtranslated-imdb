Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, who was Laura in 1944, reunited with this great 1950 foot film. The troubled policeman, Andrews as Mark, can not overcome the fact that his father was a hoodlum who died in a shootout in a police camp when trying to jailbreak. (Craig Stevens) In an attempt to build gangster Gary Merrill Mark unintentionally puts the heat on an innocent cabin, Tom Tully, who is the father of Gene Tierney, which was separated by Stevens. This is a well thought-out film dealing with the conscience of a decent human being. The end is not entirely optimistic because Mark will have to face the music, at least finally admitting what he has done.
