This indie film looks at the lives of a group of people sinking in Connecticut studios. The story is quite thin. What drives the film are characters that greatly play mostly unknown actors. Outputs in the cast are Brewster as a high school teacher who encounters marital problems, and Weixler as a casino dealer who shines as a stripper every month. Two actresses provide natural performances and work together well. This is an impressive feature debut for writers Schechter and director Setton. The other keeps talking in a quick clip. The film title and poster suggest that it's something brown, but it's an amazing little comedy-drama.
