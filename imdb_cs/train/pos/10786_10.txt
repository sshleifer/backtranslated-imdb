me and my sister used to rent this every time we got movies and our parents would be so angry (they left it) and I love it ... I have not found someone living with me who knows what I'm talking about ... I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who loved this movie ... I wish I could find it on DVD somewhere !! I'd love to watch it just bc I loved it just like a little kid ... and now I'm 15! I remember so much about it ... where I got a little bunny fuf and all my friends know a song, but not a movie! I think a little girl got there by sliding down the slide on her small playground
