I came to Nancy Drew and I was expecting the worst ... due to all the other bad reviews. I thought that even though I can not read books, it does not look like Nancy Drew I heard about. But I was wrong. Sure, it was not a book that should contain carbon, but when you make a movie out of something, you have to make it to become a big screen entertainment. The plot was fun and exciting with a lot of real fears and I thought Emma Roberts was truly believable in her own way of portraying this classical character. There were some fun moments and many statements, and Nancy does not look like a ditz at all. She was intelligent, conservative, polite, and true. One thing that made this film well was the balance of the whole thing with a mix of comedy, romance, tension and sincere moments. I loved this movie. What movie, what flick! And if you are wise and you decide to trust me and you will see it, be prepared for some SCARY like a while, because I was as if it was gone! Go on or let yourself be lucky and just let others decide what you think about this movie for you ... the mistake I've almost done. I love it, I want to own this movie! I love Emmy Roberts even now. It's like mini-Bree Van De Kamp from DH. Love it, love it.
