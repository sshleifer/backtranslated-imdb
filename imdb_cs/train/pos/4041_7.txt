Tenshu is imprisoned and sentenced to death. When the electric shock survives, government officials give him the choice of either a higher electrode or agree with some experiments. He chooses an experiment and is placed in a large metal cell with a bad guy who also survived the electric current. They can have any need in the room (in the sense), but they can not leave. after a few days the meals are reduced to a day and the room temperature is set to 100. After several alarms, they sound at intervals so they can not sleep. One day he will come to the cup of a "witch" (even if it is a glazed part). What happens next, I'll let you know. I could be in a minority but I liked building it was interesting for me. Now, if the payout was half as good as I had, I would have liked it a lot. <br /> <br /> My class: C + <br /> <br /> Media Blaster's 2 DVD Extras: Disc 1) Director's Editor; Trailers for "Versus", "Aragami", "Attack at the petrol station" and "Deadly Outlaw Rekka" Disk 2) Theater cut; Commentary with Hideo Sakaki, Ryuhei Kitamura, Sakaguchi Takuand Tsutomu Takahashi; Interview about the performance and the crew; Creation; Original trailer; and Promo Teasers
