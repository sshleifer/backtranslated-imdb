This film brings a lot of memories to the classic old cinema, where the actors did not have to take their clothes to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think the main plus point of this film is the amazing chemistry between Shahid and Amrita, it's definitely a movie production. I have seen a lot of comments about the film being sickly sweet and too nasty. In response, I think to some extent that this is the right analysis, but given that it is the film Barjatya, I think it is significantly weakened compared to MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH. HSSH was almost unbearable in some places. <br /> <br /> But in this movie, sentimental moments appear smiling and wishes the beginning couple to feel the best and hopes that nothing will happen to them. <br /> <br /> Another major plus point is the performance of Shahid and Amrita. Both played very well, especially Shahid, who looks great in the movie. Amrita looks simply stunning and should be taken seriously as a future big star. Although I really liked the movie, I feel it was too long. Some of the center could be cut off and it might have even more impact. I also think that music, even if it fits into the movie when you see the situation, is a bit old-fashioned and the movie could benefit if there was more up-to-date soundtrack. Though it's a nice song writing by Mujhe Haq Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein. <br /> <br /> Overall, I strongly recommend this movie, its romantic, looks stunning and has a dramatic peak (I will not go into the details unless you've seen it.) <br /> <br /> If you are prone to pay - take the tissue! (I needed a few)
