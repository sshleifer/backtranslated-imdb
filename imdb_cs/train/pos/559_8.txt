Good Time Film - Intense, vast, somewhat dark story that reminds John Ford of the "seeker", though not so brutal. The story starts fast and does not stay, with several scenes of a really good dialogue between (Stewart) Jeff Webster, Ronda and Sheriff Gannon. This film, in some respects, reminds "Bend of the River" (1952), also the work of Mann-Stewart but I found it to be much less sentimental and more interesting. There are several warnings: Too quickly wrapped (and rather sentimental) ends; 24-year-old Corrine Calvert is not as convincing as a naive French teenager and, of course, the film takes place in a mythical West, a land of fable where no real laws of nations and physics apply. But these are trivial worries. James Stewart is surprisingly good as a dark, disconnected man who thinks no one else but himself cares, and the mountain scenery can not be defeated. Great western costume drama.
