the one and only season she just broadcast here in Australia and I thought she was absolutely brilliant! I love it! all the stories are so good! and his much more realistic view of youthful and family life today. yet she still had strong family values ​​to keep together and to be there. their problems were real and really brought you to the show. The show is basically about this family called 'Days' and their lives. the family consisted of Abby Day, Jack Day, Natalie Day, Cooper Day, and Nathan Day, the son of a genius son. every episode day of your life, with a cooperative view of things in its entire neighborhood. I loved Cooper's insight across the show was just great. was by far my favorite figure. it ended so many things that could go on, I'm really sad that the next season was not done. it was a great show I miss.
