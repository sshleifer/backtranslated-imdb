I watched this movie once and I could look at it again, but while Jamie Foxx is good in the movie, I think they could use "less fun" characters like Alvin Sanders. Foxx's scenes, for example in jail when confronted with Edgar Clenteen (David Morse), are too fun. David Morse is once again a great cop portrait. Its heavy but predominantly silent features are ideal for its role. Morse meets Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) again in the theater. Morse ends with Hutchinson. Both are perfect for this scenario in each movie. I personally love this quality in a movie where the actors get into the same situation as the previous movie, as they did in The Green Mile. Overall it was a pretty good movie.
