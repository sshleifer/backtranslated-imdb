PROMOTING SPOIRA - In a sense, "as Alienate Friends ...." is "the loser will learn to adapt, become successful and finds out that something else depends on the type of story that is in celebrity business." - SPOILER END I do not know the original book , but this comedy brings a few good moments, although I think the end is wrong, it felt too fast and too sudden as if something was missing, and I would say that the film is not capable of maintaining a high level. actors and actresses with somewhat controversial actor's features, I have never seen Pegua yet, it's still a very unique type, though sometimes it may seem a little dull on the screen than it is necessary, and Fox proved to be able to play a hot star with his head in I do not know if it was a tough thing, but her performance was hot and better than during the "Transformers" (well ... probably it's there's no hard match.) Kirsten Dunst is very Kirsten Dunst (again) and you may like it (like me) or it's unpleasant. On the other hand, you'll see Anderson, who has done his acting skills and Jeff Bridges (which is fine, but maybe he might be a bit stronger). They all fit in. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think it's a nice comedy with some more and few less fun passages, sweet stuff, but too sudden.
