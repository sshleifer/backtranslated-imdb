Holes (2003, Dir Andrew Davis) When Stanley Yelnats IV is unlawfully convicted of theft, he is sent to Camp Green Lake. In this camp the leader and her two henchman, Sir Sir and Dr. Pendanski, allow friends to dig holes through a hole through the hole. But for what reason? Stanley plans to find out. I never meant to watch the holes and I have to admit that I really watched the movie because I'm such a fan of Shia LaBeouf, but even if you're not a fan then it does not matter. "Holes" is one of those Disney movies that everyone can enjoy. The story is beautifully written and contains a great idea that memories will appear in the past. This is not disturbing and really gives a great story. The whole cast is great. Young stars work well and adding Jon Voight and Sigourney Weaver are joy. Shia LaBeouf shows that even at the age of 17 he can act without defects. This is Disney movie, you would definitely enjoy it as a family. "" I'm learning from failure. "- Stanley Yelnats III (Henry Winkler)
