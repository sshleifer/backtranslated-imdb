Lonely French boy Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim) on summer vacation meets Cedric (gorgeous Stephane Rideau). Silent and slow film is very frustrating. On the one hand, I absorbed her and really felt for the two boys. On the other hand, I was angry - the film still flashes from past to present without a cold or reason. It is very confused and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> what ends in the hospital. What it is - we never said! Then he will say goodbye to Cedric and tell everyone else that he lives with him. Why? This is not what we are told. Then it finally does not explain at the end. Why? No explanation. It is clear that Cedric loves Mathieu and Mathieu living in the same city, so ... It's a tribute to the movie that you really cared for the characters so much. If it was just explained! <br /> <br /> Elkaim as Mathieu is not good. He is tall, handsome and has a nice body - but he can not act. His thought of acting sits with a blank look on his face - all the time. Rideau, on the other hand, is great. He is very handsome, has a very nice body and he's a hell of an actor. He also has incredible sexual magnetism about him. There is full front masculine nudity, lots of kissing, and a fairly explicit sexual scene in a movie that's great - most of the films avoids showing male male love scenes. This does not mean and helps to see the characters look after themselves. <br /> <br /> So, a frustrating movie that's a bit of a sight to see - especially for Rideau's naked scenes - that's what you like nice naked young men! <br /> <br />
