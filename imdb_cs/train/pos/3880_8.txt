Well, for starters, it was actually the BEST CLASSIFIED FILM at that date. The man always has a sense of character with a touch of humor to them, but I think he adds in this film a dimension that is incomparable with what he did earlier. His work was - in very black and white - accepted by a broad but not so critical audience, and we have always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a clear way of letting the audience know what they need. <br /> <br /> In Villa Paranoia, however, it is the first time to surprise you with invisible wisdom and respect for minorities. Jutland - in the 'country' - deals with the eternal question of lack of love, but in a close and sometimes brutal way that keeps you and looking for you focused. he himself can play ab ****** d! The truth b ***** d, who wants the right thing, but he has no idea how to get there, so people suffer painfully. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've seen this year and I'm very much looking forward to the next one.
