It's an amazing new crime series, which brings together three old British TV actors (Denis Waterman, James Bolam and Alun Armstrong) as retired detectives who have returned to old cases under the younger careers of Amanda Redman. Three strange, irritated old cops create a great team that uses twenty-year-old detection methods in the police network, since then a long way - sometimes with the effect, sometimes to the horror of its senior officers. Three are portrayed sympathetically, warts and all. There are wonderful comic scenes and some very moving, because each of the three has to cope with the growing old and the legacy of their past. At the end of the first six-part series (next year's promise of the next series), each character evolved. James Bolam's widow can not cope with the premature death of his wife. Lothario Denis Waterman learns to take on his role as a grandfather. And even the obsessive Alun Armstrong helps his new friends fight the demons of their past - and continue taking the medication! While Amanda Redman has to face a known conflict between life and career. The stories were interesting, somewhat heavily dependent on the miracles of DNA testing. But it's a mix of the four best British actors who have made the series unbeatable.
