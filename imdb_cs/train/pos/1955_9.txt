Just the movie I love. Some very good British actors as well as one and only Sharon Stone. Catherine Tramell (Stone) masterfully manipulates a well-educated group of human lives, plays on her own weaknesses and gathers experience with writing a secret book on murders. She plays quite well on a female psychopath, and at the same time uses her great sexual appeal to convincingly portray what can be considered one of the best black widows. Tramell is used for dark places in the company and freely participates in sadomasochistic trips in the "Never Visited the Dark" side of the city. From the very beginning, there is nothing other than a R rating from the dialogue itself. The stone could also be described as a kind of female Hannibal Lecter, a helpless woman deadly without a meal plan.
