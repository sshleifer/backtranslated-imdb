The thief at night must be the best of all time in thrillers. I have no idea what people are complaining about what people were shouting when they say that these movies are afraid of accepting God. They just needed to find an excuse and blamed the Thief at night. Do not listen! These films not just about one of the many possibilities of tribulation but are also fun to watch in their simplicity. In fact, they have a low budget and that's a bit obvious, but not quite obvious at first glance. I did not know because I really assumed that many films, such as those shot in the 1970s, had low budgets at all times. The Thief tells the story of a young and cynical Patty Myers who lives for her journey until her husband and almost all her friends disappear in a prophetic exaltation, all of whom have warned her. First, the film does not appear around her until a resurrection happens. What leads to it shows that everyone else around is becoming Christians and believes in Christ, which is usually the case with many people. Everyone around you who once knew and loved would be gone forever, and the one who is left is the one who accuses everyone except himself. No one can blame because they are always fine. Just like those who complain about the movie. These people must be adult adults. I have thirteen and you can not see me when she whimpering me, especially when I was just like Patty before I again accepted Christ into my heart. For those who have not seen it, if you want a little bit of everything that was tossed into the Christian film instead of stereotypical, everyone else is bad movies before enjoying thieves at night. Do not do this before you try it. Something new is always good. Trust your own instincts.
