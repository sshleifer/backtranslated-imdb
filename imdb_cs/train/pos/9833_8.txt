The terrorist tries to steal a secret biological weapon and is threatened when an escape attempt is inflicted when a case involving a deadly substance is threatened. Soldiers are able to order a case, but the terrorist goes to the hotel where they try to hide. Eventually they get to a place where they hide and "cleanse" the hotel and its inhabitants. Unfortunately, they have their cremation body and if you've seen the return of the dead, you know what's going to happen. <br /> <br /> Zombie 3 was widely populated by critics and zombie fans alike the complete disorder of the film. While this is a fair assessment, it is not without high points. One thing has a lot of bloody deaths to keep happy dogs. There are plenty of zombies that seem to go wherever possible. They are in the water, beams of houses, hidden in trees, and for some reason they want to hide under a bunch of dead brushes just to head off to attack when the heroes try to escape. There is also a flying zombie hiding inside the refrigerator. You have to see it to believe it because this scene itself makes Zombi 3 the required IMO viewing. It can be a terrible adaptation and some very dubious behavior, especially from a doctor who must be one of the worst actors I've seen, but Zombie 3 is still a very funny movie. Sometimes it's nice to sit down and watch a movie that does not require anything more than your time and open mind. Zombie 3 fits on that account and then on some. Even more pleasant is when you open a couple of beers and watch it with friends. I'm giving it 8/10, just for total joy.
