In this document we meet Roger, a wealthy factory manager in China where Mardi Gras in New Orleans are selling and trading beads and other small items. Roger says factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities they provide, but interviews with four of them tell a completely different story. The living lives of the girl are in clear contrast to the bizarre excesses of Mardi Grass himself. Filmmaker David Redmon should be praised for getting great and rare shots of everyday life inside the Chinese factory complex and for landing a revealing interview with a camera at the leading American company that imports and sells beads. The film is convincing and clearly serves its purpose as a window into what lies behind the ubiquitous "Made in China" brands.
