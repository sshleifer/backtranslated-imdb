As an art genius fan, Andy Goldsworthy, who already holds some books, I had some expectations of what I would see. What I got was something completely satisfying and a little more than I expected. Being an artist alone (working in clay), finding inspiration in our neighborhood to make good art is extremely important, and it's something Andy Goldsworthy has mastered. In the course of the year, the director captures spontaneous energy, skill and dedication to nature-loving artists with dramatically inspiring tastes. The music set for the movie is enveloping and intoxicating. If you are an artist who needs inspiration, or someone else who needs an uplifting experience, check out this movie. I'm glad Andy's out there. Creating, dancing, struggling with natural forces to make our world more beautiful.
