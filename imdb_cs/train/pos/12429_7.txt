David Duchovny plays the lead role in this film. Now a lot of people when they find that this fact would not even bother watching it.

His accident will become a private doctor for the millionaire of Raymond Blossom. However, the FBI is interested in using Eugene to hunt Blossom. Angelina Jolie is cast in the supporting role of clare-gangsters moll.She gives in solid performance. Timothy Hutton plays Blossom is excellent and immerses deep into his character. The Spiritual itself is not as bad as many people would think, and eventually I would appreciate its performance as credible. His monotone tone and straight face are known, but from films
