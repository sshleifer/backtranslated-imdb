I really liked this movie, which I saw several times as an original classic, but hardly remembered some details. I think this movie is much better than a cartoon that is not so black and white. I especially liked how he had done such an absolute character and gave the reason why he was as he was, the villain in this film was not a real Grinch, but a major that differed a lot from the original cartoon. Jim Carrey was perfect for this part of everything in a great movie that was created for both kids and adults.
