While I suppose this movie could get a rap like Anti-Vietnam, watching it I did not feel like this is because the film was just a sincere look into the perspective of young people who were trained to war that the public did not support ... fear, despair, drive ... everything, outdoors, naked. As a soldier, I had a lot of stuff in my experience in the army - especially in the Boot Camp. Overall, this film, though shot at a very small budget, looks great, is very well set up and offers excellent acting and direction. I highly recommend this movie to all who are looking for another great film by Colin Farrell. 10/10
