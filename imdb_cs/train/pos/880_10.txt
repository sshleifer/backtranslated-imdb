Probably the best movie of the year for me. This little French film focuses on Carl's office secretary (Emmanuelle Devos) who spends her days on the work of other men without notice and is the source of their disdain and the lunch interview that is too clear to her because she is partially deaf, she reads her lips . The change is started when we hire an assistant to the newly-relieved Paul (Vincent Caselle). The relationship between them is the center of the film. Interdependence, for very different reasons, combines them. Carla becomes attracted to Paul and the fact that he feels appealing for what seems to be the first time. Paul does nothing to dispel her feelings because she needs her help. He owes the money to the local gangsta and creates a plan to steal him, including Carlas's ability to read his lips. I think the main thing that moves the film above average tension / drama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars. Throughout the movie, no matter what other characters are on the screen, you can feel the amazing bond between Carla and Paul. I do not remember when I was between two actors witnessing such sexual chemistry. Emmanuel Devos gives great performance (she won the French Cesar for the best actress). You never feel like watching this game, this is Carla. Chameleon like Vincent Cassel is also wonderful. He made a somewhat unattractive character both attractive and attractive. I loved this film for these two people, and when I watched him perfectly, I wanted to go back to the cinema and get involved with them again and again.
