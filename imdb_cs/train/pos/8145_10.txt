For the first time, I saw this movie four years ago and I was expecting something fun, like the CB4. I was fired. I was on the floor laughing that the movie was so great. Path better than CB4, characters, songs, conspiracy, everything. The most significant independent film that Siskel and Egbert received "Two Thumbs UP" (and if two old white guys understand the humor in this movie, you know it's good).
