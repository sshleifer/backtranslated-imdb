He felt it was very balanced when he showed what Jehovah's Witnesses had done to protect American freedoms. It also showed the strong faith of two families who witnessed the first generation. I also appreciated how it turned out that by witnessing Jehovah, it affects family members who are not witnesses and how difficult it is to accept the fact that they do not celebrate the holidays is a sad part that families who are not witnesses have your family witnesses for family dinners / visits, or give them gifts at other times, but on holidays or birthdays. With regard to medical care, witnesses want and expect a high standard of medical care, what people forget is that blood transfusions allow careless medical care and surgery while bloodless treatment causes the medical team to be highly qualified and trained, which you would gave priority to treating your loved ones? I highly recommend this video!
