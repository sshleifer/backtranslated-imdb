It was released in France on DVD a few years ago - I wish it would be released again with English subtitles. Do not confuse it with a remake with Penelope Cruz who gets bad reviews. Gerard Phillippe is a peasant who believed he had married the King's daughter. He enters the army and goes to war. His love, however, is Gina Lollabrigida in an early film for her. I will not end up spoiling. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later at a young age, a great loss on moviedom.
