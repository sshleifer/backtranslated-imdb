this is the best example of what I think Jesus was really like. most films show that Jesus is effeminate, lobotomized or tortured. this Jesus laughed, played and was serious when it was necessary. this is the kind of Jesus that people can be attracted to, not the Hollywood version. The film gained some freedom and attempted to "fill the void". but the filler did not seem impossible or unlikely. One thing I could argue is that he never really explained what the Romans had against Jesus (the film said that the novels were the main driving force of Jesus' death, not that the Jewish authorities were against this idea). /> it seemed that the film was being studied well. One example was an unpleasant commentary to a teenage boy who was called a "stamp." it is believed that the mark (or john mark) was a boy would have in the garden of gethsemane, whose cloak was pulled up and ran naked (note 14:51). I feel like they tried to make the movie so accurate (even in spirit) what was possible.
