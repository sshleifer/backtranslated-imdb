This film is the second immersion of Damian Szifron in films after an excellent studio in "El Fondo del Mar". With "Tiempo De Valientes" he creates extremely good characters, far from prototypes and unprecedented chemistry among them. I saw the talent of Szifron to represent each figure in a carefree way, but only so much that we engage with her emotionally. His control over them is magnificent, so he returned to the film in a large direction and a gorgeously polished script, the characters laughing and crying with true sentiment and inviting the viewer to join them in their emotions and their development on the screen. > <br /> Spanish takes English, Buenos Aires cityscape replaces Hollywood night sets and the premise is as interesting as any other, so we have the courageous film to compete in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> But I want you to see the movie mainly because I never cared about such cute figures. The script seems to fit perfectly with the actors and vice versa. I really believe that a movie that resembles Argentina is really in competition.
