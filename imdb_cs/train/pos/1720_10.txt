This early Biograph short was so fun to watch. The second on the disk one D.W. The DVD series "Years of Discovery" by Griffith (recommended) includes three excellent performances by leading directors, and it is interesting to see Henry B. Walthall as a small candidate who gives the Earl's eye (and other things). <br /> <br /> The wife of the Countess takes my wife's betrayal and has its bricks in a small room. It's unbelievable that you hear the wall did not come out, but hey, maybe the wine has something to do with it. Here Mr Johnson (the father of the silent player Raymond Hackett) is wildly gesturing and it adds to the melodrama, but in an unexpectedly comical manner. The best moment comes at the end. As soon as the lady emerges from shock and fear as soon as she realizes that she is doomed, Henry will take her instrument and "fans" over her. The way he did it was so unexpected and strange, as if she was sexy, and I just lost him and laughed at my head. The expression on his face! Since then, Henry B. Walthall has fascinated me.
