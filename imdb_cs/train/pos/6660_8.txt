"Gandhi as a husband and father?" has always been discussed by people in India. "Gandhi ... my father" is a story he would know so little about. Surely insight into Gandhi's personal life. Overall, I liked the movie for storytelling and cinema. Jariwala, Akshay Khanna, and Shefali Shah all did a good job. Most scenes from the movie would be nice desktop wallpapers ... praiseworthy work. Traditional Indian folk music as a background score during certain parts of the film gives a good feeling. However, what I did not quite like was a narrative style. In several places, I've found that the tone is overly dramatized. Overall good work by Anil Kapoor Productions. I would recommend it as "must-follow-once". 8/10
