It's a great Swedish movie .. it was the first Swedish movie I've seen ... it's simple and deep .. what a great combination! <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist has done great performance as a famous conductor who is looking for peace in his hometown. <br /> <br /> Frida Hallgren was great as his inspiring girlfriend, helping him continue and never give up. A fight between a conductor and a priest who loses his battle with Michael when his wife confronts him and prevents Michael's noble thing from helping people in the hometown to find their own peace of mind in music. The only thing I did not like ... was not that good, but it has some deep meaning.
