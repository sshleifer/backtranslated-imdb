The stuff that comes is a historical film. Together with Metropolis (1927) he is one of the first great science fiction glasses. It's also one of the first films about litigation. It is remarkable how filmmakers predict the beginning of the Second World War within a year, and even in a gentle way the year that ends in the real world. But then the film deviates from reality, depicting the world destroyed by the war (only a substitute toxic gas for nuclear weapons, which of course did not exist in 1936). The last half hour of the film is an incredible view, making pioneering use of models and matte painting - later became the foundations of the science fiction genre. Sadly, sci-fi will become identified by cheaply created b-movies, a stereotype that would not be interrupted until 2001: Space Odyssey more than 30 years later. If they had the quality of the effects in this movie, it would be very different in Hollywood. Raymond Massey and some of his star stars play several roles in this film. Massey plays a great role as a Doctor of Modern Civilization (1970), who is trying to defeat the ordinary land ruled by a simple warrior (Ralph Richardson's very powerful performance). Eventually, the story covers 100 years. But that's a big problem with this movie - there really is not a coherent story. Perhaps in such an episodic film - somewhat reminiscent of intolerance, in fact - it is difficult to have a conventional fence, but I felt that more material could be made, and although the visuals in the last third of the picture are really amazing and worth the price ... the plot does not exist and the movie itself ends at the same time as it is interesting. Maybe the producers were thinking about further future sci-fi innovations: the sequel? The stuff that comes is a movie that every serious sci-fi fan should see at least once. Unlike Metropolis, however, it may not be repeatedly seen.
