It's a great thriller from Turkey that can make sense. The great work of the brothers Gokbakar. First I want to show on the screen. Overall, the screenplay in most of the films from Turkey is not enough, but GEN has the best pictures to say "perfect". And also the transition parts are really excellent. On the other hand, "Gen" has a great affair that affects everyone. Especially a woman who wants to be a psychiatrist in a sanatorium has a mother who is the usual madness. The main causes and psychological consequences are given in Genus. The only thing you have to do is combine all the advice. <br /> <br /> There is an impressive aggressive part of Doga Rutkay and Sahan Gokbakar played. This performance can be more realistic than "Irr√©versible (Monica Bellucci)". The last thing I want to say is "Watch this movie, you get confused"
