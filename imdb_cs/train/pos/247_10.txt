I love this movie because it has shown that they do not kill for fun but save those they love! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom did a great job in which Ned and Joe played. She has several inappropriate scenes, but she's fine. The language is very mild and sometimes does not even know it is there. This film shows that just because they are offenders does not mean they are evil killers! I hope people will be watching this movie and learning about important times in history like this one. There is one thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their armor from the book Ned looked! It's also how people remember them from their armor. I hope that people will watch this movie and start to be interested as I do.
