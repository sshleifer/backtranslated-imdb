Noni Hazlehurst's tour-of-power performance (which won the AFI Award) is at least the same as her effort in FRAN three years later. Colin Friels is also good, and for those who are interested, Alice Garner appears as a child of Noni and Michael Caton (best known for HRAD) is a bearded painter. (Also interesting is that Hazlehurst is currently hosting LIFESTYLE HOMES AND GARDENS, and Caton hosts property programs including HOT PROPERTY, HOT AUCTION, etc.). This film reaffirms the popular belief that Noni was probably Australia's top female actor during the early-to-mid-eighties. Rating: 79/100.
