this movie was somewhat terrible Vipul Shah's last film was good this was just bad though it's a good story and it's worked out great by Aatish Kapadia who adapted this movie from another gujarati game "Avjo Wahala Fari Malishu" did a good but slow piano 2 and a half hours to watch that there are a lot of mistakes in this movie but it's still fun songs are rather sorrowful and they do not work well but they're still good overall there is no movie that would be enthusiastic to watch it's still a story to engage account and it's good when you're a type of relationship with a pretty good movie with lots of flaws and humor that really does not need even one bit
