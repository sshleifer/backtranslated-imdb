This movie was very nice, although you like it only when: - you hate to go to the dentist, but you are not afraid of a movie where one of them goes beserk - you love horror films <br /> <br /> I especially liked the fact that some attention was paid to explaining the gross actions of the main character. The fact that she is totally obsessed with purity (especially in the mouth) and then captures her females that provide some oral pleasure to the muddy pool is a fairly credible reason to go overboard. . I give it 8.
