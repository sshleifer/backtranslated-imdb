I just chose a DVD release of this film on holiday in Norway where it was released with English subtitles. The film is beautifully photographed and strongly acting. The young man representing the "Frits" leading figure has a stunningly open face that reflects the painful precision of the tragic events that unfold around him. <br /> <br /> We soon see that the father Frits loves so much has mental health problems, and it is brought up when a brutal director denies attacking a guy and suggests that he was his own father. Climate scene where Frits refuses to show any respect for the director; simply stands his country and repeats "Liar" while brutally attacked by his classmates is a scene you will probably not forget. Films just a weak point are more of a clich√© "Flower Power" a teacher who uses every trick of a friendly teacher in the book. Besides, I'm sure it's a movie that will really like it.
