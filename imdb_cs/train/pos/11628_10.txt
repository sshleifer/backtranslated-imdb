"I did not want it to be complicated, Lees. I have to assume she'll read it." Fear is at a distance of 30,000 feet in this tense, action thriller. A one-day flight to Miami quickly becomes a battle to survive when Lisa (Rachel McAdams) realizes that her roommate (Cillian Murphy) plans to use her as part of a frigid murder plot. Once the minutes click, it's in the race with time to warn potential victims before it's too late. One of the many reasons why I love this movie is because of the chemistry between the two stars, McAdams and Murphy, who are also two of my favorite actors. For example, the early scenes at the airport play more like a romantic comedy: two people are still running into each other ... I have to do it for two because they made a movie like this one. Especially Murphy's character .. Jackson, who really seems to be so complicated by acting charming and innocent, still tries to do his job and make Lisa feel physically and mentally imprisoned. I think in certain parts it seems that she really cares about Lisa. <br /> <br /> Very excited ride all the way. I would hate many movies if I saw some prequel or sequel, but in fact I would not mind the ancestor that would happen if Jackson followed Lisa. The favorite scene is probably the main scene because it was so unexpected. It was also a nice stack on the famous scene. When will she do it? There was also a nice change in McAdam's Lisa, where she changed from being a victim to a fight. I also loved the scene where she sits in the dining yard and pretends to ask some ladies about a food court survey. How great was Murphy with all his pain .....
