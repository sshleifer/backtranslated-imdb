That was a wonderful introduction to Marion Davies' talent and beauty for me. She is not only gorgeous but cheerful in this film. (I believe that Lucille Ball could model her later career in the style of Davies, which could be called "zany beauty".) Vidor's direction is light but sure, the story is of course chestnut, but the acting is a stunningly contemporary, and star- for fans of the quiet era, with many cameras, adds to the overall entertainment. It combines elements of ghosts with adult dramas and good old timeless romance quite well. For all film fans who have a deep reaction to watching silent movies on your knees, you can sit down and change your attitude. <br /> <br />
