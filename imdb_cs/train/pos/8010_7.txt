Previously, I thought this movie is the weakest Muppet movies. I would now like to appeal this claim. In my opinion, the weakest MUppet movie is a TV movie WELCOME TO YOU VERY MERRY MUPPET Christmas, it's a wonderful life that's really terrible. MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN is nothing special, but much more fun than MERRY MUPPET Christmas. <br /> <br /> The best songe is that the song "You can not accept any answer," the singer Muppet Babies sings and the song for the big finals themselves. As I loved the Muppet Babies TV show, I loved the Muppet Babies succession here (they told me it was what inspired the Muppet Babies show) MANHATTAN MELODIES to show itself was a real showstopper, with Muppets from Sesame Street even looking at the wedding. As Kermit puts in his last line: "What better way for something to end?" I wish that what was between the beginning and the end was a bit more fun. There are cute portraits from Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines, and great dance sequences from Rizzo and Rats (choreography by later Jim Henson), and the movie definitely entertains. But I must say that MUPPET MOVIE, GREAT MUPPET CAPER and MUPPET Christmas CAROL are three definitive MUppet movies.
