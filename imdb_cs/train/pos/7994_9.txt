I really liked this movie. it's dark, it's not a bullet-dodging, car-chasing to dull your brain action movie. many characters and character motivations are somewhat unclear, so the audience has come to their own conclusions. it's nice to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to devise their own thoughts. In the end, the motivation is love or revenge or the desire for repentance - it does what he feels to be "right". "God will never forgive us for what we have done?" - this is not a question the dead men can answer - it does what they feel they have to do, what good they are, what they have been trained for. Denzel Washington is a great actor - I honestly can not think of one bad movie he has done - and he has great support. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
