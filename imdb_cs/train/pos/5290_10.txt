If anything goes far from the deliberately rough things he usually does, John Waters (happy birthday, John!) He made this parody a celebrity / art world. Edward Furlong plays the headline, a working class girl in Baltimore who loves shooting things. When Agent New York (Lili Taylor) discovers her work, she offers her the big break that she accepts. But as soon as it strikes the big one, it has to consider everything. Basically, Pecker watches how he loses his friends and normal life as he becomes a celebrity. Something we could expect, of course, but with the Waters control tool, there are always a few shocks waiting for you (you know them when you see them). I certainly recommend it. Also play Christina Ricci, Mink Stole and Patty Hearst.
