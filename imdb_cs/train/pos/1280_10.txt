I was fortunate enough to see it in the mood during the film festival, and was so silent that I saw that I was returning another night on the second of the three screenings. A funny, wild and sharp armed attack on every aspect of ordinary entertainment passively swallowed without tasting the target audience of the lowest common denominator led by a lone avenger journalist who slowly accepts members for their guerrilla war of predictability is what the film is all about and is made so unpredictable a refreshing way that you have stayed after the credits roll with hope renewed and the enthusiasm that the original movies can still be made. Anyone who would be frustrated with unfulfilled expectations to ignite their imagination would be good to chase (and I think to hunt) this barely seen subject. For fans of the Fight Club and any Charlie Kaufman movie and the required tours for anyone who avoids multiplexes such as a furious dog.
