"" The 40 year old virgin "" made me very laughing. I do not care if it's considered a very sexual comedy, I just enjoyed the many jokes and scenes that are present in this movie. Steve Carell is perfect as a virgin Andy Stitzer, and I think the scene where Andy's chest will remove the wax is one of the best, especially because it's real. Many of the actors and actresses present in this film are well known or already famous. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer has a quiet life. It's a little weird and it's collecting a lot of toys, but it seems harmless. One day, when playing poker with his friends, he finds out that Andy is actually ... a virgin! And she's 40 years old! After this surprising revelation, all his friends are trying to sleep with Andy ... The problem is the confusion Andy gets, especially when he really likes Trish, the woman he met when he bought a DVD player at the store he's working on.
