I am grateful to Cesar Montana and his crew for reviving the once-dying Visayan movie. "Panaghia" is hopefully the forerunner of a revival in this popular language (this is claimed by more speakers than Tagalog). The dialect and lifestyle details exactly resemble this area of ​​the Philippines. Slowdown: The terrifying and agonizing activity of the American antagonist. The second item I did not know was the lack of authenticity in the "period" costume of the same character and, above all, its bright red pram set that I supposed to have passed the road of the thirties. Without the little, but brilliant details, "Panaghoy" should have at least 9 out of 10 ratings - daghang salamat, Manoy Cesar! Supplement: This film will certainly defeat Peque Gallaga's "Oro, Plata, Mata", which gave a different view of Visayas during the Second World War. Alos, there are some parts where cinematography reflects back to Spielberg "The Color Purple" and the plot begins to resemble "Noli Me Tangere".
