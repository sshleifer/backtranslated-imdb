"If Ned Kelly was born later, he would probably win Victoria Cross at Gallipolli." such was Ned's brave. In Australia and especially in the state of Victoria, the name Ned Kelly can be said and immediately recognized. Gret is still a hero, life The blood of Jerilderie depends on the tourism he created, but in Mansfield they have not forgotten that the three policemen who "murdered" were from there. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Many of the buildings he has visited in his life are still standing. From the old Melbourne Gaol, where he was hung up, he got up at the post office in Jerilderie. The cell he once held in Greta is exposed in Benelle and at the site of Ann Jones's hotel, stations and even diaries where he was captured in Glenrowan can be visited. Evidence of all the events in the movie (except for his interest in love) can be found throughout Victoria, in police registers, and even in Sash, that Ned was awarded for rescuing Dick Shelton from drowning. None of this is bad and what is omitted would further justify the Neds action. The horse Ned "stole" was actually stolen by the wild Wright (the man Ned is going to get out of jail). Ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen, so he could not steal him. Jerilderie Letter is more than what has been said before. It's not a mere justification that it's Ned's biography, an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting. So go ahead and read it, check out the movie and then decide what happened to Ned.
