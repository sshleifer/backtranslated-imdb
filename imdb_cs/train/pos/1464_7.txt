Just like the psychological analysis of the films, Psycho sounds better than the headline. The man in charge of the movie (the narrator if you want) shows the movies here in his own way. Most of them are classic, but all of them are listed in IMDb and I would recommend you to see them (especially Hitchcock, Solyaris, Conversation & Lynch) because they will be referred to by Slavoj Žižek! <br /> <br /> In other words, it can spoil them for you. I do not remember if it spoils more than you have said (I think Chaplin movies), but as I wrote, it would be best if you were all watching them before! In the IMDb list, the movie is missing that I told them so it would get there soon enough. It's a Meg Ryan movie, but it's just a short snippet that's not as big as any trade. <br /> <br /> Zizek's opinions and opinions are crazy and fun to listen to if you're open to seeing things through another perspective (even if it destroys your favorite movie a bit for you ... that does not mean it does but it could it would be)!
