I was looking at this show when I was a little girl. When I think about it, I remember it only vaguely. If you ask me, it was a good show. The two things that I remember unclear are the introductory sequences and the thematic song. In addition, everyone was ideally occupied. Also writing was very strong. The performances were also top-notch. I hope a network will bring it, so I see every episode. Before I pack it, I'd like to say that I always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I do not think I've seen every episode. Now, finally, if some network is ever brought back, I hope you're going to get it one day before it gets better.
