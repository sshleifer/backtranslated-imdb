B movie? Yes. DIY? Yes. The first movie? Yes. But aesthetically A +. This movie was certainly bad sound / editing / lighting / acting / etc ... But this film has many positive things about it. At first, the most annoying figure first dies! Second, it's a parody / funny B Rated Horror movie. The comments our murderer made to my victims left me and my friends laughed on the floor with laughter. The problem is that many people try to take every independent film and expect to be a masterpiece. Take it for what it is, a bunch of kids right out of high school make their first movie. What it is, it's really good.
