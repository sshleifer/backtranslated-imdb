This is one of the three 80 films I think at the time were unfortunately overlooked and unfortunately still overlooked. One of them was Clownhouse, directed by Victor Salva, who terribly overlooked the film due to Salva's legal / sexual problems. Another one would be Cameron's cabinet, which seems to me somewhat underestimated - not big, but not as bad as the reviews I've seen. Paper House is worth your time and I think it's one of those very quiet movies that will hold you in the brain much longer than you think. I mean, 10 years after I saw it, and I still give her a little pause, while something I saw 6 months ago went into the air.
