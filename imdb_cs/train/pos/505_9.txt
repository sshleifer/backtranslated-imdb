Very good start. I was a little surprised to find that the machinery was not so advanced: it should have been more crude than we saw in the original series. The cast is interesting, though the Vulcan meets a little too human. He needs a school at Spock, which is after all a model for this race. It was a shame they could not choose Jeri Ryan. I like Mrs. Park, Korean (?) Lady. The doctor has options. They did not create other men except the black man. He is really happy. Bakula needs to find his place - In QL his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try something. Of course, it is big enough and powerful for heroism. Heavy graves were fine even though their makeup did not like them.
