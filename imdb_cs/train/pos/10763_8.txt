I have to admit that I was very skeptical about this document. I expected it to be like All American Propaganda that we do not like much in Europe. I was wrong. This is not propaganda, in fact it is hardly political. Describes the events of September 11, which appeared in the eyes of the fires, who were called on the scene just after the aircraft crash. It's an amazing coincidence that this documentary was shot at all! This film was initially shot as a documetary that the novice NY firefighter became a "man." We can only thank the filmmakers for continuing their work during the terrible suffering they faced. Big work. Absolutely amazing material. We highly recommend. <br /> <br /> Regards,
