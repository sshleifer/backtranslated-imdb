The Spirit is a unique and original view of Western life from the point of view of wild horse and native Americans. The film focuses on the friendship and dangers that the wild horse, the Spirit, encounters during his lifetime. <br /> <br /> Very well done in the presentation, using today's available technology that provides stunning visual features that are breathtaking in their depth and realism. The music is fantastic, with songs by Bryan Adams and music by Hans Zimmer, who was also responsible for the extremely popular music of Disney's 1994 hit, The Lion King. > <br /> The story is not too deep, but the fact that it is not as deep as some films do not, in my opinion, affect the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> A great movie that I enjoyed enormously and which is suitable for the whole family. It will not be missed. (10/10)
