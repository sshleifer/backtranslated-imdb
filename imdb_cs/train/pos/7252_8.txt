I saw this movie before joining the British Army. I went through basic training, initially I was difficult and then proceeded much easier. My time spent at the height of trouble in the NI and cold war. There were times when I doubted what I was getting into, not long since it always took over and you always have an instinctive reaction. The voice used to show what the soldiers think is right, even if I add breathing and heart rate as it seems to fall in the ear drum in the given situation. A few years later I was in Canada to join my family. My aunt, who lives in the United States and is a lecturer at Columbus Uni Ohio, produced a documentary on the effects of the British Army in the NI. She spent some time exploring. Although ex pat was very anti-British. She made a bee line for me and condemned me as a British soldier. My only answer was to see the film "Long Dying Day". He is the closest civilian who realizes why a soldier does what he does. The answer is at the end.
