A very stupid film, starting with a delicate pornographic sequence, emerging into a comic comedy in the art gallery, adding to a shocking discovery in the hotel room, and introducing a random murder for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> What follows is bizarre and unreal (the stop scene is extremely unnecessary), culminating in an obvious "twist" that is just as obvious as unfair to the viewer (see precisely why intentionally unfair). </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> explain each other very thoroughly and over and over again what has just happened in the movie. Although the background of female characters in the restaurant scene at the end is a joy to watch. In fact, the whole movie is a joy to watch: Despite its many, many mistakes, the whole package just works well.
