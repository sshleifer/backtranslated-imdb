I have seen this show only a few times but in my memory. <br /> <br /> It's very frustrating that it's so hard to find it anywhere to buy, and yet it seems like it's an endless repetition of things like Friends! Especially more difficult to get in England I think ..? They say it was low ratings, or was it a Bakersfield PD complaint yourself? Perhaps it was too clever for some people? <br /> <br /> Anyway, about one comedy I'd like to see again, but it's almost impossible to find it. Did I hear it repeats or repeats itself on another network? But unfortunately it is not here! <br /> <br /> Summary: Ingenious.
