I saw it on the big screen and was encapsulated. The period of Queen Victoria's younger years is a mystery, and it's a perfect description of how the young girl got into one of the highest roles in the world. The script is perfect, the acting is amazing, the history and detail's attention is outside of this world. Emily Blunt is perfect as Victoria. Funny, playing her mother Elizabeth I and William IV, plays Prince Albert! (Think Blackadder). This Victorian show shows that she was once a rebellious young woman - I'm sure she would be at the Jeremey Kyle Show if it was around: "My mother and her friend are trying to steal my life." The perfect piece of much of British and Commonwealth history .
