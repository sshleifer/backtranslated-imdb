This was one of the most important moments of the second ST: TNG before they "grew up" or entered their third and third seasons. It was not just a show for fans like Bill Campbell and Teri Hatcher but also a sequel to the search for Data for his "humanity", this time through the notion of comedy. Another of my favorite episodes. <br /> <br /> I'm still disappointed with the fact that an actress whose character Okona is about to have (according to the character of Teri Hatcher) is rather harsh than Lt Worf. I remember watching this 'first-run' episode in a daytime shop and we all thought she was perfect Jean Gray / Marvel Girl. It would be nice to know who the pretty lady actually is ...
