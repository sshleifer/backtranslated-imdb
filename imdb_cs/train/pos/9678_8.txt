I made a wish for my happy birds to talk. Print the print on the reviewer who gave the film. A sweet story that people of all ages will have. Paulie is a nice treasure. She has a lot of clever lines that really laughed at me. Especially I loved dance sequences during my showbiz stint. You can forgive the obvious clich√© when you cheer him in an attempt to meet Mary again. A charming movie with two strong characters who really are friends with a small parrot separate from their young owner. She would like to see more women who become blind and have to give up their mutual journey. I liked her artistic and poetic inspiration, a shame she could not share Paulie's meeting. Bless Paulie in her new home, finally with Mary, perhaps with a dear young man who helped him defeat the antagonists to finish their journey.
