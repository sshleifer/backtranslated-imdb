This movie is a fantastic movie. Everything about him was, in my opinion, a peak from acting to directing. I know Mr. Garfield was in the black list in the 1950s, but most of his other films are on the video, if not the DVD. Because why is not this? A friend uploaded it from TCM for me, but having it on DVD would be great. Due to their special characteristics, they could say that a marine historian speaks of the battle, and if Mrs Schmid's wife or son is still alive, they could also be an interview. Anyway it's a great movie and I highly recommend it. If it's ever eliminated, let's hope it's not dying. Coloring would, in my opinion, only destroy the whole effect of the film. The battle scene was fairly realistic in terms of 1945, the film would go. Mr. Garfield did a great job when he spoke to Mr. Schmid. Some actors might have been tempted to overcome Mrs Schmid's part, but I feel it is right. I sincerely hope that this film will be featured on DVD as a homage to the courage of Al Schmid and all the other Marines who sacrificed us during the Second World War.
