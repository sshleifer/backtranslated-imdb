My first Fassbinder was a great experience. The film and the alternative cinema (a small hall with uncomfortable seats, the public had to wait while the films were changed) were perfect matches. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of clich√© in the movie, but Fassbinder is so smart that I'm really fun. Sound was also great (sometimes louder than dialogue). Everything seemed to be in the right place. And I liked postwar time. Real fun! <br /> <br />
