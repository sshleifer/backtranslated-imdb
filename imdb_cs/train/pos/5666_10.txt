I loved this show when it was broadcast on TV and was crushed when I found out someone else decided that it was not worthy of a sequel! For years I've been hanging on my copy of this show, those I've been filming or had a tape for me. This is so far. The facts that finally decide to release this beautiful series on DVD and I finally managed to get my eager hands to a complete set. Which brings me to this part; part of the show is about everything. <br /> <br /> The American Gothic is about bad verses, basically about a fight between Lucas Buck (that's Buck with B). She's the evil sheriff of a small town in South Carolina who drives things the way he wants things to run and stop in anything to get in the way. I felt the show was greatly written and controlled and had a lot of life that was not yet alive. I'm really hated when it was canceled, but that's how it seems to me that when I finally find something worth watching on TV. Gary Cole did a great job as the role of Sheriff Lucas Buck, he has only the right amount of magic verses of evil to pull him out. The other actors also did a great job, so I think you could say that even the casting was a hit with me.
