Silent, tiny, almost insignificant. Polanski finds the invisibility of his characters and makes him something huge. Before and behind the camera, he creates one of the most inconvenient masterpieces that I had the pleasure of seeing and seeing and seeing again. He never left me. People, even people who know me pretty well, thought / thought there was something wrong with me on the basis of my attraction, or I should say devotion to "Le Locataire" They may be right, I do not know but there is something irresistibly glamorous in Polan's darkness and I did not even mention humor. The secret around the apartment and the previous tenant, the secrets that it takes over and, of course, us, me. This building was populated by Oscar major winners: Melvyn Douglas, Shelley Winters, Jo Van Fleet, Lila Kedro. For anyone who loves movies, it's mandatory to watch. One, two, three, many, many views.
