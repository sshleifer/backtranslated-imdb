This movie is a beautiful and light look on both sides, where the scene of a "club baby" blends with the artistic, musical and artistic worlds of art in New York City (with the ubiquitous Miss Bunny). This is the "Torch Song Trilogy" for perky-post-teenage girls. "This girl" for our restless, millennia hit. Dialogue is fast and fun and Parker Posey's customer deserves - if not the Academy's price, at least - the "wave" stadium. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film is based on Miss Posey's very stylish heel and is perfectly occupied. Like many of her acting work she may not be too deep, she is often self-referential and well-posey ... but everything DOES. It's a talented comedy, incredible fun, and it's fun, wearing her on her shoulders like the face of a leopard, and never letting her fall to the floor. Mary is a superficial fashionist who is not over the theft of designer clothes from a friend's wardrobe or with someone else's friend. At a deeper level, this is a story about a girl and her friends who are easy to care for in every sense, including other people; and the process of learning that care is vital to life. <br /> <br /> The script is beautifully crafted, funny and the only performance that disappoints is aunt, in a role that was too one-dimensional and heavy. which would divert her performance, deepen the relationship between the two ... but ... hey ... this is a comedy. The surprisingly deep role that gives this film some substance and a world vision is the seller's friend fallafel. We should all be so lucky ... is this for Mary? or the one who disappeared? <br /> <br /> I judge it as 8, because it's not a great moment of film history, it's not a classic, and it's not a great art (everything that gets deeper and richer at the show). Like "Desperately looking for Susan," it is something very true about its time period, but it may be irrelevant over time. Still, she has everything she needs for a fun movie, and it's worth seeing clothes just a few times!
