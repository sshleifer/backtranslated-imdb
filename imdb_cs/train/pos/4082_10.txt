Hayao Miyazaki has no consensus about using hand-drawn animation as a form of narration, but is often compared to Walt Disney. This is just as unjust as it is seen by watching Miyazaki's film that he is a great artist. It has a really exciting gift for both adults and children, and Laputa is really an amazing ride. But where can I begin to describe the movie so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's work will never surprise me. Laputa is a big-scale adventure, and I wonder how the film can be full of detail and imagination. Ask yourself this question: if you are a child dreaming about an adventure so magnificent and as magical as it will be? The answer would be if you sat down and watched Lapu, because it is really a childish fantasy. Every minute of the movie is rich and breathtaking ... from the train to the pursuit to the amazing flying sequence ... and the beautiful view of the floating castle itself. Not to mention the excellent score Joe Hisais! Everything you ever want from an adventure movie is here.
