I saw it at the Legacy Theater in the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City this morning. I assume that the level of his enjoyment during this film will depend to a large extent on how one accepted Joseph's story. However, it was very well done, worked well and had a nice score. If you get to Salt Lake City, you need to see it at the Legacy Theater. I've never been in a nice theater in terms of image quality, sound quality, and atmosphere throughout my life ... It seems to me if the Church would let me watch Batman begin! Since I am the LDS and I consider Joseph the Prophet, I have come to several places and I have been thinking about it several times ... which I believe is expected from the time they handed the films of the tissue before the film began! Anyway, I was told that this film is available in several resorts for LDS visitors all over the world, and if you have 70 minutes, check out if you believe Joseph Smith or not is telling a fascinating story.
