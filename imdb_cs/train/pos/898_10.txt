One would have to be really crazy to get into this gem of the film (and I also saw hundreds of Hindu and Bollywood movies). Actors, beautiful surroundings, places and surroundings, deep emotions, carved sweet songs (especially the singing voice of Udita Narayana, my favorite) - everything was just wonderful. The human (imperfect) element was tissue to create a pathway and to control the conspiracy, as well as to allow a heartfelt distinction. Alok Nath is such an amazing actor, so open with the emotions of the characters he portrays, almost steals the show from the young stars. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves true novels - those that go beyond superficial beauty with real love - as one of the best movies, Hindi or otherwise!
