I was delighted to read Martin Torgoff's book "I Can not Find a Way Home," which is full of information about America's drug culture in 1945-2000. This guy knows his stuff! I found out he is an excellent spokesman for this document. I loved watching movie clips from the hippie and 70th century culture. The soundtrack was great. Whoever compiled it was definitely in touch with the melodies of every era. Let's hope it's wrapped up and sold as a CD set. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in how LSD experiments in 1960 forever changed American culture as we know it. One thing that was missing was the mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in Blow), allegedly responsible for a large proportion of marijuana and cocaine arriving in the country in the 1960s and 1980s.
