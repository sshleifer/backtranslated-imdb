I saw this movie once as a child on a late late show and fell in love with it. It took 30 years or more, but recently I found it on DVD - it was not cheap, either - in a catalog that specialized in war films. We watched it last night for the first time. The sound was good, but it was grainy and had trailers between the wheels. Yet it was better than I remembered. I was also amazed by the fact that it is a game. <br /> <br /> The catalog is here somewhere. If you are honest in search, burn my missive and see if I can get you information. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
