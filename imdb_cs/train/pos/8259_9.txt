I suppose that the ultimate curse of visiting the Toronto Film Festival is the timetable of the release date. Quite frankly, I'm happy that Fido was up for distribution in the US. In any case ... <br /> <br /> Have you ever seen Shauna dead? Good. What about Lassie? Is he able to reconcile the two? Well, if your name can be Andrew Currie, a Canadian helmer from the first family thematic zombie comedy, or die. (Seriously, that's what the Toronto press release says.) Though it's not as violent, dry or British as the Shaun of the Dead, Fido remains true to its roots: the devotion of the 50's black-and-white television, including Lassie, which was exhausted during this period. <br /> <br /> The talented Fido talents (Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connelly, Dylan Baker, and Tim Blake Nelson) stand as proof of a brilliance script. The film examines all the implications of its assumptions: the world where zombies were transformed into servants due to their total number due to a strange accident. What would you use your new undead servant? Mid-fielders? Handmade? Pet? Countless acts? Fido solves all these choices in a sweet and surprisingly elegant way thanks to Connelly (as one of the zombies) and young television actor K'Sun Ray, who seems to be ever better young Elijah Wood than young Elijah Wood. <br /> <br /> If you expect another Shaun from the dead, do not waste your time. There is almost enough gore and pokes to the genre to satisfy you and just let the theater be bitter and depressing. But if you're willing to look at what happens to Shaun the dead when they jump over the lake, you're on the favors. Think of Fide as a sensitive, more defeated brother, Shaun of the dead, who is rich, and you start to drift. If you like (or at least tolerates) zombies, little kids and lots of dead satire, Fido is for you. If it is not ... well, you know the exercise. Just hit the squares between the eyes.
