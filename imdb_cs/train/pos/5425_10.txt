This - and not a certain slightly overestimated South Soap - was the biggest epic that came out of the biggest year in Hollywood in 1939. I will not repeat the obvious - Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen (who was the Bengal Lancer) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. they give an excellent comic performance. However, I want to note two more, less understood elements of this masterpiece. The spectacular final battle, as the gorgeous Sam Jaffe rises to the top of the temple to blow his box and warn the regiment, is simply magnificent. It will never disappoint me. Another underrated feature in the film is the performance of Eduard Ciannelli as a guru. This is not the Fu Manchu cartoon, but well-drawn, articulated, historically informed ("Have you ever heard of Changruputra Maurya? He defeated an army that left Alexander in India") a villain. Indeed, you can see the parallels between this mystical, evil Nationalist and some famous figure of the 1930s (German, not Indian). Gunga Din, an anti-Nazi tract? Not quite. Yet, a huge, fun, moving epic.
