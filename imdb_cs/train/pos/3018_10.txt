This movie is an exception to the rule that the sequel is worse than the original one. Her comedy is best. This movie is a fast action comedy where something seems to have happened every second. On more than one occasion, the audience laughed loudly at the joke. His great advantage is that he saw the first movie, but it is not a requirement. <br /> <br /> GÃ¶ta kanal 2 also has the advantage of parody in the last decades of reality production of television series such as the survivor (expediton: Robinson in Swedish) This is a Swedish film for a Swedish audience. So you can not see unless you are familiar with Sweden and its language. Otherwise: Have fun! Johan
