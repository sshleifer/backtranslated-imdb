I have not seen this movie for years, so my knowledge is a bit rusty. I remember this movie is a two-time Braveheart movie. It is simply more realistic and has more credible characters. Ridb Roy looks like someone imagines what Rob Roy looks like, chaotic hair and beard with simple clothing. Also, Liam Nesson has a Celtic look at him, looks like Scots, and even more importantly looks like Rob Roy. It's a comparison that scares some people, but compares it to Mel Gibson as William Wallace. Gibson is probably playing a man who is legended to be described as a 6 foot 7 giant, while Gibson is almost a leg shorter. The story includes little romance, a plot, and a story from a non-commissioned officer. Sounds like Braveheart? But instead of the film that calls "freedom," freedom and nationalism, we get a movie that says honor, love and justice. This makes him an interesting movie. Just like Gladiator. Cast is fantastic and Liam Nesson is a very strong leader in this effort. The story is great as it deals with heroism and humanity. The scene where Mary is raped and she steps from a burning house with a look of true Scottish power, followed by washing her semen from her crotch in extreme panic. This is something that the heroine in Braveheart never did. Overall, it's a stunning and almost flawless watch. Go and see!
