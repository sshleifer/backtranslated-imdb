Day Zero leads you to think, even to think why two boys / young men do what they did - commit suicide by killing their classmates. It captures what must be in a bizarre way of being for two people who have chosen to step out of common courtesy to define their own / mutual world, linked to destruction. It's not a perfect movie, but what kind of money / time the filmmaker and actor have - it's a remarkable product. When it comes to explaining the motives and acts of two young suicides / murderers, it's better than "Elephant" - as far as the film that comes under our "rationalist" skin, it's far, a much better film than almost everything you're probably see. <br /> <br /> Wrong but honest with terrible honesty.
