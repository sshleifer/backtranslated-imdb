Pierce Brosnan's latest, but James Bond is a killer. He is very good at what he does, but he gets tired and tired. Greg Kinnair is really good as a direct and narrow trader. Now that the story opens, the film shows these two people in their separate lives. Then one night they have drinks in the bar and they start talking. Then suddenly you will find that these two people have joined together during a series of events. The story is great, acting is top and humor is fun. I never thought Pierce Brosnan was so funny, but I really do, and I have to say that this movie needs to be seen.
