... do not read any summaries of the plot, because the words of the conspiracy may seem trivial, brain-dead and unnecessary. The movie is great, it's about both Denzel and Dakota (she's going high, believe me) are just wonderful and the plot is blown. Actually, "fabulous" is a small word to use for such talented actors. The film is based on real facts and some characters are not fictitious, a fact that adds to the shock I had during and after the movie. If you like both the actors a bit shaky movies, you still have not seen your favorite ... Trust me, you will eventually have a strange and inexplicable feeling. The movie is amazing, see, rent, buy or otherwise ... just do not miss it
