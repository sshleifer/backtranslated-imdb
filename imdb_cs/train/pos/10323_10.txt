This is a very funny movie. Several reviews I've read on this forum are written by people who apparently think the movie was an attempt at a serious career. It was not what it is ... It is an extremely pleasant film that is performed in the face language. Of course, all actors enjoy fun. The battle sequence is alive, lively, and above all inappropriate. The so-called "green death", used on several occasions, is not, as I read in one review, "scary". Several reviewers were critical to fighting martial arts between the Doctrine and the Sea near the end of the film. Hey, lighten ... I remind you again that it's a fun movie. Each phase of this "fight" was a title, which added a fun point of view. The actors did not try to imitate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. This is not one of those martial arts movies. Ron Ely looks great in this movie and is the perfect choice for playing Doc. Another nice touch is the unique way of dealing with the ultimate fate of the "bad boy" (Seas). I promise you, if you are not trying to take this movie seriously and simply watch it for entertainment value, you will spend 100 minutes in the most pleasant way.
