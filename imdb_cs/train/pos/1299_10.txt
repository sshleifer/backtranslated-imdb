I caught a little of this concert on public television and I knew I had to have it. Boys give everyone at Royal Albert an excellent, often exciting performance that is in any case complete. Also clean - no synthesizer, no lasers and flashes packed with smoke, no spectacular entry (and unhappy, serious and respectful audience, each leaving his rocket on the bottle at home). <br /> <br /> It's a fan of Cream (or you've just heard about them); if you are a blues fan; if you're a rock 'n' roll fan; you will not be disappointed when viewing and listening to this DVD. You will never lose this DVD because you will never borrow it from anyone. (This DVD justifies self-esteem! Tell them to get their own!) It's too good and too transportable. you will want to keep it in touch.
