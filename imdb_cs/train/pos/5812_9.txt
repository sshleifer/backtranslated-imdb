Moonwalker is probably not a movie that will watch unless you are a Michael Jackson fan. I'm a big fan and I'm looking forward to most of the movie, the end was not fantastic, but in the first 50 minutes - if you're a fan. Personally, I think the first 50 minutes are re-traceable many times. Dance in every video is breathtaking, music is fantastic to listen and fun dialogue. It contains many of his best videos from Bad and excerpts from his previous videos. It also contains some live concert shots. If you are a big fan of Michael Jackson, it is necessary, if you are not a fan or you do not like Michael Jackson, he does it clearly. <br /> <br /> 9/10
