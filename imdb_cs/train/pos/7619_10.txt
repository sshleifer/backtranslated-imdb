Fascinating. Exciting. Dramatic. Explosive. Complex. Epic. Words that touch only the tip of the glacier in terms of the magnificent story that is lost. </ P> <p style = "text-align: left;"> LOST is a basic TV show for fans of fantasy, fantasy, action, adventure and a lot of secrets, from scattered to rare visual effects. Every member of the cast is so well chosen and so well in his roles that you either love or hate it, or we clearly want him to be dead. Visual effects, when used (which is rare), are actually quite well done due to the usual production of shows. Whether it's a "smoky monster" on polar bears, LOST is credible when it comes to eye-candy. As for the story, nothing can be compared to the huge complexity that this show has done to the audience to hold onto me. From the beginning to the end, continuity is virtually perfect, characters are being developed, and the ever-evolving story slowly gives answers to questions to so many people. <br /> <br /> Overall there is virtually no error in LOST. It makes for dramatic / science fiction television what Arrested Development did for comedy: set up a bar. I highly recommend removing those who are patient, mental and loving every moment of the journey, no matter how long it takes before you finish. <br /> <br /> Look at this show.
