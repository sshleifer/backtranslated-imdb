"Radiofreccia" is still a surprise in the Italian cinema. The film is based on the book by Italian composer Lucian Ligabue, who also directs the film and writes a musical score - of course. The film is a portrait of North Italian provincial life in the Emilia Romagna region. We are in 1975, the time of the first free radio - one of the guys of the film creates "Radioraptus". Youth's friendship, love, sex, individual drama and unemployment are among the themes, but the film also talks about drugs - the main character is the victim of heroin slavery. <br /> <br /> and moralists, the story goes very well; spontaneity of actors is strong and also a way to drive. Obviously, Luciano "Liga" Ligabue is neither Fellini nor a film professional, he is a musician. But he can produce a good product. Unfortunately it will not repeat the success with the second film "Da zero and die" - nothing at all. <br /> <br /> In "Radiofreccia" actors are not generally too famous, the only star is Stefano Accorsi - one of the most popular young Italian actors. See in a small role another Italian composer - Francesco Guccini, he is a handsome communist bartender and football coach!
