This animated TV series is the best way for children to learn how the human body works. Yes, this is biology, but they will never say it. <br /> <br /> I really think this is the best part of this "educational cartoon" stream. I remember that in several parts: skin, skeleton and of course: organs. You will find the same stream: "Il Ã©tait une fois l'espace" (about the space and its exploration), but it is about the human history from the big bang to the 20th century. it is more a fiction than a description of reality because it is held in the future.
