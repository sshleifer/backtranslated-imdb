It happened to me that I caught this movie one afternoon. I have to admit that I've never been a big fan of baseball, but sometimes I can get into a good sporting movie. I found it more interesting to portray a foster family system. As a therapist who saw both good and bad mental health and a foster care system, I was rather refreshing when he saw a movie that showed both the rises and the descent of this system: people jumped from family to family, biological parents who always does not participate actively, and transitions that can only be heart-poisoning and heart melting. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover are the anchor of this film and both bring a very credible performance. Perhaps it was just my emotional state, but at the end of the movie I found out that I was ripped apart.
