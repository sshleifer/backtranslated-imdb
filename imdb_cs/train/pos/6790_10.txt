This game is one of the best RPGs. Fist, it's really fun than any other because of the combat system (you're hurting the enemy depending on how you target the attack, you can turn into a dragon, a special attack, a spell ...). The script is very good. The characters are beautiful and you do not have long dialogues to support, as it happened in several Final Fintasy series games. I've been bored with those past dialogues where you just want to continue the story of the game. Surrounding is a jewel in this game, combining middle-aged fantasies with futuristic sci-fi. It's remarkable that the animation effects are simply unbelievable that I like more than others in other modern games (we can not remember that the Dragon Legend is 8 years old). Then the map is huge, everywhere there are enemies. Finally, music is not the best game I've ever heard, but it's ideal for such a game.
