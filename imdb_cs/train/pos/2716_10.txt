Everything I remember was great ... a great cast with Sam Waterston and George Innes (before he met the American audience) ... great scripts as English only - Edwardian Sherlock Holmes / Lord Peter Wimsey / Albert Campion of a secret, but with Jules Verne twist. Something similar to MacGyver would be if it was in England 80 years ago ... right at the beginning of the 20th century scientific / technological revolution. I often wondered if the makers of MacGyver had seen these shows. MacGyver first broadcast about three years later. I still have one episode on a much worn tape.
