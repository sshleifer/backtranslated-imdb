Hitting: This is one of the most amazing and intense movies I've ever seen. The first film in the years that left me totally unfolded. As soon as I felt the way out of the theater, I was so impressed. I spent fifteen minutes on the screen trying to find a way to describe the power of this film. just failure. Highlighting any aspect - the format of a documentary-style video recorder, unimaginable display of events, the strength of the characters - only seems to spoil it all. Some may find it ridiculous that each killer could be characterized as normal. But then not all the killers are mad mad foam at the mouth. Many of them are quite regular, undemanding people. They are simply cabled differently. And this is perhaps the coldest idea for all.
