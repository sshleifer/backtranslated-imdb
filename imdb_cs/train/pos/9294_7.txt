Before I begin, I must emphasize that I know the editor of this film. We never met, but we belonged to the same fancy (the stuff that came in front of the bulletin boards), and we talked over the phone, so I'm biased here. Anyway ... ironically, how the Rat Pack culture of the late 50s and early to mid-60s returned to the original Rat Pack in the mid-1990s, and which was made in a similar way, was a flop. Not only that, it was a critical flop; I believe that Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was the only one who did not suffer (when I remind him, he gave him a mixed view). And when I do not think it's the biggest movie in the world and I'm not a fan of Rat Pack or "cocktail" culture, I think it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> One thing looks stylish and moves straight. Second, the main achievements are good. Richard Dreyfus is surprisingly restrained as a gangster from his head, who returns from the sanatorium and has a peak. Jeff Goldblum returns to the silent ironic performances he made on pre-Christmas days like BIG CHILL. And while Ellen Barkin is only supposed to spar on this movie, it's funny. It's true that it's not a great movie; The dialogue is mostly made up of punks and many of them do not work (like the whole of "Zen Ben"). And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are terrible. Still, I enjoyed it, and if you like gangster movies, you can also be.
