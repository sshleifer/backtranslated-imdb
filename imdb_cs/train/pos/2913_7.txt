"This male navy" is, as other remarks show, a rare and well-shot view of Navy's lighter-than-air (LTA) operations. The LTA crews were fairly proud that the convoys never lost the ship to a diving attack. And filming at various NAS sites gives a valuable insight into the type of aircraft that's long gone. However, the first part of the film is about Beers, his relationship with his servants, and his encounter with Tom Drake and his mother and getting Drake's foot firm. Only after that, the second film begins. The second film is mostly LTAs in action, while on the surface platform, the guys are killed and cause lots of damage. The view is quite brash and realistic, I imagine. Then we move to Southeast Asia. Does the Navy have LTAs there? It does not matter that this part is really wild, with the jungle being depleted by some downed crew. And the Japanese shoot like a madman. The tones of Vietnam, except for escape, are oh, so quiet. This is the bomb we are talking about. Finally, the dramatic drama of the Second World War about the very unusual part of the war.
