Two adolescent adolescents, best friends, go to Thailand for the last experience before you break up and go to college. It seems like it's a fun time to tour an exotic country when they meet an attractive foreigner who leads them to Hong Kong and puts drugs into their luggage. They acquire local police and find that justice in Asia is very different from justice in the United States. This is the main story for "Brokedown Palace" and that was good. The film makes a decent job of portraying the arbitrary and corrupt judicial systems of Third World nations. In fact, the picture was rather mild, because prison conditions are often much worse than makeup. It serves as a reminder that no matter how badly we think our system of justice is, it is inviolable compared to most of the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there were too many contingencies in the movie that broke the story. The whole escape attempt was a fake fantasy. Thinking that friends will be able to smuggle money for bribes in a cushioned bra and that they are not interested in guards, who systematically check everything that visitors bring, assumes that either guards or viewers are utterly blocked. <br /> <br /> The story also does not close on the annoying question of how the drugs got into Alice's (Claire Danes) backpack. Did she really agree to transport drugs? We have to guess. It was interesting that we are constantly guessing about the girl's innocence throughout the movie, but we finish the film without knowing if one or both girls could be guilty. Except for this significant error, the end was excellent and the results unexpected. Cast Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale were very solid and well done. Danny, who was overcrowded and exaggerated, actually came as an actor in this film. Although her portrait was often immature (as did her character), she improved the progress of the film and the circumstances became more terrible. Beckinsale, on the other hand, flew under the radar all her short career and shines like a good twin who suddenly find himself in jail. Her best performance in the movie. Bill Pullman was a lawyer. His frantic and restless style is an asset in "When You Slept", but as a third world lawyer on a crusade to free two innocent girls from injustice, he had a bad personality. <br /> <br /> The tourist view of Thailand was interesting, but I did not want to go there. <br /> <br /> Overall, the fun movie was unlikely in parts by inserting some ridiculous scenes. I gave her 7/10.
