Yes, this horror B grade. But at least producers, directors and actors do not pretend that this film is manna from heaven. The mission is a sad, psychotic serial killer on his way to execution, splashed with a genetic acid that turns it into snow. The snowman, and so Jack Frost, continues a murderous assault to find a small town sheriff who finally arrested him. With a limited budget, the crew had to deal with a limited special effect, most money seems to have spent on a snowman's costume. Special difficult shots are controlled by cartoons or exposed shots (shots where the camera moves to mask details). <br /> <br /> This is not a children's film and should not be confused with a Disney movie with the same name. If you do not want your children to watch movies pg-13 themselves, then parents should not let their children watch this movie. This film has two claims to glory. 1. Outstanding Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) has made her first major film role. The scene in which Jack Frost attacks Shannon Elizabeth is worth watching several times. 2. This movie always has the worst snowman. The joke is so bad that directors attribute to a joking depositor.
