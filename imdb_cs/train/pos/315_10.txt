I totally loved this soap. It was one of my favorites. You will highly recommend :) ... I like Brazilian soaps, these are real life events. I'm really sad that the soap is over, but I'm sure I'll find it somewhere. For those of you who have not seen them, look at it. I loved the characters, the conspiracy and how things turned out to be the villains. The only thing I would change is the end to Xica and her long love. I can not wait to see it again, and I highly recommend it. Xica was by far the best soap I've ever seen. Forget everything else :) GO XICA .. I hope you like it the same way.
