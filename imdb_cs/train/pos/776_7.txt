I think the idea of ​​a plot is ideal for exploring the emotional experiences of the people involved, and secondly, as someone else wrote in the commentary, the implications of this type of relationships (incest and lesbianism) in Romanian society. <br /> <br /> So ... start with the second aspect ... to be short, not to be seen at all ... <br /> <br /> first. as I said, had much greater potential ... I think these relationships bring much more tension ... much more tension ... and the potential tension has not gotten ... I think the soundtrack could be more than a couple of songs on the background and the theme (which was nice but not enough and not always at the right moment) ... yeah ... I felt the absence of better soundtrack .. actors ... I think they were somewhere from 7 to 8/10 ... at key moments there was not enough sensuality ... <br /> <br /> A total of 7/10 .... mostly for the story
