Before I watched this TV movie, I did not know much about one of my favorite actresses. After that, I realized how truly sad Lucille Ball really was. It was a great time, but I did not know how sad it was. This movie was very good and he told the story of his beloved Lucille Ball very well. I warmly recommend.
