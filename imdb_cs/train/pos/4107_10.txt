I loved this movie! It's really bizarre, extremely entertaining, morbid, humorous ... There is no point in telling the content of the movie, because then I would give the result! You have to see it without knowing what it is about! Everything is connected and has its reasons and reasons. It starts gently and then things start to move faster and faster until it culminates in the deadliest explosion you can imagine! It's even more fun watching the movie a second time as you know all the "tricks". The actors are excellent, especially Ivan Trojan, whose final scenes are a real masterpiece! I highly recommend this movie, it's one of the most original movies I've ever seen!
