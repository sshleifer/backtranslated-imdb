Lost is an exceptionally good TV series about some lost on the island. there are so many twists and turns that you can not decide who is your favorite character, one minute is his, then he does something the best, then he's going to do something, so she's the best, then you develop tension and just like you . the episode explosion ends and yours like noooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!! so you have to wait all week to see another episode, but it's worth waiting. Conclusion, action, romance, humor will all separate from girlish nude, but that's good because it means you can really focus on the story more and the story about it's all about it. so if you like a good story and as a voltage it's good, but 24 I think it's probably better. (I also have an overview that you could check it out.) I'd lose a good 8 out of 10 mainly because it's so unpredictable, you never know what's going to happen.
