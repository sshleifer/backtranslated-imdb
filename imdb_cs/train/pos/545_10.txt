The consequences almost do not suit the original one. This is certainly the case here. However, if you are a big fan of the original, you will definitely give it. Although the camera is missing, the character of Brian Krause is unpleasant and the conspiracy is a handle, it is much more fun than the first, and that's what I like. <br /> <br /> You do not see this movie expecting the same performance as the first movie. Honestly, it's a bit different. Rather than sitting in his writing scenes in the cabin, Stanley is in Hollywood trying to direct his dream project, Cabin by the Lake. This movie has a different feel, but it's great to see Stanley in action. <br /> <br /> I give him 6 out of 10.
