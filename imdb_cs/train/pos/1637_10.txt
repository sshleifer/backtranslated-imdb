I love this movie and have seen it several times over the years. Every tracking improves. I agree with all the positive reviews here. Yes, it is harsh and brutally realistic, because prairie life was in those days. I found out that I made comments when I watched them. Someone here said Rip Torn was wrong. I could not disagree more. It's great because Clyde Stewart, who says little and works like a slave / horse, is crazy, crazy. Conchatta Farrell is fantastic as a widowed Elinor whom Clyde hires as a housewife / cook (along with her 7-year-old daughter). Lilia Skala is excellent as a distant neighbor named grandmother. Also the star is the sharp Montana prairie. It is a beautiful and brutal country in which to settle down. There are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary. No special effects here, what you see is real! It even has a perfectly perfect musical score and a great screenplay. Once you see the Heartland, you will not forget it. He deserves ten years.
