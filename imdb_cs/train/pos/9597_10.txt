This is a documentary film that must meet anyone who feels that modern youth has lost its taste for real-life adventures and a sense of morality. Darius Goes West is the stunning story of the story. We live in the life of Darius and the crew as they embark on a life-long journey. Darius has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a disease that affects all the muscles in his body. It is limited to a wheelchair and needs constant attention. So how could this crew of young friends do 6000 miles of trips to the West Coast and back? Watch the movie and experience the excitement of this great adventure - laughing and crying with the crew as they cope with unimaginable challenges on the road and enjoying the ultimate triumph of returning three weeks later in their home town at an exciting reception and some great surprises!
