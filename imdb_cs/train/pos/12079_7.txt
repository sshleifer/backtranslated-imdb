For those who think of Dame May Witty as kind, lightweight, old lady from Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes, this film needs adjustment. Here is everything, but kindly or impatiently. Instead, her son, George Macready, is the guy. Just do not give him a knife, otherwise his eyes will light and there is no furniture in the house. Now we know what she means to be caught by Nina Foch if she can get out of her mother's subordinate hand. A really tight little woman in a dangerous movie that keeps the tension high. The script has never disappeared from Foch's dilemma. She was imprisoned in a large old Gothic house on the edge of the angry sea. They will kill her, but why. Her difficulty does not make sense. Tensions roll when they try for a second flight, but even strangers appear to appear against it. We begin to feel its helplessness and growing paranoia when the world turns away from her. Director Joseph H. Lewis has made this film a great step toward cult status, and of course. Then also watch how Foch gently passes the whole range of emotions without crossing the peak. Funny also shines like a really intimidating matriarch who knows what he wants and how to get it if he can keep his son at the head. My only reservation is the climax that seems to be too conceived due to the timing of the events. However, it's a good, nervous way to spend over an hour studying Columbia Studios.
