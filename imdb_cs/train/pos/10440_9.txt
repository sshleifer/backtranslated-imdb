This movie is intelligent. This means that most of the other films go beyond the smallest common denominator - silly people will probably not appreciate it. The story is also based on dialogue. It has some parallels with loss in translation, although it is much clearer before the sunrise, slightly less abstract and simply much better. Scenario, characters, and even a slightly surrealistic atmosphere feel completely realistic. The actors play absolutely brilliantly. I have rarely seen a movie where scenario and acting have completely melted this reality. Dialogue has moved to very personal questions with the risk of a little skipping. However, it is on the right side almost all the time, although I found a little awkward and embarrassing for a while. Balancing this fine line requires a huge talented actor. Sometimes it brings great results, and overall this movie is just amazing! Only very, very rarely, is "love" in the films illustrated in a way that I think is credible and realistic. Every time this is done, the result is fantastic. I think the stunning and seemingly timeless beauty of female actress in this direction has helped enough. It still looks stunning in this movie, 12 years later. <br /> <br /> It's simply the jewel of a movie you can not miss. One of the best movies I've seen since the 1990s!
