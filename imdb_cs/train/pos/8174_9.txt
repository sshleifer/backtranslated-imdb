I love this movie. As a kid, it was one of the first films I saw that made me feel like, of course, it's now mild, but that was awesome that day. Dentists are one thing so many people are scared, so why not make a movie about a dentist killer? It's salty, it's fun, sometimes it's scary, but it's amazing. And I always had a love for medical horror. And Corbin Bernsen perfectly plays Dr. Feinstone, no one can do it better. And for a low budget horror movie, effects and such are pretty good. And I also like thematic music, that's good with the movie. Ken Foree is also about playing an angry cop and doing a great job. There is plenty of blood and some really cold torture / deadly scenes. Check this out!
