The High Energy Raoul Walsh classic from 1933, The Bowery features the owner of the salon and operator Wallace Beer against the bitter rival and dandy George Raft with the adopted street kid Jackie Cooperem and the good-looking Faye Wray in the roles they play among their great rivalry. It is not clear what rivalry is, but everyone is watching it in the daily avenue. Lots of puzzles in the beginning, but the characters soften the progress of the film. Besides, there is a complete exuberance of scenes in the Beery's saloon. Various characters, a sexy chorus line, a lot of drinking, the perfect day offright creation that has not been overtaken by so-called code restrictions, and later comes Carrie Nations, led by Carrie Nation herself. Everything creates a very vivid image of life that is long gone. I do not want to compare the era, but this film is totally different from what we see today. The film has a lot of heart and a long loss of innocence and it's absolutely necessary to see it.
