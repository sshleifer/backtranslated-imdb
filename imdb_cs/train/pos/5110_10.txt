I was about 11 years old, I found out that I live at a distance of 0.48 miles from my uncle's home. Uncle House is at Westway Dr, Deer Park, TX. they have added home since their filming. I do not know the house number, but you can go look. I'm 21 now and I enjoy watching this movie. the Spencer bar is no longer theirs. Pasadena ISD wants to build a school. I was at the house last week and the house still looks great. My dad and my uncle would go to the street where the house is and watch the actors come out and out of the house trying to make a movie. where John crossed railroad cracks that made 225 higher. when I hear about John sending his son, I think about when the city cowboy was at the age of 26 or 25.
