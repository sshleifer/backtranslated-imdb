This is a dramatic film in the whole sense of the word. He says that in Greece we live as a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is. Surely it has some extremes ... but every now and then real life suffers from art. It is deeply critical of the goals we are pursuing and the whole social fabric around them. The film has a deeper understanding of Greek ways of life, stereotypes and social structure. Unlike most of the Greek movies that have a certain fast-food audience, this will never focus, but while you look at it, you feel that someone has given you the best words and pictures to describe your feelings. I'm not a big fan of traditional music, but I would not want to hear anything else when it was during the movie. <br /> <br /> If someone told me that I would say something against this movie, I would definitely define the transition between the scenes looking suddenly or somewhat short-circuited. I think the editing had to cut out to fit for 2 hours and a bit for the theaters. Anyway, I could write more and more to express my thoughts on this, but I think you have to see and discuss with a friend. You must see
