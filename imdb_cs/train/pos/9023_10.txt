A very gruff, temperamental display of part of the history of World War 2, which most of us in the US had never imagined. I'd like to have it on the video. It only showed t.v. once I know, back in 89 or 90. I asked for this movie and most of the video stores do not even know about it. Great actresses all around, they wanted me to see it again. Top ranges.
