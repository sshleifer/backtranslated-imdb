A "family affair" returns us to a less complicated time in America. She is scary when she saw how everything was different. It was a more innocent time in our country, and we watched a "functional" family that dealt with together. The film also marks the beginning of the series with the Hardy family. The film, directed by George Seitz, is based on a successful game. Judge James Hardy and his wife Emmily face a domestic crisis that needs to be resolved. Married daughter Joan returns home after committing a social mistake and her husband is responsible. At the same time, another daughter, Marion, brings home a babe that will clearly meet her father. Happy young man Andy seems to be the only one without his problem until his mother allows her to accompany Polly to dance, something she's reluctant to. Hard to say, Judge Hardy will prove why he knows best when he puts the plan into action to reconnect. After all, it is a person who understands not only the law, but how to deal with those external forces that threaten his community position and what will make his family happy. Lionel Barrymore plays Judge Hardy with conviction. He is the glue that holds everything together. Spring Byington is seen as Emily, mother. Mickey Rooney plays a small role in this film, but as always, it's fun to watch. Cecilia Parker and Julie Haydon appeared as daughters, Marion and Joan. Sara Hayden and Margaret Mark√Ωz are also introduced as Aunt Milly and Polly, a girl who will surprise Andy with her beauty. "Family affair" is a good way to observe our past through a positive image painted from an American family.
