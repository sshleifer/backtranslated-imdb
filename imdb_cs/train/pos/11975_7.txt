Full House is a great family show. However, after watching some episodes over and over again, I realized they are incredibly boring and seem to be largely hidden from the outside world. Yes, there is a lot of comedy, but there are times when it's incredibly rich. It's not like I hate it, but I just do not watch them again and again, because they care fast. Probably the best season is the first. The whole house is about the widow Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) and his three daughters D.J. (Candace Cameron) Stephanie (Jodie Sweet) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley). When Danny dies, he needs some help. So his best friend Joey (Dave Coulier) and girl uncle Jesse (John Stamos) are moving with them. Once they live together, they find they can not live without themselves. <br /> <br /> The complete house will remind you of the importance of the family and that you can always come back home.
