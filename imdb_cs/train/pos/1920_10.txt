Paul Hennessy and his wife Cate have to deal with their two teenage daughters and a strange son ... But after John Ritter's premature stroll, it turned out to be more about losing a loved one ... <br /> <br /> I found this show and walked through the channels one afternoon and I must say that I laughed until my ribs hit, just to the extent of the characters; funny lines, and the situation that Paul finds himself with his daughters ... Since then I've captured the rest of the show when I was free and I have to say that the writing was very good .. But then I read about the Death of John Ritter ... Soon after, I watched "Goodbye" part 2 and I must say that I was almost in tears watching the emotions of the figure, losing the beloved ... How Rory strikes the wall in anger and frustration. .. How does Cate deal with sleeping in her own bed ... Briget and Kerry talk about what to do. But the show continues with Jim Egan and CJ Barnes, who is greatly laughing because Cate's father is trying to protect his family and "talk to a man" with Rory ... But the real jewel is CJ ... who is totally cheerful like a wild cousin. <br /> <br /> It will always be John Ritter's masterpiece.
