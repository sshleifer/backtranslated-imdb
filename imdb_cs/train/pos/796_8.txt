Thomas Capano was not the boss of Anne Marie Tom Carper, governor. That's why the federations got involved, called Clinton and asked him to join the Federation. I lived outside of Philadelphia at the time, so the case was the newsletter on the first page everyday. I also read the Ann Rule book and saw the "City Confidential" segment on A & E. Tom Capano was a megalomanic (sp.), Uber-controller and monster. He claimed to love Ann Marie, but all he wanted was someone he could control. If she did not let him do it, she killed her, the final form of control. I think it's a waste of money that she's still alive.
