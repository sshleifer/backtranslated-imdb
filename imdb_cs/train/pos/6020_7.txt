The beautiful new sign "Zabriskie Point" plays in Paris and seems to be doing well in the Latin Quarter. It's time for a full movie review. Hopefully, the new press means that in the near future a DVD will come out with some striking "extras". I remember watching the GP when it came out and thinking it was a shock. This time I was totally amazed and would classify it as a "almost miss" masterpiece. The first part of the film is a time capsule from the late 60s of Los Angeles, where I lived there, and Antonioni has done a masterpiece to capture the essence of this place. Kudos to production designer Dean Tavoularis, who has found some incredible locations and has done excellent work. The print I've seen runs for 1 hour and 50 minutes. It is forbidden to those under the age of 16 (or 18 years of age that I do not remember). I suspect there are lots of recovered records in this press. SPOILER - I wonder how many desolate sexual scenes were originally cut. What seems today is becoming fairly twisted according to current standards. <br /> <br /> There is no music soundtrack until the movie gets nearly 1 hour. Before we hear foreign noise like radio broadcasting, etc., Antonioni was very daring. I remember how much it was in the time of the lack of acting skills of non-actors Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin. This time Frechette did not worry me. Halprin is weaker, but is gradually improving as the film continues. Most student riots look like a footage for me. One image is in a different aspect ratio and is distorted by a wide-screen image. Of course, real scenes appear, but not so much. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to find out how Antonioni made some of the Frechette's shots. Looks like he really did some flying - there are no blue screens or doubles in some clippings. I hope to return to see the movie again. Recommended for all fans of Antonioni.
