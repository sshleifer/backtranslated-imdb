Personally, it's one of my favorites all the time! no, I'm not 10 .. I'm 30! I own an old, original VHS from the fact that I bought it from a tenant shop. I've seen it countless times .. <br /> <br /> Although it's a funny movie for kids, it's an interesting adult movie. As soon as I saw this movie, I was not ... sober. my eyes were opened with things I had never noticed before. I have seen the strong encouragement of morality, apparently, somewhat subliminally. I wish I remembered all the things I have noticed especially, but since then it has been a long time ago. Make sure there are a number of things that are mentioned throughout the movie. if you have the opportunity to see it .. it's not sober .. so, you will not be disappointed .. in fact, you will probably feel rather happy and warm. <br /> <br /> Unique and Wonderful!
