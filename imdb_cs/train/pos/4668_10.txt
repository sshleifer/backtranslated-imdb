This movie is now appearing on digital television at least once a month, watching it a dozen or more times, and it has never made me happy. If it were tomorrow, I would look again. Such art is Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, the two great magicians of the acting profession, who helped in the sharp support trio of Karel Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley. Do not forget about others in less important roles. A simple story, to put it simply, about ex-con, dear embezzles, fighting and hurrying with the then "technology of the new age," ie, affection in the process. Even if it is tad (tongue in the face) unlikely, even incredible, characters are not. There is no violence, no sex, no bad language, and no worse method of action that is so widespread today. Great lessons by modern filmmakers about how to make a great show and virtually nothing ... except excellent talents.
