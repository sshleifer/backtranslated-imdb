Brilliant overexposure to Lesley Ann Warren. The best dramatic hobo lady I've ever seen and love the scene in the clothes store are second. Corn on the face is classic, as good as anything in the Blazing Saddles. Interest in lawyers is also excellent. After being accused of being cloaked, selling his boss and being dishonest, Pepta Bolt's lawyer shrugged his shoulders indifferently, "I'm a lawyer," he says. Three Funny Words. Jeffrey Tambor, popular from Larry Sanders' later productions, is also fantastic as a crazy millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto. His character is much more sinister than usual. The hospital scene and the scene where homeless people attack the demolition site are classical. Look at the foot scene and the two great fighters fighting (one bleeding). This movie improves every time I see it (which is quite often).
