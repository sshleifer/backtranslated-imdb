I saw this movie in the worst possible situation. I've already done 15 minutes when I woke up to an international flight between Sydney and Seoul. I did not know what I was watching, but maybe I thought it was a movie of the week, but it quickly met the performance of an actress who played a young woman kidnapped by a child. The premise began to move and turn, I did not see that I had come, and to the end I was getting credits that I went through the in-flight guide to find out what I was just following. It turned out that I later discovered Do-yeon Jeon, who won the best actress in Cannes for a role. I do not know if the secret sun is typical of Korean cinema, but I'm in a DVD store to discover another.
