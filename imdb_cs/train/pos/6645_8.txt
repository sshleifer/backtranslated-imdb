A highly modern house in a wealthy neighborhood appears to be the cause of every bizarre (and deadly) behavior of every population. At least that's what Lara Flynn Boyle, Col Kennedy says. After a series of lethal incidents in a garage house, Col knew he had to give something. Mark-Paul Gosselaar also stars as a mysterious architect. <br /> <br /> My opinion: The house next door works due to Lara Flynn Boyle and the location (beautiful house) and stylish sets. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actress, not to mention totally stunning. She brings the credibility of her character and makes the film interesting. Without it it would fail. "It's so lively," says potential buyer with reference to the house. Yes, it's alive. But the story itself is not so much about it. <br /> <br /> Barring Boyle is the presence, not much is happening here because a huge amount of film is spent watching or waiting for how the house will affect its current owners. The results are predictable. But I still liked it. Cinematography gives the film a glossy look. 8/10 due to Boyle, the premise of the evil ultramodern house, location and cinematography, and setting decoration and wardrobe.
