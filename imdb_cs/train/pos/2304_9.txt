I thought this movie was very well done. In the mid-fifties, everything seemed accurate. She was well occupied and believable. I usually do not like this type of movie because they just have no depth, but I felt that this film got into the character and felt how they felt, you really got to know them and take care of them. He took me back to my youth and allowed me to recall more innocent time. You can enjoy this movie for both men and women and all ages. After the movie, I wished it was part two. I wanted to know what happened to Dani and her family. This movie must be classic. If you have not seen it, you should try to catch it when it's on TV or you rent it ...
