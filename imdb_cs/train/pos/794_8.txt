I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. I thought it was funny, sexy, painful and warm. Andie MacDowell's performance was nuanced and vulnerable. One time director of MacDowell did not make her beauty another character in the movie. The romance between Kate and her young man is beautiful and much is playing. Her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a balm in her life. Imelda Stalinson, who is an MVP in so many British films, is doing a great job in this work. There is some tragedy, but I think the film is ultimately rescued by brilliant acting, pure direction and funny writing. The quality of the movie is excellent and the music is good even though it is not available on the soundtrack.
