A very impressive documentary about the Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose work is largely based on ephemeral sculptures made from elements of nature. His work is made of stones, leaves, grass, ice, etc., which blow out when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows on the field. So most of Goldsworthy's works will not last, except for photographs or movies of what they were. Now, it can be said that Goldsworthy's works are a reflection of mortality or words that are in that sense, but it is not easier to say that what he does is just a fine art. And while the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter, demanding, often mentally unstable people who live in disturbed urban conditions, it seems that Goldsworthy is the opposite: a stable, low-cost, family-oriented person who loves nature and there is a small village in Scotland (of course, I'm sure these are the same reasons why some people in the art world have avoided finding his works bloated or superficial).
