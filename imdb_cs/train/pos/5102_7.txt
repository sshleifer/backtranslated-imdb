you do not mind what's happening now. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Debra Winger is always interesting, and although it was her earlier role, she is pretty good as Cissy, the girl from the wrong side of the track, lived in a trailer with Bud, (Travolta) just to get some time replaced Madolyn Smith as a rival. I agree with earlier reviews of Scott Glenn, he is used only for drawings, thrown into the mix to create tension; the story is predictable and conceived. Although I'm out of the East, many of us did not like "Saturday Night Fever" while having its moments, eternal stereotypes are out of criticism for this point. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing Debra Winger; she is still so kind and never had a Hollywood personality that we are exposed to too many actresses today. 7/10
