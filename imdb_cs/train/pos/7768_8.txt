This splendid turgid melodrama represents Douglas Sirka on his highest string. It avoids a grievous affliction of "all that heaven allows" and the crying sentimentality of "imitation of life," and instead of feverish anxiety and overheated tension. And of course it's all captured in the vivid Technicolor. The Cornball Story has something to do with the friendship between Rock Hudson and Robert Stack, who becomes a rival when Hudson takes on Lauren Bacall's affection, but who really is paying attention to the story? Dorothy Malone won the Best Academy Award for her outstanding performance as Stack's Sister, who will take family business into her own hands when no one else is. The highlight of the movie comes when this wild child plunges into the dense dance in her bedroom, unable to bear the obstacles that make her the middle class honesty. As is often the case in Sirk, the scene is inadvertently cheerful in its absurdity and yet strangely moves in its effectiveness. Sirk came closer than anyone else to become a clean high-arts camp, and satisfied Philistines and high eyebrows at the same time in the same films. His talent was unique and I do not know that ever since, someone else's filmmaker has been alike. <br /> <br /> Grade: A-
