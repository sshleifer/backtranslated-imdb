Garde à Vue must be seen a few times to understand his sub-plots. If you are not accustomed to French word films, based on interviews and the battle of reason, rather than on action, do not even try to watch them. You get boredom to death and make sure that French movies are not for you. <br /> <br /> Garde à Vue is a speech based mainly on dialogue (which, among other things, written by Audiard), cruelly reduces the veil of appearance. Why does Maître Martineau (Serrault) prefer to be unjustifiably accused of being a child murderer rather than telling the truth? Because at the time of the murder he had an 18-year-old girl with whom he had an eight-year-old sexual relationship. His wife knows it, she is jealous and will be executed (in 1980, France was still the death penalty), rather than revealing the only "clean and innocent" aspect of her pitiful life.
