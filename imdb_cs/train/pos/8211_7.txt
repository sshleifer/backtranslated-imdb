I have never seen the original dirty Harry, I've judged this film on a clean shale. And I must say I liked it. Certainly, some of the acting director Sondre Locke made me a bit squeemish - but hey, it was 80s. But even if you could not get it (and almost could not) or her revenge to kill (which looked a little bit exaggerated, P), it's worth Dirty Harry. Or at least a bull dog that loves to call "MeatHead": P <br /> <br /> 7/10.
