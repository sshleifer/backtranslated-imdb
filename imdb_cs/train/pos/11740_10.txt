I have no doubt that they criticized this film, especially artists who need laxatives. This is a great car movie in the tradition of Abbot & Costello or Don Knotts recently. He will not shake the world nor change movies forever. What he does is have fun. When everything is said and done, it is the most important thing. Watch this movie and forget about your troubles. He even has a simple and nice moral message without additional charges. By the time I lived in LA, I've always loved Elvira's TV show. She did not really buy it from Vampires more than Vampire from the original Thedy Bars. This kind of mythical figure belongs to the one who does the best; & Cassandra Peterson does it the best. For a long time Elvira lives; we need more of these films. It's never enough. The vile, William Morgan Sheppard, was also excellent. It radiates wonderful refined anger. I did not find any technical errors. Execution is as impeccable as it gets into the form of art. My deep compliments to director James Signorell and the entire crew.
