First of all, you would like to see this movie as your typical western film, but it turned out to be very interesting and kept me magical until the very end, which turned out to be very unusual. Charlton Heston ("Sam Burgada"), "Midway", "76, had experience with James Coburn (Zach Provo)," Deadfall "," 93, and Zach never forgave Sam and stopped in nothing to make sure with him and paid him back. Unfortunately, Barbara Hershey (Susan Burgade), "Portrait of Mrs.", "96, managed to get into this situation and found herself among the sexless hungry men who never left her alone." Sam Burgade had to make some very difficult decisions quite surprised when I did it. It was a very entertaining film and the acting was excellent.
