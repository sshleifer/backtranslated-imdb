I do not know much about Rat Packu, and Frank Sinatra always seemed to me a little confidently full of myself. So when I call this one of my full-day photos, it has nothing to do with the mentality of honor. As another reviewer says, Mad Dog Time is about symbolism, not about realism. It's Kafka (a pity that Kyle MacLachlan is probably the weakest of a powerful crowd when he was as good as Josef K), it's stylish, conscious, sardonic and smooth. Jeff Goldblum moves around different characters, trying not to shoot and shoot, but to try to keep up with what he knows and not others, with whom he can root out and who can not. Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss (his best performance) have a ball and a supportive face look spot-on. Symbolism, setting (one outdoor move shot with Jeff Goldblum on the stairs looks really weird after so many rooms), dialogue (style, not practicality, it's the order of the day), it's all about attitudes, not really gangsterism. Fun watching has to be fun. What critics do is really a secret ...
