It's great to see Jorja Fox in a role where he smiles a lot. She also liked to hear her singing. A nice change has seen her from her CSI / West Wing / ER roles. The film itself was fun, but it seemed to omit some explanation in many parts. Several characters seemed to be unhappy with one minute and another happy, and it was left to your imagination to find out why. Each character was strange and in some cases I could not wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next. This movie was not full of dirty, clean people, but rather complicated, realistic people who could make mistakes, feel bad and then find a way to fix them.
