As a 40-year-old urban explorer / photographer and long-time fan of the original Kolƒçak series: A Night Stalker from my early childhood, one of the aspects not really mentioned, is the amount of city exploration that Carl took during the series. He has always managed to get into one big abandon, a canal or a tunnel after another. Armed only by his faithful light (fine, so he had some flares in the primary monkey episode tunnel) and his camera, he never carried any other gear to protect himself or to facilitate exploration. <br /> <br /> Like many here, I recently bought a set of DVD boxes from two pilot films and subsequent TV episodes and I slowly returned to all the shows. And even though I remember watching them back in the early 1970s when they first broadcast, more than 30 years have passed ... so many of them are showing up again. Camps, dated and cheese-filled - but charming and very entertaining. They just do such things today. Now it's all pervading spin-off with predictable characters and land. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, my 16-year-old daughter sits down watching episodes with me and developed awards for them (she has a genre). It gives me hope and confidence that the series will continue on the next generation of fans for the coming years.
