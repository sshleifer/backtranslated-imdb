Those who are not familiar with Cassandra Peterson's alter-ego Elvira, then it's a good place to start. <br /> <br /> "Elvira, Lady of the Darkness" begins with our heroine with a gravitationally resisting breast, message. Her great aunt appears to have died and to be present for reading the will. Trying to get the money for a show he wants to open in Las Vegas, he decides to go in the hopes of getting a lot of money. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the place to go is Fallwell, Massachusetts. She must remain a spell for breaking a car and find that her great aunt has left her three things: a house, a dog, and a cook. City residents have mixed reactions: teens like her, women hate her and men long for her (though they try to stay the moral pillars of the community). Her worst problem is her big uncle Vincent (W. Morgan Sheppard) because she wants her cook. It looks like a cookbook is a book of spells that makes it a more powerful warlock. The film is really fun because Peterson aka Elvira uses his "queries" and sexuality as a joke ("And do not forget tomorrow we will show our heads with two things ... think with two heads"). Especially entertaining like Edie McClurg as Chastity Pariah, the woman who works the most to keep the city in harmony but ultimately looks ridiculous (Picnic scene is a perfect example). She deserves a look (a movie, not her breast, of course).
