Sunday would not be Sunday without an action movie, and if you want an intense fight, you turn to Tom Berenger (Platoon). Here is a sniper in the jungle and goes after insurgents and drug gentlemen. Life is a bitch, so she gets a green office type (Billy Zane) to help on a mission. The film is in the hands of Luis Llose, who destroyed Anaconda. Here it is not much better, but Berenger makes the film for it. <br /> <br /> Sure, it can be a bit long - who wants to see a lot of jungle walks, but it's good, tense action when the time is right.
