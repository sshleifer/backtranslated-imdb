I'm not a fan of newer movies, but it was really a pleasure to watch. Adults and children could look together - how unusual! My aunt liked her too. She had laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors - and a talking parrot. It reminded me of the favorite, The Wizard of Oz. The hero, Paulie, the intelligent parrot, is separated from his home and family and goes through many adventures, temptations and disappointments, always remembering his decision to find his friend Marie. Highly recommended.
