Before I get started, let me tell you how great it can handle this special sound when playing Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's cut at the same time (especially at the Red Mountain level). So when I look at this stand-up strange, I suggest ... no, please do that. Carlos Mencia got to the extreme in San Francisco, California. There is joy of all with absolutely no excuse. Thank God that Carlos did not do his thing in which he uses the same joke over and over again and again and again. again. It does a tremendous job that makes everyone happy and at the same time it is true; I know several times what I said after Carlos said the joke: "Damn this guy is a good point!" And then the Game Over screen came through my TV because I forgot to play Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut. My bad :) So yeah, there is nothing to complain about this stand-up special. If you have TiVo or something like that, do a favor and record this historic hour.
