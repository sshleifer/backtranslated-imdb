I remember watching as a child in the UK, enchanted by the story and story of Laurence Olivier. On the second day, we should not talk about anything else. I imagine the evaluation for the first performance was huge. This is simply the best of the most complete documentary series, though they had to cut the story down to the bones they could capture so much. Interestingly, battles from Britain and North Africa were key, but Americans are widely unrecognized. The series depicts the rivalry between Mountbatten and the American generals, the suffering of German troops on the Eastern Front, the poor treatment of Japanese war prisoners by US troops. Images of the Holocaust from my family, a non-Jewish European, I feel guilty forever in dealing with the Jewish people. I do not know why this is not the number one in the IMDb ranking. Maybe they are biased towards documents. Spoiler - we win.
