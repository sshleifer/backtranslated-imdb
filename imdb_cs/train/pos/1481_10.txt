Nowadays some people do not see a movie without a movie style, so Dogma, Lars Von, Watchosky Brothers will change what we expect in the movie, maybe, Casomai is none other than an independent-American film, the film takes all the film sources and language to tell us a simple story about love and marriage, but much more .. Fully from the point of view, lectures and let's think ... and I'm sure you can not get exhausted every second for 116 minutes. I do not think they have one scene longer than 3 by 2 1/2 minutes.
