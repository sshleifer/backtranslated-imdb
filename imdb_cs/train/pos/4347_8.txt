I will not go too much about the story of this film as other reviewers have covered almost the same reason. Just wanted to say I really liked the movie. Peter Falk's performance alone is a good reason to watch the movie. A small movie trip with the Falk & Paul Reiser filter in the past NY in autumn is setting for most of the action in the movie. <br /> <br /> Very well written with adult target audience in mind. Lots of realistic humor and some well-played drama give the film the feeling it can be your own family. We really can not say about this movie enough that it's a damn shame that a beautiful movie like this will not get more exposure, while the other junkies do not do there. It's great to see Falk with the big lead man role again and he's making the most of it. This proves that his famous friend and writer / director John Casavettes was right when he revealed Falc in many of his top 60s and 70s.
