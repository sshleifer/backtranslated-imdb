I know some people think the movie is boring, but I do not agree. It is a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person. I liked the characters in the movie, and I thought that leaving part of Archie's life of mystery caught his humanity. I do not think that the purpose of good biography should be to detail someone's life, rather the complexity and relationships that make them interesting. And what's fascinating than someone so successfully reappeared? "Men become what they are dreaming - well, you were dreaming." Good work in front of Lord Attenborough. I also wanted to mention that Nathaniel Arcand actually performed as a charismatic actor and I hope to see him in more films.
