I went to Deathtrap and waited for a well organized and interesting thriller; and although it's like the movie; I can not help but I think he's just a poor man Sleuth. The classic 1972 film is probably the inspiration for this film; especially as regards land, but it is certainly in case of execution. Casting Michael Caine in the central role just confirms it. The film is based on Ira Levin (previously written by Rosemary's Baby and The Stepford Wives) and focuses on Sidney Bruhl; a playwright whose best days are behind him. After his latest bombs, Sidney found himself at a low level; and it's not helped when the game called Deathtrap; the written amateur he taught will come to his threshold. Deathtrap is a commercial success and Sidney will soon begin clearing up his own plot; which includes an invitation to an amateur scribe, his killing, and the subsequent deepening of Deathtrap as his own work. Despite all their clever twists and turns; Deathtrap falls on one primary element, and these are characters. The film can not provide a single pleasant character and it is very hard to take care of the story when you are not rooted for any of the players. This is not helped by actors. Michael Caine brings you a good and fun performance as you would expect but no one else boasts. Christopher Reeve is unpleasant in his role, while Dyan Cannon is somehow able to create the only possible character that could be honest with a sincerely irritating performance. It's lucky the story is good; and it's just good enough to store the movie. There are plenty of twists and turns on the plot; some work better than others, but there is always plenty to make sure the movie stays interesting. Director Sidney Lumet deserves credit because the style of the film is another big plus. The central location is interesting in itself, and cinematography is well suited to the film. Overall, I must admit that I liked this film; but it could be much, much better.
