When you encounter the gem of such a film, you will realize why the 1980s were the biggest decade. Rock music reigned, just like films ... especially horror films. The filmmakers knew how to have fun, and "Trick or Treat" is obvious. When rocker Sammi Curr, which was probably written after W.A.S.P. singer Blackie Lawless, died in a hotel fire, his fan of Eddie # 1, is upset. He goes to a friend and local dj Nuke (Gene Simmons) for support. Nuke gives him a copy of Sammy's last recording; this is the only available copy. It was given to the radio station to play the live Halloween night. When he plays Eddie, he brings Sammy somehow. He helps Eddie get bullied at school, but then he gets out of control. It's definitely one great movie. The bad thing is that this movie is printed. I paid $ 25.00 to finally get off eBay. You should also ... $$ well spent!
