I've never been a fan of Farrah Fawcett ... Until now. She was really amazing in this movie. The emotional feelings they had to go through after re-taking are not interested. It was a very hard movie to look at, the subject is definitely unpleasant and you feel so helpless, just sitting and looking at an abused woman for what looks like eternity. In fact, I felt that the whole thing had snapped off when her friends returned to the house, and I found no end to the conclusion in any way. The director seemed very interested in using heights in his footage and loved mirror reflections, I believe he should pay more attention to the pace in the second half of this work. I'm sure he's doing heck of a powerful theater, this movie for me, though it's credit, just shortened.
