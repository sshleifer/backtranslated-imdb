This movie is truly original and random. It's really hard to find films like Hollywood movies. I'm really watching this movie, I bought this DVD on Tuesday this week and I watched it 4 times. I love Spanglish's Pazu accent, it's really cute as it is. And her acting and Morgan are so fun and natural. My movie taste may be really different than others, but I have to say that I really love this movie, simple is the best! <br /> <br /> I learned more about life from this film (well, or at least life in the USA) ... life is really random ... Sometimes you meet someone, they go through their lives and they will be your friends, have spent so much time with them, perhaps only a moment, but enjoy it "while" with them, and then ua never meet each other but the time u are together really unforgettable. Only those moments in your mind are grateful and nice memories ... <br /> <br /> This movie may be cheap in the cost of making, but its meanings are not completely cheap. I can rarely learn anything from the movies, but that's an exception.
