Jim McKay has made one of the best movies you can see all year round. The silent simplicity of this movie attracts you from the initial shot and never leaves. No fake note is in the movie. No. Everything works. Handheld camera never breaks and should always be. The three young ladies whose lives we follow are always real. There is no single beat, where the audience is reminded that we are watching the actresses who play the role. only real girls who are trying to find themselves. There is no political agenda, hidden or otherwise. This is the most basic cinematography, and although it is likely to be seen only by a handful of film visitors, it deserves a much wider release. special hats by Hugh Hefner for providing filmmakers with the money they need to get this important film. I can not wait to see what Mr. McKay is doing.
