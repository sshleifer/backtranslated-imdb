Surviving Christmas is a surprisingly funny movie, especially with regard to poor publicity when it was released for the first time. Ben Affleck is funny as an unpleasant millionaire who pays out to a family who will take his family to his children's home for Christmas. He then drives a family crazy with overindulgence for Christmas cheering. In the past, I was not a fan of Ben Affleck (although I liked Daredevil and Paycheck), but here he is well worthy of this role. I also like Christina Applegate as a daughter in a family who can not first build Affleck's character. Make sure you see where this movie goes, but you do not care. Ignore what critics say and rent this movie out there because it's more fun than lots of Christmas movies.
