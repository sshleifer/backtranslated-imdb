It's one of those films that they have promoted too much. If you are watching TV, then you could also watch the movie. Almost all fun scenes are spoiled in the previews, except for one that just happens that Jennifer Annisten is funny. It's a typical Jim Carrey humor and it's really funny. Just do not look because this movie is expecting a surprise. Overall, if you like Jim Carrey or comedy, you have to see it, otherwise you can just watch the previews and you'll be just as happy.
