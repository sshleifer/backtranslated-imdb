This was one of the DVDs I recently bought in a set of six titles called "Frenchfilm" to find our French before the planned holiday in beautiful Provence this year. Meanwhile, just like improving our French, we have greatly strengthened our appreciation of French cinematography. What breath of fresh air to obsolete,. What a good example of scriptwriters, actors, directors and cameramen who follow. It was also stimulating to see two identifiable characters in the main roles without having to be the glossy numbers of magazine covers. <br /> <br /> The second thing I had in this movie was the slow figure and plot that guessed how it all ended. Is there any real good in this selfish burglar who constantly treats his seemingly naive benefactor with the kind of contempt that would be ex-con? Will our sexually frustrated, poor flocks be half-hearted to prove the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has given her? The audience is interested in these questions, and the actors reveal the answers slowly and convincingly when faced with the events they create and shape their feelings toward themselves. Once you've seen this movie, just like me, you might want to see it again. I still have to solve the psychological motive of the director for the partial conspiracy as a protector, and some of the fine shades of camera work are behind the other. This conspiracy requires some fantasy when our hero gets a chance to help our abused and redesigned hero in the office. You must also be very thoughtful to believe in her great lip reading and how to do something. But if you go along with this exciting journey with this example of French cinema at best you will be more than satisfied. Four stars of five for me.
