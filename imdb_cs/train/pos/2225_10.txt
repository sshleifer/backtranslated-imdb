I am absolutely shocked that this show has been canceled. The only one took only one year. I recently started watching her and I love her. Her show, which could go so far as the Friends went. She had a good humor and was very pleasant. <br /> <br /> It's about 2 brothers and 2 sisters living under one roof without their parents. Kurt (Joey Lawrence) plays the role of the eldest sibling and becomes a paternal role. <br /> <br /> It took more than a year because it was fantastic. An amazing show with all the best actors. <br /> <br />
