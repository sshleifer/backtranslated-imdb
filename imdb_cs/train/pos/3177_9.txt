Adam Jones has a great sense of humor. I did not like this movie. Cross Eyed was beautifully shot. Adam does a great job not only to develop the main characters, but also smaller characters. <br /> <br /> Cross Eyed gives hope to every low-budget movie. That you do not have to spend a lot to create something worth paying attention to. There is something for everyone. If you had a terrible roommate. if you ever picked up at a high school dork. if you ever parked anywhere in the city. if you have any sense of humor at all, you will love this movie. This is a type of movie that will be around for a long time and will end again once Adam has a bigger name for himself. I look forward to Adam's future projects.
