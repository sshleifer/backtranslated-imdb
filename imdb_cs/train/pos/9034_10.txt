This movie was absolutely brilliant !! Every performance in this movie is great, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. It looks like Mr. Gyllenhaal will have a huge film career, if it's something we can go for. I thought Joe Johnston was a special director because he is usually associated with large budgets (Jumanji, Honey I shrunk children). Draws from every scene with a complete class. My favorite scene was where Homer went down into the mine shaft and looked down at the sky, going down because all his dreams were, it was beautiful. Joe Johnston should drive more of these great acting movies, as well as his Big Budget Blockbuster faire, which is also excellent. GLORY!! to all those involved in this masterpiece!
