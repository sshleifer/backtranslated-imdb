The first week in May each year brings memories of the Holocaust through films on television. Of the many movies I showed, I did not see this. The story is about Hilter's life and how he got to power. It begins with childhood and ends up holding Germany's highest position of strength. The film was previously introduced as a TV series and later converted to film format. Scottish actor Robert Carlyle plays Adolf Hitler with great courage, conviction and excitement to give him a real picture of this man. It is a good script and narrative that educates the audience about the major events that lead Hitler into power, and also tries to show the likely psychological composition of Hitler. Is the film a curious look at director Christian Duguay? who will show Hitler as a one-time, threatening, angry and shouting person? which had so strong influence on the Germans and the people around them. Hitler is not portrayed as someone with charishma and attraction, and there the film can not convince Hitler's portrait. Though the business was for television, all the production components are first class and on par with any major stream movie. Production value, sets, costumes, etc. They were perfect. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of criticism about the authenticity of the events that are presented. Still, the film is grasped, everybody is pilgrimage and entertaining. Robert Carlyle survives and controls the screen as no one else does. Is he amazingly good? brilliant! I would like to see a more balanced view of Hitler's life because I think that Hitler was able to bring about the calm feelings of millions of Germans, and it is not just someone who should be blamed for the Holocaust. As I said several times, did not I? very unfortunately - our company loves the ceremony or the prosecution of one person as a representative of the company of good or evil.
