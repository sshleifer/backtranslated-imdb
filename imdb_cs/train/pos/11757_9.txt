Robin Williams and Kurt Russell play boys in their 30s who are threatening marraigas by making decisions (Russell somewhat reluctantly) to return to their heart afterwards. Williams is fine, but Russell is great as Taft's legendary coach, Remo Hightower. Holly Palance makes a nice and attractive turn as a Williams woman who could live without this rematch. The film is worth watching to see the famous Rem in action. Highly recommended.
