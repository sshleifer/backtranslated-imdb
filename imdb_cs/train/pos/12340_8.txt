There is a lot to complain about this film version of Molnar's mystical game - Farrell looks good in the title role, but his reading line, sincerely, smell. It also suffers, for the most part, from being credited as the first film that uses the rear projection. Files look fake. <br /> <br /> There are two great powers in this show, however: though the dialogues are lurking, the visual performances are perfect. Rose Hobart, like Julie, remembers today very little: mostly for ROSE HOBART, in which Joseph Cornell interrupted EAST OF BORNEO's programmer to simply record it: faithful Melford's style visual direction of the original. Her spectacular beauty and simple (though terrible) performances help repair some of the damage to the terrestrial stretches of this film. One of the themes of Borzage, however, is the mystical power of love, and it is the manipulation of the heavenly parts that do so, from the arrival of the celestial train to the "hot spot". H.B. Warner's performance is as perfect as ever. <br /> <br /> So here's a mistake, but a very interesting version. I think Lang's version of 1934 is better, as well as the heavenly scenes in the version of Henry King CAROUSEL, a ruined musical remake. But I still enjoyed this version and think you should give her a chance.
