The Gibbons Chady (2002) is a gentle, sad comedy in an ethnically diverse community near Heahthrow Airport in West London. <br /> <br /> Just like the planes that are constantly coming in and out of overheads, we watch the ups and downs of two main characters Jess Bhammer (Parminder Nagra) and Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley) when they encounter unlikely friendships focuses on their mutual passion for football and their technical passion with David Beckham. <br /> <br /> Much of the comedy comes from the misunderstanding of the two talented girls' families because they violate all the expectations and conventions of their very different family environment. Somewhere in the middle, as a broker (Jonathan Reece-Myers), team coach for Hounslow Harriers, he is interested in the crisis and at the same time remains the main attraction of both main characters. <br /> <br /> Finally, and not without many obstacles and triumphs on the way, we finally see our devoted and beloved football heroes who have avoided realizing their dreams. With brilliant performances from Bollywood veteran Anupama Khera (Bhamra), Shaheen Khan (Mrs Bhamra), Juliet Stevenson (Paxton) and Frank Harper (Paxton), this is really a film that captures the urgent passion for adolescence and crosses all ethnic boundaries. Pinky Bamrha (Archie Panjabi) and (Taz) Trey Farley are fighting for their own struggle, but they still make a major contribution to understanding the main characters in the film. In his special way, this film tells an important story, random football. Celebrates the development of the understanding of ordinary people in ordinary families and the inborn ability of young people to teach the old.
