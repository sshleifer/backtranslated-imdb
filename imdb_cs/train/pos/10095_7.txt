My parents took me to the movie when I was nine years old. I never forgot about it. I've never seen anything as beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor before. (She was twenty-two when she did the Elephant Walk) Remember, I'm nine, so feelings are not sexual, I just did not see anything on the screen. I just wanted to sit at my feet like a puppy and look at her. She started showing her age (she is nearly seventy-four), but I still think she's one of the most beautiful and delightful women ever to have lived. I've seen the movie several times because it's a sappy melodrama. What it saves is, of course, the beauty of Miss Taylor, beautiful scenery, a very impressive climbing of elephants and a well-created point about human arrogance in the face of nature. Overall well - spent a few hours watching a movie channel or a leased video.
