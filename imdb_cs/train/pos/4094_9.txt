For anyone who has just seen Disney Productions a beautifully animated version of "Beauty & the Beast" or even a surrealistic wine fairy tale, Jean Cocteau will be quite surprised by this French version (but with a director from Poland). This conspiracy concerns a French family of faded aristocracy who marries a well that makes an English family. The main catch is that the bridegroom carries an old curse on the family. The film also includes a series of follow-up sequences (potentially) explaining this family curse. From start-up credits to the very end, it's almost a non-stop erotic fun ride home, with very explicit and graphic sexual content (from now on, it's a movie rating X in the US in its initial run, which is now unrated). The film is a somewhat contemptuous sentiment in the ruling class, probably recalling one of the cellular flights to a similar territory. If you have a taste for really bizarre and not offend "taboo" material, then this movie can just scratch that itch for you.
