Unlike some people summaries, women in the film are not geisha. They are prostitutes living outside the most famous entertainment districts and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a large number of women Tokugawa era. I can not say that the stories were particularly instructive, but their charm is how they are typical. Topics are universal and everyday: love, friendship and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I really liked art and acting. I had the feeling that I had seen time and a place I could never see. The actors, especially the four women who played the main oiran, were excited. I recommend this film only to people who want to taste Japanese culture or to those who like quiet and emotional stories. It's a great example of both.
