Overall, a good film and a better story about the film not being told can remain hidden for the masses. Brosnan does a good job as a native American with a hidden past and shooting is amazing. Someone can be too moody, some boring - it's a gentle, well-known story for me and perfect for family viewing. Now it's not something you've got recently.
