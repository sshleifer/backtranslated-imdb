One of John Ford's best films, "The Informer", does not contain any spectacular scenery of the American West. Instead, Ford's intense drama track was known to play actor Victor McLaglen on the least developed terrain of the face of British character. The former winning team, which once faced Joe Louis in a circle, brings in the worst night of his life awards won by the Academy, the inherited IRA soldier Gypa Nolan. The act is amazingly simple: In 1922, Dublin, a starved and humiliated man who was fired from the IRA for not being able to kill the informant in cold blood, became an informant himself. For 20 pounds mature friend Tans and for the rest of the day he drinks and distributes his blood money in rapidly changing convulsions, denial, self-pity, and desperate desire to escape the consequences of his action. <br /> <br /> It is a remarkable complexity given by the seemingly simple Gypo, which is the most impressive success of the film. In most of the films, the Gypo pile would be heavy, should have two or three rows, and be quickly discarded to allow the hero and villain to show off their showdown. In The Informer, Gypo himself is both a hero and a villain, while the showdown is in his inner confusion, each bit being explicitly shared with the audience. Since the novel by Liam O'Flaherty was previously shot in 1929, RKO gave Ford a very modest budget. The director and his coworkers, especially cameraman Joseph H. August, used this to create a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man in war with himself. In addition to McLaglen's Oscar "The Informer," John Ford also won his first together with winning the best screenplay and best score.
