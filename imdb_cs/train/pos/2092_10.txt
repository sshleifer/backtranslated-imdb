I saw this movie with some curiosity. I wanted to find out if 1) Paul Muni could play Chinese and 2) Luise Rainer deserved the Oscar. I left the movie to think YES! When we saw Muni only in one movie where he was quite greedy, I expected the same performance here. I was happily trusted. Although some may criticize him as too childish and stereotypically simple in the Hollywood Asian thought, I thought he was right in this role. Keye Luke, if he had the chance to play the lead role, could play it basically the same way. <br /> <br /> I was particularly impressed by the camera and using crowd scenes, especially during the landing of the palace, where O-Lan was sometimes a slave. The graphic and dizzying atmosphere of the palace and drought made it an epic form that resembles the others at the same time when everything was shiny and shimmering. I have seen this movie from start to finish enchanted. I can not say the same about today's "epics".
