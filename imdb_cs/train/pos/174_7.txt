The sun, a cocktail waitress in the D.C. area, is somewhat dark to give it lightly. He controls an old clown and rents a small room from a homosexual couple. However, she will save the life of the prominent Arab, by having a bullet in her back that was intended for the official. He enjoys a national print with small notes and a sweet look. When he seizes the opportunity, the assistant to the president will install it in the US government protocol. Even then sometimes they break something, but they are trying hard and learning a lot. He even catches the romanian attention of a civil servant. But is there yet another sinister plot that includes an Arab man who wishes to marry another wife? Blonde? LOL, LOL, LOL. This film features Goldii as nice as a picture and as stupid "like a fox", as they say. The sun learns very well the path of the jungle of the US government. It even has important information about the integrity and lack of protocol. Perhaps the Arab community would be less enthusiastic about this work, but for those who like to laugh, they are renting them today.
