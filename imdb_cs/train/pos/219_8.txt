Shimon's carefully written dialogues are actually electrified by Matthew and Burns. You can literally hear the crack of the script. There are few films that can develop such a relationship between the actors and the screenplay. For example, the famous reunion scene could be much more reticent with lower-quality actors. It seems Matthau was born to play Willie Clark (of course Oscar moreso in Odd Couple) and with all the little idiosyncrasies and manners that Matthau puts in the character (a line where he claims to have been with him since then living in the city, while Lewis lives in the country that Lewis is "out of reach," is a typical example of that) making this one of the best performances I've ever seen of any actor in any role, whether it be comedy or drama or whatever. Time. Matthau and Burns work perfectly together; the contrast they display emphasizes Simon's great talent in creating a comic conflict. This film is just one of the most important "must-sees" and demands the right to a prestigious place on film history pages.
