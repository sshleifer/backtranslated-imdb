The director and the two LAURY stars (1944) were ready for this solid policeman: Dana Andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a police officer to bind all the past, but can not keep his inherited violent ways under suspicion, one night, goes too far; Gene Tierney is a stolen wife of his victim, a distinguished war hero who has become entangled with the culmination of the city and Andrews No 1 by nemesis, Gary Merrill (who was himself protected by Andrews Snr). As usual, with Preminger, this is a greatly created film with a remarkable initial credit sequence and animated good cast, including Karel Malden (as Superior Superior Andrews), Tom Tully (as Tierney's biker) Neville Brand (as Merrill's chief killer), with remarkable also supported by Craig Stevens (as a slim, wife-beating victim), Bert Freed (as Andrews compassionate partner) and Robert F. Nolan (as Andrews.) As he warned him to deal with his paths or elsewhere, Andrews Panic Stevens is released a few hours after the murder to send the police to Merrill (in this case), but after Tully becomes the main suspect (until Andrews and Tierney are romantically entangled), the cop is alone to Merrill's lair, who has the full intention of getting to the ground and "standing up" blackmailing for his murder! It's clear that the protagonist is a tricky cha rakter and Andrews come with a first-class feature that is typically complemented by the in-house Fox Noir style.
