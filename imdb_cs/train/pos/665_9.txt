"And Everything Over The House" is a special episode of the crypt not just because it's from the first season but this episode was the first I've ever seen! I remember that as a young man who was on holiday with my parents in the summer of 1989 in our hotel room in South Carolina on HBO, I saw this episode and I was buried in the crypt just then and forever! I've always been a fan of horror-tense series and I loved monster movies, and with this series that HBO started, I was afraid again. This episode was the first one I've seen is a sight for me and one of my favorites, it's so nice with a nice twist. "And Everything in the Home" has a nice cozy environment on a snowy Christmas Eve, which is the perfect way to relax for a holiday chop! Well, you have Mary Ellen Trainor (who, by the way, plays in warner brothers, usually small parts), as a greedy, jerking wife who takes care of her crap while waiting for some money and a new romance. Like most horror series, things turn to the worst and the bad people who deserve what they deserve. Chances are very accumulated when a maniac dressed as Santa escapes from the local house of nuts, causing a late holiday mowing on Christmas Eve! Just like the old lessons of E.C., you will teach bad people to get what they are looking for! But this story ends with a perfect recreational scream! Also this story was in the 1972 film and featured Joan Collins, it is undoubtedly one of my favorites and probably one of the classic episodes of crypts of all time!
