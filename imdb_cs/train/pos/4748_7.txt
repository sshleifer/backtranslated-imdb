The story would never win prizes, but that's not about it ... the script was simply fun and exciting to give room for incredibly choreographic combat scenes. Who needs a story with this fight? It's really worth watching just for this reason. If you can handle the gore, which is LOT ... none of that is realistic enough to make it hard to look at it. I gave her 7.
