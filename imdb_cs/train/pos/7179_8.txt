recalls the writings of Stephen King and the recollected childhood full of terror from stories like IT - as the exact opposite. There is no fear in these childhood things that one of the friends - who are still friends 20 years later - remembers or seems to suffer. On the line, everything is described as friendly quarrels, perhaps regularly described as "picking" one or more of them, but everything is forgiven. There is no movie * and engagement * and the participants in later life describe relationships - all we see are young people who grow up essentially the same person. Higher but essentially the same people and the same structure of power. Amazing! Not only because people can actually grow up relatively innocuous social conventions - but also that friendship can actually endure. In this respect, this film is a small pearl - as we suppose it was the intention of the film: A Portrait of Forced Emotions Who Bonded People. When seen in contrast to the films of later years depicting the darkness of childhood - it is what has become easier in the mind of a violent blocking of Bowling for Combine, but since the mid-1980s, along with the growing worship of children and the childhood of 1000s of commercials, animations and a series of films directed directly at children), several films and documents have been successful with reminiscing of the dark sides of growing up - abuse, loneliness, an effort to excel - leading to adults with dark and twisted minds. /> <br /> And here comes a movie that says: It's possible to have a happy childhood, look'a'here! <br /> <br /> Thank you. OR the illusion of counterweight ... <br /> <br /> 8/10
