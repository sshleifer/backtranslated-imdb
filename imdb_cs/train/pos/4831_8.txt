I went to the fact that I do not like it; I thought it would be terribly good and serious and rather fruitful and boring. In fact, it's much better than that, and I've found out that I'm really looking forward. I do not know much about Queen Victoria for what he knows best - he married Albert, who died young and she still mourned him. The sight of the circumstances that grew up was fascinating; in fact, I wanted to see another story, and I think at some point we see the sequel. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is overwhelming. Sets and costumes are incredibly adorable without being too dark and over the top. The actor is the pinnacle of all those involved. <br /> <br /> In a word it was great!
