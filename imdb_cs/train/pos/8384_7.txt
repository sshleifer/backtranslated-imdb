I read somewhere (in a fairly panning overview) that it's something of a live action mecha anime, and I think they are in the right place. For the first time, I watched this movie when I was very young and I was dying to see it again, and when I finally came up, all the memories came back. I do not think it should be taken too seriously - it's just a good thing about 80 years of almost television entertainment (it's against the backdrop of a rather dark future, though this point is not much emphasized much). What I most admired in this film was that the dialogue did not sound in general - no clich√©, no predictable lines - it's all good fun! Perhaps the time for this little film was not kind, but they still find me awards in me. In any case, it is not perfect, but it is fun and does not try to be anything else. Let the fools and the comic stores take care of the technical character - who cares about it? Look at yourself and decide. Nobody else thinks.
