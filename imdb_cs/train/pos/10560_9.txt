Jimmy Cagney is constantly looking around in this producer's story, which is struggling with upcoming "talking" movies. This story of love, deception, women, and dance is presented in such a way that as a viewer you will never be treated with a tedious moment. The direction of the bulk scenes in the test rooms has been extremely well done. The story never lost at this furious pace. Some parts of the material presented here are a bit dated, but it does not matter, because when you look at it in the time frame of 1933, it's wonderful to watch it alongside many other drags of the films released during this time. Jimmy Cagney is the sight of the painful eyes in this film, never losing his peace as a constantly working maker of thumbnails created for cinemas as intros. In this way, he tries to protect his butt from being excluded from business, before he started, was a broadway producer. Joan Blondell is wonderful as a neglected love affair, Nan gives such an impressive performance that is so unusual for the movies of that time, so it's great to watch a woman who is portrayed as a strong woman for change. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with the film was a huge production at the end. They were magnificent, beautifully choreographed and beautifully made, but they did not seem to be in the story. The only link to the main story is that Cagney had to give 3 views in 3 days to get a contract, and that's what he did. I had a hard time believing that it was what the girls had tried throughout the movie and that these sets could fit into the cinema. In this way, "Sitting On Backyard Fence" was much better suited for the story. Production at the end seemed to pull this frenetic transient story to stop, and it was not a good thing. I was tired after seeing the first music sequence, and then I realized that two more were coming. These sequences have received lots of laughter from the audience as well. <br /> <br /> A great movie with an acidic end. <br /> <br /> 9/10
