This is an excellent stand-up DVD! Eddie Izzard is the most fun person I've ever seen. His routine is cheerful and makes a great conversation with others who have seen her. HIGH I recommend this. Part of Europe's history is relatively slow, but the final jokes in French are pretty good because you do not have to speak French to get it (even if you do, it's still funny). Also the parts about being transvestite are quite good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not great, but it's funny for the first time. Skip them if you can. It's almost not worth watching. However, this is really a funny, funny stand-up show that everyone should see. "At that time I was dead!"
