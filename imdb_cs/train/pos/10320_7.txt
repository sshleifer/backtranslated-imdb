*** Possible Spoilers *** I recently watched this movie with an 11-year-old son and was pleased to see that he laughed at the right places and was thrilled with the events. Ron Ely is right as Doc. Cold, quiet, almost always under control (and with occasional flash in the eye). What more can you ask for? I have never read Doc Savage, so I do not know if he is faithful to the source, but I liked the light tone and exhaustion. Many people compared this movie to Raiders of the Lost Arch, which I do not think is fair. The difference in the budget is overwhelming (Raiders must have at least ten times the budget). Doctor Savage does not have a lot of work for Raiders. Special effects are also minimal, but they come to people, the story is a lot of fun and humor is right. Sousa's music is catchy (love this theme song - every time I watch the movie, I'm going to end up with the humming theme all day long). The best way to get closer to this movie is simply RELAX and enjoy it. The most important of these are the amazing beginnings, when the fabulous five and Docka chase an Indian sniper on New York's rooftops and a very entertaining combat sequence between Doce and Captain Seas. Not so good is a villain who sleeps in a giant bed (really!). Overall great movie you can watch on a rainy day. I'll give it 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Doctor Savage, Doc Savage ... thanks to Mr. He is here!
