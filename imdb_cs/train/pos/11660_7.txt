A beautiful piece of children's cinematography buried in the world of archaic celtics. Setting a story about the famous Kels book, believed to be composed of monks from the small island of Iona on the west coast of Scotland. He tells the story of a young disciple who goes to the woods in search of Crom-Cruic, a wild headless pagan mythologist. In the hope of recovering the lost artifact. The film's true beauty lies in its "animation". The cell is shadowy in a clear and inspiring style of deep complexity, making it look less straightforward. Based on the artistic style of the brilliant Samurai Jack series from Cartoon Network for his brilliant use of branding and background depth, Kels's secret creates a consistently affectionate Celtic world living in the shadow of the Viking invasion. <br /> <History may be extremely inaccurate, and the ways of life depicted by the lack of realism, but these facts are totally irrelevant because the film itself is formed in the world of fantasy and the Celtic mystic revivalist. The girl of the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion it does a picture of what it is like when it slips from branch to branch. It appears and disappears as a mysterious nymph with features reminiscent of the legendary Cheshire cat from Alice and Wonderland. <br /> <br /> The secret of Kels is absolute treatment. For all sexes, all ages, it's a beautiful piece of family cinema. Do not expect you to be amazed, but pleasantly amazed!
