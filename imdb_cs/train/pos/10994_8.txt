This is my first comment! This is a fantastic movie! I watched everything on TV at night. In the first 5 minutes I thought it was film B, but later I realized what a wonderful product it was. I suggested to my friends to see the movie just to tell me it was a bad B movie. How bad. Surface criticism. <br /> <br /> I think film is almost a product of genius! A well-known director has done a great job here, and it's a shame to say he was out of the box all of a sudden.
