I have not seen this movie for over 20 years, but I still remember it. The film was not made in color. Stark Gray is what he does, and was life so simple in the 1950s? What reminds me the most is that Perry Smith goes to the gallows. He was breathing under his hood just before he had trapped a trap. I do not think I could track it again ... there is a lot. It's like the unnamed guy at the beginning of "Papillon", which is in horror trapped in the guillotine. The guy who said that, watching it on a double bill with Dead Man Walking, had added the last 10 minutes "I Want To Live". Some of my ancestors were "aristos" going to the guillotine in 1794-95, so my feelings about the death penalty are rather intense.
