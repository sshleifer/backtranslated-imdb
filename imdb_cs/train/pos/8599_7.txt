It's 19 years since Gordon Gekko used Wall Street to tell us that greed is good. Now Michael Douglas will take over the GG staff and turn him into a Pete Garrison secret service agent. Guess what? It works! It's a solid political thriller that let me guess. Important work on displaying security measures taken by the SS on behalf of the President and the First Lady was also interesting. All the leadership was pretty good, but as I tried, I could not accept Eve Longoria as a secret service agent. While Jodie Foster just suspended your faith and really thought she was a FBI Starling agent in "Silence of the Lambs," you do not have the same feeling with Longoria. However, it is a fun movie, a fun getaway with Beltway as a background.
