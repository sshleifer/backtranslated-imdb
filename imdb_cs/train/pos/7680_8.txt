"Holly" is question-oriented, but neither manipulative nor too sentimental. In his heart, he is a film based on a character that would not be so successful without the portrayal of painted images of Patrick (Ron Livingston), lost souls with a gradual awakening of conscience and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), strong will, but eventually exaggerated young Vietnamese girl . From live places and shooting to effective editing, everything is straightforward and well done. The current classical scene may first omit, but it is a top composition and underscores the admirable restraint that is evident throughout the text. This film, which raises many questions but provides some clear answers, will eventually raise awareness of compassion and sympathy with Holly and many people involved with it. Kudos to those who managed to get it.
