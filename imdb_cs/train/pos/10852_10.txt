Hello, I was alanrickmaniac. I'm still Crazy-holic. It was just another movie I watched partly on TV. Then I had to get a videotape and finally find out how it ends. Then I wanted the DVD because after a few weeks the first signs of decay appeared on the tape. After DVD I had to put my hands on the soundtrack. Then on several film posters and film scripts. Right now it's worse that I try to get other people to become addicted to my web pages and Still crazy parties. <br /> <br /> How could this happen? What made me addicted? <br /> <br /> OK, it's one of those funny but somewhat sad and melancholic intelligent comedies that only Britons can produce. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie is a world separate from things like 'This Is Spinal Tap', because of characters that are not childish or super cool but real. It's a story about the men getting older. A story about how men are getting together. Or not. It contains some of the best actors. Tim Spall. Stephen Rea. Bruce Robinson. Jimmy Nail. And Bill Nighy. Bill Nighy, who has one of the best performances I've ever seen in the movie. Good soundtrack is incredible. Alien Mick Jones wrote songs for the imaginary group Strange Fruit. Jimmy Nail, who plays bass guitarists Les Wickes and Bill Nighy, representing the egocentric but unpleasant singer Ray Simms, is actually singing. We know about Jimmy Nail, but if you only heard Bill Nighy sing in "Love Actually," you have no idea how big and strong his voice is. <br /> <br /> Well, you will be feverish about every scene that comes at X-th time, especially on those concert stages. You would die if you could spend a dance crowd when Strange Fruit is doing "The Whole World" and sings at the top of your lungs. You want to cry and celebrate with thousands of people the rebirth of the real strange fruit at Wisbech's festivals. <br /> <br /> It's hard, but ... I'm addicted to this movie. I'm addicted to Strange Fruit. If there is a world in which this group actually exists, I would like to move there. <br /> <br /> Are you still crazy ... someone?
