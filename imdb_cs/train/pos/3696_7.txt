Although I live in Minnesota, I have been studying in France recently and I came across this bizarre jewel of the film. This movie was amazing, at least. A creative and unique film, different directors each wore something other than their interpretation of love in the city of light. The first instinct is to try to adapt each of these little stories to the overall storyline, as was true in 2003 with love. This attempt, however, makes the spell of each segment obsolete. When taken in nominal value, with each of the short segments captured as their own film, love stories together tell a beautiful message. The film is remarkably bizarre sometimes - often to the point of confusion - and every single segment can be difficult to watch. Yet, for an observer who pays special attention to each of the segments, short plot lines will become clear after a short time. Confusion is almost interesting; keeps you on the edge of your seat and is waiting for what's coming. He lets the viewer think, "Is that really true?" but it also leaves them satisfied that they actually happened. It's a kind of movie where the viewer, when he leaves a theater, can not really decide whether he loves or hates him. The initial reaction is to go and watch it over and over again just to bring these individual lives together in a masterpiece of film. An interesting decision to make a film multilingual adds something to the spectrum of people who can relate. It adds to the reality of the movie - here, American tourists speak English, French Parisians and so on. The number of people involved includes an understanding of the international language of love. From illness to supernatural, love of parents to the love of husbands, this film covers all the basics of romantic stories. In a beautiful and surprising way, each unique event will hit the story: all types, sizes, nationalities, and shapes of love.
