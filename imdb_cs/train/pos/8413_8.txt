A silly young man is obsessed with a woman - so obsessed with losing perspective and common sense. A wicked magician approaches him and informs him that he can give him the great wealth he can use to get the lady's heart if he agrees to give him everything he wants and that's in their room. The stupid guy agrees and the magician steals the man's reflection from the mirror - and as a result, bad things naturally occur. If this movie was made only ten years later, I'm sure it was not so good at reviewing and scoring the movie. After all, the movie's storyline is a bit vague in spots and acting is, sometimes, a little rising. However, when you think that in 1913 "full length" movies were rare - and often only 20 to 30 minutes! The whole idea of ​​a complicated story like the one you've got in this movie is very unusual - because the stories were very short and wide-ranging. So given the time constraints, this film is quite good and is one of the previously known horror films.
