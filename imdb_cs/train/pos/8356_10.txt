<br /> <br /> It's just a small but decisive thing that can be interesting: the boys steal the green Citroen in one place for the joy of riding, and return it to the owner who performed the purposeful and revengeful hidden damage to the car and hoped the owner would collapse. Is it the same car they steal much later from a picnic family? We know the original owner has sold them. They are leaving at the end of a dangerous road that I understand is closed to everyone except the pedestrians over the last ten years. The whole new tendency to the end of the movie. Otherwise, this movie could be called "Women's Fragrance". I do not remember another film, certainly not American, which treats the woman's scent so openly and openly, just like the "nose" of good Bordeaux.
