The story of the Martian attempt to colonize the Earth. (Things must be pretty bad on Mars.) Two state soldiers are investigating the scene of reported UFO accidents. Whatever landed, he was buried under the ice at Tracy's pond, but in the snow there are traces of snow leading to a nearby dinner. Dinner had no customers since the eleventh day. Now, several bus passengers sit around waiting for permission to pass a structurally weak bridge. The bus driver insists that six passengers are on board the bus, even though they have not noticed who they are. The problem is that there are seven people waiting for a renewal. One of them is a stranger, but which one? They are all suspects. There is, of course, the crazy old man (Jack Elam), who seems to be using the sub rosa joke. There's a vicious businessman who has to get to Boston (John Hoyt). Young couple on honeymoon. (Execrable performance of husband, Ron Kipling.) In addition to couples, no one else noticed. And even couples are suspicious of each other. Bride to the newly carved husband: "I could swear you got a mole on your chin." The story continues in a haunted but slightly haunted way - the phone rings for no reason, the lights turn on and go out, the box switches on - and none of it needs to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It's a very nice music set and the high revelation is worth laughing. There is no obvious "depth". It is not a moral report about the inhabitants who dress as ordinary citizens. It's no warning, just a fairy tale that reflects and entertains. I always like it when it is. It is especially interesting to see John Hoyt as an irritated and impatient trader because he knew that in 1954 he was a Roman senator who had assassinated Julius Caesar in Shakespeare's MGM. And here he is - with three shoulders. <br /> <br /> Oops.
