Let's just do it: My two children were stuck to this movie. It has its shortcomings from the perspective of adults, but buy some jelly worms and just enjoy them. <br /> <br /> And the Pepsi girl was great! <br /> <br /> And Kimberly Williams was pretty crazy, though there is not much in the movie, so she does not fit too much. <br /> <br /> No, that's not really a bad thing, but it's the one you watch only once. Do not buy a DVD. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it! <br /> <br /> Did I mention Kimberly Williams? (That was for Daddy).
