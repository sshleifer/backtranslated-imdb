When the first came, my father brought home - we were surprised - it was so different from what we had seen before. Last night I searched for a specific movie and again found "The Mind's Eye". Box breaks and I'm surprised the tape is still working! Although it's not a good graphics Finding Nemo, it's still very good. They should sell it again - it's a landmark for computer animation. Highly recommended! <br /> <br /> This is what it is: <br /> <br /> The "mind eye" is a magnificent odyssey in time. Your journey starts at the dawn of creation and moves with the rise of man and technique. Travel in the world of abstraction and into the future with breathtaking computer animations. <br /> <br /> "The Mind's Eye" joins the imagination of more than 300 talented computer animation artists in the world with powerful, original soundtrack music. This unique collaboration brings you an incredible journey into The Mind's Eye.
