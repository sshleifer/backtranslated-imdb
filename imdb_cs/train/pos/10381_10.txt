An earlier reviewer said it exactly. I saw it once, was fascinated, saw it the second time when it was re-broadcast during a week or two first broadcasts. I still remember some scenes. The meeting is the opening of the 20th century, the war listed in the title is World War I. One of the scenes was placed in the women's section, which was an interesting historical discovery. The moment one of the women first touches the other is one of my great feature film moments. I do not think of it as a "gay movie", it's an interesting and restless love story where there are two main women's principles. I would like to see this movie again; I'd buy this if it ever came out on DVD.
