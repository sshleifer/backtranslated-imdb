The words barely describe him so I will be brief. "Thief of Bagdad" was my favorite movie as a child and never surprised or interested me. I loved this movie from the first moment I saw it when I was the sixth boy who started reading "Arabian nights". I remember going to the TV room in the middle of Sabu's battle with a giant spider, and I was immediately charmed. Rarely, she has so much beauty, magic and miracles captured in the movie. Sabu and John Justin are excellent as a horrific hero, Conrad Veidt is very nice as the evil villain Jaffar and Rex Ingram is a joy to watch as a sardonic genie. Taking Georges Perinal is one of the best ways to use Technicolor. One of three award-winning directors is Michael Powell, a filmmaker who was a critic of criticism, but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films, including "The Mother of Life and Death," and "The Red Boots." one of the real camera masters, right there with David Lean, Akiro Kurosawa and Orson Welles. As with all the great works of art, the beauty of "The Thief of Baghdad" lies in detail. Every shot has its magic. The story never stays and characters and their actions are always involved. Here's a movie that never grows old.
