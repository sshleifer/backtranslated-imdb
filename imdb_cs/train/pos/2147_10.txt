I have lived in Tokyo for 7 months. Knowing the reality of long train rides, train rides, soup stalls and other typical scenes that are so well-liked, certainly added to my own awards for this movie, which I really love. There are aspects of Japanese life in this film painted with vivid colors, but you do not have to speak Japanese to enjoy this movie. Suo's tricks were largely subtle; I found his emphasis on Tamako Tamura with a soft filter that became exquisite, a bit a little fancy, but most of the director's tricks were so subtle that I was fully drawn and danced with his characters. Or she was crying. Or he laughed out loud. Great. A +.
