Ok - I'll confess. I think Kenny Doughty looks amazing in this movie - but in addition to his good looks, the film is carried by a predictable but reasonable conspiracy. <br /> <br /> We are starting to introduce ourselves to the three main filmmakers. One director - very concerned about her image and never married. The policeman - with a child and a bad former deal. The third - a hungry doctor with power and standing with a desire for recognition and three ex. They are almost the "Club of First Spouses" and indeed there are plenty of word wraps ex, "letting credit card behavior". The characters of McDowell, the director, arrive late at the funeral - where a young organist who fills a regular player (Doughty) captures it. What will her two friends tell her about the following misfortune? Will they live happily ever after? Tissue or two recommend if you are a type of tear - end uplifting, but perhaps not what you would expect. Overall, it's a great movie that stands out among the current possibilities of action, special effects and horror horror.
