Certainly it does not have to be a classic, but it's one full of classic lines. One of the few movies that my friends and I are quoting all the time, and it's about fifteen years later (maybe it was on Cinemax too many times!) Michael Keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie - he can not seem to figure out how to play but is surrounded fantastic occupations who know exactly how to play this spoof. Are you looking for a movie that makes you cheerful? This is it, but it borrows it with friends - it will be even better.
