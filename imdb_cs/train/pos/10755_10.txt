A great documentary about the life of firefighters in NY during the worst terrorist attack of all time. This reason in itself is the reason why it should be seen collectible items. What shocked me not only with attacks but with "high fat" and physical the appearance of some of these firefighters. I think many doctors would agree with me that in the physical shape they are in, some of these firefighters would NOT REDUCE the 79th floor and carry more than 60 pounds. I said that I now have more confidence for the firefighters and I realize that he has become a firefighter is a life-changing work. French have a great documentary in the past, and this is a great documentary .....
