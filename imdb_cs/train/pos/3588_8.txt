When I saw this movie, I was amazed that it was just a television movie. I think this movie should be in theaters. I've seen a lot of movies about rape, but it's great. This film has some realism, which is very rarely seen in film films, let alone in movies. He tells the story, which is very realistic in many small towns today for many victims of rape, and found it very plausible (which is hard to find in other rape films). I also thought that Tiffani Theissen and Brian Austin Green were amazing in the parts they played. I definitely recommend this film to anyone who likes movies that have a bit of harsh reality. I really liked it.
