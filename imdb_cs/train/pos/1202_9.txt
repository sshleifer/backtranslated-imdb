I really enjoyed this documentary about Kenny and Spencer's attempt at "The Dawn". It was a great look at how aliens are trying to get in to make it big. <br /> <br /> The story was well set up and arranged in an interesting way that made the film well flowing. Surely worth the attention. My only complaint is that they did not seem to be closed. Maybe that's part of this point. We expect this, but in reality it is not what happened (or is usually happening). The film is also a great way to see Kenny and Spencer's personality outside their Canadian TV show. You can see a little bit of what's coming. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing The Papal Chase.
