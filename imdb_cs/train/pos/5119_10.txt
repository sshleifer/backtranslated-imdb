I just have to say that it's one of my favorite films of all time. I can not even count how many times I've seen it. I was in love with John Travolt, but for the first time when the camera wakes up on the body when everything is shaved clean and looks beautiful on his first trip to Gilley, I was in awe. Debra Winger, as always, delivers perfect performance as a young, naive wife of Buda, but with the necessary attitude to marry a hard-working cowboy. If you are not a country music person I was not, it's one soundtrack that sings you directly with each word. If you have a chance, check out this movie - it will not disappoint.
