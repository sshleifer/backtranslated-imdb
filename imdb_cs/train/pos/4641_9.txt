Eytan Fox did it again: move the viewer's heart into a humble story that takes place in great disorder. The film also successfully describes the perfect and gentle atmosphere of the incredible city of Tel Aviv. <br /> <br /> I was there a month ago and it's all: lifestyle, relationships, hitting the city, mess, a bit of utopian thoughts in the most famous, blithe and unknown megalopolis. <br /> <br /> We strongly recommend: it is a way for heart and mind with an interesting view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <br /> <br /> Nota Bene: The film is a central gay plot. If you do not think you are too homosexual, be prepared to be attacked and eventually see it as "just love". (and do not worry: the cat is also hot!)
