I have to admit that Tsui Hark is unique, you can not warm the person with the strong style of the movie. The Chinese fantasy image may not be easy to present to the audience, the director tried to return the classic fantasy stories from Zu mountain and that's what he viewed. The new legend of Zu has really improved since 1983. From this new millennium, we have seen Tsui Hark's vision of the Zu mountain range. Spectral visual patterns, amazing action fantasy epics have beautifully done. The whole picture stuck to me. Great actress with fine gaming. It's really fun watching the movie, but is it too weird? Now on the bottom side people are sure to get confused with his broad story cut down to a 95-minute film. Plot probably does not have a lot of relationship between the characters but by doing the movie again, you will have a better sense of understanding for the characters themselves. Some may complain that there is not much physical combat, except for figures that have supernatural powers to defeat enemies, and spirits who fight manually do not make much sense. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this nice stylish picture. It may have a bit of a story, but let's take a look at Tsui Hark's "Time & Tide" magazine, we were wrong too, but it was really something stylish and amazing. Tsui Hark always attracts something else to H.K. Cinema. The American audience may be difficult to understand when watching this movie because it's no Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, that's a whole new genre. Though it may not be a masterpiece, but its special effects are actually better than the Storm Riders. It's really worth checking out.
