I thought Baseketball was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! It's a humorous humor that brings me to giggle, and the fact that Trey and Matt are so overhead is raising the movie comedy. <br /> <br /> I just bought Baseketball on DVD and it's just one of those movies where you would never get tired of watching it. I have very brief attention and I think this movie has some funny bits that will keep me all the time. Funny quotes are unforgettable, and they can make me laugh for hours if I remember them later. So overall, I think Baseketball is a brilliant movie that everybody should see, especially if you're younger than me because you're scoffing for a long time. <br /> <br /> Does anyone think it's strange to me that they like both of them? hehe
