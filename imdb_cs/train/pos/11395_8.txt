I chose old musicals from my garage and that's another of my favorites. This was written by Jay Alan Lerner and directed by Vincent Minelli. She won two Academy Awards for the Best Picture of 1951 and the Best Screenplay. The story of an American painter in Paris who is trying to make it big. Nina Foch is a sophisticated lady and is very interested in helping but soon finds out that she loves that guy. Meanwhile, Gene Kelly falls on a beautiful girl, Leslie Caron. His main dance partner and I must say they are fantastically together on the floor and otherwise. Famous French singer Georges Guietary also sings. So if you love high-quality dance and fun full-length scenes full of sharp pianos by Oscar Levante, George Gershwyn's songs will last forever in this colorful gem. 8/10
