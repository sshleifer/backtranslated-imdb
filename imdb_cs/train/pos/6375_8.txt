While I have great respect for Disney's animated films, it was not really what I would call "must see" later on. Atlantis looked interesting from the first movie poster and trailer and fortunately met my expectations. Atlantis is a "mature" Disney movie in the sense that it lacks songs (a very unusual feature for Disney movie really), and is more focused on action and discovery than any other Disney recent offer. The world of Atlanta, hidden beneath the earth's core, is fantastic, imagined as a deserted cavern with ruins, and then slowly evolves into real ecosystems that, although usually containing some roughness reminders, are becoming more and more interesting until the tropical paradise alone has reached it. Presenting the simple landscape of Atlantis and setting, without any unnecessary merry song, gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and interesting look. The inclusion of the Atlantic language as well as attempts to link it to the mythology of old civilizations in real life adds to it and works quite well. Also, except for some scenes involving Mole's practical jokes, it did not seem to be a "childish" element that I would normally associate with Disney movies. Instead, the main element was the struggle for Atlantis and the constant discovery that appeared at Atlantis, because Milo, an outsider, was able to learn everything he ever needed to know about the place by helping the Atlanteans discover parts of their own history that they did not know. Part of this includes the Atlantean "guns" that are used in a very acoustic climax, which is rather exciting due to lack of better words. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
