My baby sitter was a fan, so I've seen many older episodes when I grew up. I'm not a Scooby Doo fan so I'm not sure why I left the TV when this premiere premiered. To my surprise, it seemed pleasant to me. For me, Shaggy and Scooby were the only interesting characters * to deliver tomatoes from other fans *, so I like to focus only on the two. However, this may cause fans to hate the original performance. I like voice acting, especially Dr. Phinius Phibes. I liked listening to him before I knew it was Jeff Bennett. And Jim Meskimen like Robi seems to me like he really has fun as an actor. I also have a techie hill with their slightly autistic personalities and their desire to play Dungeons and Dragons or to play on scenes of star wars (of course they do not call them).
