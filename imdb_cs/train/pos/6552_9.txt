I usually do not like Emma Roberts, but after watching Nancy Drew it changed me. Actors in movies have made the whole thing exciting and entertaining. Most of the time when you look at a mysterious movie can be resolved before the center of the show, but in this movie it's as if you really were there. Catch points must fit together until you finally can not understand the whole crime. I am still amazed by how she found it. The whole movie was really smart, and people watching him loved the movie. Clothes was my favorite part of the movie, she was so cute. I do not think there will be another movie like this until the sequel continues. I give her nine because the popular girls really did not seem to have the right role, but they still laugh at me. It was a great movie and a great secret. I certainly recommend watching it.
