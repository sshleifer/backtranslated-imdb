I saw this movie about a year ago and found it laughing. The real winner, in my mind. It was the stress of a stupid comedy, but it really had a real plot. Just like a hit comedy, Elf, in fact. It had several serious moments that were stacked between the resolutions. When Stiller shot Black Horse, usually a sober moment, you found yourself laughing at his humiliation. You can actually find a common ground there, because I'm sure many people did something they would not want their friend to know about your friendship stopping. When I found out how many people did not like this movie, I was totally overwhelmed. That absolutely horrible movies such as Napoleon Dynamite were rated better than I'm thinking about people's understanding of IMDb. Take advice and hire her. If you are not laughing at least once, I will pay you the rent. = D
