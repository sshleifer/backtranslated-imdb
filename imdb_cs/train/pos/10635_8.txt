I appreciated photographs, textures, colors, and often, unlike a note, lighting. What I missed was a continuous story. I have found that it is often disjointed, poorly dressed and sometimes difficult. My version was 110 minutes, IMDb shows one at 125m. Perhaps cuts and subtitles did not help. I appreciate all the films that escape from the Hollywood form, but it disappointed me. Miss Gillain was light and the performances were fine, I just wanted a little more dialogue. If anyone wanted to see another movie that has a relationship with this one, try "Hideous Kinky" with Kate Winslet.
