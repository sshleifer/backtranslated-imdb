This is probably Karisma in her best, except for Zubeida. Nana Patekar also does her best without trying. The story is sometimes very good, but eventually it seems to stretch, especially when Shahrukh comes to the picture. What really did me, as if it were the leaders' introductions, the dialogue delivery, as well as the story of what it was. It could have been better and better. The supporting case was even great, including the mother of Karimina, although she had only one glowing moment, it was great to watch her. The sets were also pretty good. I did not really like to show them to the Canadian family, but as soon as she gets out in India, it's as real as it is. Overall I would give her a thumbs up!
