I saw this movie tonight in NYC at Landmark Sunshine. I did not know what to expect that I would not read too much about it because I knew I would see it no matter what. Everything in all, it is very well done. It does not focus on generalizing the anti-war statements that left my policy behind me. Soldiers mainly talked about their consciousness of toxicity in their boot camp training and how hard it was when they returned to civilian life. It was really good to see Paul Rieckhoff and Camilo Mejia tell about the difficulties of surviving not only the war but the refusal to return when it was against personal morality. Do not make a mistake - it's not an anti-war movie. Anyone who says it is not, did not see it, or does not use the scars of war on their souls.
