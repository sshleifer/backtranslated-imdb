I just saw the GIFT VANITY in the newly released Universal Pre-Code and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the end of the car. Most other commentators dealt with the story, the mystery of murder inside the musical instrument, but I wanted to add a few more notes. Brisson and Carlisle are relatively insignificant compared to most minor players and neither really has the right voice for what they are singing (Carlisle's trained opera singer, Brisson slipped a bit on some of his tall and low notes). Grand Victor McLaglen and Jack Oakie play well with an excellent sense of timing that keeps the ball moving between musical numbers. Yes, Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan are girls' vanities, but do not forget the beautiful jazz singer Ernestin Anderson in "Ebony Rhapsody". Gail Patrick makes one of her early performances, which sounds a bit like Eva Arden; Patrick would become executive producer of television series Perry Mason. Then Jessie Ralph is like Mrs. Wardrobe - you will also find her with David COPPERFIELD (like Aunt Peggot) and BANK DICK. Music is very good - Brisson presents standard "cocktails for two" in two different scenes; "Sweet Marijuana" with difficultly covered pejot girls in the background (the blood that drowned on the white skin of the chrome was amazingly cool); "Ebony Rhapsody," with Duchess Ellington's orchestra, and a splendor of beautiful dancers, both black and white, and blending. And I believe it's one of the first musicals to have such a mix - and the costumes leave no imagination.
