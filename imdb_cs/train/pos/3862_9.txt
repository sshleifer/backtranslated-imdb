Since I've always been looking for something new and unique, I've been watching this movie online. I thought it would be just another "B" movie, but I was amazed at the acting of two main characters. All actors in this film were very capable and well managed. The plot was amazing and unique, as well as excellent morale to the story. This movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sexual story, "Dumb and Dumber" or blood and intestines. This is a wonderful horror movie that shows some terrible reality of life, coupled with the kindness of the human heart, and just so interesting. <br /> <br /> I prefer this film to many "A" movies even to see a great deal of high boxing revenue. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
