Joan Fontaine plays like a villain in this Victorian movie. She convincingly plays a married woman who has a lover on her side and also focuses on a wealthy man, Miles Rushworth, who plays Herbert Marshall. Mr. Marshall is pretty good like Miles. Miss Fontaine played her part to perfection - at the same time she was cunning, counted, innocent, terrified and charming. It requires an actress with an extraordinary talent to pull it. Joan Fontaine looked exquisitely in elegant costumes by Travis Banton. Also in the movie is Joanna's mother, Lillian Fontaine as Lady Flora. I highly recommend this movie.
