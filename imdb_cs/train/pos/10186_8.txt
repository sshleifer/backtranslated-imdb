Okay, I know it does not work India in good light. However, the overall theme of the film is not India, it is Shakti. The strength of the warrior and the power of the mother. The relationship between Nandini and her husband and son will devour you in their warmth. Then it is terribly wrong. The interactions between Nandini and her father in law - the strength of their dysfunctional relationship - and the lives that have changed are the strengths of this film. Shah Rukh Khan's performance seems to be just a camera compared to the mysterious despair of Karoys Kapoor. It's easy to capture love, violence, and the redemption of life in this movie, and you will find that you have culminated with relief and sadness at the top. Music Interludes are strong, believable and well-done.
