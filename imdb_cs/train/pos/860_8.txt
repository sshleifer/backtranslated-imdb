Audiard has created a very interesting movie here. It begins with the description of the almost deaf young woman, in her working universe as a secretary; she is ignored, frustrated, refused ... Insurance internally as an assistant seems like a way to find someone in her life, but the guy is just getting out of jail. Their two rejections of society are gradually unifying them. The description of the characters is deep, goes into detail ... they both begin to help each other; because she can read on her lips, which seems to be very useful to him ... She gradually evolves, far from what she was initially. He is beautifully shot; the whole is very convincing, even though it eventually turns into a noir movie at the end. The gesture is especially beautifully observed in Audiard. Emmanuelle Devos should be nominated for the best prize by Actess Cesar for her master game. End-of-movie activity prevents it from being a simple "etude de moeurs". It's surprisingly fun: 8/10.
