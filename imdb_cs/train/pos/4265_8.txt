If you have not seen this obscure little wizard, you should look for it. It's a story of sad, war Sad Sad (Fred MacMurray), who is listed 4-F every time he tries to enter some arm of the army. He finds a magic lamp that naturally contains Gene (Sheldon), but the genie is even more foggy than MacMurray, and sends him in time to serve in all the bad times and places he wants. She's cute, cheerful and pure hairy, and you can not help but love. The paintings are similar to the Disney film, especially since the two stars (MacMurray and Sheldon) both produced numerous Disney movies in the 1950s and 1960s, though not together. Needless to say, it all ends well for everyone and the viewer is leaving quite well.
