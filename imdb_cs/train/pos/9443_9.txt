It is a shame that Deliverance is known primarily as a film about rape and for Dueling Banjos. Even people who have seen the movie can not eradicate their minds from this raped scene. It's not as bad as a rape scene in Pulp Fiction. This is definitely not as bad as any scene of raping women in almost every movie. People tend to miss the strength of the film, which contains an indescribable stroller scenario. Performer, plot, cinematography, and the Deliverance soundtrack all lend a hand to being a delightful charisma. Backcountry that was shot is beautiful and is quite inconsistent with the dark object. The actors, both big and small, feel as if you were sailing along the river with them. <br /> <br /> The thing that separates this movie from others is a tangible feeling of fear that is inspired. Many movies can make you chirp. Bottom Line: This movie is classic. I can really say more than that.
