This movie hit me home. I'm 29, I remember in the 80s, and my father worked in the factory. I thought if I worked hard if I had pride and never surrendered, I could also have an American dream, a house, a few children, a car to call me alone. But I noticed that without a title (unlike my father who left the ninth grade) and a deep sense of greed and laziness, you can not get anywhere. <br /> <br /> I would like to know if someone has this movie on DVD or VHS. it's made for television and I saw it an hour ago. I will not find it anywhere! I would like to show it to my friends, my pseudonyms, family and other relatives, see what they think and remind them that Americans would ever work for a sense of respect and that we were proud of what we were doing! I think that feeling is still there, but in the heavy down spiral with so many things done overseas ...
