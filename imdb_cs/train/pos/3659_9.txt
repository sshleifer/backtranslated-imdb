This movie was my first contact with Mr. Sica, so I really did not know what to expect. But what I saw interrupted all my expectations - in the good sense. The story is not complicated and shows us the life of a found boy and especially his connection to the community of poor people who built a hood with simple metal plates together. This small town in another city lives its own life and things are all right. One day, however, a source of water is found and the wealthy nobleman is beginning to be interested in buying this place. But as the name of the film hint - there is a miracle. Our character becomes a miracle of a dead mother. What will he do to protect his friends and all the built cities? It was just a masterpiece of a natural comedy. It shows the behavior of poor people and how money and property can talk and play with people. Also, many fun moments and scenes are included - at the beginning with the place where the sun shines and many more. So, by not being a comedian lover, you should see this movie because I liked a lot of myself <br /> <br />
