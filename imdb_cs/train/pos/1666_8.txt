It is a film about Italian artists from the 17th century and specifically about one artist, the woman of Artemisia, which at that time was an unheard-of profession for women, and dared to paint a male act detailing her unique muscles. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera is mainly inside, because artists work mainly. There are some great shots. The beautiful work of classical painters suggests detailed candle light shots and it is fascinating to watch the painter and his students, supported by sophisticated scaffolds, which deal more closely with religious frescoes. It is no wonder that the artistic elements of the film (costumes, faces, make-up) are quite surprisingly authentic because Italian churches have kept these details in their frescoes for centuries. Beautiful Artemisia invites her father to study under the great Florentine artist Tassim, who became a specialist in fine arts and landscape painting (something new), but unsuspecting Artemisia is introduced more than new techniques in painting. After posing it, Tassi violently raped her. Her father is outraged. Judicial proceedings follow. <br /> <br /> This romantic drama has a fairly simple story with an unsatisfactory ending. The distinctive feature of the film is its artistic presentation and attention to detail. Scenes such as women walking through the terrain and the wind peeking out their bulky clothes bring great effects. Artemisia says she is painting to be delighted; her father painted for the other's pleasure. As for this movie, I think I will like it.
