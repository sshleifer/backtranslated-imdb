I saw this film with a special screening of Owen Alik Shahadah. It's interesting where the guy comes from. Now he is probably the key independent African filmmaker in the world. And I'm not talking about black artists, I'm talking about filmmakers who have roots in culture. The idea of ​​demonstrating the diversity and scope of African themes with its filter 500 years later is an African question. Idea, however, does not match this form. Show artistic diversity. The film is an African whole, but the subject is a human subject that most of us could relate to. I just love a gentle comedy. And Kora of Tunde Jeged is just amazing, it's really the gem of art.
