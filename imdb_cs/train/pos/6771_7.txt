so yes, it's quite a nostalgic observation of the first episode, because that's one episode I've ever remembered. I like to watch the first season and yes, compared to the action packed shows that we now have this show seemingly lame. but I honestly like the "less violent" part of the show and the story line has more substance than the new ones. I think it is interesting that Belisario Airwolf and JAG have a similar theme - the main actor (Hawke and Harm) both are looking for a relative MIA (brother, father). wondering if the personal life of Robert Belisarias imitates these two themes. <br /> <br /> Question - Does anyone have pictures of Hawke's cabin. I love the cabin (probably like my house) and that's one of the scenes I remember at Airwolf.
