I think it's unfortunate that the main commentaries on this movie include the words "frivolous and terrible nonsense". I think it's a very fun movie and great fun. One has to stop their mistrust that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman can fall in love, have a baby, and live happily ever after. But it is always beautiful to see that the movie is playing and has a warm heart. Is that impossible? Other movies describe much more unpredictable events. The game is good, the script is fun. The only negative remark is that the story could end if the family left their home, instead of exploring whether the man retains some residual homosexuality.
