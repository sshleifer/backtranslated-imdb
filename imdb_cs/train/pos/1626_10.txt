This movie is really FUNNY! If you want an hour of rest, go ahead and watch. It's called blond and blond, so do not expect deep and meaningful jokes. What this film and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about the two blondes. It's just a funny movie that you can watch on a date or with a group of friends (especially if you're not too sober.) Pamela and Denise are still quite hot chicks. It is a mistake to judge this film as a work of art. C'mon, this movie is about BLOND! It was easy, fun and shallow. One more thing, I do not think the girls will appreciate and like this movie, but it will surely be a guy.
