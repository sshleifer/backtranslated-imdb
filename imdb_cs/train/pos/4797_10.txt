I have always been a fan of David Lynch and with this film, Lynch has shown to critics that he has talent, style and artistic integrity to make films outside the surreal aura he has become known for over the past decade. Just like the movie is G-rated, it's pure Lynch in style, stimulation and tone. The film moves at a slightly hypnotic pace and is full of scenes of authentic emotions and power. Cinematography is amazing as you can expect from Lynch, and the transient assembly sequences are breathtaking. It's also very refreshing to see a movie where all characters are friendly, merciful folk and unmotivated characters that are clearly labeled as either "good" or "evil." Richard Farnsworth turns out to be beautiful as the rest of the cast, most notably Sissy Spacek in a cute performance as his daughter, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but never-ending role. Thanks to this film, David Lynch has shown to critics that he could make a powerful moving film, just like in the '80s with' Blue Velvet 'and' The Elephant Man '. Critics have lost faith in the past decade after producing such surreal films as "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me" and "Lost Highway," but with this film it showed that there is a FWWM and LH method, and it looks like critics have finally caught up with with his recent film "Mulholland Drive," given the high praise he received and the Oscar for Lynch. Straight Story is one of the most moving movies I've ever seen. It's a nice story about the family, the friendship and the kindness of the aliens. I would highly recommend it.
