This collection of eleven short stories in one movie is a great idea and presents some great segments but also some unsatisfactory surprises. Based on the tragic event of September 11, 2001 in the United States, eleven directors were invited to invite American tragedies. The result of most of them is not only individual sympathy for the American people, but above all intolerance in a world of different cultures and people. Ken Loach (Great Britain) represents the best segment, on September 11, 1973, in Chile, when the dictator Augusto Pinochet, with the support of the US, was demolished by the democratic government of Salvador Alliende. Other outstanding segments include Youssef Chahine (Egypt), which show the intolerance in the world and the number of casualties that US governments are doing in different countries today; and Mira Nair (India), which shows the true story of injustice and prejudice against the Pakistani family whose son was wrongly accused of terrorism in the US when he was really a hero. Some segments are beautiful: Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) shows that innocent Afghan refugees are preparing to shelter a bomb, while their teacher is trying to explain to them what happened on the other side of the world; romantic Claude Lelouch (France) shows a life couple in New York near the WTC; Danis Tanovic (Bosnia and Herzegovina) shows the consequences of his war in a small place and lonely protest of widows; Sean Penn is very poetic, showing that life continues; and the Shohei Imamura story is probably the most impressive, showing that there is no holy war but sadness and shame. Segment Idrissa Quedraogo (Birkina Faso) is very naive but pictures terrible bad conditions this segment of Africa. The Amos Gital (Israel) segment is very boring and manipulative and shows more violence and terrorism. The segment of Alejandro González Iñárritu is very disappointing, (Brazil): "11 de Setembro" ("September 11"). <br /> <br />
