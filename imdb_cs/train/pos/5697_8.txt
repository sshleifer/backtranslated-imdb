In May 2004, Wonderland is relatively new in the UK. Brilliant film of brutal true story. If you know LA from the early 1980s, you will appreciate how well it is captured. Using the elements that make up his rough cinematic style is original, it strengthens the experience and brings the viewer very close to being really. Using an unrelated time line in the style of "Pulp Fiction" allows you to examine uncertainty about what really happened while the direction and performance of the attention, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes; Oscar, of course, if I handed them away.
