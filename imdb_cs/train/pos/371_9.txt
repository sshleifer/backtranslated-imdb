I remember when this film was announced on an Oscar and did not win in any category. For life I can not remember what it is against, but one thing I can say: it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. And the fact that director Steven Spielberg made the film did not convince me. <br /> <br /> It's basically the exams and the suffering of a black woman when she grows up from a girl to a woman. There are lots of stimuli that are disturbing and scary, but they are all needed to find out to what extent this woman is involved. On the way we see other women who have had to cope with their misery and go with them for redemption. Whoopi Goldberg gives her best performance ever in this movie. Danny Glover was also nominated for his role in this film. <br /> <br /> And the best part of this movie is that people are humanly engaged, not like crazy shows like the newer "Beloved". I encourage someone from some race to see this movie. 9/10
