Who Can Imagine - Hal Hartley creates the filmmaking impact of Syrians while retaining his signature idiosyncratic style. The merger is very fun. When I did not see Hal Hartley movie for about ten years, I turned to him with some caution. His great productions from the 1990s have impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialogue. The director's earlier films feature colorful characters and offer close observation of life - often in Long Island, New York or New York itself - that were extraordinary and incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> My first caution was based on the description of this movie as an "spy thriller". To my pleasant surprise, Hartley managed to reach his steady style and to concentrate on creating a very original drama of international intrigue. There are more ways you can imagine. Hartley's film preserves the dialogue and characteristic focus, which are its trademarks, together with a unique cinematographic style. Moreover, it is due to the current situation in the world and the state of war, which was supported by dark elements on all sides. Hartley has brought all his skills to something new - a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Syriana. It really comes to your own. The actor does a great job in interpreting Hartley's vision and style. Parker Posey fans will see her in full bloom, still with us, and more mature and more beautiful than before.
