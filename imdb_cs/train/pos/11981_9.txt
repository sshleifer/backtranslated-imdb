"FULL HOUSE", in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure if I've ever seen each episode, but I still enjoyed it. One of my favorite episodes is where Jesse (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Lori Loughlin) marry. To know how what was so funny you have to be seen for yourself. It was two-storey, so you'd have to see both parts. Another favorite episode is that Jesse, Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen) are blocked at the Michelle birthday station. You would also have to see it yourself if you want to know how and why it happened. I have many more that I like. Everybody always gave good performance, the design was magnificent, the costumes were well designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can be seen in the syndication now, I strongly recommend that you catch it only if it is left out of the air.
