Rohmer returns to her historical drama in the real story of Grace Elliot, the Englishman who stayed in France during the peak of the French Revolution. One always suspected that Rohmer was conservative, but he knew he was such a red-blooded reactionary. If you can get rid of Rohmer's fearless defense of the monarchy (and that's not an easy thing, for example, for example, the French lower classes are portrayed as hideous puppets), it's actually an elegant, intelligent and polished film. Losing money for the great 18th-century French film recreation, Rohmer instead plays against clearly-painted cartons. It's obviously an artificial mood, but somehow it works. And the newcomer Lucy Russell succeeds in creating a sympathetic character that should not be.
