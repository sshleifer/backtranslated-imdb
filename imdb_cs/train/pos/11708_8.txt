The reason why people say they are afraid of this movie is because it did! This meant that the film's intention was felt by some who had seen it. When I first saw this movie, it scared me and made me think about life and religion. It's not a film of blood and a frightening type, but the kind that would have thought it might be possible for things to become the way the film was written. Naturally, non-believers will tell their only science fiction film. The truth is that this movie is necessary for your thriller collection, even if it has a religious opinion. If you are a fan of classic thrillers (Omen..etc), it is one of them and it must have it. I have never seen a sequel (Distant Thunder), but I believe it rises where the movie ends.
