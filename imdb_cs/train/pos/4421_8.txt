Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese cinematography, with highly creative directors, editors and photographers working on historical themes, which the Japanese call the "period." Gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color, photography and editing. Brilliant, balanced. A new wave of Japanese Samurai films allows insight into the traditional beliefs of shamanism, demons and occult powers that were certainly part of their old culture, but in fact they were not explored in the Kurasawa epic samurai or Zaitochi. Another good example of this genre is Onmyoji (2001). I would like to give Sogo Ichii as one of the most interesting and cutting-edge Japanese directors. Other recent Japanese songs I would highly recommend include Yomada's Twilight Samurai (2002) and Shintaro Katsu's Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman (2003).
