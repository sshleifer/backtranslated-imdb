In addition to the great film METROPOLIS, it is the oldest pure science fiction film. While sometimes the film is a bit of a sermon and the acting may be a bit broad, it's a great movie for two reasons. First of all, it is extremely original in both style and content. Even in the 21st century, there are no films I can think of as something like that. Secondly, the special effects were absolutely unbelievable - using mature images, models and huge casts, they created amazing scenes for both the post-apocalyptic world and the huge city of tomorrow. Sure, you can sit and knock the film, because according to today's standards the effects are just that. You must appreciate, however, that this was a state of the art when the film appeared in 1936 and it really had to impress spectators. In many ways, the sets look very much like the "modern cities" appearing at WORLD'S FAIR 1939. I think the film is also interesting because it seems to be ripped off by the question, "are people really stupid or are we big?" The final result seems be a bit of both! How true! <br /> <br /> Last note: I saw it twice on TV and shortly before the video. All three times the sound and quality of the print - especially the sound. If it's available on a DVD, let's hope it's much cleaner and provides an optional description. Since the sound of the video is still exiting, I would really appreciate it!
