This set of adults who returned to the Summer Camp form in their youth was in the autumn of 1993 a very quiet participant and exiter of the cinema. I think it was a shame, but then again, some of the better movies are Silent Release that do not have much humor or praise. Diane LAne, Kevin Pollack, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Julie Warner, Bill Paxton, Kimberly Williams, Matt Craven and Alan Arkin) are a group of actors who develop these roles as people who have grown up with good, bad and funny memories of years that have passed through the past. This film covers a gambit of emotion, mostly pleasant, and the film never knocks off the viewer to feel what the characters feel, prefers the viewer to enter into the memories themselves. Since I am a filmmaker who is lucky to have a seamless, inexpensive manipulation in films, it is something I appreciate from the writer / director Mike Binder. This movie is a great cheap rental, good rental and even a nice sitting in a theater movie. You could come across it on TV and I would definitely recommend you to look at it.
