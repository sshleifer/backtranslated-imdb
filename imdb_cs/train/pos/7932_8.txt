When I look at a low-budget movie, I know what to expect. I expect that the acting will not be so good (budget reasons), I expect the lighting will not be so good (budget reasons) I expect the sound to be not so good (budget again). Stop reviewing these low-budget movies as a big budget! I myself am a director, so I understand the budget constraint on a low-budget movie. They steal places, shots, etc. ... the list goes on. I do not want to say that all the acting is bad. Jose Rosete, Chris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza are good. Raul Martinez is natural. Carl Washington has not been sold yet. They have to understand that each line is not important, some are dropped. I say that if you want to see what happens next, it's a good movie. I like this movie. I gave her eight. I wanted to see what was going to happen next. Great work Quiroz brothers!
