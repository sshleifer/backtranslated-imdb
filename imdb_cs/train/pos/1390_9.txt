If you like sci-fi cult 70. Just like me, or if you love movies like "Repo Man" or "Buckaroo Bonzai" before you love it. It is a sci-fi spectacular stream of sci-fi consciousness, including the barn of the 22nd century and the Earth in a million years. This movie is purely seventies. Put Steve Miller "Fly Like a Eagle" or Pink Floyd "Dark Side of the Moon" and you are ready to go!
