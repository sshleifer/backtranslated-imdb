IQ is a cute romantic comedy featuring two great actors who look good on the screen. The plot is a typical guy for a girl, the guy has a girl's format, but he gives a firm point that one must love the heart and not the mind. The addition of Alberto Einstein and his group of geniuses provides excellent comic relief. Overall good movie. Not big but good
