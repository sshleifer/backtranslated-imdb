Based on Elmore Leonard, this is a violent and intelligent action movie. Story: The trader is blackmailed by about three criminals. Roy Schieder does a great job as a lead figure, and a special loan must go to John Glover, who plays some naughty psychopaths. I have to mention that the villains are very complex and interesting - something that is very rare for the action film. also presents some beautiful and sexy women - the most notable are Kelly Preston as a young career for the Schieder character. Vanity gives a very good performance and looks like a shoe that is associated with three ejectors. I'm glad Ann-Margaret's still missing - this lady is really a babe. Do not look at the film. I really do not know what the public and some critics have against this film, but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this really gripping and undervalued movie. You will enjoy it, that is a promise. Recommended A +.
