Although most Americans have little knowledge of their work in addition to Star Wars, Alec Guinness produced an amazing work-especially in the 1940s-1950s-from drama to strange comedy. I especially love his comedy because they are so well made and seem to be so natural and real on the screen - far different from the usual Hollywood fare. <br /> <br /> This was said to have prompted my interest in these films. It's a conspiracy that was so strange and cute that it's very unlikely that the film would shoot anywhere - except Ealing Studios - which had special hobbies for "small" movies like this one. Guinness is a nasty scientist working for a textile company. He wants to experiment to create a synthetic substance that is indestructible, though he does not work for the firm as a researcher, but for cleaning work! So he tends to sneak into the lab (whether during the day, if no one suspects, or at night) and try his hand in inventing. Repeatedly it is captured (for example, when the lab has fired) and got a shoe until one day it really succeeds! Then, despite the importance of this discovery, a completely unexpected chain of events sets off - and then fun begins. The film is a great satire that is entertaining in industry, trade unions, government, and people in general.
