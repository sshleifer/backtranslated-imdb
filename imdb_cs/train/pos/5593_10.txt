This movie could be a silent film; he definitely has one. I was extremely happy to see this very rare version of this movie. Extase is a symphony of love and goes beyond all language versions. The French language, which is a perfect romantic language, seems very suitable for this very sensual and lyrical version. Young Hedy Lamarr illuminates the screen in this movie, which almost resembles a sexual fancier; but certainly far from being pornographic. Quiet qualities can be a bit rough; but it does not affect the magical charm that this film radiates. Many early movie lovers would love to admire this film.
