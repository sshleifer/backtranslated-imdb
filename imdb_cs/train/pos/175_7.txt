A nice average film, but brave by Mrs. Hawn, who supports this vehicle as an Exec producer and as a stellar vehicle. Although she finally justifies, she is willing to portray her as a dizzying bimbo. How many other named actresses have exposed the prstfalls from this film? Not too much. Does it mean that a woman's buttock can not be funny? Goldie overcomes other actresses because she keeps personality screen and business in other projects that will not be. Sandra Bullock occasionally goes there, like Miss Congeniality, but Nicole Kidman would never hurt pratfall. Wonderful artist. Great to see some of my favorite actors, Chris Sarandon & Cliff DeYoung remarkably.
