The Unseen is in the style of old Hollywood mysteries rather than a horror show. The film is somewhat slow, but lots of bizarre pictures keep the film alive and observable. The basic idea of ​​young girls going through something in the basement is an old but good actress and production makes the film worth the attention. The film is remarkable for its emotional influence and definitely not for any express action or special effects. I rated it 8 out of 10.
