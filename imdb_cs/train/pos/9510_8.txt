In the winter of 1931, 12-year-old Tyler Hoechlin (Michael Sullivan Jr.) is curious about what his fanciful father Tom Hanks (Michael "Mike" Sullivan) is doing for his livelihood. Young Hoechlin followed Mr. Hanks to "work" one night and testified to how some rival gangsters snapped him off. This leads, in a circular fashion, to Paul Newman (like John Rooney), who has hired an independent musician Jude Law (like Harlen Maguire) to trace Hoechlin and Hanks who are cooled in Chicago. . Hanks thinks they will be safe with the relative, which is mysterious when you take into account a number of character figures. <br /> <br /> Hoechlin does a great job, like Paul Peterson ("The Donna Reed Show") for director Sam Mendes; and began working with this cast makes him the happiest young actor of 2002. The most notable thing about "The Path to Corruption" is the stunning cinematography of Conrad L. Halla, who deserved to win the Academy Award for a late photographer. Mr. Hall's work is really superlative. This helps to balance the overall impression of measured, imagined stagnation both for narrative and visual. The deviating end is suddenly uplifting (the unrelated dog is an example of the above-mentioned staginess). Road to Perdition (7/12/02) Sam Mendes ~ Tom Hanks, Tyler Hoechlin, Paul Newman, Jude Law
