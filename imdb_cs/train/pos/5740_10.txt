The emotional forces and characters of Dominic and Eugene are things that Hollywood is no longer doing. It is one of the most emotional, sensitive and warmly cítilých films I've ever seen! Roy Liotta, Tom Hulce and assistant actress Jamie Lee Curtis, will bring Oscar Winning Performance! There is not enough to say how big this movie is. Surely, people who are not in sentimental movies do not like Dominic and Eugene much like the rest of us, but for the rest of us, this film goes right into the heart and exclusive compassion and humanity. You will never forget this movie, never! <br /> <br /> ***** ***** ***** SPOILER IN ACCORDANCE <br /> <br /> A simple but eloquent story is masterfully handled. Eugene is an intern who faces long working hours and heavy workloads in the hospital. His brother brother Dominick (born 12 minutes earlier) is a little slow and unpleasant due to brain damage due to the victim's abuse of their father. (Heart moment when it pops up in the movie that leaves you in tears!) Eugene (aka "Geno") faces a painful dilemma. He has to decide whether to end a medical school, which would mean accepting his stay in another city and leaving Dominic (aka "Nicky") or he would lose the rest of his education to take care of him. Nicky helps pay her brother's schoolwork by working as a garbage collector. Questions of ethics, morality and responsibility are masterfully mixed in this landmark film. Only when Gino thinks Nicky can move towards independence, Dominick turns around and ends by helping the drug dealer or making a connection with the wrong cord he finds on an electrical appliance dump. <br /> <Larry is "The Character," and Nicky is a partner on her garbage path that captures Dominica's wild head with all sorts of stories like Geno and Jennifer (his girlfriend in clinical pharmacology) to Atlantic City and gamble away all your money. But deep, you can see that Larry cares about him. On their laps Nicky also weaves a little boy whose discover that his father was also beaten. The end result is tragic and also the pain that you see on Nickyině face when it happens, speaks volumes. The sensitivity shared by the two brothers can not be overstated. All that Nicky wants to do is to be loved and to seek acceptance in any way he can. (Ie. Going to church, he loved Hulk Hogan) Geno Nicky loves more than anything in the world. Can his brother become independent enough to allow Geno to follow his dream of becoming a doctor? A brilliant film, which was to get more recognition than he deserved, but unfortunately came out at the same time as Rain Man, which dealt with similar issues. But I prefer Dominique and Eugen because he has a much stronger emotional component. Be careful that this film focuses directly on tear canals, making Kleenex practical! What movie !!!!
