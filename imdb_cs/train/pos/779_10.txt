In northeastern Brazil, the father of 12-year-old illiterate Marie (Fernando Carvalho) sells her daughter to a middle-aged prostitute Tadeo (Chico Dias), who is to be employed as a home and has a better life. However, the girl is sold to Lourenço's farmer (Otávio Augusto) who turns her off and gives an abused girl to his teenage son to have his first sexual experience. Then he was sent to a brothel on the golden field in Amazonas and explored his owner, disdainful Saraiva (Antonio Calloni). When Maria escapes to Rio de Janeiro and is waiting for a better life, Vera (Darlene Glória) is investigated. "Anjos do Sol" reveals the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in Brazil, the fate of Mary. Last year I saw Lilju 4-ever, telling the same story in the former Soviet Union; therefore, this problem exists in Third World countries. Director and writer Rudi Lagemann presents a great movie that reveals reality but never shows the nudity or explicit sexual scenes. It's the debut of promising Fernanda Carvalho, who has excellent performance in the role of a terrified child struggling to survive. Most prostitutes are amateurs and it is not possible to recognize the famous Darlene Glórii so different that it is after many plastic operations. The hot and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Anjos do Sol" ("Angels of the Sun")
