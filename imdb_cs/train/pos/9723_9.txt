I really really enjoy watching this movie! At first I saw that it was just another romantic comedy ... but it's just more than that! Personally, I think this idea (I'm sure a good audience just before they saw the movie) is another important part of the great concept of this movie (or even its marketing strategy)! I mean: Nowadays we are slaves to paintings! To view! I went to the cinema to see that this film had a bad impression, poor expectations, and finally I felt how I could be superficial! As an example, it seems to me that the end of Sidney's purchase of a ticket to come back to New York and being asked to "submit an autograph," which means signing the ticket, believes that it was precisely because he had come to TV due to a scandal to the awards that she is now a kind of celebrity. And that is, in my opinion, the culmination of this main subject around which the films are turning. On top of that, I think the film also offers us a solution that we have managed to solve throughout the movie according to Sidney's attitude: Do not be too serious about yourself or someone else ... "even saints were people at the beginning". as Sophie once said in the movie. The saints of the moment are stars. We admit to them the "aura" of perfection, eternal happiness, but the reality is much less than that. Even the saints of a religion are images, ideal models of how to behave and how to live their lives. Even they were not really ... they became "real" after they died, and we looked at them. And that's a catch: we need our saints! we need our stars! We try to make them as if it were not for them, we should not try. And television and all other media are the means to create and capture our efforts. We desperately need standards that we can measure. And so we went to the cinema to see this movie first: to find out if we are a benchmark or whether it is a benchmark for us. This time it was bigger than we expected.
