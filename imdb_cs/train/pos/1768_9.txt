This time I did not like the movie for a long time. I have to go for a preliminary survey and I was excited because I was dying to see it. I had tears in my eyes for laughing all the time. The audience all shared my laughter and clapped and shouted for most of the film. Kudos to Steve Carrell (who I was already a fan of). In this film he shows his tremendous talent for comedy. It has a style I have not seen yet. And Catherine Keener's always great. Thank God there was no actor from Will Ferrell (love him, but he saw too much this summer). In this film there were parts of the comedy genius. Partly thanks to Carrell and partly thanks to writing (also Carrella). Waxing scene and speed daters with "obvious problem" were totally hysterical. I'm definitely going to see '40 Year Old Virgin 'when he's released. My advice: go to look at her with huge laughter and an incredibly nice movie on top.
