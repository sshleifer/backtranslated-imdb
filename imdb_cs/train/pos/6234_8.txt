This is my favorite Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie. The dialogue between the two is so cute and fun and very clever. Not to mention that this movie contains some of the best tracks recorded by the two; like putting all my eggs in one basket and seeing music and dancing. If I remember correctly, it was a movie that introduced me to Fred Astaire, so I suppose he will always have a special place in his heart (I apologize for the sentimental cr * p, but I'm a woman, so I can overcome it) throughout this the movie gets me 8/10. The choreography was excellent, and the fact that Lucille Ball is in it is even more amazing.
