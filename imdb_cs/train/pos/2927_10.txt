This video is so fun, it makes everything else Eddie Murphy very disappointing (even Beverly Hills Cop and The Nutty Professor, which just shows how good it is). To be honest, I do not think I ever laughed at anything like Naked Gun and rarely seen by Bargears. This show is amazing, although it must be said that it is definitely filled with a word beginning with F, which is four-letter long (plus an extended version starting with M), but that did not bother me. See it, the funniest thing I've ever seen, and probably the funniest thing you've ever had.
