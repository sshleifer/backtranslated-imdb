Some hesitation was on my part about what the movie was supposed to offer. Beginning, casting does not seem right. Kiefer Sutherland has done very well in "24" and did not seem to have suggested something to him or the audience. Eva Longoria appeared on the spot and the rest did not seem very interesting. When the film finally ended, I was not entirely dissatisfied with seeing a decent thriller that could be much better, the responsible parties had to pay more attention to looking at the narrative gaps and paying a little more attention to personality development. We have seen threats of this type before, and it has caused the major conflict to be much more demanding for writers. As a listener, we do not want to sit again with the same old story. We want to see something different, be excited and entertained. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with casting. From excellent first lady Kim Basinger. She is carried with sufficient grace and sexual attraction to make part unforgettable. Michael Douglas was and did it before. Unfortunately, the president is rather a subject that does not have to worry about his destiny at all. Sutherland again transforms his "24" hard approach with enough force to be big enough for a big screen, and Eve does the job as a newcomer. how come some of the established classics ("North by Northwest" and "The Fugitive"). Leave your expectations outside and enjoy your ride for any option. It's alright.
