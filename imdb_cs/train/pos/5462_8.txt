First, if you are going to follow this, make sure you look at the UNCUT version (although it's very interesting to come back and then watch the scenes that have been affected by censorship), it's a huge difference. This film is about a young woman played by Barbara Stanwyck, who has been forced into prostitution by her own father since 14 years. When her father suddenly leaves, she is able to go to the world herself. After reading about Nietzsche's philosophy of life, she uses her sexuality to manipulate people to give her what she wants, leaving her in ruins and desperately for her love. Throughout the film, he becomes increasingly materialistic and manipulative, and audiences are beginning to wonder that he has any sense of morality at all. Overall, Baby Face is a very shocking film with obvious scenes of sexuality that most people do not expect in a black and white movie. While there are no explicit sexual expressions on the screen, it is very obvious what is happening outside of the camera. I enjoyed watching this movie very well and I think most modern viewers will get at least a bit of fun if it's, especially with the value of the film's shocks. I wondered when I watched that moving seemed to be a little slow, but I think most of the movies are the first to see. Actually, I think almost all the movies I've seen since the early 1930s had some minor motion problems or some parts that were simply not right. Was it just the craft of film making that was not perfect yet? it will take only a few years. Compare the 1939 film and compare it to the 1930s movie and I think you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Once again, I'm glad I could watch the original cut; it really makes a big difference. Also, all John Wayne fans will be surprised to see him in this film before he was famous in an atypical role.
