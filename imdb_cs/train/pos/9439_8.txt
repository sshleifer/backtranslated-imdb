Before I watched this movie, I heard about it a lot and some scenes in the movie, but listening to it did not work for me, so I planned to watch and think about it! Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds make an interesting group of people bent over the Cahulawassee canoe and the unfortunate series of events that appear on them. Character development takes some time to enrich the viewer with a better understanding of each person, but eventually you know these people as if they were your girlfriend. Acting, the dialogue is very realistic, as close as possible to reality in Hollywood acting. Reynolds's "Lewis" character was interesting as a guy who looks very hard, but under a man's veneer lies a very soft and broken man (I was impressed by his performance!) Jon Voight seems to be the figure that is the focus of the most unfortunate circumstances, who find it at every corner, really shaped it and castrated it to another person (his character transition was excellent). Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox really look like silly fools who just have fun and do not seem to get too serious if they were not, and they ... I was really impressed with the idea of ​​director Boorman about Dickey's novel , very impressed. You can not go all your life without watching this movie. I gave him eight out of ten stars that were extremely impressed.
