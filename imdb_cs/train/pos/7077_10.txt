One of the historical science fiction acts as a visionary and thought provoking as Blade Runner or even Gilliam's own Brazil. Willis performs his best here, but is overcome by the incredibly frantic turn of Pitt, which resembles what he has done before or since. Even Stowe is not out of his league. The story is very layered and offers plenty of stuff. The climate scene is beautiful and the last line is perfect. The scenes in the psychiatric hospital are scary and yet funny in a way. There is a lot of dark humor on the screen. Fantastic production design and appropriately bizarre cinematography. In my ten.
