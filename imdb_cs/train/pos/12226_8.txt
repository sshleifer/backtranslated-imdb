This is the best movie of all time! Do I say this because I'm a huge Silverstone fan? Partly, but even without her I would still see it. I'm a fan of genre serial killer films and I believe this is a great entry into this category. Also Mary Giordano easily ranks among Alicia's five-character creations. Completely unforgettable - as it really is. I would have it on my side if the mystery could be solved. She plays her character as well as her real life, with complete confidence in everything she does. She seems to be nice, honest, nice ... just like in real life. So is it acting? Yes, indeed, they are second. This is not bad this time, she's too good and a little afraid to do things that seem over the law. But she does not do things a normal teenager would do. Instead, he spends time reading detectives and solving crimes. The clich√© abounds: it helps to avenge the death of his father in a different way than in the vigilante style. At that time, it seemed that Alicia played the same characters: rebellious, seductive, without a parent, loner. It will also be here, but this time it's a little nerdy. It does not matter; it's still cool as a nude. Check it out soon, or else Giordano will investigate why you ...
