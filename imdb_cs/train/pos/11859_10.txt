On MTV's freezing spots, all packs and shotguns call the classic scene from their DVD collection. This can give you the idea that Scarface is a "gangster film". Sure, there are gangsters and crowds, but that's not Scarface. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is just a Cuban sanctuary looking for a new way of life. He comes with the crowd and becomes a famous drug lord. Montana was all for what you wanted to do with your life. Classic phrase: "Greet your little friend!" is in Scarface. This quotation is what always reminds me of when I think about Brian DePalmase, Scarface. It falls into my top 10 favorite movies. I should rate it *** 1/2 (from ****). Definitely a movie you have to see. PHENOMENAL.
