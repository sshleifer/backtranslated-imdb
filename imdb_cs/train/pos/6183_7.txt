The financially strapped Paramount pulled out all the stops to enter '34: Big Budget, Big Cast, Extravagant Production, and Mitch Leisen as Director. What happened? Two Things: Busby Berkeley did not work for uncoiled rock and a murderous mysterious script that did not deserve to be in the same basket as the worst Charlie Chan had first set up on the street. I have to believe that cutting has been from Leisen's hands since the big number of Duchess Ellington's wildly chopped, but that does not mean it's not worth a look: the "Sweet Marihuana" number is an eager production code and also has a fascinating Toby Wing fed horrible lines and played a silly blonde prototype) like a hot chorion for otherwise interested Jack Oakie. Carl Brisson acts as Melba Toast, but he is a competent singer. MacLaglen gets to the new platforms as a stereotypical stupid detective. And try to meet Lucy in the choir. That's 7.0 as curiosity. February 2010 to think again: I recently gave the film another look and now I think I was wrong when I praise the lack of serial numbers of Busby Berkeley. I understand Leisen's argument for more realistic production numbers in the context of the conspiracy. I still have huge editing problems. Paramount, the largest atelier in the city, faced huge production code problems at the worst possible time in its history, financially speaking, and pulled out all the stops on this (also look at 1934 Search for Beauty). It has to be seen for the enthusiasts before the code.
