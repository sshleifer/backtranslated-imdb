This movie has everything. This is a classic display of the events that surrounded the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees. Antonio Montana (played by Al Pacino) is just one of the thousands to get a chance to choose his destiny in America. This cinematic, yet very accurate, view of Miamis's drug empire is overwhelming. Brian DePalma is doing the amazing work that controls this picture, with the audience engaging both in the story and in every character in the cast. Tony's character is so credible and powerful, Brian DePalma reveals the sympathetic talent that revealed Steven Bauer (Manny, best friend Tony), Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (Gina, Tony's sister), Robert Loggia (Frank Tony's Boss) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elvira, wife of Frank). I enjoyed watching this film every minute and kept looking at it every week. This year's 20th anniversary of this classic crime film, I am one true believer, for the next 20 years, the people of this film are still remembered in amazing numbers. With other crime movies that are so dramatic, I find that movie is a shock to the system.
