It's not always easy to explain what the movie is, but this time I think I found it. It reminded me of two films: Trainspotting (small-time criminals who do some drugs and do some stupid things in Schotland) and the Blair Witch Project (due to the shooting style). It is a loyalty between two friends, one of them out of prison, the other not captured. With a stolen vehicle, he runs through the Scottish landscape but exhausts gas. When they try to find some fuel, they find the farm in the middle of nowhere. The farmer thinks they want to rob him and show a gun on one of them. Then everything goes wrong. One of the friends inadvertently shoots the farmer's daughter and has to run. What follows is a man chasing the fields and forests of Schotland. These two buddies must literally run for their lives. Apparently this film was shot in only 12 days. OK, that's not entirely unbelievable, because the biggest part is always in the same place: in the Scottish countryside, but it still seems amazing. Especially because it's not really a bad movie. Maybe it's not the biggest movie at all, but they can still be proud of what they have achieved. I had a good time watching it and I liked the film overall. I give it 7/10.
