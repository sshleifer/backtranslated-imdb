I do not have much to add to what was said before, but it's really a movie of that time and the first (and probably only) time that the studio has reached a total of Dead End Kids. > <br /> Warner gave boys a lot of help, from director Ray Enright and budget 'A', to the almost magical cast of supporting actors. Every step we get one of those jewels from real professionals. There are too many on the list, but it seems that everyone on Warner's Trigger (without the largest stars) is going through this picture. (See if you can see John Ridgely) Only top performance is from the ever-reliable Eduard Cianelli as the boss of the crowds with a messianist complex. He plays this character almost exactly like Thuggia's leader in "Gunga Din". It's something to watch! And Marjorie Main is excellent and gets his best role from "Dead End". <br /> <br /> My bid for this is the second property on a double account with something like City for Conquest. <br /> <br /> Hooray for Warners!
