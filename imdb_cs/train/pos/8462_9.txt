I have just bought a collection of one of these great series and even after watching three episodes, I'm still fascinated by the elegant animation style and the slow but thoughtful story telling actions. I'm still a fan ..... with some minor pain. Although this installment to the Gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series had - a stylish satirical way of telling about bad wars and not leaving the need to control or control everything (a sound known?), I must say that this guy gets a little too slightly dramatically attempting to explain the lives of the main characters and their constant needs for belly-pain about every thing that happens and what needs to be done to stop a group of OZs from succeeding in their plans (especially the character called Wufei ... I think the hell more than an American character on soap operas, adviser, yes?) Moreover, for the exaggerated drama (I think it mostly comes from dubbing English voice actors), this series is still very exciting and will once again enchant me. I think it can always be worse. It could be like a recent installment, SEED ...... eeeewwww, talk about mellow-dramatic ... I'll be talking about it later.
