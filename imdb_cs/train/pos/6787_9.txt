I found it late at night in TCM. <br /> <br /> I have not seen it since it originally appeared, but I never forgot it. <br /> <br /> I totally forgot how gorgeous and talented Signe Hasso was when she was young as well as Shelly Winters before she avoided. Ronald Coleman was really a brave acting actor - I read Othello in the English high school - and NALÁŠ. After I saw "Double Life," I read it again and finally I understood what the game was about. <br /> <br /> The team for writing Gordon / Kanina was at the top when this script was made - <br /> <br /> The film is well worth remembering and rewatching,
