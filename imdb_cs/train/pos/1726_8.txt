While thinking about "The Big Escape," I let my mind return to this little jewel of childhood film. I read and read the autobiographical novel from 1949 that inspired him, and when he came to a single cinema (in fact we never used that word) in a town where "foreign" movies appeared, I was my first ticket. As someone who was educated in war news films and propaganda films during the Second World War, I was interested in exploring the reality of this conflict as reflected in the memories and stories of the men who were there personally. This eventually prolonged the interest in buying a book over the years, and eventually reading the impressive novels of Hans Helmut Kirst and Erich Maria Remarque, which gave even deeper feelings. The film versions, however, contradicted the seldom supply of goods. Medieval black and white movies have never been as good as they were in those years. I have never seen any technical color of war that would seem as authentic as the deep-sightedness of films like the "Wooden Horse". If it is true that we are always destined to be perceived by the images of our childhood, I admit it freely. And never again, like Leo Genn as a symbolic British film war hero. Not Sir Alec.
