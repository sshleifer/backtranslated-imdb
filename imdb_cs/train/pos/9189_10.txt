Let me begin to say that after watching this episode for the first time on a DVD at 10 PM P.M. One night I could not sleep until 3:00. <br /> <br /> This brief review may contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I am a longtime fan of The Sopranos and I can safely say it's the best episode I've ever seen. I'm not saying everyone should feel, but I'm doing it. This episode is the same as the weekend I spent with my family following my father and coma in the ICU before he passed. The episode begins with Tony in an alternative reality: a businessman who is the identity of a person named Kevin Finnerty. At the time of ten minutes, I knew that either Tony was dreaming or I was watching some other show. It was not like a normal soprano and I loved it. Option 1 is confirmed when Anthony (or "Kevin") looks at the sky on a "helicopter reflector" and we see a doctor with a flashlight. We see it for a moment and the sequence takes place until we return to real life in a situation similar to the one I just said. Tony emerged from the coma for a moment. His boys take A.J. home, and Carmella, overcome by stress, collapses in the corridor: the moment of signing in an episode. For the rest of the episode, we have split into a real world: a family that deals with the potential negative outcome of this coma, and Tony's alternative reality, which cope with what's going on in the mind and the real world around him. <br /> <br /> Then comes the star point in the episode: After AJ He even tells his mother that he has managed to get to school, walks and sees Meadow sitting at Anthony's side. She is approaching Tony and tells the best episode: "Anthony, can you hear us?" In the world, Tony enters the dark hotel room and lights up. He takes his boots and goes to the phone. He tries to dial, but he can not - as if he was trying to say something to Carmella, but he could not physically bring it. Not yet. <br /> <br /> He sits down and looks out the window. The third light that appeared in this episode seems to have seemed from the other side of the city. <br /> <br /> "When it's cold, I'd love to die," Moby is getting married with these last pictures and helping to create an emotional mountain track of an episode. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> You will find out what light is. That's beautiful.
