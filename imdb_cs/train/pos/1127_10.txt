I have seen IPHIGENIU only once, almost thirty years ago, but that has haunted me since then. One sequence, in particular, remains in mind and could only be made by a great director, as is undoubtedly Michael Cacoyanis. <br /> <br /> Context: the weight of history and the mighty army and fleet lie on King Agamemnon's shoulders. The sacrosanct act caused the sea, threatening his great expedition to Troy. He told him he had to sacrifice his daughter, Iphigenia Apollo, to get the sails for thousands of ships. He first resists, but comes around and dares his wife Clytemenstra to bring his daughter to a Greek camp to marry the greatest of all Achilles warriors. Clytemnestra and Iphigenia come, learn about the sacrifice and the fury of the gods for protection and vengeance. Meanwhile, the proud Achilles learns that his name has been used in this fraudulent, dishonest manner. He climbed the hill and told Iphigenia to protect her. <br /> <br /> Shot: The camera crosses two young people without looking directly at each other. They clothe their fate and weakness of people who deceive their loved ones and desire for the war. Suddenly they look at each other and for a moment we feel their strength as well as the beauty and unofficial - in addition to the camera - irony that they could love and be married at another time or elsewhere. It's a sharp and sad epiphany that lasts for a moment. What direction! What a camera! What a story!
