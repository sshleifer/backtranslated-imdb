Another classic study on the effects of wealth on the southern family is masterfully depicted in a written text about the wind. <br /> <br /> Kyle Hadley has everything. Wealth, airplane, you name it. Kyle's best friend, Mitch, always got him out of trouble. Mitch graduated from college, Kyle was fired. Mitch is not a rich home. Kyle's family with Hadley oil controls most of the city. <br /> <br /> Kyle meets New York with the girl of her dreams played by Lauren Bacall. After a romantic storm he married and brought her home. There she meets her father-in-law, who warns her how hard Kyle is. Kyle sleeps with a pistol under the pillow. Bacoll's character meets with Kyle's sister, Mary Lee, a hitchhiker, if ever at all, starring Dorothy Malone, who was voted best supporting actress. Rock Hudson plays Mitch, a loyal friend. br /> <br /> The year of blessedness for Kyle and his bride ends when Kyle is told by a doctor that he can not have children. When his wife finds him really pregnant, Kyle thinks the baby is Mitch, he's a drunken madness and he's accidentally shot on a memorable scene. Mary Lee, who always loved Mitch, tries to but blame Mitch for Kyle's death. Malone, in an unforgettable scene in the courtroom, pulled out all the stops and finally admitted that Kyle's death was an unfortunate accident. Their Oscar was deserved. Robert Stack, great as Kyle Hadley, was nominated for Best Actor and was lost in an impassioned victory by Anthony Quinn, like Paul Gauguin, in Lust for Life. br /> <br /> Douglas Sirk was a filmmaker of the 1950s. Written on the wind is no exception. *** 1/2.
