The story of an imprisoned prisoner who was persecuting the jail was an electric current, killing casual prisoners, and waiting for revenge on the man who framed him. Viggo Mortensen is great and acting is pretty good. Lane Smith is deliciously vicious as a vindicator. Also, this film has some great gore, including the death of barbed wire mummification.
