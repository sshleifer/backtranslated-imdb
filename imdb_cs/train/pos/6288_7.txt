GONE IN 60 SECONDS / (2000) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> "Gone in 60 Seconds" is an energetic, smooth, stylish action scene with a high octane star and plenty of amazing cars. If you are a viewer who is interested in the cars of this production, producer Jerry Bruckheimer ("Con Air", "The Rock"), it is worth seeing just to have eyes on shiny cars. Although the film eliminates the smell of weakness in many areas, its precise sense of action and excitement makes it a slightly successful summer exciting ride. The film stars Giovanni Ribisi (The Mod Squad), a young crocodile named Kip Raines, who opens the film, can not give a long list of expensive cars to the powerful crime of Raymond Calitrim (Christopher Eccleston). When Kip's life is jeopardized due to this, his elder brother Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage), an officer but skillful, is called upon to complete the task in exchange for his brother's survival: steel fifty cars - model, color, year and make- in just four days. Memphis pays the first three days of hiring a bandit team to help him pull the robbery. The crew includes Sara "Sway" Wayland (Angelina Jolie), a sexy and yet frantic murder in a car that recognizes Memphis through a previous business, collaborator Mirror Man (TJ Cross), aging and wise Otto Halliwell (Robert DuVall) Tumbler (Scott Caan) , Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott) and Donny Astricka (Chi McBrde). <br /> <br /> Contribution to the drive and tension of the film is a subplotot involving two police detectives, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant) who suspect from previous experience that Memphis and his crew are no good and Let's look at them carefully. <br /> <br /> There is not much time for character development here; viewers become acquainted with these people, though their robust lifestyle and take on hard personalities through films hard core, stylish atmosphere. To make things even worse for a movie, dialogue can not define characters with a harsh cultural tone. I'm not saying I think thrillers are blossoming and vulgar; I really appreciate the director's decision to keep from extremely dirty language in a movie that could very easily earn a rating of R. But I believe in a movie like "Gone in 60 Seconds" to develop a strong character enlightenment, the dialogue must be credible and authentic. <br /> <br /> Despite the problems, the characters are effective due to the top, perfectly occupied performer. Melodramatic performance by Nicolas Cage is intense and convincing. Angelina Jolie's unsettled appearance is quite right here. Delroy Lindo is deliciously robust and credible. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton and Christopher Eccleston provide convincing supporting roles. The film contains a standard structure with a satisfying first act that handles the style of the story and its personality motifs, sets the pace of the action, but lacks the depth and the strong character. In the second act, we get into a few other problems: the story loses time in much of this segment, it is never created for a third act. While half the film takes a lot of time and the sexual scene provides a solid centerplay scenario, there is not much going on. The Third Law is largely pure adrenaline rush, which contains exciting wall-to-wall excitement and one of the most intense sequences of autofilm ever shot. The soundtrack to "Gone in 60 Seconds" contributes to a great deal of inspirational action scenes. There are scenes like a car hound that makes this film work over several destructive mistakes. Dominic Sena, whose career was mostly directed at advertising, has an appealing style and decisive stance in the article "Gone in 60 Seconds," which gives audiences two hours of excitement, excitement and excitement, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
