Romantic comedies can really go on both sides, you know? You will see one that is really scary and you think you want something more realistic. Then you will see one that is realistic, but it can be too boring to be interested. Or maybe you will see a person who does everything right but simply does not make you a smile. Romantic comedies are heavy movies. You go to them with a lot of expectation, and usually whether you like it, it's just a question of whether the filmmakers anticipate your expectations or those guy or girl next to you. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you have a girl next to you and you are a man like me, it does not really matter if the movie is good, you mean other things. For you, I say, "Go ahead, Tiger!" For the rest of us, we say, "Look at _A Guy Thing_." It's a lot of fun. Because _A Guy Thing_ knows you're getting ready for this movie, so he does not pretend that his "Guy married his wife of dreams, and that's not his wife!" Everyone will make a plot. Sure, maybe you like it, but maybe that's not true, or you think it's cruel. Guy Thing_ covers that. What Guy Thing_ does is fill the best-supporting screen I've seen long ago, so if you do not have the main plotline, you have something else to smile. <br /> <br /> Whether we are talking about experienced veterans of big and small screen such as Larry Miller (Beautiful Woman Best in Show), James Brolin (Traffic), Julie Hagerty (Airplane!), David Koechner Live and Conan O'Brien regularly, dirty work, Austin Powers II) or Thomas Lennon (State and Viva Variety), or new faces like Shawn Hatosy (faculty) or Colin Foo (Saving Silverman), talking about a bunch of highly talented and experienced actors who know exactly how to use the inspired film characterization, steal the show from time to time and still conceal a piece of energy and joy seldom seen in romantic comedies today. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This does not mean that it would make it impossible for the romantic crawl to take place and the stars that carry it because it is very sweet and terribly well done. Jason Lee (Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, etc.) Touching a young professional whose life may slip out of control, and Selma Blair shows the subtlety in showing the ambitious and sophisticated career each guy wants to take except for the guy who really Yippee. <br /> <br /> But the success of the film falls on Julie Stiles, the right girl in the right place in the wrong time, and she wears her well. No, because, I do not know when, I saw an actress in a romantic comedy that loved her so much to love her. Of course, it's all in detail, voice and gentle smiles, but it's magical, and it's one of the main reasons why we go to the movies first. But Julie Stiles's slightly extraordinary sophistication would be lost if it was not that the rest of the cast is so incredibly dead in its classical simplicity. It's a movie that draws a broken world of incompatible stock, cause it to fall on you to make you laugh, and then come with a big heart. Guy Thing is a movie You surely saw it before, and the creators knew it clearly when they went out to do it. Since Shakespeare we have not seen any new romantic comedies; the relative success of this or one is entirely dependent on the performance of the classic story of a boy meeting a girl. Guy Thing hugs it with a bit of a metacinem border, often scenes into absurd, to give the audience a chance to recognize strong emotions and an old fence triggering device. <br /> <br /> For the record, they even blend in with the somewhat traditional gender and gender structural concepts that are at the heart of any romantic comedy, so even feminists can get kicked there. <br /> <br /> And boys, I think we can all agree that we want our friends to be in this movie as cool as Jason Lee's friends. I'm not going to spoil you, but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why she's a pharmacist and a clothing salesman among the smartest boys in the cinema, I'd just say, "It's Guy's thing," and let it go.
