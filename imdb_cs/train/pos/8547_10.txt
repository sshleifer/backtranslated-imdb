A lot of people hated this movie, but I accused them of two facts - 1 - They want it to be too much like the first couple of American Pie movies. and 2 - trying to take it too seriously. The one I found was the best of all six and I totally love Dwight. The plot is predictable, I will say, but then what is teen comedy NOT? Road Trip, Dirty Deeds, etc. They are all incredibly predictable but damn fun! I say it's worth watching, I love it, I find it fun. Just do not look, but compare them with the first because it's nothing like that. After watching Naked Mile and this it became obvious that all American Pie movies were around, Stiflers. Which is FINE for me. <br /> <br /> Watch. Enjoy. Love. xD
