Some elements of this film are, of course, dated. All white male crew, for example. And like most of the science fiction before the war, it tends to admire too much. But no film ever caught the taste of scientific fiction "Golden Age" as it did, even down to the use of "electronic tonalities" to provide a musical score. Robbie's robot embodied the Asimov robots and was the inspiration for everything that followed, from C3PO to the data. Of course the boundaries of the plot are Shakespeare's "The Tempest". Morbius is a prosperous and exile wizard who finds his kingdom attacked by interlopers ... It was a film that worked out Science Fiction as an adult genre, perhaps the first.
