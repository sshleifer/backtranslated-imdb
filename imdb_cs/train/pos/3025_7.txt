Bacall is here well - especially with regard to this is just her second film. This is often overshadowed because it falls between two great achievements: "Have and Do not" (1944) and "Big Sleep" (1945), both of which merged with Humphrey Bogart. I admit it can not be compared to other films, but I think it's not a mistake in itself. I think somebody was indignant by portraying her as a British girl. No accent. I think all the strange accents scattered - Boyer was certainly not a spy. It was hard to keep what people are coming from. <br /> <br /> I really liked black and white cinematography. Mood is accustomed to great influence - especially I liked the misty scene. Lighting also greatly contributes to intrigues and tensions. <br /> <br /> Bacall is just gorgeous. Boyer simply does not fit into the role of romance as a leading man - so with Bacall he was a little weird. It's not a great chemistry - and definitely no Bogie and Bacall spells. But I really liked this picture. There is great tension and it moves well enough. I have to say that I found the murder of a little girl who is so brave for this film. <br /> <br /> Katina Paxina and Peter Lorre act as a supporting actress. Paxinou as a hotel businessman is totally vicious and evil in her portrayal. Her one scene where she laughs maniacally when Mr. Muckerji leaves after putting her as a child killer is quite worrying. Lorre also takes good care of his slim, snake portrait of Conteras - a dirty coward to the end. Wanda Bendrix is ​​also very well dedicated to portraying Else's baby - especially since she was her first shot and at that time she was only 16 years old (though she seems to be much younger). It turned out that she later married Auie Murphy, who turned out to be a short, stormy marriage.
