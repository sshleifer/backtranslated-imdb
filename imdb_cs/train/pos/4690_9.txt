Twenty-five years ago, I have shown this film in some children's classes in entomology, and I still remember the excitement of children; were enchanted! It's not just the termites who built and lived in the "Hradištích from clay", but also about other animals that use the mounds. There is a fantastic scene in which the cobra fights with the monitor lizard while the Mongoos clock colony. It's not only good for entomological classes but also for ecology teaching because there are so many interactions between termites and other organisms and the whole ecology of all the organisms that live in and around the graves. <br /> <br /> I wish it was available on DVD so I could watch it again and show it to others.
