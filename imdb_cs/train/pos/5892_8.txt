Thomas Ince has always been inclined to bring simple stories about family life with fullness and taste. "Italian" is such a movie. Solid acting, especially George Beban, the father of a quiet child's actor, George Beban, Jr., and gorgeous sets bring a realistic feeling of early immigrant dwellings in New York. These give this film in 1915 authenticity that is unusual in the characteristics of this year. The film begins with a modern day, and a man (George Beban in modern clothes) reads the story of an Italian immigrant, and then we go into the story of George playing immigrants. He raises enough money to bring his fianc√© from Italy to America, marry her and have a son with her. But times are hard and the family is trying to survive. I found out that I was wondering why my mother was breastfeeding her baby and avoiding complications with a dirty recipe, but well, even the early dream Factory promoted political behavior in 1915 for women! <br /> The best scene in the picture is when Beban has a chance to avenge the crime boss who has inadvertently put him in jail, and at the last minute he decides against his planned move. Very elegant. I loved the curtain effect, it was great. Wonderful use of lighting in this movie. <br /> <br /> I give Italy 8 of 10.
