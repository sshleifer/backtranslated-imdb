"De Vierde Man" (Fourth Man, 1984) is considered one of the best European thrillers of the eighties. This latest work by Dutch director Paul Verhoeven in his home country before moving to Hollywood to become a major star with films such as Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Starship Troopers is about a psychopathic and disappointed author (Jeroen Krabbe ) to go to the sea for recovery. There she meets the mysterious femme fatale (Renee Soultendieck) and begins a fateful affair with her. She becomes addicted to her heart and soul and finds her three previous husbands have died with mysterious circumstances ... "De Vierde Man" is much influenced by old Hollywood movie noir and psycho thrillers Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Wells. It took a lot of time to create a dark and gripping atmosphere and a few moments of extreme graphic violence has the right impact to push the story straight ahead. The tension is sometimes almost unbearable and sometimes resembles the works of Italian cult director Dario Argento. Cast is also excellent, particularly Krabb's performance as a mentally disturbed writer who opened the doors for his international film career ("Living Daylight", "The Fugitive"). If you have the opportunity to watch this brilliant psycho thriller on TV, video or DVD, do not miss it!
