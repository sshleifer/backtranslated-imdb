Wow! I've seen so many bad low-budget movies recently, but this is great. A very realistic depiction of police life in the city on the coast of East Germany is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series. I loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of a predominant clich√© about the police. This movie is realistic as documentation and fun as a drama at the same time. Perfect Trade!
