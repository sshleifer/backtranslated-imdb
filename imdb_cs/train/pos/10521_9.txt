Well, I think I'm emotionally connected to this movie because it's the first thing I've seen seeing more than ten times in the cinema ... it helps me in my diploma thesis or rather let me work on it! <Br /> <br /> But after we look at it a few years later (and many other movies) - it's a well-made little jewel! I have never seen Gwyneth Paltrow in a more convincing performance, and Jeremy Northam is the perfect Mr. Knightley - where do you meet such a man? Sophie Thompson is like Ms. Bates's virtuoso actress best (oh, napkins, sorry!) and the rest of the cast is not disappointing - Toni Colette brings a lot of Muriel to her Harriet and Ewan McGregor is convincingly charming - and Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson are the perfect "impossible" pair! Of course, sets and costumes and a beautiful soundtrack contribute a lot to the feelings of almost the Hobbiton atmosphere of the film - though with regard to cinematography and artistic decoration, it is almost a case of visual overload. Very nice, but a little more economical would mean a better feeling of the season. But the good thing is that the movie does not suffer too seriously and there is plenty of fun - and some really great editing - that prevents her from diving into the Merry Old England sacharin. <br /> <br /> My favorite is the ball scene - some beautiful acting and direction, and the final dance summarizes the relationship between Emma and Mr. Knightley beautifully. It is a shame that the final design scene takes only a little too long - a cut with two shots (I can think exactly about which one!) And it would be much more in line with the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> God, I just realize (I read imdb statements) that I saw Jeremy Northam in at least three movies without realizing it was he - he seems to have much more for him than actor than just being a gentleman's English heart! Hmm, I guess I have to pay a video store visit ... <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie. My most popular adaptation by Jane Austen - though perhaps Ang Lee's sense and sensitivity is strictly speaking of the better film, this is closest to my heart - and I've seen it more! See if you can - and do not be too difficult for your little shortcomings. <br /> <br />
