And that's not because of her days on "Clarissa explaining it all" that I had a little crush on Melissa Joan Hart, which at the time this show was popular was already well into her 20s but she was still able to get teenage role. "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch" was another big Hart jump after her "Clariss" days. Based on a comic, Sabrina Spellman - you guessed it! - A teenage witch who tries to balance her witchcraft with the demands of everyday life of adolescents. She helped her in her efforts with her two aunts and wise cracking a black cat when she goes from high school, to college, and ultimately to her journalist career. As usual, Hart is a show of heart and soul. "Sabrina, Teenage Witch" is quite funny and very sad and it's a shame that it took me so long to realize how great it is. I just wish there were some newer episodes that we could all enjoy. 10/10
