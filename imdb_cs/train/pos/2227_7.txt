It will have overviews across the map, because it does not fit in any form incompatible. It's terrible - but it's not a splatterfest. It's an equal part of Suspend, just like Horror - but without the usual Hollywood shouts and jerky camera. <br /> <br /> Feel the film is spare and slim beside any special effects because I think you should listen and watch the faces of the characters. <br /> <br /> Forget that Brendan is a graduate of Buffy's universe. This is a herring. He's acting here. "Camp" is an incorrect description of the tone of this story. Adrienne Barbeau gives rock solid performance - so she must believe the script has something to say. We all know justifiable justification when the actors do not care and just wait for the director to catch "Cut" and get his paychecks. This is not the case here. Forgive the fact that the bodies begin to fall with almost mondo-fun regularity. I think the intention was not humorous - but to keep you in balance. <br /> <br /> Think less about horror film and more about the 'Play' horror on stage - it destroyed the white house. Then you could see that it is paranoia, fear and a spiral of madness in the isolated US environment. Time trips, mind control, secret experiments, and the Nazis who may not be dead. . . let's say we rent it and try it out if you're in the mood for a bit of a brain. That would be a good choice for Saturday midnight.
