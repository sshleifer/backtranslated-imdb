"Invisible Mouse" is a wonderful and different Tom & Jerry cartoon. Includes common walks and battles with cats and mice, this time differently. Jerry accidentally falls into the bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very happy because he realizes that Tom can prepare many "surprises", scare him, suffer him and confuse him. <br /> <br /> As weird, it's also cool and fun to see what we do not see: Jerry invisible. It's fun to see things get up in the air without seeing who does it (we know who it is?) - it's like things have their own life or even almost like a ghost thing. It is equally fun to see Jerry eat some candy and fruit while invisible. I really like this instrumental music that's played when it's not visible. Some of the best jokes on this short one are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and kills him, and even if Tom tries to throw him in the pan, Jerry writes: "I've lost myself." I also like Jerry drinking Tom's chocolate milk, reappearing and liking his face. Overall, this short foundation is the basic ingredient required for classic artwork: humor, entertainment, entertainment and entertainment. some pretty artwork too.
