Straight Story is a multilevel survey of America's beauty and beauty. On one level, they slowly pass through the heart, they are kind people and amber grains, on another level, they get older and remember what is important (and we actively forget what is not). David Lynch gives us time in this movie and helps me to remember that so much can be said in silence. A remarkable film that gently rests with me for some time.
