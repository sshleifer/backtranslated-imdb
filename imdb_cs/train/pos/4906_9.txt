I do not believe it was a challenge for Richard Harris. It was an uncomplicated plot, yet interesting. It's a good movie that you can watch if you do not want to do a lot of thinking, just want to be told by a simple story. The Canadian landscape was breathtaking. The beautiful shots of the fall made a picture that is worth seeing.
