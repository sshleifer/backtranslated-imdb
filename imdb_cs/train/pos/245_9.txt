The only reason I wanted to see it was because of Orlando Bloom. Simply put, the film was enormously average. It's not bad, but it's not really good. Editing is good; The film is well-paced. Direction is competent and confident. The story is fruitful. The film is usually Ledger, Bloom, and Normally Great Watts and Rush. Accents are indispensable if you're from the USA, so just sit back and enjoy the scenery (or how I like to say, Orlando Bloom). By the end of the movie I was bored or moved. Some people have asked what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the film. I have to say that it did not happen to me like that. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the only reason I can recommend is that Orlando Bloom shows a bit of a hint of scope (although often, the present "I'm pretty and confused" appearance is prominent) so fangirls can consider price matinee price. Other than that, you just do not see. It's neither good nor bad enough to be fun.
