The Secret of Kell is one of the most unique, beautiful and enchanting animated films I've ever seen. Before I watched this movie, I was convinced that nothing could give up her money and that it was a win in this category, but I found a serious candidate in Kells. <br /> <br /> The secret of Kells tells the story of a young orphan, named Brendan, who lives with his uncle Kell. Eat is a loving guard, but perhaps too strenuous and much more interested in amplifying the walls around the city from the next Viking attacks than when he behaves to the boy's imagination. When legendary brother Aidan (who looks surprisingly like Willie Nelson) appears and takes the boy under his wing, Brendan walks into the woods and meets the beautiful Aisling forest nymph that he likes (and saves his life more than once) . With Aisling's help, he tries to save the city and help his brother, Aidan, complete a mystical book that legends can darken again.
