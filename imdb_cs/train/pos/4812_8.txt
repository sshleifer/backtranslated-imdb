I was initially forced to visit my wife because she is fascinated by the royal families of Britain and their history, and she will not go to the movies without me. Although viewers should not expect to be electrified, this film is very well made and its visual aspect is dim. In many ways, it helps to distract the myth that Victoria was a desperate, helpless blonde woman we usually see in the photos. She was clear intelligent and according to the history of her early years, a fun loving happy young woman. Her love for Albert was the essence of true love, and even if you only counted the number of children she gave birth (9), they had to have a passionate relationship. All this is well known in the movie. For that purpose, the cast was well chosen with both Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend, who gave a sound performance like Victoria and Albert. SPOILER ALERT Historical accuracy is somewhat controversial because Prince Albert gets shot in defense of Victoria. There was at least one when trying to kill when they were together, but no one was hit by shots. I also learned that there is little that little has been done to extend the allegedly intimate relationship between Victor's mother and Sir John Conroy. It is likely that this relationship is a real reason for Victoria's reluctance for her mother and for Conroye. I also found it a special attempt to portray the relationship between Victoria and Lord Melbourne as a romantic mistake, or at least have the potential to become romantic. It was already in his late 1950s, when Victoria came to the throne, and while the marriage between older men and young women was common at that time, the film portrayed Melbourne as sympathetic to Prince Albert. There were seemingly rivals to Albert, but she could never have gotten a little under her station in life, and Albert was one of only a handful who would be acceptable in any case. Overall, I spent worse times in the cinema, and tiny spots with my wife can not be a bad thing either.
