When I was a little girl (and my father owned a video rental), this was one of my favorite films. Since then, I have not heard much about it, nor have I forgot anything about it because it was forgotten in connection with other, probably better films, Don Bluth. I managed to track it a few weeks ago, and I was pleasantly surprised. The meeting in New Orleans in the 1930s, the animation is wonderful and the songs are unforgettable. There are a couple of plush in continuity if you look so hard, but generally will not touch the story that lets you smile (and perhaps even a little hazy eyes if you are a lover of animals). Characters are believable (maybe a little too adult for younger observers). Two paws and those of you who have not seen it for a while are definitely worth watching again.
