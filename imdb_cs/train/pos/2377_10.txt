I waited a long time for someone to make the honest version of the classic novel H.G. Wells "War of the Worlds". Timothy Hines finally did! I just could not believe how good it is! From acting to costume, outside of this world special effects, I just can not say enough! It was great! Dramatic, intense, full of first-rate performances by top actor! He must be seen to have believed them. Certainly not. And I read all the negative comments of others and I do not believe what they say. We had to watch another movie, huh? And the really bad comments of the Vpsaian guy, guy, no matter who he is, well, he just does not know what he's talking about. Keep a good job, sir. Hines.
