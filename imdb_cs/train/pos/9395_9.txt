If you like a plot, it's your movie. In no time can we foresee what will happen next. Nothing is as it seems or ends, as you think it will be. Characters are ubiquitous and engaging. Cage is at his best. Dennis Hopper again shows his beautiful ominous page. JT Walsh is perfect in his latest performance. Laura Boyle spoke. Dwight Yoakum makes the film debut great in the portrait. I categorize this movie as "I have a really, really, really bad day" movie. This movie is not a slow minute. True sleep. This film is underestimated and unfortunately overlooked.
