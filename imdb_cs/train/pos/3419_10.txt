Having an "old daughter at the age of 23" in Iraq, the Camp Anaconda medical department, I felt compelled to get this DVD. I wanted to hear other feelings of returning veterinarians to try to better understand her mentality on arrival and not wait until something went wrong. Regardless of the fact that you are in war and peace, this movie serves as a great start for all Americans to begin to heal our return vets emotional emptiness. The primary statement of the whole film is "take action" on this issue. An incredibly emotional film. I would highly recommend this movie to a veteran veteran of the whole mature family and ask them to follow with a plan to listen to comfort to help the return of veterans of the Persian Gulf War. <br /> <br /> Fast forward almost a year later & My daughter saw this DVD. She took note of her emotions and actually committed to return for the next six years. Her time spent in the sand is that she has done something good. Local Balad children received the first medical treatment for various common illnesses that they usually can not afford with an escort and a free translator. She looked over her shoulder to tour Iraq. "We've changed some hearts and minds" Big DVDs have to have an open mind and see all sides
