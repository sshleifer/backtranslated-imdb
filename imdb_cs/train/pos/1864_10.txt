I just watched Antwon Fisher at BRAVO. What a wonderful movie and an incredible young man. This film must be seen for anyone who is concerned with how to overcome child abuse and abandonment as adults. Denzel Washington has an excellent performance, just like a young man playing Antwon Fisher. Kleenex alert - Feel good and tearful. The greatest heart rate is when he finally meets his mother, whom he took at the age of 2 months. And one of the most daring was when he stood at his insulting mother and sister. I saw this movie on Bravo in 2008 and I just wished to know about it years ago. Definitely the movie I have to add to my DVD collection.
