I first saw Ice Age in the Subiaco cinemas when it was out in '02. At that time, I was only 13, but I still liked it. It was a bit warm. We've been on the video for years, and no matter how many times you look at it, it's never bored. It's because of one element that distinguishes it from all other 3D animations created at that time - The characters have no "home" that leaves. They are nomads, and it is really refreshing and uplifting to watch. Also, every individual figure on the surface looks like they're just getting together, but they're really all good friends. Also all characters have their own spells (even bad guys). Sid Lenoch is charming in his annoying, supernatural and naive way. Manny is adorable in his depressing, detached nature, and so on, and so on. Another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation. All environments and characters were originally molded by clay, giving the film an artistic touch. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that increases the feeling of the film is that sex means very little. There are hardly any female characters, but you really do not realize that after you watch it several times and even then it only has little effect on the way you view the movie. Because of this, there is no mention of a nuclear family that would be really pathetic in an environment like ice age. Overall, Ice Age is a great movie and is proof of how much effort was put into 3D animation before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out.
