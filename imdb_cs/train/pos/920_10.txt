This cute animated short contains two comic icons - Betty Boop and Henry. Henry is a bald, slightly crazy boy from comics who never talk. <br /> <br /> But here he is talking! <br /> <br /> He wants to get a puppy out of Betty Boop's Animal Shop, and when he's in store he's in the store - some funny hijinks to follow. Betty sings the animal song, Henry gets to battle with birds and monkeys, but it all works.
