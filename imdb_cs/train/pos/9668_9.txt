It's a small movie, few characters, theater. Still, there is something about Ireland that you will not find elsewhere. This film is Ireland. Everything is crazy, it's sadness, it's self-delusion. Boys, Master Doyle, SP O'Donell, Cannon, Senator Doogan's daughter, Gar and, above all, Madge. I know them. I'm in a pub or kneeling to pray with them. They are our sad history and they are our presence.
