It was a wonderful presentation. Hemo (blood) as a Greek god was so well played with animation with vanity, arrogance, snob supremacy, and innocent miracle. The quote (or scene) that I remember alive is when Hemo tires "all that plumbing ... you have not learned my secret at all" and threatens to set off, the scientist answers him to the only word "Thalassa" salty water that scares Fiction Writer but calms Hemo and so neatly into the chemical aspects of blood. <br /> <br /> Such a wonderful mixture of entertainment and information make it classic as fresh and breathtaking as the day it was released. Stimulating interest and imagination is essential for teaching children to love learning.
