This film is at odds with the first as far as the origins of bear care and the care of bears are concerned. I do not deny it. However, if you look at "Part II" as a stand-alone movie, then it's a very good movie. I remember watching it in the early 1980s (and I began to feel the demographic audience) and totally loved him much more than the first movie (not that I did not like it, it's just a little extra ). It's certainly darker than the first, but maybe it's because it's so good. And it is dark and deep in its fine form (the kids may not quite understand, but it can still be a little bit afraid because of the atmosphere they make, and the adults who are watching will surely speed up because I've been watching this movie again in my in the mid-twenties), where you basically have a young girl who negotiates for a bad spirit / demon in exchange for something else. Get Image? But I simply observe it as a child, of course, as I said, it may have been a little scary, but nothing traumatic. In fact, if something gave me another fantasy game I could play when I was old. I can not tell you how many times I pretended that the Dark Heart wanted to imprison me, helped to catch Care bears, try to move me to his dark side and other things, the film was also good for my imagination. And it also has a great emotional depth. I've seen it at least once a week. Hadley Kay was also the perfect choice for the voice of a dark heart (I always thought it and I always). <br /> <br /> Now it's just bad that they never made a soundtrack. Sometimes I just want to hear Growing up without watching the movie as good. <br /> <br /> "What kind of love and care is there when she can not save her?"
