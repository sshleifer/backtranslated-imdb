This series was rendered over the rest of the TV detective series of the day, but certainly did not find the audience. The idea of ​​a blind detective may not be entirely new, but it has added so many stories. And who could forget Pax, a great guide in the show! While the stories themselves were no better than the average series, settings in New Orleans, acting and music (I note the note on the musical score in the other comments ... I remember it clearly) all the work to make good TV series even better! <br /> <br /> Well, you never know ... one day Paramount can only dig into his archives and release it on DVD!
