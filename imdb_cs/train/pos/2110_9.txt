So much was written about the film, the amazing performance, the script, the melancholy, the warm-hearted atmosphere, the great direction - what can I add? Just look at one of the most warmth of the heart, beautifully acting, horror scenes sometimes shot. It's Christmas Eve and the character of Frank Morgan (the shop owner - Mr. Matuschek) is recovering from the broken marriage and attempted suicide. As each of his employees leaves, he invites them to the Christmas dinner. Each of them is politely removed. They all have plans for their own Christmas evening. At this stage there is deep sadness on this moving scene. Frank Morgan gives his career a career, and this scene easily leads me to tears. Fortunately, we have a happy denouncer on this extraordinary scene. A new employee, boy, is the last one to leave the shop in a beautiful snowy street scene. Desperately, Mr. Matuschek approaches this boy and asks him how he would like to spend the evening with him, he will treat him with all the wonderful Christmas dishes that he has never seen! The guy is overwhelmed, lonely like Mr. Matuschek, and they can have a great Christmas meal together. Every time I see this scene, it moves me. If you can get a wonderful DVD view of a great trailer with Frank Morgan, who will introduce himself as Mr. Matuschek and the performance of the film director - talented Ernest Lubitsch. This movie is joy from beginning to end.
