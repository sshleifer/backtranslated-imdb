I first saw this movie more than 25 years ago on British television, and last week I caught him again on DVD a copy of eBay purchased. I remembered the music sequences, the color and the beautiful fashion plate made up of clothes, but the conspiracy is weaker than the earlier film Anna Neagle / Michael Wilding Spring in Park Lane, and Maytime does not hide the transition. But Michael Wilding is in the movie joy, charming, funny, loving, it seems he has great fun and the top of his mold. It is for him alone. Anna Neagle looks a little matron beside him and a little too old for her role, but by the end of the 1940s, their film partnerships have been well established with cinematography. Spring in Lane Park was a hit for 1947 and a big producer of money. In his autobiography, Wilding has long written his attention to Herbert Wilcox, the director and instigator of this series of films in London.
