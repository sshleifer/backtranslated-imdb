My Super Ex-Girlfriend is a funny movie no less. <br /> <br /> The story is silently simple. Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny (Uma Thurman) in the subway and joins her. At the beginning of his relationship, everything seems to be all right, but Matt finds out that he is G-Girl. At first, Matt looked great, but G-Girl proved to be very jealous and needed. So she decides to break her up and join her colleague Hanna (Anna Faris). This makes G-Girl very crazy and she starts to avenge her ex-boyfriend. What I liked best in the movie are scenes where G-Girl avenges Matt. It was also nice to see Anna Faris in a role other than her character from a haunted movie saga. I give this movie 7 out of 10 and I recommend it to everyone who likes a nice comedy.
