Meryl Streep is brilliant in her nuanced and stoic performance as infamous Lindy Chamberlain, who was accused and attempted to allegedly kill her own child Azaria Chamberlain and used her alibi clever dingoes as her defense. Based on the book "Evil Angels" and titled in his Australian release, CRY IN THE TARK is an ugly film to watch. It is a scenario that is too realistic for us in America: hunting for a witch against a person considered an easy target. Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. Being someone who spoke to her, someone who did not play the sympathy card, and someone who was strong enough to continue her life despite her terrible misery was identified as suspicious and hated for understanding, even though it was clear she did not kill herself child. The media began to tighten the cord and the invasion of privacy, which soon had the whole state stuck to their ensembles when they bred this family piece by piece. Despite all this, Lindy remained as stoic as ever, even though her husband Michael had broken apart. This attitude is, of course, a force of power, as obscene as it may seem, and people are strongly reacting to it. They want to see an upset motherly plaque, cry and sometimes disappear at every step, do not sit and look empty. People do not understand that not everyone is suffering the same way, and when someone decides to become strong, speculation begins. Meryl Streep embodies this humiliated woman on her grip and creates a cold, but not incomprehensible, woman whose conviction is, even if her freedom is. Because of it, Sam Neill is allowed to let his character slowly dissolve into despair - somebody must, or the Chamberlains would be too detachable and no one would want to see it. In addition to the monster that became new at the time of writing. They will always eat train wrecks up and feed the rusty dung to uninformed public.
