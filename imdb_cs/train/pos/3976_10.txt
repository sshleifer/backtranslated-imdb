I just saw Drugs on VH1 and I like it. I think it reflects the history of drugs very well, and most importantly, it has a strong message to all generations. There is wood, there are Joplin's, Hendrix's and Jim Morrison's death, there are many examples of drug use and drug abuse. It completely covers the time line and the development of drug use in America in both good and bad ways. In my opinion, this document is well done and I would like to congratulate the creators of this document, because that is exactly what is needed on TV these days. I'm waiting for a DVD release. You should definitely see it! This movie is amazing - BIG TIME!
