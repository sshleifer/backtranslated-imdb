Some movies seem to be made before we're ready for them. When I was watching this movie, made in 1988, in 1999, I thought I was looking at O.J. Simpson's debacle (although I have very different views on the innocence of individuals in every situation). The Australian news media, if this film is to be believed, ate the case of possible crime and the truth was left as an idea. It was frightening to see the scenes of invasive, full of hordes of the media, the ridiculous explanation of half-truths and lies and the debate about the presumed merits of the case by persons at all levels of society. Just as frightening is the display of the media as indifferent and the misunderstanding of technical information in the given case. I would like more religious beliefs to happen in this case (the seven-day Adventists are accused). Today, these circuses become common, but they make the lesson more important. /> <br /> Streep is as good as usual and that's the best I've ever seen Sam Neill. Aussie accents sometimes a little dense but not incomprehensible.
