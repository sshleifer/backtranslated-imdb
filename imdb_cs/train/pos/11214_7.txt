It was the first movie "Walking Tall" that I saw, I think at the 2 dollar cinema along Hollywood Blvd. , so I had no reference to the first installment made by Joe Don Baker. I remember being shocked by McNair's corrupt system and the brutality of "gangs." I was also surprised by the fact that one man decided he did not want to slip and went to do something about it. Courageous? I thought so - until the point at which the vibration sent to me. I think this movie is a great story about the American courage to stand up and do something about a system that serves only its own interest. I was pretty blown and thought it's still one of the best hero / anti-hero genres that could laugh, but it also includes recent movies like The Punisher, but even more so because it's a true story. A recent remake with the star "Rock" just does not make justice a real fire in the story of Buford Pusser. <br /> <br /> "Classic", which I'm sure will appear again in the future.
