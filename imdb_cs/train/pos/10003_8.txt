This is not a typical Mel Brooks movie. It was much less stupid than most of his films, and he actually had a conspiracy that followed. Leslie Ann Warren shot the movie, she's such a fantastic, unattainable actress. There were times that could have improved a bit, and some scenes that might have been truncated to do the job, but overall it is worth to rent and see. All the performance was good overall, Brooks himself did a good job without telling his character directly to the audience. Warren was again the best actor in the movie, but "Fume" and "Sailor" both played well.
