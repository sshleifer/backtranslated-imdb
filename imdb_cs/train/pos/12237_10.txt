Pairing is a charming, awesome film of the time it has gone through. Hollywood must take into account the charming remake of this film. My wife and I would see it. It's a great romantic comedy with which we and AMC looked at my wife. This movie has Tony Randall's best. Debbie Reynolds is great, as always. <br /> <br /> He loved it. We plan to order on DVD and add to our growing collection of films. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Hollywood has no such movies anymore. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood .... Time to dig out some of these types of scripts from the old vault, update them a bit (without damaging the original movie and script as you did with other remakes) and hold the casting call. <br /> <br /> The remake would be a big hit on the silver screen, the DVD and the cable / SATTV. <br /> <br /> SN Austin, TX
