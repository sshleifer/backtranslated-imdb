When you are in a gloomy or depressing mood, look at this movie. It shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday environment and is very encouraging, especially from a feminist and humanistic perspective. When you know both the Turkish language and the Danish or German language, watch the movie in any case. Half of the dialogue is in the original Danish, synchronized with the German in the translated version, the other half Turkish, the subtitles in Danish or German. When I watched it in German Mannheim, the reaction of Turkish audiences showed that there must be a lot of humor in the Turkish dialogue, which, most of all, I was miserably escaped, only imperfectly depicted in the titles. Still, the film is interesting, even if you do not have enough knowledge about Turkish. <br /> <br /> Aesthetically, the film plays a lot about speed and slowness. At first sight, a lot of body movement is fast as lightning, making it a fast, disturbed movie. Especially, while it's Kung Fu, beware of running scenes that are beautifully expressing a lot of emotions. But there are also quite a few slow, emotionally intense scenes. And above all, characters are developing much more slowly than you would expect in a dramatic show of age; there is still some movement in attitudes: Closer observation of the villain Omar, whose part and acting I really liked. The contrast of speed and silence nicely contributes to the display of human anger and dignity - displayed at once, simultaneously with the same characters.
