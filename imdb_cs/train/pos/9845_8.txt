I will not lie, it's a great movie. I saw it about 4 months ago at my local theater. I saw it a second time and I was somewhat bored in slow scenes. Sid (lenocha) is not all flattering, but Diego (a mountain lion, I think) is really good in the movie. The animation is excellent and the story has a touch end. It is considered that kids 10 and below, but teens would probably find it a little boring. Also uniqueness in characters is so interesting. As I said, it's a pretty good movie, but I would have rated "Toy Story 2" or "Shrek" higher. 8/10
