A good image is worth all the words. This film has the most poetic scene she has ever dreamed about with Down syndrome. And I will not mess with telling you. You will want to see it yourself. <br /> <br /> Pasqual Duquenne is an amazing actor. I did not have to understand the only word he said to understand his meaning. The film has its own magic. After watching it, I better understand that we place too much emphasis on success and the people we love are not enough. Passion and simplicity are all we need.
