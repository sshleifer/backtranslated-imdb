The third and final part of the trilogy Bourne (duh) is missing a bit in the story of the department, but it covers the extensive action scenes! Particular attention is paid especially twice, and this movie is better. The director and the star (Damon) agreed that the last part is hard to find a story because the end of the second film was quite ... an advanced story-wise. How did they get around? Action scenes were once given, but they did another thing I can not detect because it would be a spoiler. But if you look at the movie, you can not see it! Perhaps I read that this adaptation of the Bourne books is the least accurate of all three films, if that means something else to you: o)
