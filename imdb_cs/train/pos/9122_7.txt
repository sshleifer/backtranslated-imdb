Purple Rain is a great movie if you are a music lover with 40 things that was involved in Prince's music in the eighties. The story is a very used formula: Growing musical talent must overcome personal and professional obstacles to find its audience and self-esteem. Prince is a bad actor, but his performance, especially the Purple Rain / I Die 4 U, is worth sitting in the movie. He is alone and as a performer, as powerful on the scene as Mick Jagger or Michael Jackson, circa Thriller. Apollonia Kotero, a former prince protector, is beautiful and shows some acting talent and a hemisphere with the prince, but her screenplay does not leave her far. Den Morris and other supporting actors provide comedy elements.
