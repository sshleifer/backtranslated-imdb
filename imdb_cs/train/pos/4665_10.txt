I first saw this movie about 11 years ago, when I was recommended by my former college professor of accounting. I was amazed that the film from 1968 was so comprehensively and cheerfully a computer crime. Maggie Smith is beautiful and Ustinov perfectly plays a "retro hacker". "About Nolo Mio" !!!!!
