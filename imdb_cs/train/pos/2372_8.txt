I just watched after my mother brought me back from America, wondering that I was following all these negative comments, but I have to say that acting is deep, some of them ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But you have to remember that it was supposed to be in 1898 not 2005, and I thought it was quite good for such a low budget. I enjoyed this version much more than the Spielberg version I saw last week. I've read the book so many times, and I find that I'm going "ahh yes, that's in the book" almost all the time, with the second version almost nothing in the book. So good at least trying to make the right version.
