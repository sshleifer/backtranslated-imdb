Actually, I never bought into metal was Satanic and so, but this movie was playing this idea. Although it is certainly not a movie that would take serious or very high, it serves its purpose in having fun while playing. The story has a metal band in their hotel that fired at their hotel, one of the fans has a dream about it and said the band is starting to go from the murder of the graves. So yes, a bit of a "Nightmare on Elm Street" plot plotting here. Since Freddy had never done any harm to the girl in the car. Another movie was a heavy metal band, but it was very different as it was because it had a band that took over the city of children and went crazy. This simply has a single group fan as he first assists the assassin, then tries to stop him. Nothing that would be terrible, because I do not remember so many bloody killers. Frankly speaking, the scene I remember the most is the scene of a girl who wears headphones, and then is betrayed by a creature of the band's incarnation. Nothing great but pleasant filling time.
