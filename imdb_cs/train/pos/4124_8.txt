Lloyd Bridges as Mike Nelson and his ship were all stars of this series. What made me so good when I saw that it was a real feeling he was underwater. The show shows youthful energy for underwater exploration that is contagious. The exhibition was also educational and showed the audience that they are diving from someone who seems to be a perfect professional, Mike Nelson. They were great shows and the program always seemed to be well produced. He thought drama in scenarios sometimes hit the same notes in more than one episode, but each show keeps on its own with any other show that was produced during this era, the childhood of American television.
