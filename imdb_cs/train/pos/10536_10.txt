Yes ... I'm going with this 1-0 and here's the reason. In the last few years, I have watched a lot of comedies and left with only a few laughs and several video rental shops that could forget about later fees. Then I came across "nothing". It seemed interesting, but it did not expect much. I was wrong. It was probably one of the funniest movies I've ever had the chance to watch. Dave and Andrew make a great comedy couple, and humor is catchy enough to remember, but not too complicated to the missing joke. I do not want to comment on any real scenes, because I feel it's a movie worth seeing once. With more and more unnecessary concepts coming to the movies (you know, like killer military nozzles and "fresh" remakes that destroy old classics), this movie will tell you that it's OK to laugh "Nothing."
