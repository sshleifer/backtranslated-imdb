"8 SIMPLE RULES ... TO RECORD MY DAY HOLIDAYS" is, in my opinion, an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure I did not see every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. I think it was always funny when an accident occurred. I always laughed at it. Despite the fact that James Garner and David Spade were good, I liked the show when John Ritter was the lead man. If you ask me, his sudden crawling was very tragic. Everybody always gave good performance, the design was magnificent, the costumes were well designed, and the writing was always very strong. Finally, I hope some network will be back in the air so fans can watch.
