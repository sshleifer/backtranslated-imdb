Samuel Fuller is an interesting filmmaker, mainly because he has a very inconsistent policy in his films. While "Shock Corridor" and "Naked Kiss" featured America's hypocrisy and mockery and "Big Red" was an effective portrayal of horror wars, "Merrill's Marauders" painted the war as a necessary hell, and "Pickup on South Street" is the danger of Communist spies. All of his films lead to very entertaining watching, and although he was often considered b-filmmaker, Fuller was as good as any of the biggest studio suppliers. "Pickup on South Street" is no exception, and despite the dated themes, the style of making movies is remarkable in time. It's also a very fast pace, a tight and sometimes brutal movie noir. Playing overboard is fantastic. Richard Widmark makes a great anti-hero, and Jean Peters is quite sexy as a girl who works for his friend of the Communist spy. The showmaker is Thlema Ritter in a very wonderful performance as a police stall. The angles that Fuller employs are great, making the acting sequences even more exciting and brutal (it's very violent for their time). The camera is constantly moving, just like Tarantino and his school forty years later. "Pickup on South Street" is a great action noir thriller. "Shock Corridor" remains my favorite film, Fuller, but it's very close. (8/10)
