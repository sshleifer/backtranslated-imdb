A great movie that requires the taste. If you are in action, wham bam movies and hate serious love stories then its not for you. Otherwise, if you want to sit in front of a good intelligent film, I recommend it very well. The best movie made in Bollywood this century. The only other Indian film that I'd give for 10/10 is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Even then it is the second work of this masterpiece.
