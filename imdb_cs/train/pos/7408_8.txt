I had the privilege of seeing this film at the Rotterdam Film Festival. <br /> <br /> "Xizhao" or "Shower" is a $ 200,000 lowbudget movie about his father and his two sons. Father has a traditional swimming pool somewhere in a traditional Chinese village, where local, mostly older men come to relax and swim. The father has sons: the "slowed-down" son who lives with him, and the son who lives in a large modern city and who visits him. To this son, the traditional village, the spa house and its "retarded" brother seem strange and annoying, but it changes throughout the movie. Though the story may sound like cheese or clich√©, it is not. With really great performances, especially father and late son (I apologize, I do not know their names) and a great story that touched the film while it was funny. <br /> <br /> You have the chance to see this movie done. It's a great alternative to the mainstream of the Hollywood cinema. <br /> <br />
