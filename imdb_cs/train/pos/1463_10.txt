Mardi Gras: Made in China provides a wonderful, intricate connection between popular culture, nudity and globalization through production and throwing beads. I saw this film at the Boston International Film Festival and I expected it to begin to globalize, but what I got was a subtle visual impression of shocking records from both China and the United States. The opening film is humorous, deep, serious, disproportionate and leaves you wanting more as a credit role. It is worth comparing with Murderballem - it's just done well. Young workers in China have different views and the owner is amazingly open at the discipline. Peaks during the carnival are the pinnacle, but only because this excellent film provides a profound context in China without narration. Bravo filmmakers to get in and finish the movie! I would never have thought of the connection between beads, China and New Orleans; now I think of the human connection between almost every object, but also the role of globalization, inequality and entertainment. More importantly, I can make these connections without feeling guilty after watching this film, unlike other films about globalization I've seen.
