Another strong knock. This time she turns around Diana Gusman, who always gets into school at school. Instead of being excluded, she took her anger elsewhere on the boxing ring. He trains as a boxer and meets Adrian and begins to fall in love with him. This movie has a strong message of taking your dreams and going with them, even if someone does not believe in you (in this case her father does not believe in her). This in itself makes the film worthwhile. Enjoy
