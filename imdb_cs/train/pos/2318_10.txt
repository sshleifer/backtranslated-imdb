I saw this film as a teenager, and I immediately identified myself with the image of Reese Witherspoon's Dani Trant, a 14-year-old tomboy in rural Louisiana around 1957. She felt she would never be as beautiful as her older sister, Maureen saw Emily Warfield) and the feeling that she had no place , in terms of her conservative Baptist upbringing. Then seventeen-year-old Judge Foster (Jason London), the son of a close friend of her mother (Gail Strickland) moves side by side, Dani will experience her first bout, while Court enjoys her company and her intentional spirit. Dani will be able to get his first kiss, but when he sees Maureen, he falls over her head and Dani remains. The close bond of the nurse is severely broken by a rivalry that explodes, which only deepens when the court dies in a tragic accident. Girls are then realized to realize how much they need to each other. Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are simply perfect as loving parents, trying to balance the individuality of daughters, while trying to keep families together. Beautiful cinematography and a wonderful soundtrack with Elvis Presley, The Platters and many others greatly contribute to the movie atmosphere of a simpler time. Touch of film with timeless message.
