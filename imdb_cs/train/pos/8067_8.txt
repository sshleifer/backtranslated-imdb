Today, if anyone mentions the name Victor McLaglen, the answer will most likely be "Who?" or perhaps "Why?" Believe it or not, Victor McLaglen has won Oscar for Best Actor in this film, which concerns a poor, desperate man who is willing to sell his best friend for Carfare to the United States. It's an interesting movie that shows how low even the most famous shnooks will go for just a few dollars. The film takes place in Irish-controlled Britain, and while all other characters are either directly or indirectly fighting for the political independence of Ireland, McLaglen's character is concerned about getting money and being drunk. The film realizes whether political activism is worth all the trouble, because while the activist is trying to mention something, many others have not cared about it, nor do they know what it's all about. The morale of this movie is: Watch out for a friend, he can sell you for a dime.
