This is a great movie for all ages. His story about three animals as they have to get home. At the end, and especially in the whole movie, it's a little twisted. You never know what will happen next. This movie screams and makes you laugh. You just do not know what will happen next. Trek Home is beautiful with all the wonderful wild scenes. Producers also spent a lot of money on this movie and it shows it too. The animals in this movie are well trained and are great actors / actresses themselves. Everything about this movie is great! 10 out of 10 all the way! Today you can buy or buy it. I can guarantee you will love him, it will be the whole family!
