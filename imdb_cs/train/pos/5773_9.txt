Since I'm interested in riding monsters, I really dug this movie. This movie is worth seeing. If you like it so bad, it's good movie types. The effects are really good, and just "Land of The Lost". Originally, I watched this movie in the early 1990s, maybe more like 89/90 on a local channel monster called "Morgus Presents". I did not punch myself but I was eight and everything B felt to be more like A. A few years later I saw it on a DVD in a local district town and I immediately bought it to give it 9 because it's in my personal place hearts there with The Monster Squad and Gremlins. Good B fun for all ages.
