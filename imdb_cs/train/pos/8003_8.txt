This movie is great entertainment you can watch with your wife or girlfriend. There are laughter and some interesting little nudist stories. Actresses are very interesting and definitely worth watching for their natural beauty. Maslin's beach life is full of a variety of nudist and personality types. The Australian coastal scenery is just gorgeous. Which place to visit, at least, and one day, can become my shelter. I love this movie and every time I look at it, I look forward to it. I would love to see more of these characters and I always wonder what happened to them. Although the plot is somewhat soft, this film is, of course, a great challenge to sit on the couch and enjoy the beautiful and famous Maslin beaches with those beautiful nudists and personal stories.
