Originally, I hit Linda Feferman's Seven Minutes in Heaven when I was 14 years old and worked in a video rental and I loved it. I recently watched the movie again, and I realized it was a lost treasure. Film star Jennifer Connelly, almost twenty years before she won the Oscar for a beautiful mind like Natalie Becker. Byron Thames plays his best friend in the world, Jeff Moran. The movie is certainly a milder, cute and softer version of Pretty in Pink's and Some Kind of Wonderful's of the 1980s, which is why it is so good. It's sincere, hated like movies, and parents will look forward to watching this movie with kids. When Natalie's father went home on a business trip, Jeff convinces her that he should move because his domestic life sucks. With the support of Natalie's friend, Polly, she played beautiful Maddie Corman, leaving him. But this film is not about having children in situations and seeing what they can get away. The three leads are so natural and the script is surprisingly so honest that what is best shown in their performances is heartbreak. These characters really care about themselves. It's a great movie that will show kids who have reached adolescence before adolescents. <br /> <br />
