This is a fascinating hunt for the first known Soviet killer. I tune in, I just expected it to be a decent TV movie, but I found myself attracted in a compelling way. As others have said, there is a lot of admiration that, unfortunately, many projections on the big screen are missing. Chris Gerolmo, whose intelligent screenplay and directing are attracting the audience inside, has to be a big part of the loan. it is impossible not to feel emotionally. All the acting is also great, especially that there are two leaders, Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. Their persuasive portraits give their arc a lot of credibility, and the scene where they have their first committee meeting after Perestrojice really touches. If you prefer your crime movies with some depth and a little less gloss, I strongly recommend that you look at "Citizen X". <br /> <br />
