I first heard about this movie after buying the movie "Snuff" from 1976. I was told that Devil's experiment is much better so naturally I went ahead and ordered a set of seabirds. I was really interested in hearing that Charlie Sheen was trying to forbid this movie or the other, so my interest was high. Devil's Experiment is a short film without a story, without character development. Only three men tortured the woman for about 45 minutes. They tortured her in a variety of ways like hitting her, turning her around in circles again and again, then forcing her to drink alcohol, forcing her to listen to noisy noise for 24 hours, smashing her hands with a mallet, burning and giving worms burns, to her, and finally to the thrust of a sharp needle through her eye. I have to say that much of this movie was fake, like a drum scene. But then, some of it was really done if you made it from you. Scenes in which a woman turns around in circles made me dizzy when I watched her. Or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think. The worst is the scene of the eye. When I looked at it, I did not hide, but I just thought, "Damn, it looks pretty good for such a low budget." I really liked it, but I do not know if I really can recommend it unless you've seen most of what the horror genre has to offer. 7/10
