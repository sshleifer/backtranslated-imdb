This is the first movie I've ever seen since John Singleton and is a pretty good director. The film starts with a bunch of incoming novice and shows what happens to some of them. Omar Epps plays a trail star with a partial scholarship and is hard to hold on to his work. He is friends with Ice Cube and beings that date from Tyra Banks. Kristyna Swanson is a rich girl who is dating rape and becomes friends with Jennifer Connelly, a lesbian, and she is not sure where to go. Michael Rapaport is a kid from Idaho, who falls into a group of neo-Nazis, and their leader is Cole Hauser. These are three main characters, and Laurence Fishburne is a professor of political science who is trying to help them. It's a great movie and it's unfortunate that the studio had to make several cuts into the movie.
