The original film DeMille was created in 1938 by Frederic Marche. Very good movie. Hollywood's love for remake brings us a pretty interesting movie by Yul Brynner. He was of course great, because he was almost always in his movies. Charlton Heston, like Andrew Jackson, was brain-brilliant. However, the film tended to take a little longer. It does not move at the pace of version 1938. Yet it's a fun movie that should be seen at least once.
