OK. There are people who should not see this movie. <br /> <br /> 1) You do not see if you like satir or black humor. 2) Do not like if The Watchmen_ is offending you. 3) Do not see if you want a serious superhero. <br /> <br /> Other of you, go, do not go to see _Mystery Men_. It's funny, it's odd, it's the wonderful touch of every bad superhero clich√© known to men. Occasional junior high humor excursions do not lose teeth Jeanane Garafalo, Ben Stiller and Hank Azaria, as well as a few more fun parts from Geoffrey Ruse and Greg Kinnear. (It's good to see Louise Lasser get to work.) I laughed all the way. Extremely unbearable, somewhat strange, but well.
