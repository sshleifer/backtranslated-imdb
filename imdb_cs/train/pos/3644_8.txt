Rookie is based on the real story of a forty-year-old teacher in the Great Lake in Texas, which has reached the largest. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) is a tiny science teacher and a baseball coach. His team is terribly lost until the team finds out that their coach has played in smaller leagues and could throw a pitch at 98 mph. <br /> <br /> After throwing a betting practice and betting on a bet, Jim agrees that if his team wins the regional one, he will try for the main leagues. The film tells Jimmy's story of being a kid playing in his first game in big games. It's a great story for nature lovers and a very friendly family movie. Dennis Quaid shoots the film for emotional performance and is supported by an outstanding actor, including: Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> The story lasts a little bit before it develops and some scenes are a bit slow but everything works to the end. Baseball scenes are fun, well-shot and greatly rendered. The film is not about baseball, it's about a man whose goal is to reach his dream. It's inspirational, it's emotional and it's funny. I like it, I hope you do it. Rookie. Cast: Dennis Quaid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> 4 of 5 stars.
