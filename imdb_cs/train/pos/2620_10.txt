What a pleasant surprise: Disney DTV (Direct to Video) sequel, which is actually good. "The Lion King 1 1/2" is a comedy that includes all the popular meerkats and warthog, Timon and Pumbaa. He begins to watch the original film and make remarks until Timon complains that "we are not here yet". After fighting the highway, Timon and Pumbaa decide to tell the audience "their story". A new movie starts and begins to laugh. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I lost hope at Disney. Most fares directly on the video were aggressively horrible, with story lines that desperately need money for the original. "1 1/2" decides to try something else: it tells the original story from a new perspective. Well, he adds things like Timon came to and meet Pumbaa, but it's an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella perfectly capture the relationship and friendship that loved us in the first film. There are also several modified parodies (including one scene that also spoils "The Good, The Bad" and "Ugly" and "Cool Hand Luke") and the script is filled with fun memories. <br /> <br /> Cast Julie Kavner ("The Simpsons") as Timon's old mother and Jerry Stiller as Timon's slightly mad Uncle Max. Matthew Broderick appears as Simba and his "teen" scene reminded me of Ferris Bueller. Everybody is doing well, especially Robert Guillame (that's how you say it?), How Rafiki, which radiates more and more Yoda-speaking in this movie (Timon commented on it several times). <br /> <br /> 'King 1 1/2' is the perfect alternative for those who tire you out of Shrekification animation. 10/10
