I filmed the film at the Birmingham Southern School in 1975, when it appeared in combination with Red Balloon. Both films are similar in their dreams of similar quality. Most of the film means that the fish happily swim in a bowl while his new owner, a little boy, is at school. The cat enters the room where the fish and the bowl are and begins to carefully watch its "prey". The boy starts going home from school and the viewer is interested in coming in time to save his friend from the fish. The fish becomes agitated by the presence of a cat and eventually jumps out of the bowl! The cat quickly moves to the fish, carefully takes it with the paws and returns to the bowl. The boy happily returns to his fish, none of them are wiser. The end is amazing in both irony and technical complexity. It's hard to imagine how the director could print technical performance in 1959 - it seems like a trick for 2003. If you find him, watch - you will not be disappointed! And if you do it *, find it, let me know to get a copy!
