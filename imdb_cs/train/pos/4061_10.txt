This is the best oak I've ever heard from Disney, as well as the best adaptation of the biggest abuse that has ever been on soundtracks, themes, characters, conversations in the Kiki Delivery Service. Urrrghhh <br /> <br /> This has a different atmosphere, especially the deviation from the common heroine. This has both a hero and a hero (although I do not really support the hero and the heroine because Miyazaki is a stereotype and a common theme). As usual, after being introduced by Spirited, amazed by Mononoke, alarmed by the grave of lightguards and deeply touched by Majo no Takkyuubin, it starts with a bit of doubt in my part. Wonder if this is the first Ghibi bagpipe. Well, just like Just yesterday and the whisper of the heart, I ended up rating 10. I give 9.8 points, but another 0.2 is for sharing good feeling by encouraging people to see the movie. SPOILER Somehow I see it as a sad movie, people are dying in this lonely robot, a deserted place and ending with destruction. It is as if humanity really can not live with too much power. The sculpting scene gave me traces of metropolis that ended. It's a little sad. This story is evident in most reviews and in soundtrack rules (as always). Joe Hisaishi really belongs to Uematsu, Kanno, Williams caliber. People who can bring film, play, event to life, even be lasting moments of stunning composition. <br /> <br /> This is a good feeling movie that was part of the American cinema in classical days (it's a beautiful life etc., etc.). Well, things are changing ...
