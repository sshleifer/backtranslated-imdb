Guy Kibbee gives the audience a lot of laughter. Like most candidates know almost nothing. Warren William, very, under the rated actor, is great when he instructs Kibbee; it means teaching him to say something that does not mean anything to the public. A campaign based on no comments, "I'll consider it" and "Maybe yes, but then again, maybe not," is an almost perfect way to get the election. Sneakily, the candidate is more likely to win. After all, the public can identify with such a person. With regard to the movie, it does a lot of comedy.
