The Oscar-Calibr performance by Peter Falk in the Oscar-Calibr-written role. I loved a nuanced and balanced exploration of a long-standing marriage - how often do we have it in movies where the film usually ends when the boy and the girl meet together? This is a film for adults, a complex view of all sides - husband, wife, son - how each of them has adapted in the past and has grown throughout the story. In addition, it gave me about ten main laughs of the stomach and I am one of those people who usually sit unusual when the rest of the audience rejoices. It was one of the few really fun movies I've seen. Great, original jokes.
