It's a good show and I find it fun. Ultimately, poor Latin stereo types are over! ¡Gracias, Señor Lopez! I love this show and I just started watching it three months ago. The whole concept of the television series in the Latin family really amazed me. I am surprised that at last Latins have a good opportunity to be on TV. This show is probably one of the best I've seen, it's fun, hearty, eager and kind.
