Let's start this review on a remarkable message - I'm very glad they did not decide to avoid shooting Tony and make a retrospective season as some people called it. In fact, the creator and writer of this episode David Chase did quite the opposite. Actually, we do not know if Tony will live or die. He is in a coma and his chances of recovery are very low. It seemed that this episode was moving very slowly, and the coma was a dream in which Tony lay in the wrong identity, and was stolen by the Asian monks who pushed him out of him, was totally weird. After 45 minutes, I was a little bit sad for everyone who suffered, but that should not be the reason why you should kill this episode. It was a weird and unpredictable episode, but it was still well written and intense. Edie Falco has made a stunning career in this episode because a conflicting wife has to meet her husband's death. I also found it interesting that AJ dropped out of school and vowed vendetta against Junior, who AJ most likely will not have the balls to avoid. Silvio is now an acting boss who, in later episodes, opens up a series of problems. There were a lot of great experiments in this episode, and I think Vito 'Pole-Smoker' Spadafore can see his extinction if he's still greedy SOB. It was not a great episode and disappointed just because Tony kills people, we like the audience and we feel he's our hero show. This was a necessary episode for the series, although it was a bit of snoring to conclude. Kudos to perform Edie Falca and David Chase and writers to create this completely original and unpredictable conspiracy plot. This is the only soprano season where I have no idea where she is going to go. I can not wait for an episode next week. My best rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The best line of the episode: (Paulie to AJ): "Come on, Van Helsing!"
