I've been studying this film several times in college, and every time I show it, the number of people who look at me grows exponentially ... except virgins, everyone I've already shown needs to see it again! It takes a while for you to get into it but eventually the whole room scream, scream, scream, rewind, repeat the dialogue, and fully and completely attracted to the movie experience of Pia Zador in The Lonely Lady! Scene after scene after the most inappropriately filmed, badly written, terribly hit TRASH is cast on you in a full-fledged attack, which is one of the most popular thing he owns (no small statements, friends). Nothing compares to me 2 U, Pia ... and I do not suppose I'm the only one who ever felt!
