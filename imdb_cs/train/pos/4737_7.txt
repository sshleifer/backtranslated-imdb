Hak hap (Black Mask) is what I would like to call ballet of fists and explosions. Surely it was an attempt and a hearing before, (a biologically-engineered soldier who is part of the elite fighting force of supermen to decide that killing and coercion are not ways to satisfy every thing and become a pacifist, but when he learns that the rest of his group trying to get an antibody that will keep them alive by coming to the police - her best friend is a cop - becomes a black mask.) The style that the film is very visual, working and at least fun for me. I like martial arts movies that are special. People who fly lighter than air and recover a second after a crash will keep pace and strike without interruption. But it's such a movie that is just as well, the showcase of Jet Li, who does what he does best, and it's a spectacular show of his skills that are at least top-notch. As with most of the fast action action martial arts films ala. Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung, who are in the country for the first time, are these films with low conspiracy and high physical performance. But I have to say that he has large holes that are conspicuous (as if we saw him safe in his apartment when he had only one scene before he had 20 men who were just fifteen feet away from him with a sign of escape? a bit to him in the apartment ....... ohh well stop believing I think), the film remains interesting to me. It's up until the last 20 minutes, when the film seems to be a bit shorter. But still around the great action movie.
