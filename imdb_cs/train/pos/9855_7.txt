This is my first CG animated movie I've ever seen. Generally, it seemed to me that the look of other animated films is unwavering. Not the ice age. I wanted to see it the moment I saw a trailer with Scratte, a cheery sabertooth squirrel. <br /> <br /> The Ice Age was a sporadically entertaining and generally entertaining film to watch. The story is basically the animated version of Three Men and a Child, which has been in the past for 20,000 years. The visuals were great. Just beautiful. One thing is to create a convincing revelation, it's quite another thing to create visually arresting things, and Ice Age is great when you look at her stylized visuals. Blue Sky Studios is a company that will look in the future.
