The woman in this world was a boy and she was alone. Both were alone, because the boy had one gift and a curse in one package - he was able to take the sword out of his hand. The cause of this "gift" - the wound of the most dangerous weapon inside his body has always been a wrist injury. He first kills his ever drunk stepfather, who always hurts his mother. Then she grows up and decides to find her true father. Just as a whole time for a superhero - it will reach justice ... but the company will decide that this justice is not necessary and dangerous, which is really true because it's not like in Hollywood movies that this character is not trying to kill someone - Sasha (he is the main hero who acted Artem Tkachenko) kills if the person who, in his opinion, deserves to die but accuses the authorities and runs. In such an escape from the authorities and the Mafia she meets the girl (Chulpan Hamat) and falls in love with her. Everything else needs to be watched ... he did not say. Be aware that this film is about feelings and emotions, but not about activities. This film is full of the pain of the main character full of his and his vision of life.
