I'm surprised by the low IMDb rating of this movie. With overall respect, his low rating is representative of the IQ level of those who rated it so badly. They'd rather see a movie with low prices, a larger budget, and more gore. The first confusion of people is that it's a horror film. There is not even the film does not tell you to believe it's one. It's a psychological thriller. It's for people who really want an intellectual experience watching a movie. Review of Reel.com is a perfect example of how I feel about this movie. All other negative reviews do not make much sense. It's almost like trying to create an original film for change-very rare nowadays-is something wrong and it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> I will uncover some spoilers for fools who say that it's a boredom that makes no sense. Martha was brainwashed and experimented on herself to be a caring mother while she was a really bad Nazi who would kill her without warning. Evidence is all about pudding and the fact that at first glance we are sympathetic to this cold-blooded monster for the duration of the film is the testimony of the film and its writing. <br /> <br /> I definitely feel that this film should at least be rated in 6 only on originality. I recommend this movie to people at the other end of the IQ scale - aka intelligent people - because of this movie, of course, lost to those who would rather watch Scream or Freddy's nightmare. Kudos to acting as well. For such a low budget, you are amazed that this movie did not experience your local cinema in great direction, writing and playing. Please do not be fooled by the IMDb rating. This movie is worth it. Actually, I recommend buying a movie because the first viewing of rent will not do justice.
