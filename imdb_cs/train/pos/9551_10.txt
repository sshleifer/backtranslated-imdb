I must say that I was surprised by the quality of the film. It was much better than I expected. Scenario and acting are quite good. The director also did a good job. Although some scenes seem a bit clumsy, it's a pretty decent movie. The idea was definitely brilliant and the truth was not found until the very end. The mental hospital atmosphere was relatively good. The story was clear, consistent and well thought out. Some people may find it a little boring because the story line is very focused and devoted to their time of character and story development. A moral story, it's a decent film for your genre, and it's surprisingly good.
