This movie is upset like hell! I think it was written as a serious film, but when it came time to make a film, Michael Cooney said, "Hey, throw some humor and charm it!" The characters are really a little developed. Oh, and the death sequences are the best. One thing I hate was the hair dryer. What was all about?
