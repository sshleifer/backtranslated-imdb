Soylent Green IS is a really good movie. <br /> <br /> I would never have thought. I really do not like Heston in his science fiction efforts. He is one of those actors who, like Superman, managed to come across the ordinary and invincible most of the time. I prefer more vulnerable heroes. And he really can escape despite much of Soylent Green, but because he should play a persuasive straw, I do not mind. I understand why some people change their nose in this movie. Soylent Green is not trying to create futuristic visual elements (what you know - it looks like 1973) and it is missing. But I admired the vision of the film about complex, corrupt and highly stratified societies and I was so pleased to see that Edward G. Robinson had such a moving and entertaining final role. Nice little torque moments - like sharing a precious meal with Heston - really make a movie. Soylent Green's message is relatively relevant these days, when no one seems to know what the hell the government of the corporation is ready for. Funny, it's not like seeing Heston in Michael Moore's prototype ...
