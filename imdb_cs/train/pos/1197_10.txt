I just watched this movie in error. What a small jewel. This 1956 film looks and feels like a movie from the late seventies. And he's actually better, more restrained and more correct than, say, the Blue Soldier. Environmental, anthropological undertones are much premature. Inconspicuous cinematography is excellent and very realistic. Much more than dances with wolves, The Last Hunt manages to convey the look and feel of the buffalo "killing fields" of the late 1800s. Probably because you were really killing the fields in the movie. The film was shot during legal forest driven buffalo, so the animals you see are actually shot, the bones are real. Finally, there was a lot of underestimated Western work that worked great, controlled and shot.
