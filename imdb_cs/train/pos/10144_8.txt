But the fun is on its way. I found this movie extremely enjoyable, not only that the two eyes are very easy to look at, the humor of the support cast, and the jokes really laugh at me several times. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's predictable and yes, it's a clich√© of a romantic comedy. But the question is that it's a sweet story, the message of finding one of your true love is also true in many ways. Dialogue is dead and acting is done well on all parts and over the peak for the comic effect. The Bulgari scene is considered to be gold, the actress deserves an honorable mention! For those who predicted it for being predictable - If you want a movie with twists and turns that guess you ... then you want the thriller. It's a romantic comedy ... touched my heart and realized that I was lucky to have found my true love in life and that it was worth it all. <br /> <br /> Great date movie, great movie for joyful plac ...
