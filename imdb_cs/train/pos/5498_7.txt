This document has been broadcast on both RTE and BBC in recent months. When I saw it twice, I would recommend it to everyone interested in creating media and documentaries. Originally, this paper focused on a more detailed description of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's political life. The Irish crew issued these plans. What happens when they get to Venezuela is amazing because they are witnessing an attempt to overthrow the factions of the rebels (especially Venezuelan oil concerns) Chavez and his governments. What we hear is how the media are manipulating this situation, and in fact, they support the overthrow of Chavez by disturbing the events that occur as a result of the coup d'Ã©tat. It is a great documentary and a remarkable piece of work by several journalists. <br /> <br />
