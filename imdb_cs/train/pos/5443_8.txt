What it is, it's a pretty good movie. I like both Johns -Stamos ("Full House") and Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). Both give powerful performance. Interest in love is fine, but it's more human than good movie. I love Harleys and I hated seeing them paint over "14 layers of hand painted varnish" with a good old army olive drab. There is a little lesson of history here that Harley-Davidson motorcycles played a key role in World War II. I do not know if the training is just like those scarecrows! The film kept my interest all the way without going anywhere, with good riding action sequences. I love looking at the demographic history of voting - an 18 year old man gave the film 10 (really a lover). I would not do 10, but I gave him eight. I do not like each movie on the same scale. There are big budget movies with great actors that you expect to be good, so when they fail they can not make big ones. (Star Wars - episode I is my best example) I loved the first three SW movies, but I thought the episode was weak compared. So I have a smaller rating than this movie. I expect more from George Lucas.
