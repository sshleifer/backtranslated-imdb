No message. No symbolism. No dark attic. Just beautiful melange music, nostalgia and good entertainment that people who have obviously enjoyed doing it. It's a refreshing antidote to some of the demanding rubbish that students distribute. Naturally, ANYTHING with the incomparable Judi Dench is worth seeing. And great Cleo Laine jazz singing is a bonus. This lady is in the same league as the late Ella. It takes place on my field field to be pulled back again whenever I feel the need for a warm experience and hearty good catching. Just a wonderful movie!
