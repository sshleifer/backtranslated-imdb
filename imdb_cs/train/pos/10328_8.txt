The creators chose the best people to work and set the stage perfectly. Each interior is full of details that tells you everything about those who live in it. Whether the 20th century (the first story), the present (1950) for the middle story, or 1910 (the last), the costumes and settings are lovingly observed and created. I like the distraught costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium - a beautiful lace overlaid with the most beautiful Shetland dressing rooms. Roland Culver as Ashenden is very attractive, but does not mind being young lovers, it's Raymond Huntley as a man who does not like the health and independence of his wife that prevents our emotions. He usually played comic, pompous types, but here he is gentle, convincing and very impressive. The Chinese Sea (a great 30s film with Gable and Harlow) stole a conspiracy from Mr. Know All's episode (and also rewrites the story of Kipling). I wish I could see more than Naunton Wayne as a jealous husband - though he has a nice melancholy in a Mexican hat. I like the lovely bird who plays his wife.
