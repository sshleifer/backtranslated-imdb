Emma is a heavily defective film based on the classic novel Jane Austens. I did not read the book, so I did not know much about the plot, yet I still predicted almost a whole plot. There were also many scenes that frustrated me for bad writing or directing. The film is somewhat fun for some reason and I loved it. Of course, there were all the scenes I did not like, but most were well-eaten and funny. Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best performances as a heroine in Emma. The film also stars Toni Collette (who is ok but was much better) Ewan Mecgreger (who was also better but still very good) Alan Cumming (who I never really did, and it's quite the same) and Jeremy Northam Who is the performance is rather wooden at first glance, but really quite gentle though it was not what he needed.) There was much better editing of Jane Austen's books, but this is still very fun and worth watching.
