This movie moves without being sentimental - meaningless without being demanding. This is a simple story of a family that could ruin decay because technological interventions and emerging society make family business unsustainable. The game is great - although none of us Western people are likely to hear about these actors, we should have - a playful character and respect playing their characters - these are mistaken figures, each of which has its main weaknesses, but with such complete humanity and kindness, that's impossible, the story. <br /> <br /> We need more films like this - we need more Western filmmakers to create such films.
