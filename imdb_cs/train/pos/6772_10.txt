Unlike another user who said the movie was sucking (and that Olivia Hussey was terrible), I do not agree. This movie was amazing !!!!!! Olivia Hussey is amazing in everything she is! Yeah, she can be older because she remembers her from Romeo and Juliet, but she's great! <br /> <br /> This story line can be used quite often, but it is a unique movie and I will fight against anyone who disagrees! I like this movie just like any other Olivia Hussey movie. Olivia is "my girl" and I love her. <br /> <br /> I first saw it on Saturday (April 14th) and fell in love with her. Not only because it is the film Olivia, but because it's a unique story line and a wonderful direction.
