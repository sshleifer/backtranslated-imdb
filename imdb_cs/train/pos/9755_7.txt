When I last saw the movie, I was about seven years old, so my views could have been exhausted over time. At that time, I enjoyed filming that has changed between cartoons and live events. At that time, I felt sad about the blue camel and his sad life. I also felt joyful when Captain Contagious kidnapped a heroine (a princess or a toy shepherd) on the tables that turned her over. Unfortunately, manufacturers have never decided to convert this movie to VHS, so I have only twenty years old memories. I'm sure that if I saw the movie again, I would think it was terrifying and hot, but at that time I really enjoyed it.
