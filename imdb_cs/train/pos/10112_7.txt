Originally I captured it in 1996 in one week at the cinema. I was under the impression and my feelings did not change much. A documentary about the infamous Edward D. Wood, who dealt with his life and films. There are conversations with people who worked with him or knew him. These include: Vampira, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. The interviews mix with movie clips or some bizarre recreation. It's interesting (a bit), but was it really necessary? I've seen all of Wood's movies and it's terrible. The wood had ambitions, but not a little talent to solve it. I do not think he's the worst director, but he's down there. Do we really need a dock on a very average film? I like the fact that they did not try to make Wood a saint. More than a few of those interviewed (especially Lugosi Jr.) have hated him, and that is loud and clear. They also completely ignore his films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 1970s. Interesting if you are a wood fan. The best interviews are with Vampire (which tears Wood apart) and Dolores Fuller (long girlfriend).
