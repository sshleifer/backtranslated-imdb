It's one of those movies that is difficult to judge without dividing it. Suffice it to say that there are strange things and unexpected interventions happening behind the initial superficial "Tom Cruise Bolts around with More Women" plot. Quality casts raise this film above the standard, and all the cast are well suited to their works: Cruise as an irritatingly complacent playboy who has everything - and then loses everything, Diaz as an attractive but slightly shaken lover Cruz as an exotic new girl on stage and Russell as a psyche psychologist. The story includes elements of romance, morality, murder-secrets, tension and sci-fi, and it's a generally fun trip. I should add that the photo is equally excellent and the insertion of different visual metaphors is beautiful as soon as you realize what's going on. If you like well-played movies with twists and strains, and are ready to take the slightly fantastic resolution of Philip K Dick in style, then it's got to-see. <br /> <br /> 9/10
