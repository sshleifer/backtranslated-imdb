I'm looking at romantic comedies with some hesitation because romantic comedies contain old clich√©s that make the movie unattractive. Typically in a romantic comedy is a girl and there is a guy, they both fall in love, then have trouble and then win over the problems to be taken or anything. But this movie is another story, it's really very different from the romantic comedies I've seen recently. <br /> <br /> There is a widowed guy (Dan), there is a girl (Marie). Dan meets Marie in a bookstore and talks after some time after Marie has to leave. Dan will develop something for her, and if something starts to make sense, we'll get it. Marie is a friend of her brother. Dan does not tell the circumstances and Dan flirts with Mary, realizing that he loves her, and even Mary loves him, but their love would not only be possible. As much as possible, make up the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell has good results, Juliette Binoche is good as Mary. And all the other things are doing well. It's a good movie, watch it.
