If you like movies about school bullies, brave kids, cheerful toddlers and eating worms, then you will like to deal with fritted worms. The film is dedicated to a boy named Billy who, when he arrives on his first day in a new school, finds some of his classmates playing jest at him by putting worms into his lunch. Joe and his "team" of buddies start bothering Billy and call him a "worm guy". Billy decides to play together when he says he "eats worms all the time". Joe and his friends do not believe him, but Billy assures them and Joe betters that he can eat ten worms in one day or else he comes to school with worms in his trousers. Boys take Billy up at his stake so weak stomached child with the mission to gain respect from his classmates by eating cooked, fried, or alive worms. The movie may sound rough, but there are plenty of news. One of them represents real friendship and acceptance of people for who they are. It also shows why some bullies resort to bullying other children. The protagonist of the film is Billy, a strong-minded and courageous man with whom we can all care. It is easy to concentrate on him when we are silently longing to achieve our goal, although we do not always agree with what he is doing or with the choices he makes. The kids in the movie are portrayed exactly how the kids are in real life and the film deserves a lot of work for it. Children's actors are the stars of this show that show real emotions and feelings to most other children's movies. Some adults may not enjoy this movie, but children, maybe even teenagers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are no other good movies at the moment, so if you are not in the mood to see the snakes on the plane, try worms on the plate in the section How to Eat Fried Worms. It's a nice fun movie and not just a Fear Factor for kids.
