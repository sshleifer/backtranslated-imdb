I'm usually skeptical about watching movies or mini-series based on novels, because the script is always different from the novel. Fortunately, I was wrong! The script was very close to the novel (I think it will help the author as a powerful producer and writer, what?) The cast is excellent. I can not describe how much I liked seeing such a wide range of actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianco Lawson). Setting the place ... I expected to see the houses and chalets I imagined in my mind: what I saw on the canvas differed somewhat. However, it was not enough to miss the mini-series. I recommend this for anyone who reads a novel: you will not be disappointed if you have. 8 of 10 Stars! <br /> <br />
