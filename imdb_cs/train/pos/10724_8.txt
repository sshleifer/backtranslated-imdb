This is one of those who felt good Saturday afternoon movies. She's there with other retromics like Flight of the Navigator. Just a cute movie with some fine comedy that makes things easier. And it's fun to see 20 years change stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson. Not to mention Joquin Phoenix. <br /> <br /> I personally like it from time to time. Nothing deep or too scary. Just a nice story line. And I would never know, Mr Phoenix, that I have recently read credits. He was just a child when he made the film. Kelly Preston was also a young young actress. She and Lea have done a great job in this movie. I agree that it is not an Oscar-caliber movie. But it's worth watching. Especially if you have children, for example, 8 to 11 years old range. Or those who are interested in the space program.
