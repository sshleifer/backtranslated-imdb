Beautiful Bo Derek's beauty and revolutionary direction of John Derek make this movie useful. <br /> <br /> Bo, looking much more beautiful than ever, is a recently widowed woman who is experiencing visits to her "dead" husband (Anthony Quinn). She has a plan. Bo must acquire the body of a young man so that her husband's spirits can transform from spooks into physical life. Can he find a suitable candidate? How does he do it so Tony can do his thing? <br /> <br /> Thanks to Bo's attributes, the unique direction of John, Quinn's film presence and thanks to John, very nice exotic views of the whole movie, this film is a pleasant sight.
