I was brought up on Doc Savage and as a child I was spoiled with a green death, but as I thought it was absolutely fun. I've made countless friends and colleagues watching this movie and were very amused by the variety of responses, admit that they mostly think I'm special, but you're there. "I do not know what's about Doc, but the girls always get" must be the final line when you look at his sad group of men. This movie is a classic spoof on all the superhero genres and was so time-consuming, no need to take it seriously, through Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a god. It is unfortunate that this movie was not released on DVD in the UK. I think it should not be remade and intimidated, as I said it is a classic, it can not be without Ron (like Italian work without Mini and Michael Caine). I give it 10/10.
