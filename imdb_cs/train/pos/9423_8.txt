I can not say whether British comedies after the war after World War II were made in Ealing Studios or not, but I'm totally addicted and the man in a white suit is one of the best. There is no need to go into the familiar conspiracy about the threat posed by both the textile industry and the textile unions of indestructible, durable fibers. It is enough to say that the joints and arrows that naively idealistic Sidney Stratton suffer from his polymeric vision make comedic joy. Many famous faces from the world of British acting actors - nervous Cecil Parker, promising Michael Gough and the extremely merciless Ernest Thesinger - brought a wonderful performance. Guinness - as always and forever - is excellent, and Joan Greenwood is perceived as Daphne (just as he portrays the word "Daddy" makes the film look for it). "Knudsen !!! !!!!"
