The Lion King series is an easy crowning success in Disney animation. The original Lion King is the greatest masterpiece in animation of the ensemble. Lion King II: Simba's Pride is BY FAR best direct to the sequel video that Disney, or other studio, made for the animated feature. He deserves the theatrical release. The same can be said for this film. It has original cast, songs by Elton John, a cheerful story, exciting events and torque moments. Everything you expect from this series. Not so a new story, but a filler and widespread background on Timon and Pumba and their place in this story. What impressed me most was care in animation. Often, Disney shorts on the quality of animation of their video and television efforts. But there is a seamless mixing of the new animation with the original movie. Scenes are never seen in place. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are in full swing as Timon and Pumbaa. Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillame and Moira Kelly repeat their roles as Simba, Rafiki and Nala. We even got a visit to Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin as hyenas. In this movie there are great big laughs. So if you love Lion King, you need this movie. The story is not complete without it.
