Personally, I really loved this movie and especially moved me. Two major actors give us such great performances that in the end it really is the heart of breaking what to do with their characters. The alchemy between Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson is amazing and the song is as great as it is. <br /> <br /> That's why I did not feel surprised when I learned that she had won 5 Golden Globe Awards (best rewarded by Golden Globes), Oscar, and even Grammy. This movie is a classic that deserves someone to see. A great movie that was often criticized (perhaps because Streisand ventured to join him, definitely as a "coordinator"). Her art is greatest, and it will surely please!
