WARNING!!! Tones of dead villains !!! DO NOT READ THAT THIS SERIES WERE NOT VISITED! OR YOU CAN, ANYONE. <br /> <br /> There are just a few words that describe a movie that claims to be the last one and comes out with another; Liar, cheats, maybe even a few words that can not be spoken. But when Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead shows everyone who thought the series grew older and wanted to stop seeing it, or people who wanted their hero (or Villian) to stop at the last minute, it was a movie. This movie begins with the parody of a wizard from Oz. Then you see a child named John Doe, who is the last child in Springwood, Ohio, to leave and leave Freddy. The woman who lives in the hospital to get out of her feet meets with this boy and at the same time has a dream about a man, a water tower, and the promise of secrets that floats in her mind, returns to Springwood to find out this terrifying vision and soon finds out that he is the child of Freddy. And soon we find out that Freddy can leave Springwood only if his daughter can be a host to him. And then there is fear. This movie seems to have hit the nail on the head of everything you wanted to know. This film has lots of humor and portraits such as Rosanne Barr and Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp, and very young Breckin Meyer playing a teenage stoner who sees psychadelic flower vision and Iron Butterfly "In-a-gadda-da-vida" then get stuck in the Super Mario parody of the species. This movie will either hate you like this movie or Krueger even more. The best of the best.
