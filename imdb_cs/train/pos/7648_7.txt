I admit that I have the weakness for alternative historical stories, from WONDERFUL LIFE to GROUNDHOG DAY until 12:01. Among these big ones is this little jewel. It's hard to get through MR. DESTINY without nodding to all the cast members, from benevolent James Belushi to the murderous Courtney Cox. This film lacks gravity and scale to become a great movie, but it's a pleasant enthusiasm on a rainy afternoon. It is also a great rental for cheap accommodation.
