I have to admit that at the beginning I was a bit reluctant to watch this movie. I thought it was a stupid, small, romantic film about a French woman who meets the American on the train and decides to visit Vienna. In fact, I was not enchanted about this script because he still believed that it was just a movie. Still, I watched it! And I was amazed ... "Before sunrise" is one of the few movies that dare to speak rather philosophically, thinking about being sentenced to death at the moment of our birth, or that it is that the couple should stay to eternity together, or that we humans can afford to live in fairy tales. <br /> <br /> The end was beautifully chosen (we do not know if they will meet again in six months, at 6 pm at the Vienna station) - in our optimism, we sincerely hope. The actors played very well, so I began to believe that I, I can live such a story of love.
