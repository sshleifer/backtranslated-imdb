This is my first comment on the IMDb website and the reason I am writing is that we are talking about one of the best movies at all! "Not goryuy!" you will laugh and cry at the same time, you will fall in love with the Georgian choir and you may take the difficulties of your own existence and after the end you will feel good what I like about this movie is that the actors in non-profit roles create lively and unforgettable characters and are as interesting and important as the central character. The film is played by Vahtanga Kikabidze (which is great), but in the film you remember every face around you. You will find that you quote their series, which have become the household names for so many Russian-speaking people. The movie you live in. Simple, yet deep, you will want to watch it again and again.
