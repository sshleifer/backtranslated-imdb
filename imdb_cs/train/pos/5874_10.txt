this step was friggin cheerful !!! the funniest thing I've seen, akshay and john kick as always, and the cats are also hot. the story is amazing, lots of great jokes, and anyone who has examined it before you is an idiot. I say to him that they are not from an Indian background, so u does not understand the moron humor. it does not appreciate movies do not understand. what did you watch, the subtitles version where most jokes are lost in translation? that's what I was thinking jackass. <br /> <br /> akshay kumar is the best actor at all, and once again proves his versatility, he can not only make action but also comedy and is excellent. John has also proven himself to be his first comedy and he was also excellent.
