Fritz Lang's German medieval saga continues in Die Nibelungen: Kriemhilds Rache (1924) .Kriemhild (Margarete Schoen) wants to avenge her murdered husband, Siegfried. Her brother is too weak to assassinate Hagen. Kriemhild married Etzeel King of the Huns (Rudolf Klein-Rogge). He raises a child and invites his brothers to a party. Etzel and the other Huni should kill Hagen but are protected by their brothers. We see the enormous battle of life, and death begins, and it lightens the whole place. In fact, Hagen is dead and so is Kriemhild. These films deal with great themes such as revenge and undying love. We found out that we later saw some better movies on these topics, but it was one of the first.
