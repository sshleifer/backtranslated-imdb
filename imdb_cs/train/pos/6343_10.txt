Let me set the scene. It's a school holiday and there's nothing in movies. I'm with my friend, what decides what to see. We are looking for a movie that is soon to begin and "The Grinch" will appear. We buy tickets that do not know what to expect. What we got was a fun run. Jim Carrey (which I could add to being my first player in the world) was absolutely gorgeous as Grinch in this best Ron Howard movie (next to Apollo 13). The way this film was shot, scenery, actors, props and music was amazing. It really brought this children's film to life. The story is based on the story of grinch. As we all know, Grinch is a terrible person who just can not stand in Christmas. He lives high above the whoville and has never been wrong with the cities. But one little girl will change Grinch's look at life and the other in a drastic way. Cindy Lou Who (playing the adorable new actress Taylor Moms) will meet Grinchem to find a nice part of him right now. He tries to overcome the barrier and help Grinch move and mingle with the people of the city. This whole movie is a barrel of laughter for the whole family, both children and parents. SOLID 10/10. Well made Jim. <br /> <br />
