I've seen this movie recently. Two hours later my head still laughed. The plot was terribly horrible, the jokes were so bad, but what I did not do was: <br /> <br /> The first two scenes before and after the movie Pat and Jay posed (which caused more than enough laughter) 2. A bicycle through the windscreen that has turned off the criminals. This movie is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour series, and my copy even came up with a disc that said you do not like the movie to send an HBO certificate. While I was thinking, the date you had to send them was January 1991 (which also caused a burglary).
