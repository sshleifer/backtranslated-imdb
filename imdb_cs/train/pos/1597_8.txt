This is the kind of movie for a snowy Sunday afternoon, when the rest of the world can continue doing business when you go down to a big chair and a few hours soft. An amazing performance from Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) gently split the plot. There are no rapids to cross, no dangerous waters, just a warm and funny paddle in the life of New York at its best. A family film in every sense and one that deserves the praise it has gained.
