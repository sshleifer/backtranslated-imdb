When I read some comments on the billboards, I expected this film to be a complete disappointment - but when I was watching it, I could not laugh! It officially became my new favorite movie. I do not know what the whole hate is all about, maybe it's because a movie of this kind has never been before. I'm going to lose another feminine fairy-tale comedy. A lot of comedies will have one or two actresses at the head but there will be plenty of supportive male figures. It was almost all the woman - except for Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and Will Arnett's short look - and that worked. All actress actresses delivered a very entertaining performance (especially Missi Pyle) from a strange and dear script. The spell of this film seemed to me in my gentle feminist message: to accept who you are, the success of women in the public sphere, the power of friendship among women, and the breaking of gender roles. Although it's easy, each of the leaders faces a challenge because of their attempts to be a more entertaining conflict with their feminist values ​​and with which they knew themselves. Missy Pyle suggested that the film missed the theatrical release due to its versatile cast and lack of actor with a big name to earn a studio and I have to agree. Everyone I've recommended to love this movie and I think it's a shame that comedy celebrating female dorkiness has not been widely accepted and successful. I highly recommend this film to everyone with open mind or love for comic comics.
