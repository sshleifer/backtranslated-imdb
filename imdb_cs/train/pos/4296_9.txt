That would be my number one film of the year 1991, except that he was defeated by the brilliant JFK. It's such a wonderful movie! I loved it. I love stories where the lives of different characters intersect with each other and how they deal with their lives. Kevin Kline is good here but he is overwhelmed by Danny Glover and especially Steve Martin. I never really liked Martin or his style, but here he is great. I loved the whole speech that Kline put near the end of the Grand Canyon. The writing was great. Larry Kasdan is an IMO, a great writer of dialogue, on the roads of Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. Here he created several three-dimensional characters and well thought-out stories and messages that positively affect our lives. Great movie. 4 of 4 stars
