The space card unfortunately appeared at the same time as the Challenger Explosion. Those who actually gave the outline when it was necessary to bring them out, or even if they had, they would bring it out. I'm glad she did. I first watched SpaceCamp in the movie. Which really raised attention. <br /> <br /> While I heard of Leo Thompson and Tom Skerritt. I have never heard of the others in the movie. So it was a great shock to me when I found all the young actresses and played really well! Of course, Kate Capshaw was also excellent. I really liked the scene where it turned out that the kids behave like a team. The scenes of children who are ready for a trip could only hope. The actual launching of the spacecraft is, of course, old news. But this was different. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is one of the most prized films. Escapist maybe, but it was fantastic for a space like me. After probable rental in 30 - 40 times. Eventually I found her in a store and bought it. Now if it appears only on DVD. I'll probably have it forever. This movie gets 9 out of 10 from me.
