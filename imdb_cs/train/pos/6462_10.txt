I'm not going to spoil the content of anyone who has not seen this humble masterpiece by Kay Pollack. The world-renowned conductor, played by Michael Nyqvist, is looking for peace of mind by returning to his childhood village. Villagers watching genius in silence slowly attract him to share his size. Each role in this film has a very specific purpose and shows the remarkable potential of each of the actors to play their own chord in short but accurate words, a symphony of love. Not love in the sense of relationship, but in the tone of the spirit deeply buried inside every character, each revealing their own contemporary story, their needs, skeletons, desires and much more. Do not forget to mention the two main parts played by Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyqvist, whose plays are played in unforgettable harmonic emotional feedback. They touch each other with the pain associated with their own inability to love. Michael Nyqvist is really tested here in a very difficult arrangement in one of those films that either end up as disastrous or fantastic. And fantastic it happened from start to finish, not one second less or more than enough, you are left with feelings of change and taste for more. To date, I'm sure one of the best movies I've had the pleasure of watching.
