I've seen it as many times as I could before I left the scene. Beautiful and funny movie with some of my very popular stars. I just wish I found it again! I would definitely buy / view it if I could. Please someone, bring it back. Fred MacMurray was perfect in his role as a patriot during World War II, and his front ladies, Joan Leslie and especially June Haver, were beautiful and charming. It was musical, but also romantic, fun and smart. It was my favorite film with the star June Haver, although I always enjoyed it. A dazzling smile illuminated the screen, and its beauty and talent were a benefit to every film. The supporting cast gave the loan its individual roles. A well-balanced and reckless film; just a wish for us to like more!
