I was curious how the critics responded to this exciting inspirational film, so I went to Rotten Tomatoes and was horrified when I discovered that the pompous peanut gallery, which is a film critic of our nation, gave the film an average of 43% (or " Rotten "). <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say is that if you do not move this movie, you have no heart. (It is interesting to note that the same movie on the same site received 74% of the viewers). Not that critics' opinion is important to me. After all, I can not think of an unnecessarily overpaying profession. Some schmoos get paid to go to cinema (how hard life) and they do the same thing everyone else does on the planet: they make an opinion. But these chumps have a way of getting over, as their opinion somehow matters more than you, and even worse, they like to hate. I assure you that this movie is old fashioned (well, except for f-bombs), syrups and a little predictable ... after all, you know that from the beginning that Cuba Gooding Jr., representing the realistic naval hero Carl Brashear, will at all times triumph (in the end) simply by meeting: determined and devoted; but his performance and De Niro (like Billy Sunday, the composite character of several real people) are so powerful and inspiring that you will be stimulating many of your movie scenes on your feet, especially the culmination of the courtroom. You'll have to be a real wand in the mud to stay away from these scenes. Just like our film critics. Michael Rappaport is an excellent, as well as a sweet nature, stuttering diving student who ties to Gooding Brashear. If someone saw "Higher Teachings," this character totally redeems this character. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it confirms what I've always felt: do not listen to critics. Watch this movie and get inspired.
