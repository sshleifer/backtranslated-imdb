I'm a fan of TV movies in general and it was one of the good ones. The feature-length performances were quite solid, and there were twists and turns I did not see before each ad. For me, it was something like a medium meeting CSI. Did anyone else think that in a certain way the daughter looked like a young Nicole Kidman? Are they related? I would definitely watch it if it ever came to a video. Dedee was great. She did not see many things in her, and she did her work very convincingly. If you are in TV mystery movies, check out if you have a chance.
