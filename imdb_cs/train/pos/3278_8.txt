It is a well-written and well-functioning psychological drama. It's not really horrible, so those looking for something like The Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed. What really surprised me was the intelligence and gentle attention paid to the details of the plot and the effort that was to be intrinsically consistent. I also appreciated the absence of Dr. Phil psychobabble or New Age of Revisionism. Rather than developing the agenda, the creators just told the story, they said it well and let the viewer think about it. The scattered dreams reminded Wyeth's paintings and were amazingly effective. a great example of how to make a good film on a small budget, without big studies, star actors, big names of directors (it was much better than many Hitchcock films), special effects or "smart" plot.
