I disagree with other comments on this movie. For example, the film is based on a book, and if the writer had gay characters in how "Hollywood" could just throw a token gay character in the movie. Besides, there were two homosexual characters, and I thought they were mirroring each other. One was normal and the other was female, but it was not over the top. And Diane Keaton gave a wonderful performance, and if the other reviewer had the decency to really watch the whole movie, they could see that her character evolved from the film by interacting with other characters. For example, when she and Adam went to see the car that Sara had hit the scraper, she saw her mother's side come out, and later in the movie you saw that she was invincible. But I think if you are too worried about gays and characters that are bad then this film is bad. But if you're more open and I do not know you really have a bit of a doubt about what's good then you'll enjoy this movie.
