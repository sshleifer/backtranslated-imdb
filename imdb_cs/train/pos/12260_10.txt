This is a great start to Mickey Rooney's film career. His talent here shows that he has a long career. The ride of cars and trucks is exciting for the 1937s. This beginning of Andy Hardy's series is in my book The American Treasure. Performance Spring Byington is as good as usual. Please, Mr. Rooney or the film rights owners, take the chance and get it on DVD. I think it will be the winner.
