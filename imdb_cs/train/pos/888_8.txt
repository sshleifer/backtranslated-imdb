One of the better kung fu movies, but not as perfect as I hoped it due to shining reviews. The film starts well enough, and the jokes are so visual that they translate the language barrier (which is rarer than you thought at this time) and that the dialogue sequence without a fight was successful (for a kung fu movie, that's a great compliment). Unlike other Chinese action movies that were always in pieces or (following the Jackie Chan I police story), Pedicab Driver gives us a look at contemporary rural China. Unfortunately, in the second third of the film it takes a nosedive into the dark melodrama of the tragedy that I thought was useless. The action is good overall, featuring a duel between Sammo and 1/2 of Shaw Brothers' only two stars, Kar-Leung Lau and then fighting at the end with the taller guy who always plays Jet Li's bad guy. There is only 20 minutes of fighting, which is standard, but what bothers me is the obvious acceleration of the camera frames. I do have to shoot half the speed to avoid harm to each other, but they are smooth adjustments and then this is it. It really exacerbates the pain when it is obvious that it has happened. <br /> <br /> This means that if you like kung fu movies, my opinion here will not discourage you, and if you do not, you just lost 2 minutes of your life.
