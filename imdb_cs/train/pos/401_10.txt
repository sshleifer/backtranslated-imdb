I have just returned from Hong Kong for my summer vacation and saw the Legend of the ZU. I thought he kicked it! She was so creative and unique. It's a cruel tiger hidden dragon with much less drama. Even if some thought there were too many special FXs (yeah right!), You can not complain about the cast. Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung are so great! Legend o ZU ..... kicks and * s !!!!!!!!
