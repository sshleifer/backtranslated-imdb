Watching "Fox and Child" was a drunken experience. Bright pictures, the integrity of the view, and the complete beauty of the environment and the characters left me in full swing. <br /> <br /> The plot is uncomplicated. Deceptively simple. In the container of this simplicity, a world that draws you and your breath is developing. <br /> <br /> I laughed. I cried. I learned. This is a movie you can rely on - do it. I dare to say that it is love for any innocent heart. It reaches the heart of the viewer - of any age - and reveals the world with new eyes as if it were seen from the heart. Adi Da Samraj once said that true art draws the viewer in view of the ecstatic participation in reality. I feel I have the privilege of watching - not, to participate - in this film, works of real art.
