It takes patience to get through the eccentricity of David Lynch, but - to change - to life confirming the chronicle of Alvin Straight's journey, but stick to it. While moving as slowly as Straight's John Deere, when he encounters strangers who encounter his pilgrimage, we learn a lot about the isolation of aging, painful sorrows and secrets, and ultimately the power of family and reconciliation. Richard Farnsworth overlaps his career with the truest year, sad and poetic, gentle and careful. And Sissy Spacek agrees to him as his "slow" daughter, Rose, who was trying to care for her father to try her own private loss. Rarely, the modern film is so positive about the family.
