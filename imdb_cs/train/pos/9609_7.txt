It was a pretty good movie, I liked him. I thought it was a fairly accurate look at bulimia and how it is not about diet, it's about having such a deep pain that it has to find a way to deal with it and they choose it. Beth was a very cartoon character, and on the scene where she is confronted by her mother about eating problems, you can see the pain inside her and hear her in her voice, and you know how deep the pain is that she feels. I also think one of the best lines in the movie is where Beth yelled, "It's not about you." her mother. These words were so true and she joined the scene in the movie. I think this scene was definitely the most important scene in this movie.
