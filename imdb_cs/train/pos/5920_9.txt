American icon Henry Fonda portrays "Elegant" John Howard, an aging trucker who, after long hospital stays, brought his beloved grand platform "Eleanor." When he decides to make another perfect ride, he gets out of the hospital, steals Eleanor and connects with old friend Penelope Pearson (Eileen Brennan) who needs to relocate her prostitute collection. /> <br /> The amazing performance of the fundas is a natural anchor for a film that attracts roots as efficiently as polished in funny bones in comedy scenes. Exclusive actor, such as Robert Englund, as a reluctant young assistant, Susan Sarandon (who also gains co-productions credits) and Dub Taylor (wonderful ham, as always in the most spectacular comedy part of the painting), helped enormously. br /> <br /> Finally, life confirming the nature of the image and the meaningfulness of the path bear an incredible weight; it's an image that, assuming you get into it, you remember long after it's over. <br /> <br /> The promise of the open road is live here; the landscape looks beautiful. Set to a great musical score Craig Safans, it's a remarkable aesthetic image. He's a bit losing something in his final act (the characters of John Byner and Austin Pendleton are just a little more than the intrusion), yet he keeps his good vibes because of the appeal of his central characters. <br /> <br /> It is not expected that these titles (especially its "Great Smokey Roadblock") will be a stunning movie experience that I can recommend without any problems. <br /> <br /> 9/10
