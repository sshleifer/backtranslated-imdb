As soon as dreams come, this is the pursuit of a brass ring naive by a non-commissioned officer (JON VOIGT) and his crazy assistant (DUSTIN HOFFMAN), who soon will build friendship based on basic survival skills. <br /> <br /> <br /> A brave film for its time and the foremost example of a kind of shrubby landscape that is explored in more graphic films of the 1960s. Symbolic for the "end of innocence" in American films because he was the only X-rated film that won Oscar for Best Picture. JON VOIGT is a male houser who comes to a big city and expects to find women an easy way to make money when they fight over his body but soon finds the city's cool place without a welcome mat for his ilk. Along with a poor con-man (DUSTIN HOFFMAN), he goes through a series of serio-comic adventures that have left him disillusioning and bitter, ready to leave the boundaries of the cold water apartment for the sun promised in Florida, the land his friend "Ratzo" dreams of living . But even in this last search are two defeats. John Schlesinger directed with an excellent screenplay by Waldo Salt and John Barry's haunted theme "Midnight Cowboy" adds to the rapid moments of search and despair. Summary: A true American classic honestly faces a tough subject and the courage to show off some of the aspects of urban life.
