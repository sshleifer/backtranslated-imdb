One of my favorite movies ever. Just beautiful, full of human emotions, joke, humor, intelligence. The story grows, just like a lesson of life, just a wonderful film in many ways. Cast is also fantastic ..... a great selection of the best British talents. I loved them all for every diverse element brought to the film. Italy must be one of the most romantic places that make up such a story, everything about this movie works. <br /> <br /> I love it :)
