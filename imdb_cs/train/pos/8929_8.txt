I first liked the central idea of ​​finding "intruders", others in a fragile self, at different levels - mainly subconscious, but sometimes more allegorical. In fact, intruders are ubiquitous throughout the movie: on the Swiss-French border, where the heroine leads a lonely life; in his recurrent dream and nightmare; inside his sick body after a heart transplant .... In the last half of the film he will become an intruder and return to the old French colony in the hope of forgiving the past. <br /> <br /> The overall tone is rather hot than pathetic, full of regret and guilt, feeling more or less dominant. This is a rather cruel image of old age, seemingly dependent on itself, but hopelessly empty and lonely inside. Directer composes images more to convey feelings of anxiety and desire than any explicit meanings. Some of them are charming, not humorous, but some sort of absurd game can only imagine.
