Abe Lincoln's early career is beautifully presented by Ford. Not that someone has seen real Lincoln shots, but Fonda, wearing a fake nose, is like Lincoln weird, with voice, delivery, walking and other ways - just as he could imagine Lincoln. In the first of three consecutive films he made with the Fund, Ford is at the top of its shape and perfectly evoking the early 19th century. The story focuses on a few accused murderers who defend Lincoln, and the scenes in the courtroom are pretty well done. Supporting cast includes many of the common Fords. It was the last movie Alice Brady, who died months after his release.
