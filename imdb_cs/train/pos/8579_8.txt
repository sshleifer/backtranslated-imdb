Story: The criminal links 3 different mafias in a business to buy an island that would then serve as a money laundering facility for organized crime. To make it impossible, the FBI is trying to grab one of the mafia. The thing goes wrong and some unlikely plot and twists and turns appear with other "cop friends who do not like each other" ... one was the FBI agent and the other was a former DEA agent. <br /> <br /> So far, so stupid. But the power of this film is not in its story - a bad joke, at best. It's funny. (The least synchronized German version is). The event is also good with a memorable scene that includes a shotgun and rocket launcher. Focus, however, focuses on humor. Not intelligent satire, not quite spooky, but somewhere between us, you have a lot of funny jokes. <br /> <br /> However, this film is the opposite of political correctness. Legal drug abuse is prominent, without criticism, and even depicts it as cold. That's the part of the movie that's really angry with me, and in my opinion it's inappropriate for the kids. <br /> <br /> Everyone in all, for a nice evening of watching comes acceptable action with some funny jokes, this movie is perfect. Just remember: In this genre, it is common to leave your brain at the door when you enter the cinema / TV room. Then you will have a good time. 8/10
