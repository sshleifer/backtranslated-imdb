Yes, as other reviewers have said, it may not be the L & H vintage, but it's far from being the worst of their work than in the 20th Century stupid ... I think Fox. This movie certainly has all the basic ingredients to make things wrong for the boys. But it's their serious attitude and determination that makes them funny. They are not laughing as if the other comics do, but they take their job and the situation quite seriously, and that is the essence of their eternal humor. In this film, they encounter some of the basic problems that one of us really can meet today, and work-related stress. First of all, we would have had a doctor examined, and he would have prescribed the necessary rest and perhaps stayed by the sea. This is where the reality comes. L & H always accepts the most probable situation and exaggerates it, but never to the point of being incredible until a while. This makes us laugh because we can relate to their own problems and attempts to liberate themselves. This is what makes Stan and Ollie universal in their appeal. In this film, all these ingredients are presented in a beautiful and elegant way. It is not their best in comparison to their earlier works, probably because it was the real last film for Roach because he wanted to mirror "big" studios and go into feature creation and also wanted to hurry up and finish their contractual commitments. BIG MISTAKE! They should all stay together and maybe continue another five years. What the world may miss when it does not consider it an option. Watch, laugh and enjoy it as their last great performance.
