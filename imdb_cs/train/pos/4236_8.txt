Take this movie for what it is, not a remake, but a completely different approach to the same concept. It's not epic as the original, it's more like a popcorn thriller. Visually it's incredible. Everything else was fine. <br /> <br /> What is it, I think the movie is amazing, but I like everything Burton did. People have to calm down and stop acting as if it were the end of the b / c world of this film. It was not a remake, and it is not. <br /> <br /> The end was cool. . I took it as a parallel universe.
