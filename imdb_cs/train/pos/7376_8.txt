I really liked this debut director Ride Hideo Nakata. If you've ever seen Ring then you'll be introduced to the style and idea of ​​this movie. It has delicate spooks that work better than the constant (and predictable) smells that infest most of the regular movies of this genre. If you like movies that give you a fever, you probably like it. Good, scary debut by Hidea Nakata. 8/10
