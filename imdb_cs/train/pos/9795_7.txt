I've always said that Batman animated movies are much better than live action movies. I've seen all the animated movies, but the pile is the poorest, and it's rather unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> "Phantasm Mask" would be best, then "Best World," then "Sub Zero," then "Return of the Joker"> <br /> In this latest animated film in Gotham a mysterious new Batgirl, and Batman aims to find out if she is a girlfriend or an enemy when she goes on a search for revenge. But as Bruce joins three young women, he begins to investigate them and find out who the new batgirl is. The tone in this movie is unusually bright, because most of the films are grim and gloomy, which was more disappointing. Bruce most often behaves exceptionally out of character, villains are used to the latest films, and while the action scenes are exciting, they are really nothing new. It also lacks the dramatic impact that other films have, especially the "Sub-Zero," which was heavy in dramatic development and nature. <br /> <br /> Everything in the movie feels quite recyclable and supporting characters are charming, but no one is really worth the roots. <br /> <br /> All the time I really enjoyed, I had the blast and the identity of the new batgirl is surprising, but it was not that exciting, she hoped. <br /> <br /> (** half of ****)
