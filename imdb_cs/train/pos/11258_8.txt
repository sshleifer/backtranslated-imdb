Spoilers! Classic 70 is Sexual Waste! Swedish gal (Helga) was what made the film so great. She was beautiful, but what really got me was how she was sexual. She emitted a massive amount of sexuality in the movie. Their best scenes were when she encouraged herself. Whenever she was on the screen, I was overwhelmed. Also, Dr. Julia (sister of the confused male focus of the film) was very interesting visually. Although most twelve-year-old girls have bigger breasts than Julia, she knew how to take advantage of what she had and her scenes (especially scenes with a silky blouse and black skirt) also grabbed my attention helplessly. You also have to love the main scary scene where the bats strip off the bats; I do not know if I've ever seen anything more absurd, but also sexy. Classic things!
