Old film fans will know why I would call this "Man in a gray flannel robe." Most of the Bible-based films are basically a scholarship - what could cause smiles and giggles is how Peck seeks to raise awareness of various psychological and social issues with a spear carrying a Neanderthal around him. Like the Great Romantik, it falls like unleavened bread. But there is something about this film. Of all the great Hollywood biblical images, he most surprisingly expresses the ambivalent attitude of the average American towards belief in the biblical God. Billy's Sunday thesis is refuted by the opposite of H.L.Mencken through the script. Whoever gets the best in Symphony Supported by Heavenly Chorus depends on your point of view. In addition, D & B boasts good performances by Peck (especially in the final repentance) and Jayne Meadows as his bitter first wife Michol, a lively, moody atmosphere (a good idea to set up most of the action at dawn or at night) and a revitalizing rendition of the Psalm in twenty thirds at the end.
