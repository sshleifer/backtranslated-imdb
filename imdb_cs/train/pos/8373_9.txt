Comment on previous reviewers: This film is "science-fiction adaptation Iliad" by the screenwriter. Whether links are painful or not, no apologies, it is the basis for the film. They admit that they stole ... although it is adapted to P.C. date. <br /> <br /> Great movement, but too short. It probably did not work out, like the author, the director or the studio, but it was a damn fun. The fact that the studio itself has collapsed during the creation helps to add to its heritage. The big budget would not be so funny and probably the scenario would not do more justice. But it's fun to dream about the possibilities. DVD release with some modest add-ons is obviously available, but I do not think it would be played with NTSC players. I'm not an expert, so I'm still trying to find out. Meanwhile, I live in a VHS incarnation.
