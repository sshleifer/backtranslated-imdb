I was hoping it would be good as James Timothy Dalton's fan of James, and although it was not his deserved "third connection", it was laughter. Belu≈°i brought some good humor to his work, and the dalton managed it nicely but was probably inadequate. part of him liked Jack Nicholson in a camping version of some good men. the second Brit in it was a bit shocking, but it was laughter.
