Maxx is a deep psychological introspective slightly masked as the strange nature of the superhero. Julie Winters is an "unemployed social worker" in an unknown dirty city that is a frantic criminal, and she and everyone she knows has a lot of trouble. Maxx is her boyfriend and client, a street bum who thinks she's a superhero dressed in a costume - or is it the other way around? Maxx can not be missed for the work of art, the story itself, or the excellent voice work - particularly late Barry Stigler's deliciously urban, grumbling torture of the main villain, Mr. Gone. If you can, do not miss.
