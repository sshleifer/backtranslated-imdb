I looked like it was in Russian but I really liked it. The main character Sasha was born cursed, with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body. His whole life lives unhappy because he was different and because his anger caused him to do deadly things. <br /> <br /> When Sasha finally found love in a young woman named Katya, they all tried to take her away and end up in a deadly battle. It was a fair amount of gore, but there was not much for the weak acorns. <br /> <br /> Not for people who like an old Hollywood movie, but for those who like independent films. Some sense had an Asian fantasy film.
