Bell Book and Candle was released in December 1958 and features James Stewart, Kim Novak and Jack Lemmon. and Ernie Kov√°cs. This film had James Stewart and Kim Novak in his second pairing on the screen (following the classic vertigo of Alfred Hitchcock, which came out the same year). Stewart's last film was romantic because at the age of 50 he was too old to be old enough to play that part. The film is about the witch played by Kim Novak, who is attracted to mortal James Stewart. He gives him a spell and falls into his head in love with her. I loved the film and its cast. This film at that time was a modest success, which was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Film Comedy. GimmeClassics
