The film was absolutely amazing and cool. The graphics were great and great. Especially, Flik was great and amazing in the movie and was fun and was and was sometimes intelligent. Circus errors are colorful and are excellent in the movie. The grasshoppers were also cool and cool in the movie. Hopper was a clean and perfect villain. Even, Dot was cute. When a bird comes to eat mistakes, the scene was beautiful and good. Even the last scene was amazing and cool. Even Fliko's inventions were good. Building an artificial bird was a good idea to scare grasshoppers. When the ants build an artificial bird, the scene was good and pretty, I should really appreciate the creator of "The Life of Bugs".
