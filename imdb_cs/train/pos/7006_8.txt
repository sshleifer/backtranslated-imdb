Thomas (Will Smith), terribly secret, seeks redemption by radically transforming the lives of seven people he does not know. Once his plan is set, nothing will stop him. At least that's what they think. But Ben did not intend to fall in love with one of these people, and she would end up transforming it. Will Smith is back with director Gabriel Muccino after his life-inspiring film "The Pursuit of Happiness". "Seven pounds" is another life-changing film experience that not only reminds you of their previous collaboration, but also warmth, but at the end inspires you joyfully. Will Smith is also a producer again with some others. These films are very realistic, showing the common life of man and his life. Seven pounds might take some time to get a real impulse, but right after half an hour of film, everything is ready to rule your heart. Also, this movie has several rotations that turn around, which allows viewers to guess. Director Gabriele Muccino is the winner all the time with his emotional but inspirational message. He makes all the characters of the film very real that people would actually find themselves in the movie. Together with the director Will Smith is another winner with excellent acting skills. Once again, the duo of the director and the actor acts as a spell. There are also other talented actors who have helped their role. Rosario Dawson, Beauty with Brains, is what can be called. It looks beautiful and its part is very good. Barry Pepper gives great support to the film, and Woody Harrelson does the same, though Woody did not have much time on the screen (it would be good if he had more). Do not forget about this movie easily. Watch this movie and change your life. Cinema in top class!
