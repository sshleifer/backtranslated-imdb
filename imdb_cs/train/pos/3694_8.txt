He was not sure what to expect from this film in view of his amazing collection of stars and directors, but eventually he did not disappoint. For me, one of the highlights was the last episode with an American tourist I spoke with a terrible French accent (which made me feel better about me), which was quite a touch and a great way to close the film. The story of a paramedical and stabbing victim was also very moving and for the pure comedy the brothers Coen and Steve Buscemi award the prize. Clip Tom Tykwer was also impressive, though he was rather ambitious in his field. The Bob Hoskins segment was absolutely breathtaking and the vampire story was totally false. The dialogue in the Wes Craven section also felt very forcefully, and the story of Chinatown was completely incomprehensible. Overall, this movie is good for watching good bits and has a strong surface. It's not too painful when you sit in the wrong places - it only takes 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> As I watched at peine !!!
