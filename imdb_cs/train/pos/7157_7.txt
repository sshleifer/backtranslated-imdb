This movie is fun, fun and high quality. The movie very cleverly follows the instructions if the book, and tries to keep the lines accurate. Actors are all right and you would expect them to be part of it. They use several famous actors who make the film a big hit. Graphics are somewhat complicated in some parts, and there are a number of bugs throughout the movie. For example, there is no such thing as a yellow spotted lizard. The camp is not as horrible as explained in the book, and they do not tend to show how they appear in the camp just like a book. All of his band are much mentioned in the book, but they are not in the movie. Overall a great movie for the rainy afternoon
