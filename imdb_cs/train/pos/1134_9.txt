The only part missing in this film is Shue's part as a daughter who wants to watch in her dance steps as a daily soap star. Otherwise it would be perfect 10. It seems that each actor enjoyed their parts and survived to fulfill his own experience as well as the script - I wonder if a little ad lib'ing was not done in parts. and there are some classic lines that will stick with you. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic movie that everyone should see at least once I would recommend that you do not drink anything that would lift your nose. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You will definitely want to watch the last scene, 'Sister Nan' has a little secret that she should not share with you. <br /> <br /> If you love or despise daytime soaps, about entertainment in all the right places.
