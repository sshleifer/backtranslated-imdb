I found this episode as one of the most funny I've ever seen. The South Park makers have done the best of the romero of the movie I've ever seen. They really touched Romera's basic social commentary he had created with each of his films. I would like to know what opinion George Romero had on this episode, I'm sure it was purely positive! Keeping his real vision for his epic zombies fully intact! Most spoofs deal with pure gore without the viewer thinking that Romero is trying to do with his films. I think that if the zombie breaks out, we can really take care of our property values ​​before our lives, as shown in this episode!
