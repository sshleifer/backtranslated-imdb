Interesting, fast and fun. I'm not one of those people watching the load and plenty of televisions. I came to this show while at one time I acted ill with the flu one day, and I immediately hooked it up. I developed into John Burke. Both together and Claire did a great job of arranging a show together. You could really say that they both loved their work. Collector segments were great. I found out that I was interested in things I had never done before. What I really would like to know is: What happened to Jack with the dog? Has he received one of the hosts?
