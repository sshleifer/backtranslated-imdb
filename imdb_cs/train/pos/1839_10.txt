A great film about two cops who love the same woman. One policeman (Périer) killed her, but it seems that all the evidence accuses the other (Montand). The unfortunate Montand does not know who the other lover is to kill her, and Périer does not even know that Montand had a relationship with the girl. Montand must absolutely find the murderer ... and that's a great ending! Highly recommended.
