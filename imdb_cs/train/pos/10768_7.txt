I've seen it a long time ago when I was younger, and I never forgot the title until one day I went through IMDb's John Candy film credits and did not notice the record "One for a Crime ..." Something was ringing in the bell and I clicked on her, and after reading the summary of the plot, he brought me a lot of memories. I've found it to be pretty good, though it's nothing to mean a "great" comedy. But it is rather pleasant and is a good riff of Hitchcock's pattern of mistaken identity and global excitement. The film has a large cast of characters, including an American couple who finds a female dog on holiday in Europe and decides to return her for a reward - just find her dead body on arrival. From there, the plot gets crazier and stronger and they go on escape after the police think they are killers. The kind of mix between "Mad Mad Mad Mad World" and the lighter Hitchcock feature, this was directed by Eugene Levy and managed to get some good friends - such as John Candy - into the game. The movie is mostly fun because of its cast, and the end has a funny little procedure that is not entirely unpredictable, but it is also a bit unexpected.
