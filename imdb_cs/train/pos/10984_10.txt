One question that has to be asked right now is: Would this movie be created if the women were not aunt and cousin Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis? The answer is: Probably not. /> <br /> Fortunately, they are (or were) a cousin and Aunt Jackie. This document from the Brothers Maysles about existence (barely could it call life) Edith B. Beale, Jr. and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale (Edie) have the same challenge as a wreck train - you do not want to look but you have to. Big Edith and Little Edie live in a once magnificent mansion in East Hampton, New York, which is slowly falling apart. The beautiful gardens are now jungle. The magnificent oil painting relies on a wall (with cat litter on the floor behind) and beautiful portraits of them as young women try to place on the walls next to the covers of old magazines. <br /> <br /> Life alone together for many years broke many barriers between the two women, but built another. <br /> <br /> Dress seems optional. Edie's favorite costume is a pair of shorts with a cord hose that floats on them and pieces of cloth wrapped around the hull and the head. Edith says: "Edie is still beautiful at 56." And it really is. There are times when it is almost luminescent and both women show the beauty that once was. <br /> <br /> There is a constant suspicion of sexual tension. <br /> <br /> Their eating habits are polite) strange. Ice cream is spread to crackers. Dinner for Edith's birthday of delicious bread sandwiches served on fine porcelain with plastic containers. Time is in their world irrelevant; as Edie says, "I have no lessons." Their relationships with men are oh-so-strange. Edie feels Edith has thwarted all her attempts at happiness. He says, "If you can not get a person to suggest you, you can be just as dead." Edith says, "I'll take the dog every day." <br /> <br /> It is obvious that Edith does not see her role in Edie's lack of male co-op. At the beginning of the film, she says, "France fell, but Edie did not do it. Sometimes it's difficult to hear exactly what is said." Both women speak at the same time and are constantly contradictory. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < . /> At one point Edie declares: "The aristocracy mark is the responsibility." But they seem unable to take responsibility for themselves. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult film that can be watched but it is worth it.
