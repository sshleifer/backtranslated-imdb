The fourth in the series "Dirty Harry" contains this film one of the most fearsome, deadliest, most dangerous, incurable, disgusting women I've ever seen on the film: "Ray Perkins," played by Audrey Neenan. She is a modern ugly version with a low life of the character "Detour" of 1945, "Ann Savage." Her bad mouth and dripping position turned me away so much I never saw this movie again until I got the filter of unhappiness that closed her ... and the least of it! Then I could enjoy the rest of the movie. Wherever "Harry Callahan" (Clint Eastwood) goes, there is violence ... ... in minutes! It happens so often that it's almost ridiculous, but it does a fast-moving, funny movie with a satisfactory end because all the dirty villains are eliminated one by one. This is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our basic instincts ..... and attaches it is sad to say. Most of us like to see these dirtballs at last, and who does it better than Dirty Harry?
