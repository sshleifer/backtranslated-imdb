First of all, I would like to say that this film is raw more than any recent crap that Hollywood develops from its guts. McBain is a real action movie with more violence than most viewers can handle. It has all the classic elements of the action movie of the late 1980s and early 1990s ... of random unreasonable acts of violence (ie when Walken and the crew go to drug dealers to get the money they just show and kill before letting them live and just take their money), burst of throat, fire boys, boys who drove out of buildings, and, of course, the guys who are in the fire who are thrown out of the buildings. Walken is at its best in this picture and adds unforgettable lines such as "let's sit .......... on board." and others that make this movie the best place to buy at a local video store. if you have bloodshed for unnecessary violent acts of chance to rent this film today and satisfy your thirst.
