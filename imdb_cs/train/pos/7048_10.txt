The story of this movie does not have to be extraordinary, but what makes the film really unique is its characters (and the actors who play them, of course!). I'm not going to go into details about the plot of the film, but would I say that? This movie is not just for everyone! The movie is really funny and you have to be as smart to get all the satire. If you are not honest after a while, you probably end up missing one of the fine points. The film is full of seemingly trivial but funny things - like the news going on in the background on Turaqistan, tank ads (which I almost missed), and those that make the movie cheerful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> John Cusack has come into acting very effectively (what is co-author and producer with him) and played his character? Hauser, a killer with a heart? wonderfully. Cusack played a similar role before in Grosse Pointe Blank, but his comic disposition in the movie is simply superb. But the actress who steals the show is Hilary Duff! I've always been a big fan of Mrs. Duff. But to be honest, I was a little disappointed when I heard about the role she plays in the movie. After watching the film, however, disappointment gave way to great respect for her as an actor. Let's look at it! The boy is growing, but yes, it's her talent! All those critics who shouted that Hilary could not act are silent for a moment. Hilary had to play a really complicated character? heavy outside, but sweet baby inside? and she did it fairly. Does she laugh at you, and she screams you? to cut this long story (because I could have it forever) she is BRILLIANT! Marisa Tomei and Joan Cusack also did a good job. Joan's hysteria is especially honest! However, I was rather disappointed that Ben Kingsley was so poorly rolled up and his performance seemed faint. <br /> <br /> In general, War, Inc. keeps you on top of your smart humor and ends just the right amount of twists in the plot. I highly recommend this movie to everyone (and like Hilary Duff fans) !!! P.S. - I'm really glad that the film will get rid of her limited release and soon will come out in other places !!!
