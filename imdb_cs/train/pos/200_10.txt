Updated from previous comment. The great and underestimated Marion Davies shows her comedy in this late (1928) silent comedy, also performed by the great William Haines. Davies plays a kid from Georgia who crashes Hollywood with help of Haines, a little player in rough comedies. They appear together in a cheap comedy until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great dramatic star. <br /> <br /> Great Hollywood Puppetry and Its Claims. Davies & Haines are a great team and guests from Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Map, John Gilbert, Elina Glin, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Louely Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle and Marion Davies (you must see this). It must be for some serious film fan or anyone interested in the ever-accused Marion Davies! Dell Henderson plays father. Polly Moran is a maid. Paul Ralli is a slim leading man. It turned out that people used Gloria Swanson's career as their model (I think Mae Murray is closer). Davies and Swanson were friends. The story of this film, however, has in the meantime led the resurrection of Swanson from Mack Sennett's comedy with one reel and Charlie Chaplin with STAR in Cecil B. DeMille's films from late teens and early 20's. Davies and Haines were huge MGM stars and friends. It's strange that MGM has never met dancers. They are great together! Sweet romance and beautiful spoof from Early Hollywood. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned but do not appear.
