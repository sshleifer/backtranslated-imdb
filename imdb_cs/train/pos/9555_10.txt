I've seen this movie 12 years ago at TNT. It was the birthday of Susanah York and they showed this film as a pair with Tom Jones (1963). I have not seen this movie on TV since. I was interested in seeing this movie because one of the stars is a very funny and talented Jim Dale, like the Lusty sailor. I believe Dale is now making a story about Harry Potter's books about Casette, but it's pretty funny. This is a fast comedy. This is not a VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures should go through the film collection and think about restoring and releasing this movie on DVD. Christopher Plummer is cheerful as Lord Fopington, Ian Bannen is also quite humorous as a Ramble sailor. It's a dirty comedy, a kind of movie that can not be seen anymore, with great production value. *** 1/2 stars from ****
