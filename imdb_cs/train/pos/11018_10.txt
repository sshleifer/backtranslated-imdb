This movie is a really nervous film Cliffhangin movie! Stallone was as good as ever! Michael Rooker gave a surprise performance and John Lithgow plays a great villain! Music is a fantastic theme especially! The action is packed and never boring! Stallone fan and watch Cliffhanger, you will not be disappointed!
