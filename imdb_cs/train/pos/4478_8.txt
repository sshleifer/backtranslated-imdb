Overall, it's a gorgeous, reckless, romantic, musical comedy. I suppose it could be a small case that the movie will be long. But I'm not sure what you'd get rid of. The singing that Kelly and Sinatra do? No. Wonderful dance Kelly does? No. The time needed for a movie to develop a story and develop relationships between characters? No (it seems to be a frequent complaint many times that newer movies do not develop characters). Some comment that Iturbi did not bring much power to the film, but it gives us a chance to see and hear great talent from the 1940s. So what if he was not an actor? It was an important part of the film, because the basic story was to get him into bankruptcy. <br /> <br /> Originally, Katherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star. Louis B. Mayer brought her to MGM for a screen test that included aria. During her bankruptcy in the movie, the shot of MGM brass nods and smiles. You can only imagine that it was like this when she had become a real screen before. <br /> <br /> This movie is so full of life that it's hard to hit all the peaks. It uses great colors and lighting throughout the movie. You see why Frank Sinatra became the star he did. The nice contrast in the movie is how Sinatra (a ladies man) played a role that just wanted to find a date on holiday. You will feel good when you see this movie. 7/10
