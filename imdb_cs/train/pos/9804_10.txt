"Batman: The Secret of Batwoman" is about as fun as Batman's animated films get. <br /> <br /> While still faithful to the comic, animation is done with a lighter spirit than in the animated series. Bruce Wayne looks the same as before, but now seems a little less impressive. Dick Grayson Robin was replaced by the less nervous and younger Tim Drake Robin. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy as usual reports Batman's voice better than most live action actors. <br /> <br /> Kelly Ripa made a much more decent voice acting than I expected. As in the live events of Batman's films, the film lives or dies on the basis of villains. My favorite all, Penguin, is here. His design is more amazing than he first appeared, and he looked more at Burgess Meredith's 60s portrait than Danny DeVito's "Batman Returns" portrait. David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for the voice of Penguin. Penguin is finally portrayed as cunning sophisticated, just as he most commonly appears in a comic book. Hector Elizondo's voice creates Bane, which is much more memorable than the forgotten version of "Batman & Robin". Finally, Batman has a mysterious secret to solve and puts "detective" back into "detective comics" (that's what "DC" means, after all.) The Revolution to the Secret is a wonderfully twisted twist. > <br /> Score contributes to the mysterious atmosphere of the film. It sounds like a mixture between "Poirot" scores and "Mission: Impossible" scores. Overall, it's more fun than your average cartoon.
