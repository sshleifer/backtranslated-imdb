Report on the movie, but rather good. Excellent cast, from top to bottom. Interestingly, the fact that Bette Davis's plot is basically a story! Extremely negative reviews (the name to play on a screenplay / playwright, somehow it combines with extremely negative comments about "Angels in America", etc.). They are the subject of a movie that has been too much reported to Germany in the Second World War. God, that's just a little too sophisticated understanding of morality for me. Theater and film and acting styles are changing over time, and of course, 70 years later, this particular film would not be produced here. Yes, Casablanca is a better film (I think), but although it was made in the same year and both have the Nazis in them, Casablanca is a love story. The love story in this movie has a second place on the spy plot - more thriller. Both have quite a number of rather raw accents and gorgeous actors. Children are a little tedious and can be modified
