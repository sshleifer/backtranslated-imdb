This movie is amazing. Writing, directing, playing is fantastic. Very funny and clever script. A high-quality performer of actors, Ally Sheedy is strong and dynamic and wonderfully strange. Really original and heartfeltly unpredictable. The scenes are alive with fresh energy and truly talented production.
