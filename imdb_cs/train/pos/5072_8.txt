Pierce Brosnan is probably the only thing known in Richard Attenborough's new biopic. The rest is new to the international audience: Canada's history and the first culture of the first peoples. "The Gray Owl" is a light test of how one came to be admitted to Ojibway in northern Ontario, learning and preaching the decade's environment before it became politically correct. The film contains a love story, a moral message, and a man tortured by his past. However, this torture is not always brought to life with the dramatic impact it can have. However, it is a film that holds its audience without any violence. It provides a deep respect for the Canadian First Nations and presents them with dignity and non-sterility. Brosnan's performance is somewhat stiff, but I think it's the way Lord Attenborough wanted him to do. Thanks to the proud Canadian.
