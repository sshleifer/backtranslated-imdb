Shot in the heart is wonderful. Brilliantly illustrates the situation of Gary Gimore, a convicted murderer who claimed death. Shrouded in the heart shows the suffering that Gilmore's family, torn with hatred, has gone through. This film is an incredible psychological study and is amazingly depressing and uplifting. 10/10
