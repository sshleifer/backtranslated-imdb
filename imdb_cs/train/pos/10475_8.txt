My friend recommended this movie when I quoted my vocal and fantasy similarity with Des Whale, the main character of the film. I think to the extent that I see it and perhaps a little more, I'm not sure if it's a flattering picture. This is quite a unique piece of work, the only film that could have more than a charming similarity would be true romance, not for the content or style of filming or for the pace of dialogue (whale music is much more, well, relaxed.) But instead, that both represent modern love stories. <br /> <br /> Generally, I'm a great fan of Canadian films about music and musicians (for example, I recommend Hard Core Logo) and this movie separately. It has an innocent charm, Des is not always the most fun, but there is something about him that draws a lot of empathy.
