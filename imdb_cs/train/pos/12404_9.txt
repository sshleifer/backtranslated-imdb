I live Rawlins when this movie was shot and I was lucky enough to work on it. Both as extra and with Eddie Surkin on special effects. It was fun to see everything behind the scene, from Barbedwire coming alive to the electric chair through the office guard. There was also a lot of fun to meet all the actors, from Viggo to Tiny. Also, the gate that was shot for the film was and still is called "Disney Gate" by local residents. If anyone is interested and is sometimes in Rawlins, most movie files are still in their place and can be seen during a guided tour. It was a lot of fun and work with R. Harlin and he wished I had it again.
