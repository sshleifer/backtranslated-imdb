"Ship Ahoy" was probably made to demonstrate MGM talent. The movie is a fun trip on an ocean ship on its way to San Juan, Puerto Rico, when the country was involved in World War II. It was a typical fare for the studios that gave the film a walk to the public of light entertainment as a distraction in those difficult times of the earth lived. Beautiful Eleanor Powell is seen at her best in some musical numbers where she clearly shows us she's the dancer they count on. Red Skelton is also seen in a straight line with not too clowning while watching the beautiful Mrs. Powell on a boat that brings them to Puerto Rico. The irresistible Bert Lahr has a good opportunity in the film to show he is a funny man. Virginia Gray is also considered a funny girl who is not disappointed. There are good musical figures presenting Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, which includes, among other things, the amazing Buddy Rich, who has a couple of solos with Mr. Dorsey and Mrs. Powell. Young Frank Sinatra will also appear as lead singer of the band, supported by Pied Pipers. It's a nostalgic trip that should be enjoyed by fans of this genre that MGM completely dominated.
