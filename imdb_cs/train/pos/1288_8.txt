Preston Waters is on a bad summer. Besides his birthday, he does not look promising. First, they have to share their own room with their brothers who are going to do business. They can not do it in their rooms because they do not have enough space. At the birthday party he only gets 6 tokens, while others get $ 32, $ 35 and even $ 50. When one of his birthday cards comes early, he only gets a $ 11 check. On the way to the bank, he learns he needs at least $ 200 to set up an account. When he leaves the bank, the bully steals the check. The sequel after the kid nearly got to pass (surely his bike crashed) to the killer named Quigley (played by Miguel Ferrer). Quigley is coming from the bank to give the owner $ 1,000,000 to give it to him tomorrow. Quigley begins to write checks for damages, but only succeeds in writing his name before the police car circles in the area. She is afraid, gives Preston a check and informs him to give him his father to finish. In the evening, however, Preston tells his father that he does not want a new engine, wants his own room in his back, even better his house. His father limits them to their room for the rest of the evening. Moping in his Preston room will show that things can not get worse. He realizes he forgot to check because he's still in his shirt pocket. It's empty. <br /> <br /> Using your computer, and after careful consideration, it makes $ 1,000,000. The other day, when trying to make money at a bank, is taken to the owner who thinks that he is the person to give $ 1 000 000 and does. But it's not like a real person named Juice comes a little later. Now three must watch Preston down. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Preston enjoys shopping all sorts of things including his own house and even going on a date with a disguised bank lady who is actually an agent of the FBI (who is trying to track 3 bad guys down). He does this person named Mr. Macintosh who works for, and even plans a party for him on his birthday. But eventually things catch up (money runs out, bad ones get it). <br /> <br /> Overall it's a pretty funny movie. Miguel Ferrer plays his part very well. If you enjoyed it in another series, you will love it here. They do all sorts of bad crazy things. <br /> <br /> Rick Ducommun (acclaimed boss from Ghost in the Machine) plays a great chauffeur in this movie.
