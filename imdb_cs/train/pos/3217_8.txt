Kurt Russell is so credible and action so constantly that he will think about it later to realize that there are honest good important topics [overcoming the fear of Stranger, learning to resurrect prior to conditioning, the strength that love and friendship can bring etc. .] in action. It is very rare for the "movement" that even me (who think most A / A is a violent pap) liked the film and recommended it to everybody I know ..... it's a shame that this was overlooked because of the rights should be one of the biggest action and adventurous boxes - it has something for everyone without trying to impose credibility or lose almost continuous action moments. I'm afraid the answer to not being hit is that adults have not seen it. Everyone under the age of 20 may not have seen more violent action in their video games, but he would probably not have enjoyed a multi-layered beauty with more themes or did not care. This film could transform anyone who avoids A / A as unscrupulous violence. If a guy takes his lady [or rents her or sees her in a cable listing] to see this movie, she'll be more likely to make her go with him for more action shots.
