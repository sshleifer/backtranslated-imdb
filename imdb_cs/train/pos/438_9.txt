From the rainy and desperate late winter of England in the early 1920s ... where there is still sadness and many young widows and disabled vets from the great defeat of men and the murderer of female dreams - - now known as the First World War ... <br /> <br /> Four women share this beautiful little sunny Italian castle on the hill; one young widow who drowned her sadness in a furious party, two women who re-discover their own husbands and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous dead friends ... These four women meet with two husbands and a former soldier - almost blind - to gain spiritual "makeover" for one great April holiday in the early 1920s. <br /> <br /> NOTE for future filmmakers. Study this movie about how mood and beauty can tell the story. (Probably not a movie that would please many men ...) <br /> <br /> NOTE: Raise your coffee and hot chocolate and invite the girls for some terrible late winter day ... Spring comes ... Enchanted April you promises!
