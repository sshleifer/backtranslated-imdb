I have always liked this film by John Frankenheimer. The good Elmer Leonard script and the main reason why it was not just another thriller is Frankenheimer. His tense direction and attention to the little details make all the difference, he even hired Ron Jeremy as a counselor! You can make sure it's the last good film Roy Scheider. I have always said that Robert Trebor did a great job. Clarence Williams III got all the publicity with his awesome performance and he's also great, but he really thought Trebor stood up. Frankenheimer does not have to be as proud of this movie as the others, but it's an effective thriller full of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs and real porn actors appearing in the wrong places. What can you say about the movie Ann Margaret shot and raped? The least blame. Vanity has a really dirty role, and very young Kelly Preston will soon appear. A classic explosive thriller that should not be forgotten.
