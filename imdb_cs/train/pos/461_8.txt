Since this movie has a lot of great entertainment features, I think it should have some more credit than the imdb. <br /> <br /> It's your basic 'who did it?' thriller with sex and murder, but keeps you guessing until the end. I like these kinds of movies and I definitely think that this is the standard. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching more than once for me, so I'll give it 8 for imdb.
