Wow ... what ... a vortex. The 1930's are decades and lots of movies of all kinds, as I can imagine, especially during the early stages of talk. There were painfully static and boring movies like "Dracula" with Bella Lugosi, and there were those who just did not give up rest, sometimes good and no way else. This is one of the films that will not stop for a minute, and it is both a miracle and a pity. Lloyd Bacon, who also directed "42. Street," had to be the king of musicals of the depressed era and was probably excited about the opportunities that brought the sound to the world of cinemas because he filled this picture. Not a minute or two without music or with someone who speaks. It's totally crazy! I thought the movie deserves 5 (or 6, peaks) because she was very poor because she was madly quick and sometimes I did not know what was happening and what she thought. The characters seemed to be running here and there, talking about things I do not care about and probably no one else. I thought I would be rewarded with only a little headache. I noticed that Lloyd Bacon also occupied the 42nd street street, Ruby Keeler, and "42nd Street" was the end of the movie. And you know what? It's the same with the "Footlight Parade"! The end is totally unbelievable! It happened with my hands down, the most impressive musical I've ever seen. The final part presents us with a number of musical figures and they are, believe me, something that makes you see the next movie. The numbers are flawless! There are three big bits, and the most notable is certainly the other. Suddenly the screen was filled with a beautiful and inventive camera, beautiful people and simple entertainment that forgot my little headache.
