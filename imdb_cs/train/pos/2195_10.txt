I loved it! Fred MacMurray is amazing as Skid Johnson, a rather horrified, proud and yet very vulnerable saxophonist who is in love with Maggie (Carole Lombard), who is always there for him. They meet in Panama after Maggie leaves the ship and ends up in the bar with Anthony Quinn. Tony gets into her nose after insulting Maggie by thinking she's a loose woman - and that's because she took her hat in public. Big Battle and Maggie end up in Panama. Romance. Carole and Arthur are great together. Maggie is always there for him whenever he needs it. He urges him to go to NY, where (look good at the movie and find out). They have these wonderful scenes together, singing in their arms while playing a saxophone. I certainly recommend it.
