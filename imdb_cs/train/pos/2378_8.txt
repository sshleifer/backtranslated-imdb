This film is much better than the asylum version, especially its war in the world. Tripods look pretty cool, but their walking and death may be better. The action scenes were really great. Walking ... walking ... walking ... walking! Oh, my god will stop walking or I will kill. The scary children's scene was my favorite sequence, mainly because the ship pressed a bunch of tripods. Good movie I recommend this for people who read the book. The music is amazing and the directors cut out look pretty good. <br /> <br /> Good soundtrack 99% into the book Cool violence Tripods and handling machines are cool to look at <br /> <br /> against. some bad playable cheese
