This is the best film ever made to tackle the AIDS problem. It's a documentary about two men living and dying for this disease. The film is beautiful, heartfelt, entertaining and incredibly moving. First of all, it's a wonderful love story. Make sure you have a few hankies ready before you watch this movie - you will need them. Extraordinary.
