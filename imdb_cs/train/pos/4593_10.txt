Police Story is one of Jackie Chan's classic films to help shape the Hong Kong cinema. It's a masterpiece that should not miss a fan of action movies. From the beginning, it is clear that Jackie Chan's stunt team literally risked their lives to make this film. Both actions and spells are extremely realistic and innovative. Even today, no film has crossed the police story in dangerous stuntmen. Many people were hospitalized in Police Story, including Jackie Chan. The fight is not as indisputably exceptional as stunt games, but the fighting in this movie helped change and define the use of Jackie Chan props. Throughout the movie, Chan uses an odd object to stop the attackers and constantly throws invaders through thick glass. The action really feels because stuntmen give the film everything they have to give, and Jackie Chan's coordination is excellent. The rest of the film's aspects are not defective, but will not disappoint any fan action. Chan not only plays the probable danger of taking a cop but showing the strong changes his character is going through when he gets into desperate despair. The story is powerful, but the current viewer can sometimes be boring. While the comedy gives a lot of laughter, it does not always turn away the audience's attention from the inadequate action. However, for the time period in which it was made, the riding aspects of the plot are fun. There are plenty of interesting and well-playable characters scattered all over the film. <br /> <br /> The overall police story is undoubtedly one of the best action movies ever made. And even in Hollywood, the effects of this film are not to be ignored.
