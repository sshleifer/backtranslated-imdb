The material in this document is so powerful that it has brought me to tears. Yes, I'm gonna tear you. This popular struggle for the traditionally exploited population should all inspire us to stand up for our rights, make a greater social advantage, and stop cowardly excuses so as not to deny this establishment. Chavez is faint and unhappy just as Bush is the face of dirty corporations and capitalism ran amok. Latin America is actually transforming, and the marginalized majority ultimately has a voice in more than five centuries. Although in the case of Mexico, elections were clearly stolen by Calderon. Chavez is not perfect, far from him. He is trying to change the constitution so he can rule indefinitely. It can not be tolerated. With politics and back to film; The pace is breathtaking and profoundly philosophical with others. He portrays Chavez as a popular hero who is not afraid to attack American hegemony and world domination. If you think the author is interested in Chavez, nothing will stop you from doing your homework. One important message of this film is the questioning of information sources, as was clearly shown by the loss of shooters being shamefully accused by Chavez's supporters. Venezuela will make American alleged democracy a shame. Hasta la revolucion siempre!
