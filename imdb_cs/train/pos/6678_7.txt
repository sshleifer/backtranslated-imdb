I really did not expect this movie, but it was not bad; in fact it was quite good. This movie contained some of the most fun songs I've ever seen on the film. Now I'm not saying it's one of the funniest movies of all time, but in some parts I laughed quite a bit. "The police ruled my father's death as a suicide, they said he had fallen into the elevator shaft, and now this film is not for everyone, mostly stupid humor like Zoolander or Dodgeball, so if you hate these movies, I would recommend you to avoid it. was a nice movie about a group of superhero wannabes who eventually became real heroes - a greatly overrated comedy that many people have not seen yet, as I, before I looked at them, expected it to be a complete waste. watching this movie I finally got to know why this movie was able to build such a superstar cast that includes Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria and even the Good Burger guy, because Mystery Man is full of great comedy 7 of 10. Big surprise.
