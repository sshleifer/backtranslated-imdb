Well, first we want to make it clear that Kaakha Kaakha is part of the Tamil prayer and is roughly translated to "protect". Khakhee, on the other hand, refers to the color of the police uniform (which is Khakhi!). The Tamil film industry is rather full of purely commercial businesses, any Rajnikanth or Vijay would become a testament to this claim. <br /> <br /> Now Kaakha Kaakha is an excellent movie with a great soundtrack. Definitely very stunning in the final scene, especially loving the end (which is definitely unexpected!). Gore is sometimes too much, but it's definitely a great movie!
