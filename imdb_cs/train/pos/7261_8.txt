I definitely disagree with "ctomvelu" about the talent Jim Belushi. I really like Belushi. It is true that I was skeptical when he first appeared on the scene because I was such a huge fan of his late brother John. But Jim has an on-screen spell that has taken him very far - and he has been doing it well over the years. Curly Sue is one of his previous films - his weight is loyal (not true for most of us?) - and I like the movie. Yes, it is touching and hearty, so if you find yourself in pursuit of vehicles, blasts and unreasonable sex, then you would like to pass this - it's a warm film of three lost sneakers who are each other. Do not get me wrong, I'm all three key to a successful film, but I also like a nice, solid story like this one. And while Belushi and Kelly Lynch bring great performances, the real star of this movie is Alisan Porter - who is absolutely adorable. I do not know what happened to her career, but who is responsible for dropping the ball (the parents themselves?) Should be shot. You could not ask for a more perfect introduction to fame than this film, and nothing has been heard since then. <br /> <br /> Another sad Hollywood story ...
