I only watched the first DVD series, but summed up Soprano as a Shakespeare plot with a script similar to Tarantino. The series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino and is almost as good as The Godfather (hence not "10") and is much better than any Guy Ritchie's effort. Although there is a lot of action, some of them are quite bloody, the story is characteristic. Even some of the tiny characters contribute to great stories; for example, the relationship of a priest (or lack) with Carmilla and the wife of the restorer, and Christopher and his dear friend (who did not last long (Darwin Award nominee)) In addition, script and acting, other reasons why I liked it; <br /> <br /> 1. This made me visit New Jersey and eat pasta with tomato sauce. 2. Music. 3. It shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems.
