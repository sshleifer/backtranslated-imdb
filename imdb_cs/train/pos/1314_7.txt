When a small town is threatened by a child murderer, the cop goes after him by pretending to be his girlfriend. When the killer grows more and more emotionally involved in a murder, her psyche begins to beat and causes her to lose focus on the work of capturing a criminal. It's not a movie of exciting tension, but solid police work and a good display of the ill mind of a psychotic loser.
