As someone old enough knows, South Africa has long suffered under the shameful, racist oppression of apartheid, which has completely conquered the black population. One of the most famous anti-apartheid activists was Steve Biko, who was murdered in prison. After the murder, reporter Donald Woods was trying to get Biko into the world. In "Cry Freedom," Woods (Kevin Kline) and Bike (Denzel Washington) meet before charges are arrested. When Woods attempts to spread the word Bika, he and his family begin to live under threat of attack and eventually are forced to flee the country. The last scene makes police shooting against demonstrators badly. As one of two films (along with "A World Apart"), which helped galvanize the anti-apartheid movement, "Cry Freedom" acts as the best work for all involved.
