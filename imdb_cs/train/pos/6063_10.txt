Wizards of the Lost Kingdom is a film about a young prince (Simon) who is expelled from his kingdom because his father (the king) was killed by a clich√© as a "bad adviser." This movie is about Simon's adventures. Special effects, conspiracy, acting and everything about this movie is BAD. It's so bad that it's funny. You will be watching this movie simply because it's so bad that it's funny, and just like another movie reviewer said, it's so bad that it's good.
