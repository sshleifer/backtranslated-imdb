Princess Tam There is no fear of racism, in the way we think of racism in the United States, but there is a much smoother (to American spectator) allegation of ethnic identity at the time. Watch out for the location of Alwin's (Baker) clippings, as they are solved by other characters, the surroundings around them, who all portray her as a "wild" African, and ask themselves if Alwin has any agency in the movie. I do not want to destroy anything, but at the end pay much attention, the dichotomy between the "eastern" and "western" culture is the least offensive, such a dictation nowadays nowadays is renounced. The French have the gypsy past as an imperial power (see Chris Marker Meuren Aussi 1953) and pay attention to the places that European travelers are visiting while in Africa, and reflect their attitudes towards " other ". I give this movie 7 because I'm crazy about Baker, much of what she did in her professional career, such as Prince Tam Tam, which is regressive, is surely overshadowed by her efforts to integrate and her work as a spy but the film is for me breathtaking due to her performance, besides, it's a telling memory of past mentalities.
