Emilio Miraglio's "The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" (1972) is just about the most perfect giallo example I've ever seen, mixing all the required elements into one ominous goulash really. First of all, and for me, it is of crucial importance, it has a complicated, twisted conspiracy that ultimately makes perfect sense, and the killer is not at the end of the left field at the end. The story of a series of spooky murders (you already know how much of the film, that?) Which takes place in the apparent fulfillment of the ancient prophecy concerning the two sisters is involved and the killer, the red cloak figure with the crazy laugh of the mad, is both terrible and memorable. Every great giallo requires some beautiful actresses, and here we have a total assortment, led by immensely beautiful Barbare Bouchet as one of two sisters and in one of her earlier roles Sybil Danning as a crazy tramp in a barbaric fashion house. Another indispensable addition to the excellent gialla is the catchy, humble score and Bruno Nicolai provides one for this film that should stay with you all day long. Wonderful scenery? Check again. The film, which was shot mostly in Wurzburg, Germany, is a real eye-catching picture. OK, OK, but what about the murders? After all, is not that what the gialli is about? Well, I'm pleased to announce that most of the audience should be very happy with the various knifing, shooting, kicks and other massacres that make this film tastefully ... let's not talk about the crypts, the rage of dreams, rats and bats (and many of and the Uga Pagliaiho person, who is wild for the audience, as I said, the perfect giallo.And it is even better that this DVD is from great people on No Shame and you know what that means: gorgeous print and lots of add-ons that can be printed!
