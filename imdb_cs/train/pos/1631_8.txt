This movie has everything. Handsome gags, fine jokes, word and verse play. This is a group of rag boys from different ethnic and social classes that gather to defeat a common enemy. If you look at it more than once, you will find it quoted as Animal House (and yes, I also love Animal House). I'll put 15 funniest movies. Major at the boys' military academy is paranoid, every child is bad and wants to cause trouble (he's right in this movie). It is sadistic, hostile, cruel and must be married. A group of boys who do not first come together end up together to survive and get rid of the major with a huge plan that Mad Magazine could write. You have to see - you will love her!
