I have to agree with most other places. Was it a comedy? drama? he leaned a little toward comedy. I could have been a great comedy-free movie and it was terribly imaginative. Jamie goes on to Julia and what is his name. In New York, how many times do you find someone you know in Cleveland's center. And how could Robert Pastorelli dig out Yankee stadium to hide gold. Again, comedy or drama? But it was still fun, especially on Sunday morning. I really enjoyed the performance of Kimberly Elisse, a pretty beautiful actress, and they seem to take her seriously. She is a younger actress who will be viable.
