It's not the bad word that could happen to this movie. At first it did not work for me, but it grew fast for me. I like it very much and I think it's a shame that many people can not see it being banned in some areas because it's one of them. The film takes place in the separation of shocks, ghosts and the atmosphere. Score is a beautiful piece of exciting device. It looks like Chris Young is one of the best composers in the industry. It plays in this film somewhat high standard, if it is a little wooden in some places, and the effects are very real and grainy. All this is a great praise for a good movie slasher in my book. In some reviews, I have noted that the film got a serious mistake when the famous killer of P.O.V. And I'll ask: What's wrong with that? It's a classic shot that raises fear in any good fan of the genre and it's great to keep the secret of the killer secret. The only thing that prevents this movie from getting into my book is that the surprising twist is not treated with greater care, I think it will happen just as fast, although great performances make it just trustworthy. In addition, PRANKS is a great movie (though I prefer the original title) and its pity that so many people are knocking it off as a cheap bite. His more than that, but he knows little that he seems to have lost himself in the fog of the early 1980s. What a shame ... It's a really good movie! Believe me!
