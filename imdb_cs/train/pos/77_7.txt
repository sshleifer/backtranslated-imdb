The film begins with Vincent Price about starting his career as a magician. However, halfway through a very successful show, the police came and closed it. His old boss seems to have tricked him out of the tricks he had made - even those he did in his own time at home. As a result, Price honestly kills the evil man. The problem is that the viewer understood why Price was killed and probably thought it was a GOOD thing, because the prize was a bit crazy, she just could not stop at one (something like her Latin potato chips). <br /> The film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks (including a huge circular saw and show crematorium), a great conspiracy plot and exciting action. One thing you can not say about this movie is that it's boring. While it's also far from subtle, it's fun all the time, though it's well worth a look. If I had never seen Vincent Price be a HOUSE OF WAX, I would probably like MAD MAGICIAN much more and reach 8 or 9. That's because, while MAD MAGICIAN is a wonderful movie, he reminds him of the HOUSE OF WAX. As a result, since HOUSE OF WAX was so successful, the formula was again included in the sequel. Both were made in 3-D, both of which have a conspiracy in which Price has every justification for killing but can not stop once the first is committed and both are very fun to watch. The biggest difference, and little, is that HOUSE OF WAX was colorful and was rather a horror film, and MAD MAGICIAN was definitely more of a mystery. My advice is to see this movie A HOUSE OF WAX (Price version only). Both are huge horror films of the 1950s.
