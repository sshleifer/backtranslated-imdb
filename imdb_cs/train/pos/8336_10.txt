This film tells the story of romance between the Albert Einstien niece and the service station. To get Einstien together, he agrees to help Ed (Tim Robbins of Hudsucker Proxy) learn to act smarter. This affects Catherine (Meg Ryan). Unfortunately, Einstien goes too far and Ed is considered a genius. Hilarity follows. We must not miss it. She was filming in the Mercer district of New Jersey at Princeton University, Lawrenceville Prep School (doubled at Princeton University), as well as in the beautiful Hopewell petrol station.
