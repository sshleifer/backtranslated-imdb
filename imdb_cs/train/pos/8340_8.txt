This is a really fun, cute romantic comedy. You can not break Meg Ryan's cute perkiness in combination with Albert Einstein's genius. Under normal circumstances, I'm not a fan of completely invented fictional stories about real people, now dead and unable to defend themselves, but I think later Einstein might laugh at this. <br /> <br /> It's the 1950s ... Princeton, New Jersey in the spring. The story revolves around a beautiful young mathematician, Catherine (Meg Ryan), who has the task of taking a shot, a researcher named James, just because he has the brains he is looking for in the father of his future children. It's love at first glance when she breaks her car and she meets a car mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins). Because she thinks Ed is not smart enough, her uncle, none other than Albert Einstein, plays a wrestler, assisted in his efforts with three vicious friends, all theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert must make Ed look smart, so he creates a charade to portray him as a physicist ... naturally with amusing results. Walter Matthau is his usual cheerful self, and pulls Einstein's character quite efficiently. With his three professional comrades, Kurt, Nathan and Boris, he laughs a lot. The real Einstein had a real human side, and this film considered it as one (outrageous) step further. If you break all logic, you can almost imagine how this stupid story is going on! <br /> <br /> It does not have to be rocket science (despite its main character), but it's a wonderful sweet, refreshing film. One of the best romance genres of comedy.
