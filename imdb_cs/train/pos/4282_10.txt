Outstanding figures in many funny situations, full of spirit, absurdity and Serbian mentality. The film is a great comedy, pleasant, interesting, unpredictable. Best place in the movie: characters, then humor himself, story and dialogue. Humor has "internal development," in Serbian movies is rare. It is therefore the result of characterization, it is well motivated, spontaneous and attractive. It is also sharp, intelligent and clear. Most of the movies, unfortunately, built humor (invent a joke and put it in your mouth) or a regular sitcom, burlesque, fairy. Some of the "artistic immortality" are part of this film. Small masterpiece, barely achievable.
