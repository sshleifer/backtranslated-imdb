Many people have said that this film was not as close as the first. Well, maybe it's not - for you. How does your child react to it? Well, my boy loved it more than the first one. Disney movies from the past can sometimes be a bit harsh for young children. (For example - Bambi mother got a shot.) This movie was really great for my sensitive little girl who likes humor and a happy ending. If you want to be a snobby about what Disney-based standards should be - skip this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have a sweet little girl or a soft baby boy, you really want to please, buy this movie and treat small children. This movie is great as a movie for sleeping for happy dreams instead of nightmares. I'm happy with a movie that loves my baby and does not have to impress my parents all the time.
