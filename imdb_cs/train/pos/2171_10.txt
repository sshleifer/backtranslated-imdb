The real classic, ten out of ten! Each actor is perfect, the scenario is a scary sequence of exciting scenes. Scenes in the car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking. He would be surprised if this movie was already on DVD, because it must be seen in a widescreen version. He had seen this film in the late 1950s, perhaps three or four times, and had never forgotten since then. I remember that it was one of Warner's first films to be a cinema, a Warnerscope process that made very elegant cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserved the Oscar for their performance. The only thing I could criticize was not being controlled by someone like, say, Nicholas Ray, to increase his rhythm and tension.
