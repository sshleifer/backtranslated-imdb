What happens when someone has so many social anxieties that they will stop working? How can one get it? When we have to get to the death we have to do to get into society, it's too much what's going to happen? Frownland examines these questions. Definitely surprising original debut from Bronstein. The tone is strange and claustrophobic when we get into the mind of a guy named Keith who is so confused that he can barely make the right sentence. We keep track of him trying to contact people and working every day. Most of us know people like this - people who say too "apologize" or "appreciate it" when there is nothing to appreciate. So we know there are people like that, but why would anyone want to make a movie about them? Well, because her interesting actor Bronstein and the actor, Dore Mann, do a great job. This movie is about as non-commercial as the movie can get. A couple of friends shot it in a few years when they saved money. It was shot at 16 mm and the scratched film is a beautifully low budget. Without a distributor it can be hard to find, I think it was random projection for the past year or so. Hopefully it will be on DVD sometimes. I saw it at the Silent Movie Theater here in LA. There are ten people in the audience, including Crispin Glover, if he tells you something about how strange this movie is. Highly recommended.
