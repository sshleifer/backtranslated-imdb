Why did not he pick up an Oscar bag? It's an amazing interpretation of the often filmed / performed piece. The visuals are breathtaking (especially on a wide screen ... pan & scan actually kills beautiful cinematography and sets of this movie). Every picture is a picture. Stunning. The game is almost completely intact and Branagh's passion is clear from the early titles. No Zefferelli here, just a great story about how a movie can, but rarely it does. Jacobi is particularly sophisticated as Hamlet's murderous uncle: he does not play him as a wicked villian but a charming politician who allows us to understand why only Hamlet suspects a foul play. In addition, Branag captures the fineness of the line between the false / real madness of Hamlet and the burning vengeance in it. And many cameras will drop out fairly well, all from Billy Crystal and Robin Williams to Gerard Depardae and Charlton Heston, inconspicuous if you get to the Branagh vision as I was. Charming piece.
