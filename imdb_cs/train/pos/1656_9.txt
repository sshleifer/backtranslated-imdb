"Thieves and liars" presents us with a very naturalistic view of the levels of corruption affecting many Puerto Ricans and forcing them to make difficult, if not impossible, choices about the lives of their and their loved ones. Cast is excellent, since some are unprofessional actors; an excellent choice that increases the level of reality in the movie. Photographing drives the story without disturbing, as it should be in this type of movie. This script captures the very deep idiosyncrasies and attitudes of "Boricuas". Sometimes you seem to have watched the document! Watching this movie makes you feel like you've secretly entered a real Puerto Rican society and invisibly watched it explode. I loved it!
