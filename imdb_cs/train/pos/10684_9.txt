Watching this early DeMille's work, I again succeeded in reinforcing that DeMille soon is far better than the late DeMille. His attention to the use of light inside the scenes is remarkable. Its corridor is very good, which allows much to be said in about an hour. It's a shame that he was not as intuitive in the style of later sound films as he seemed to be in his silent films. It was the first movie I saw Cleo Ridgely. She was remarkable, rather restrained, yet she transmitted a wide range of emotions. The end is wonderful.
