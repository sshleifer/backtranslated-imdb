I can not believe the film that can be done so well in 1987 and it is virtually unknown to the west. Do not repeat any more reviews here. The score is very good and moves. Literally means "Dawn will never come" - when it comes, the beautiful spirit and lover will be separated forever. After 24 years, Joel and Leslie still look great. I enjoyed Joel in God of the players and many Leslie films including Better Tomorrow.
