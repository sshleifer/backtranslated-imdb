Diagnosis Murder is one of the only programs I watch regularly on TV. The way all the main characters have something to do in each episode is so unlike today's performances where they focus on 1 or 2 people per episode and everyone else is pushed to the side. The way a brain tag works is so obscure that you never really know what it means, and if you think you're doing, you're wrong. The diagnosis of murder has addressed a diverse issue, not only in cases, but in any personal life. Everything from racism and adoption to terrorists and technology. As for old people? I'm 24! I do not think they could be classified as old. I just want to know when to release all 8 seasons on DVD (not NTSC) so I can watch them in order. It seems that they do so with a lot of other programs from that time so they can hurry a little!
