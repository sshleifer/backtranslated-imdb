If you want fun with a lot of fine humor, then you like it. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why someone would not like it. Take it for what it is: a vehicle for Dennis Hopper to make his head grow and laugh. It's not Shakespeare, but it's good. Ericka Eleniak is absolutely beautiful and keeps her in this - better than any episode of Baywatch - and shows talent for gentle humor. It is a shame she did not have many opportunities to spread it. Tom Berenger fits perfectly into the role of a "real navy," and William McNamara does a hard job as a cheater. <br /> <br /> <br /> Walk through Hopper in the middle of persecution for "Cherry on this Sundae" and you have a movie that has kept my attention and let me laugh. I bought this as soon as it was available. <br /> <br /> Brain-candy.
