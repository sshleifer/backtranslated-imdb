This game is still the most important thing. I had the honor to play on PS2, so the graphics were really good. The vote was above-standard. The difficulty is correct. Wesker must, in my opinion, be the best servers in the RE series. The story astonished me and made many different twists and turns I did not expect. The only evaluation that this game deserves is great.
