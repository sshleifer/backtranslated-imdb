This Casper's friendly ghost is short of my childhood, and I watch it again on YouTube (Thank you DEAT! Pro You Tube); after that I like this short film and it's one of my favorite Casper shorts. I love how short it starts scary with Frank Gallop's haunted story; until we see Casper sitting at his tombstone in the cemetery, we read. While every spirit has emerged from the graves to people "boo", Casper decides to leave in search of a friend. But trying to make a friend escapes everyone who sees Casper. Poor Casper sat on his diary and wept; until there is a lollipop. Casper and the little fox are quickly joining and quickly naming Ferdi's young man and considering him as his best friend. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Casper and Ferdy is overwhelmingly threatened, but Casper does not hold Ferdie's attention while playing Hide and Seek. While Ferdie hides the hunter and two of his hunting dogs come and try to kill the little Ferdio and Ferdie runs as fast as possible until he is breathing and wandering. While the hunter shoots the shots against Ferdy Casper, he tries to kill him and flies to the hunter and asks the hunter to leave Ferdie himself. And the hunter and the dogs are terrified of Casper. Casper at Ferdi shouts that the hunter and the dogs are gone and everything is all right. But Casper sees that Ferdi's body does not move and asks if she's alright. When Casper sees that Ferdie has died, he begins to mourn the pain because he has lost "the only friend he ever had in his life." Casper returns to the cemetery where Ferdie has been buried and made a tombstone next to Casper's tombstone. Casper continues the pain of sorrow until he sees that Ferdie himself has resurrected as a ghost. Ferdie starts licking Casper on his face. Casper screams out of joy because he has joined Ferdi. <br /> <br /> Overall it's really good short; although surprisingly disturbing, showing death in family cartoon drawing.
