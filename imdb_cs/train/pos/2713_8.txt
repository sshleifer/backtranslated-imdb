Wilson (Erica Gavin) is killed by police officers and sent to prison in this neat and fun example of the 70th anniversary of Jonathan Demme's debut. After writing and producing several Roger Cormans films about the new world, Demme got the opportunity to direct the film for the first time and made a film that not only brings the expected and delicious doses of nudity and violence, but also attracts the language of quality; it is often as funny as it is spectacular. <br /> <br /> The eccentric scenes include a crazy and crude bold style act performed for prisoners as well as a powerful dream / fantasy sequence for the silent and apparently highly suppressed superintendent McQueen Horror icon Barbary Steele who makes a terrific turn in this opposite role) . I also liked the scene of a bank robbery that became a bitter, and a scriptwriter who was simply passionate. As with other films of this kind, it is also commendable that it is also a portrait of female reinforcement, as it is pure exploitation. These women are tough, they do not take any garbage and are more than able to handle themselves. <br /> <br /> Our attractive cast takes most of her roles here: Juanita Brown as aggressive Maggie, Robert Collins as smart Belle, Rainbeaux Smith as cute and shy Lavelle, Gavin as a wide-eyed newbie and Lynda Gold (aka Crystin Sinclaire ) in clear appearance as outsiders. <br /> <br /> Once our peak has peaked, Demme comes up with a tense "beat beat" when our heroes fight to save Bella from the lobotomized raptor dr. Randolph (Warren Miller), a man who thinks nothing uses women. <br /> <br /> John Calese's comfortable score, Caged Heat, is an optimistic fun and a good time. <br /> <br /> 8/10
