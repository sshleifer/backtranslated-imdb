For the first time, I saw this film in the midday 1980s. After many follow-up views (and buying videos), I'm still laughing. Yes, it's a relic of another age - home comedy in rich Central America - but well done is well done. But it is also a documentary of age - a celebration of post-war optimism, a child boom and a growing consumer age. This film is no "wine" pleasure. <br /> <br /> Three gorgeous sophisticated leading actors - Urban Melvyn Douglas; Cary Grant pale; My favorite scenes - "That means we have to burst" and "Miss Stellwaggen" and "This little piggy". <br /> <br /> <br /> Love it.
