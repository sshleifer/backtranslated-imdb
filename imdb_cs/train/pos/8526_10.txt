I loved this movie! Chris Showerman did a great job! Not only is he an incredible actor, but he is beautiful with a stunning figure! He did a great job of delivering his lines, and he turned George better than Fraser did. Great performance for his first major role! This movie is full of fun scenes that every child likes. My kids watched this movie numerous times because we bought the DVD the day it came out. In addition to the movie, DVD bonuses are just as fun. Two inches up on this! I recommend it to all!
