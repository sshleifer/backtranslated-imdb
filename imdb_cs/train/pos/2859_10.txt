I know it sounds strange, it comes from someone who was born almost 15 years after the show ceased to air, but I like this show. I do not know why, but I like to look at it. I love Adam the best. The only disappointment is that the only place I bought DVDs for the season was in Germany, and that was just the first two seasons. That's disappointing, but it's okay. I will still be searching online. If anyone has some tips where to buy the second to the 14th year, please email me at darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. He already owns first. The only one is that the DVDs are from Germany, they only play on a portable DVD player and on their computer. Oh, okay. I still own it!
