I've never been huge on IMAX movies. They're fine, but once you get over that initial rush, "Whoa, it feels like flying!" movies themselves are usually pretty and common. <br /> <br /> The exception was the powerful "Everest", exciting "Wild California" and now the BBC "Human Body," a super-great view of the inside of our body. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are machines of complexity that are simply unimaginable. This 50-minute movie could be 10 hours long, and it would still not get to all tandem systems just when I'm reviewing and listening to my radio and most of us take it for granted. <br /> <br /> Here you can see the inside of the pumping heart (looks like an alien spacecraft), the inside of the lungs, the tiny hairs in your drummer that process the sound, the baby's development inside the mother's womb and surprisingly some of the ... less attractive features, (pimples, stomach acid stomach ...) This movie also has a pretty funky style that distinguishes it from other IMAX documents. For example, we all saw the sperm that found the way to the egg, but did you ever see that it was okay with Marvin Gay "Let's Get It On"? These are the creative moments that make the "human body" not only a health lesson but also a fun.
