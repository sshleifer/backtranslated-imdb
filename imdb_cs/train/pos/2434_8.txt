I have often wondered how much CASPER was intended for children ... with all the questions that turn around his identity (in this film we are led to believe that he is the spirit of a dead child because his home is a graveyard fence) as well as disturbing the report that this particular film brought. Perhaps Casper was more like a game of morality, or familiar studios felt like breaking new ground into the 'reality' cartoons. GOOD BOOS TONIGHT is a well animated project - undoubtedly there. But the development of a plot that concerns a fox (who will become a friend of Casper but meets a tragic end) is a matter. Give Famous Studios credit - resolves death with respect ... but the stark image of Casper's sadness is quite graphic and disturbing to the kids (although the layout offers a happy end, but I will not end) and the violence is rather steep, even for the 1940 standards. <br /> <br /> This could be a good cartoon for parents to help explain the death to children - but I would not want a perfect cartoon to appear in the video recorder.
