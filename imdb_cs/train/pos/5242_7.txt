I loved this movie for two reasons. The first is that it gives insight into the world of loyalism in northern Ireland, which is rarely treated in movies, most of which tell us about Republican struggle. The second reason is actors' performances. I thought they gave a very sincere and convincing picture of a very subdued underworld that many people outside my native shores do not even hear. Overall, it's a funny gangster movie with starring performances from who's who in northern Irish actors. It does not dispose of the country, although it can easily open some human eyes to the dark world of loyal paramilitaries.
