I did not find anyone who could watch DiG! with me, because nobody I knew was a fan of one of the bands. Naturally everybody assumed that you can enjoy this movie only if you like The Dandy Warhols or the Brian Jonestown Massacre, but that's so far from the truth. The only requirement is that you are interested in music and pop culture in general. The way the career of the two groups is parallel is a perfect illustration of the ways a group can take, and the observation of how the public burned and spit out Dandy Warhols is fascinating. I agree with other reviews that say it would be nice to get the last word from Anthony himself because he is clearly portrayed as his worst enemy and strength for the band to stay. <br /> <br /> Most interesting for me is Dandys' respect for BJM (despite their lack or mutual exchange) and Anton (despite his irregular behavior). Dandy Warhols respects the art that the group produces, even if the band hates everything Dandy Warhols is now (although it is questionable). The best line is when the drummer for Dandy says, "I never have to have them anymore," and the guitarist unconsciously radiates "I still buy my records." For me, it only points out how much good music can be. <br /> <br /> You surely see this movie, even if you do not know anything about any group. It's about rock music and how they evolve, making this movie so interesting. It is very rare to watch the group for so long.
