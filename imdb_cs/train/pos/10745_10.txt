Let me get out of the way, James Hanlon is totally terrible, trying to make his descriptions of what's going on with the training of novices and the events of today. It really is in a sharp treaty with the other firefighters, without talking about aspirations that are natural in their delivery. He told me it was an amazing film that can not be watched without tears. I am an English man from London, but I like New York and I have visited many times before and after September 11th. It is the second home for me and I can not feel destroyed by the loss of life, but also by destroying part of such an amazing beautiful city. This is a real deal with the firefighters with all those who have collapsed around them. I'm so glad that filming exists so people show how it was in the day. It's a shame they did not use any shots of people jumping out of the buildings because the friends who were there tell me that it's such an important part of their memory, it should be included to show future generations how terrible it really was. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way.
