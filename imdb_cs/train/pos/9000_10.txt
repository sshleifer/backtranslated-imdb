I first saw BLOOD OF THE SAMURAI at the premiere of the International Film Festival in Hawaii. WOW! Blood just blew us out of our pure will, blood, vitality, bleeding, excitement, bleeding, utter screaming and even bigger ghosts, all in THIS GREAT FUN! Especially for those of you who enjoy all Japanese samurai and ninja champs, you have to define blood!
