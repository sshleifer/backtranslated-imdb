It was hard to believe all the negative comments about this star movie. I laughed with the whole picture, like the whole family. The film was clearly defined as an old gangster comedy - the players were hysterical - I bet they had a good old time when they did. Of course, Goldblum and Dreyfuss were great - and what about the sister Everly, each of the two Falco and the divine music in the whole. Rob Reiner made a great smoke limousine and Gabriel Byrne was a ridiculous neurotic. Not to mention Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, the character of Sleepy Joe, and the morgue and grave. Paul Anka was his usual entertaining name, with the fact that Byrne decided to make a duet of his "My Way" welcome home show for Vicky. I am of the opinion that this film was a comical hit by Frank Sinatra and friends; Dreyfuss imitated him well. I also think that no one at any age would even think of mimicking the acts that occurred in this movie - it's a joke - not the terrifying movie "gangsta". Cars and clothing were impressive, just like the decorative "Vicovo Place". I really think that "Mad Dog Time" is a musical comedy, less harmful than many cartoons, TV criminals, and speeches. I recommend a video for family entertainment in the evening.
