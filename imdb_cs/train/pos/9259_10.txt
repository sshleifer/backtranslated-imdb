It was simple and so nice. I think the overall sense of sexual segregation in a society that may be bitter has been proven very delicately. It had a bitter kind of hummer. The fact that most actors were not professionals made the film more tangible and realistic. The film was also a "documentary" party. The best scenes were those that all the girls who were forbidden to watch were passionately listening to a soldier who should watch and broadcast the game. If you are an Iranian, well-known cheering and dancing in the streets after the end of the game will fill your national pride! If you are not Iranian, you will still love it!
