Brilliant adaptation of mostly interior monologues Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus and Molly Bloom Joseph Stork at restoration of the cute portrait of Dublin June 16, 1904 - Bloomsday - the day to be celebrated - the double entender intended! Bravo director Strick, screenwriter Haines, as well as director and cameraman in making this masterpiece. Gunter Grass', The Tin drum shot by Volker Schl√∂ndorff (1979) is another fine film adaptation of the interior monologue, which compares favorably with Strick's film. While in the original novel and in the film are also recognizable characters, though with different names in the novel. For example, Buck Mulligan, with whom Dedalus lives, is a prominent Dublin surgeon. <br /> <br /> This film for all its perfection is even richer with more tours. <br /> <br /> Brian invinoveritas1@AOL.com on June 15, 2008
