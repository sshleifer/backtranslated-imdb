Anyone who loves Rheostatic music will enjoy this movie. I have a few minor complaints, especially about the steps and the discovery of certain actors (not Maury) who are not really convincing in their roles, but I do not have time to write a detailed overview. I just want to warn everyone who has seen this movie or is planning to watch this movie, as it was introduced on CBC TV in Canada: A version that's airy like CBC is like Reader's Digest WHALE MUSIC --- it does not watch. Deletes entire scenes and subplots (if possible) from the movie. CBC, which presents most of the films intact, chose half the courage of WHALE MUSIC. I do not know why. It's terrible to do the movie. Rent a video or watch it at the theater, but NEVER look at it on a CBC TV.
