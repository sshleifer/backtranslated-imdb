This documentary was nominated for an Oscar, and it's easy to understand why. Even after 45 years, it's an impressive job. Why it's not in print is a mystery Disney can explain. Good use of live shots and tandem animations. This was run as part of the "Vault Disney" every few months or so, but I did not see that it was mentioned for quite some time. * Sighs * Most recommended.
