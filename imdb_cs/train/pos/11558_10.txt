"The Odd Couple" is one of those films that far exceeds his reputation. People all know it, they enjoy the thematic song, they complain about living with hostile "Oscar" or modest "Felix" ... but they do not sell the film without knowing it. It's not just a pure guy who lives with a guy; it's a portrait of two friends who help each other through the agony of divorce. It's also damn funny from start to finish, but it's kind of a comedy based on realistic, stressful, and just terrible situations. So some viewers actually found the movie a bit uncomfortable, but I think its verisimilitude is its strength. Besides, Matthau's bulldog face just shakes me! My favorite comedy, miles.
