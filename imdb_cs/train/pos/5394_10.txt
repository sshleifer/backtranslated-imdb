I was totally enchanted by this series from the moment Tom Long entered the shot-the whole "bad boy" thing, it was just addictive. The story is addicted to what's going on - Joey will get the girl to end after five years of jail and all the time thinking about her lost love, overcoming her again, finding out that she has a son ... Although he is a violent evil man, you want to find happiness. <br /> <br /> Really captivating two parters - please bring it to the video!
