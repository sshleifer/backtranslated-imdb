The family is about two families that are after the blood of another. <br /> <br /> Viren Sahay (Amitabh Bachchan) is the daughter of the underworld that operates from Bangkok. He has a family in India. She accidentally kills Shekhar (Akshay Kumar). Like Viren Sahay, he also has a family (brother, wife, and parent). Aryan (Aryan), Shekhar's brother must avenge the death of his brother. He kidnapped the family of Viren Sahay for the same reason. The film has one turn (Amitabh Bachchan). The second half of the film belongs to him completely, where the expression is significantly influenced by his dialogues. Akshay's little role also placed him on the plane with Amitabh. I did not understand what Bhumiko Chawal does in this film. <br /> <br /> There were several vacancies in the script; like; Amitabh has been proven to be the most popular criminal in the city, who is still in the city without pests. The kidnapping of his family is also unclear. How can a family of such a big donation have a security cover?
