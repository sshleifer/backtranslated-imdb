I got this movie from Netflix after a long wait, so I was very expecting it when it arrives. My worst fear was that it would be fruitful, just like ... well, do you know what all the fanciful fancy girls were crazy about? GACKTnHYDE = hawt yaoi love? Such a thing? It scares it. I was very pleasantly surprised. The film was surprisingly traceable, even when shooting and music made someone want to launch a couple of bikers on each scene and act on the Gackt side was quite good. Hyde, hey, um, Hyde, he was a quasi-romantic friend / gang member that someone who saw him on stage could hardly be surprised. He is one of my two major cows with the film myself. The rest of the cast (including children's actors in the opening scene) was very good at what they were doing - which was mostly shot and screamed. But my second problem was very small in terms of horror. It seemed terribly terrible - horrible - like any scene where someone was shot, either falling, really the most sincere dead or lying there for a long time. But Sho just ... takes shots, repeats himself, sings, bubbles a lot while he's talking, and makes Hyde cry. Overall, if you are a fan of an actor or just a fan of j-film, it is definitely worth seeing.
