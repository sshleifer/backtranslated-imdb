It's not about making every movie cheering you superficially. I will have an ambitious failure to hit the mass market every day. While it can not really be described as a failure, the sum of its parts remains ambiguous. The unimaginable quality tantalizes me to keep track of it again and again. This is a challenging, provocative film that does not include things neatly. The problem with the video is in its structure. His impenetrable conspiracy seems to end, as well as at the other end. Although everything is technically dazzling, the movie is just this unit too long. The long delayed climax of Leo's awakening is about 20 minutes late. Large cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script, but here the innovative camera technology offers a number of visual ideas. Compositional riot is provocative and engaging; The character is designed from behind, but his own hand is not in the foreground. The rendered world is deliberate, treacherous and absurd. Keep your eyes peeled for an unforgettable, technically amazing killing that will slow your jaw. <br /> <br /> Compositions are amazing. Who decided to release a videotape (without printing) in the pan & scan format, should never have seen it. Where is the DVD? <br /> <br /> It's unbeatable how anyone could give so much originality of bad reviews. You should see that at least once. You mean von Trier a bit more than he could chew, but this movie will end up being richer for him. I suspect he's familiar with Hitchcock's foreign correspondent, in which frenzied Europeans also manipulate the American dupe and several Welles films that take the kindness of technology as he does. All von Trier movies are investigating the naif situation in the midst of troubled societies. After the end of the Zentropy, von Trier departed from this type of courageous technical experiment to complete, overstated, unbearable juice like Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.
