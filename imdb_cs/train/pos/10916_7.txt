The comic banter between William Powell and Jean Arthur is the pinnacle of this murderous mystery, which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely lands at all. Powell is probably the most powerful detective of the 1930s, and Arthur has a unique voice that often sounds like a bunch of tiny waved bells. They are extremely fun to observe, so take the roughness of the plot with the grain of salt and just enjoy how it unfolds. Eric Blore also has comic corners like Powell's butler. Powell's contract with MGM contained a clause that allowed him to refuse borrowing for another, but he wanted to work with Arthur again and liked the script, and so eagerly accepted the assignment. They collaborated in two Paramount films from 1929, the Canary Murder Case and The Greene Murder in Philo Vance.
