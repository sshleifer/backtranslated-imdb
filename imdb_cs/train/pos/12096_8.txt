I watch this movie several times, and I find it very good. This film is also known as "Castle of Terror", "Coffin of Terror" and "Dance Macabre". Barbara Steele, is her usual beautiful / scary self. George Riviere, a male leader, has a good job with his role. The whole movie drips with the atmosphere, and there is plenty of tension in the whole. The angles of the camera are good and playing, largely not bad. This movie is suitable for a rainy day or evening. I have an endless version of DVD that is much better than the edited version of the TV. Grab some popcorn, turn off lights, sit down and enjoy. John R. Tracy
