It was a gorgeous little American propaganda film that is highly creative and openly discussing Nazi atrocities before revealing the full range of death camps. While late 1944 and by 1945 would reveal how bad and terrible they were, this film, unlike other Hollywood films, has been the most brutal honorary film of the time I've seen in connection with the Nazi atrocities. <br /> <br /> The film begins in the courtroom in the future - after the war (the film was made in 1944 - the war ended in May 1945). At this fictitious world court, the Nazi leader seeks war crimes. Wilhelm Grimm is utterly rude and is called a witness who, since 1919, has revealed Grimm's life in a series of memories. At first, the film seems to be compassionate or explain how Grimm was pushing to join the Nazis. After a while, however, it is clear that Grimm is just a sadistic monster. These episodes are incredibly well done and will surely attract you, and it also seems like the movie looks more like a propaganda but a legitimate drama. Overall, the film does a great job in terms of film mostly second-generation star. There are many convincing scenes and performances - especially the very ancient Jewish extermination scene towards the end that can not help but bring you close to tears. It was also interesting that there were some super-creative scenes around the same place in the movie that use the crosses in a way you can not see at first glance. All in all, it is necessary for lovers of history and for anyone who wants to see a good film. FYI - This is not meant as a serious critique of the film, but Hitler was referred to as "the curtain". This is a reference to the myth that Hitler once made money for wallpapers. This is not really true - before he was a "starving artist" homeless and served well in the German army in the First World War. A horrible person, yes, but never a paper curtain!
