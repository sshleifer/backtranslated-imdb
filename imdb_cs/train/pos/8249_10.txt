My God. This film really shows the talent of the actors. Billy Connelly is flexing flexibly. Really amazing man when you look at him in Absolution as a rebel, Boondock Saints as a madman / killer and finally in Fido as a zombie! His character in Fido looks from cute to scary, absolutely fabulous! Cariie Ann Moss is not even a hack! Jump in a career from Matrix and Momento as a darker figure on heart warming in the Conservative 1950 at home! Rarely these days, we can see that actors are not capable of being so typified. <br /> <br /> Now on the plot (No Spoilers, do not worry). This movie would make Max Brooks (author of zombie survival guide and World War Z) a joy of joy! Finally a well done twist zombie and comedy. <br /> <br /> If you like zombies, if you do not like zombies, if you are just bored or if you are too busy, check out this movie!
