Inspector "Dirty" Harry Callahan again disturbs his superiors with his maverick approach to police work. When he rejects a vacation, he gets a simple case that takes him out of San Francisco. However, he will soon discover the connection between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside the city, leading him to the revenge killer path. As an entry into the dirty Harry franchise, the film begins with some very promising moments, including the legendary "Go to My Day" line, that Eastwood delivers gorgeous teeth before one hand kills the robbery. Very bad and what the fans expect from him. The film, however, soon moves to speed and focuses on the mysterious killer of revenge. The problem is that the killer is not as mysterious as he is as Harry. This really aggravates the presence of the main hero who has dominated all of his previous film appearances and has forgiven the Magnum Force. On the bright side, this new story draws a few parallel with Harry's unorthodox methods and gives his character a dramatic depth that was not there before, but fans who were looking for another Harry trip would be more than likely to be somewhat disappointed. However, a tense climax ends the movie on an exciting note, so if you do not mind something a little different, it's a good movie for fans. --- 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated for R for Violence and Rape Scenario
