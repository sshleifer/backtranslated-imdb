Another fantastic film from a country where, due to decades of oppression from fundamentalist regimes, it has no problems in creating passionate subjects. Panahi now has another approach with a mixture of ironic comedy and a cute, unprofessional cast. While he still overcomes his message of what he considers to be inherently bad with his country, he does so without the need for a difficult process. It has a positive impact on the country, especially on its people, which the Iranian population desperately needs. The biggest pity is that it will not be released on home soil. The island, paranoid Iranian government claims that this excellent filmmaker is successful only abroad because it is part of a global plot that punishes them. After growing up in the middle of the revolution and watching academics, artists and educators "disappear" over the last 25 years, it shows great bravery by continuing to work. The reality achieved by shooting the current World Cup will really bring you to action. The fact that he shot it at 35 mm is awesome because most of them would only try this project using a digital format. It looks fantastic. His emphasis on the use of unprofessional actors really works in this film as well. Fine performances all around. After watching many of the films that show Iran's problems and the news media that tell the facts, we can demonize people and the government. This film has the opposite. It shows us that they still love the same things and that they are laughing and laughing about the absurd rules of sharia law that maybe change for the better is not too far away. Some call Panahi feminist filmmaking, but I think he only fights for the most oppressed demographic situation in Iran. Young, independent women.
