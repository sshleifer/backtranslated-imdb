This is one of the best movies ever shot. It's a realistic view of rural ranch, which is a big part of American history. The setting is 1906 Wyoming, where life has not changed much since the last century. The movie keeps you interested without the added Hollywood myths. The whole family sees this film and is wondering what life is like in America when it was a predominantly rural nation. With this film, you miss the presence and witnesses of everyday life 100 years ago. In a beautiful, picturesque setting, you will see the hard physical work you needed to survive, as well as constant fears and concerns about the elements and market pressures that will make the difference between success or failure. Check out this movie and experience life as it was for most of our nation's history. This movie is worth seeing. My only question is - why are not other movies like this one?
