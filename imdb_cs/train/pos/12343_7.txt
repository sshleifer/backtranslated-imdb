Artistically, it's a beautiful movie - cinema, music and costumes are wonderful. In fact, this film is nicer than those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself. In this case, he wrote the film just as it did a few years after his death. <br /> <br /> So, when it comes to writing, the dialogue was well written and the story was interesting at times. But the story was rather depressing, but in some ways uninteresting - after all, it is the story of a group of women working in a brothel. Interestingly, although prostitution was considered to be far more acceptable in Japan, women still need a better life. It reminds me of a lot of Streets of Shame movies, though Shadow Shadows are much less sympathetic and more one-dimensional. So overall it gets 7 - mostly because of all BUT writing. It is bad that the weakest article in this film is the story of the great Kurasawa.
