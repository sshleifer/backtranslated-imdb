Solid Film B. <br /> <br /> I like Jake Weber. Its undervalued delivery is refreshing at times over top performances. I liked the relationship between father and son. I liked the dynamics of my family. Wendigo looks silly, but it's a representation of a toy and dead deer. It's a connection, you see? This is a psychological story, not Freddy's slash. Watch it and think about your inner child and what the film can tell you and you will be fine. Nice work.
