Whenever I see most reviews, it's called "Eddie Murphy's wreck". These critics want to look at some of the things he does these days, and maybe soften their attitude in a retrospective ... "The Golden Child" is not fun, but thanks to some cast it breathes new life into the old cliché and gives Murphy one of his best roles. I do not understand the penetrating lack of "love" for her efforts at all. Perhaps it was released at a time when the device was lost from anxiety, exciting adventures? Steven Spielberg began with Indian Jones; it is unfair to make this man a scapegoat when his greatest sin is perhaps absolutely harmless. It's not necessarily wrong with trying to evaluate trends. Yes, it is stupid, but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that "ridiculous" is the place where the Hollywood idea of ​​mysticism begins and ends. What is more important than credibility with such a story is that viewers have fun guides at hand to show them mysterious sights. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy fit the invoice for this capacity at ease. My advice is to buy you a ticket and drive.
