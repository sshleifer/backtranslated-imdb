If you've ever read and used the novel by Tom Robbins, you will appreciate this film as a whole-blooded attempt to translate its unpleasantly untraditional writing style into a practical piece of great visual art. The actors and direction of the film are good. <br /> <br /> The only problem with the movie is that when I see it is that Robbins can combine ideas and feelings with his words that were still beyond Hollywood while the film was shot. <br /> <br /> Because of the distrust of today's movies and the willingness and ability of today's audience to dive into a bizarre, I think "Even the Cowgirls ... will get a better reception today than if they were originally released.
