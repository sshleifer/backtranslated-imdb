I remember watching late night on black and white television long before the live version of the action was in the eyes of Peter Jackson ... and she was very impressed. Finally, will I get my hands a week on a copy of the VHS that was kicked off (and it's not just a parachute for a course ...?) I had a chance to see this movie again and found that it still stands well even though it's not quite a success, which she painted the memory. I have to confess to some distortion. Some reviewers claim themselves to be affirmed by Jackson lovers, others as Jackson-hate; I'm not even. I was dedicated to BBC Radio adaptation Brian Sibley originally broadcast in 1981 and immediately recognized Gollum's voice here - Peter Woodthorpe will repeat this performance almost remark-ideal for the radio three years later. /> However, I have to say that where I found Jackson's films increasingly disappointing, Bakshi's version of everything cut into bones was in fact more accurate. Yes, there are common, understandable changes (here is Legolas rather than Arwen, replacing Glorfindel as Elf sent from Rivendell to meet this side), and there are plenty of telescopic events. (The only exception to the other, as the others have noted, is a strangely widespread succession on the rivendel, where Ringwraiths, who have demonstrated the cooling ability to freeze and pull Frodo back in the middle of the flight - who resist once they cross the river, resist them - then for some inexplicable reason just chasing after him in an extended straight canter, which is initially disgraceful, but useless, conspiratorial and definitely takes too long.) I also agree that Balrog is unsatisfactory, partly because of bad animation, and that Gandalf has too much wind. <br /> <br /> But while watching both approaches to the movie, I feel more than ever that the animated route is the one to be taken. In a story that is half myth (strangely, one thing that is part of Aragorn's fragment of Berena and Luthien) is the extreme literalism required to shoot live events where everything from monsters to shirts must be made in detail to appear on the camera , counterproductive: Latex face monsters (or CGI) are less monstrous than sketchy shapes, heroic costumes tend to look somewhat stupidly worn on real bodies, and hobbies or dwarves with inhumane proportions are easy to animate but hard to convincing. Many reviewers have said that Ringwraith's owl in the woods, with his crippled, half-human movements, is one of the most horrible moments in the movie-it certainly scared me foolishly when I first saw him in the dark! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> Proudfeet - corresponds effectively to a similar change in the tone of Tolkien's prose. I felt there were some missing opportunities when the potential of animation could be used to the big effect: Gandalf threatened Bilbo with his rightful power in the opening scenes, Bilbo seemed to have become a gem-shaped creature under the influence of Ring-lust on Rivendell and Galadriel's famous tempting speech, were all attracted to more or less straight, where it would be trivial to distort the scene to reflect the changed hobbit perception. But in general, the changes in detail and palette - the colors in Bree, the bright colors that reappear in Rivendell and the Fangor Canal, dirty gray and brown for Moria and the desolate lands - work well to reflect the mood of different episodes where live- the action approach simply does not allow background blur or sketches in a stylized environment. As a fan, I did not care about Jackson or Bakshi imaging Lothlorien - I once again thought the sound was the most appropriate evocation I encountered in a beautiful, bitterly unspoken forest paradise captured by time - and I feel that Bakshi is bad at this point the singing of the elves, but I do as a small assembly at this time, showing the various members of society who are resting together in their wounds in Moria. Aragorn gives hobbies-fencing-lessons here is just as charming (and equally necanonical) spectacle like Boromir's Hollywood Hobbit in the Jackson version. Aragorn display as convincing weather Runger is good (Viggo Mortensen's handsome Jesus looks really did not work for me), although it would be interesting to see how he is going to "clean up" the character in the second half for Gondor. John Hurt, unexpectedly, gives sterling vocal performance as well as resonating William Squire in the Gandalf section. It seems to me that the hobbits are intended to reflect the current youth as data identifying the audience: I find the animated style (their proportions are much more "cartoon" than the human characters) works well to distinguish them, and the whole "furry leg" is more credible than in more literal ideas, including a large number of fans. <br /> <br /> I personally have less opposition to Boromir as a Viking - it's always a relatively bludgeoning type - than a beard - Aragorn (illogical: after all, they were both Numenori), though I obviously have a minority here! <br /> <br /> The big mistake in this picture will always be the fact that it was an unfinished project and the bizarre voices ended and they tried to solve the issues. Damage; it would be interesting, not to mention less frustrating, to find out what Bakshi plans to make from Shelob and Minas Tirith, do not mind the dead ...
