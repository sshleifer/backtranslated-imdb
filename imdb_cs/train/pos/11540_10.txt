This is the work of Neil Simon, who has received a lot of praise! "Special Couple" is a unique jewel that lasts for itself. You have Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon); hypochondriak, a cute anxiety monster and a big thorn in the side of her roommate, Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau); total slob. These men have great work. Felix is ​​a journalist, and Oscar is a sports writer. Both men are divorced, Felix's wife is close, while Oscar is on the other side of the US (West Coast). Well, what can you say? Two men living together in one roof without being crazy about each other are impossible, just as unlikely. It's a lot of laughter and a lot of fun. I liked it when the two British neighbors who talk to both gentlemen and after Felix kick off Oscar are lucky and live with them when he refused dinner with them before. It is time for Felix to intensify. I think all the clean cheats are so anxious to go. They can be upset, yet they should be patient as well. Very funny movie and nuevo classic. Neil Simon's "Special Couple" needs to see a classic movie. 5 STARS!
