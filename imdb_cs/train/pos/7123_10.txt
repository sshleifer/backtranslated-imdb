Sometimes I watch the film and am really touched by it? and yet it is not easy to explain why I liked it very much. Is this mostly true for unusual movies? those who hardly compare with others. Goodnight Mister Tom is one of these special films. There's a lot of emotion in the movie? and acting was so good that I was crying while watching the movie and laughing as the story unfolded. Young Nick Robinson? a young boy (William) is evacuated from London due to air strikes during the Second World War. Mr. Tom played John Thaw is an old man who leaves in the village to which evacuees were sent. <br /> <br /> First, Tom refuses to assume any responsibility - for example, to take care of a troubled young boy? but it accepts because it is left without choice. During his stay Mr. Tom will discover how awful the life was for William? along with his luggage, sent his mother a belt and wrote instructions to his son's host? do not hesitate to use it. This belt is in the field? never be used so brutally. Mr. Tom provides William with a real home, and the boy is happy with his new life, going to school, creating new friends and discovering hidden talents. Suddenly, William's name is at home in London with a letter saying he does not feel well and starts over again? just this time it will be much worse? Are there many feelings you can feel in this movie? love, fear, sorrow, happiness, pain, hope? and much more. Goodnight Mr. Is Tom another masterpiece of British film comparable to others like Dear Frankie and Billy Elliot? if necessary to compare. I really enjoyed watching and highly recommended. Before I finish this review, I would also like to mention the great performance of Thomas Orange in the role of Zac? reminded my friend of my own childhood (:
