Taking into account the time it was created, I found it a useful movie. While the details can be "dramatized", the overall history has been a good foundation. Besides, I found a conspiracy of actors I really enjoyed. Who would have imagined Ben Cartwright as an unfortunate incense? I'll leave you the rest of the star. As for secondary casting, this film (as one might expect from the late 1930s) has a very nice character actor, but the top to the right hand Andrew Jackson Peavey. Perfect touch of comedy. Well shot, with beautiful ships and competent acting, I recommend it to anyone who likes a gentle camp or an eye for a two-storey piece set at the dawn of America and made in times when great names and top figures are really a pleasure.
