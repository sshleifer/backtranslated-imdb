I do not think that such a movie will be released today. It takes time to put the depth of the characters and the plot is not full of twists and turns to keep you at the edge of your seat. But what does this film have: interesting to study how families deal with grief. Once the tongue for healing and excessive loss leaves silent and we rely on raw emotions. Sadness without wisdom and patience is anger, even hatred. And unfortunately, the main character (a young boy who accidentally shoots and kills his brother while hunting) in the film is given more than his fair share of it. He eventually leaves and comes in with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley), who makes it clear that it was an accident. I had the impression that this young man knew it in his heart, but he needed to hear these words from his parents and accept their forgiveness. What I loved this film: lack of dialogue. There was a tremendous emphasis on physical response, facial expressions. And the slower pace of the movie will allow you to truly watch the actors' reactions. Something we can not do today with today's movies. <br /> <br />
