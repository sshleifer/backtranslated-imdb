Everyone in the cast, from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko is someone we know in everyday life. They were so natural, and Sugiyama's transformation is incredibly believable. The score is so moving, it leads me to tears. The choreography was beautiful without looking athletic. More chic dancing and spell gave me goose bits. Tamako is such a beautiful figure. You can see the almost charming kindergarten in his face when he remembers seeing "The King and I". Aoki's character is both cheerful and pitiful. Massacre is as natural as a confused wife, you almost want to embrace her to make sure everything is okay. The film is really a goalie.
