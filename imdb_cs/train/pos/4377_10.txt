The early to mid-1990s were, in my opinion, the culmination of historical drama. The last of the Mohicans, Braveheart, Rob Roy - they all depicted the passion and intensity in their respective time periods. Rob Roy was a unique and interesting taste of time and place, rarely represented by the film. It has everything - an interesting story, great acting, remarkable dialogue and breathtaking scenery. I was particularly impressed by the apparently true dialogue. I can imagine that it was how the people of the early 18th century began to speak and behave. Something else that surprised me was the vulgarity of characters. I found it to be much more repulsive and shocking, though often more subtle than most of those appearing in movies in modern times. The film had a very slight and sexually charged edge, which was unique and most likely very realistic in the context of time. The pace was very tight, with an almost boring moment. There have been many intrigues and political subplots that have made things a little more complicated, but they have never lost sight of the main story. The action was also very well done and gripped. Something I can find forever is remarkable that there is no soundtrack at all during the most action-packed action in the movie. It makes a very tight, exciting sequence because we have no musical sign in terms of direction and resolution of the scene. Rob Roy will always be high on my favorite movie list. I would recommend it to all.
