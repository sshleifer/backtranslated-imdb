I want to warn you that this note is very hot and cold. This comment will be much more significant to you, even if you've seen the movie. Though it is tragically sad to say that the film has a similarity to my life, which is so stunning that it's really scary. The rest of you never know exactly how the film describes how people who are in situations like this act and react in their later life. It could not be a fictitious work; it had to be based on personal experience. My testimony of how good the movie was is the fact that even though it was one of the best movies I've ever seen watching my life on the silver screen, it was such a terribly painful experience that I will never see it. But I cordially support all of them as a chance to look into the soul of another human being to the extent that you have never before experienced or never before. I know this in fact because it is my soul that you observe.
