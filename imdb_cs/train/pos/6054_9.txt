I saw the Freebird on the Man TT island, as I heard about it in several motorcycle cars. Although I ended up mainly because of the races, trying to see Phil Daniels in a motorcycle (yes, I like Quadrophenia like everyone else) has turned out to be enough to turn me away from beer and party. Eventually! we did it! the British have really made a great motorcycle movie (and it's not like Torque), it's with the best British comedy. Mark my words, this is the best projection of Phil Daniels, and there's a new British legend that makes his name for Geoff Bella. I loved Gary Stretch in the fantastic Dead Mans Shane Meadows shoes and here he delivers a silent touch that he can proudly add to his growing film reputation. This is a film not just for us cyclists, but I think everyone (even my girlfriend loved it). I hope it gets the same brilliant response on the mainland as it was on the island of Man. I will not go into the details of some of the classic scenes that this movie has (watch out for the store) because it would spoil the fun, but I would say, to see, to enjoy and have one of the best nights at the cinema you had in a while. I really think it could be a cult classic. As they said on TT ... C'Mon Freebird!
