It's really a strange movie - and that's not a bad thing. It's a combination of a neo-realistic film about homeless and fairy-tale. I'm sure some may find this movie a little weird, but I loved it. Once again, this director combines the wonderful cast of ordinary people (not actors) and gets great performance in the ensemble. Although not as sad as Umberto D, both films have a very similar point - this is just a very absurd way. Do not forget about a cheese special effect - after all, it was made in the early 1950s and the special effects are not as important (or at least they should not be in movies). Instead, sit down and enjoy a very strange and silly ride. If you are not a complete helmsman, you will have the ball. <br /> <br /> By the way, from the first review of this movie, I saw another DeSica driven film, which is absolutely necessary, and that is CHILDREN WATCHED IN THE USA. Though it's not fantasy or light in spirit like MIRACLE IN MILAN, great movie yet.
