At first sight, I found that this story is at least less annoying than the other Cannon Movie Tales. For many others, I think it's one of the best. Some songs are pretty bad, especially a love song, but there are two things that make movie, even singing, good. One is artistic. Like the other Cannon Movie Tales, this is beautifully decorated with small works; each piece of cloth and jewelery (both of which have the main parts in this film fence) look fresh and new, and contrast with plain clothes of the peasants. Even during the love song, it seemed to me that I had been studying the dresses and hair of the princess, beautifully done. The second thing is comic timing. Much of the movie is blessed, but the vanity of the Emperor (and eventually his joking), the suspect guard, the guards of persecution of Nicholas and the silly prince, are quite funny and seem to be meaningful. . And the sequence during the Weave-O song matches the songs that were not that good.
