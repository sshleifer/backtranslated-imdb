A personal rule of taste when it comes to talking about movies like this precious little jewel. On the way back in the eighties, in the early eighties, I discovered this film, like many people who were released at the time, "Night Patrol", "Bad Manners" or even "King Frat" artwork and blurbs on the back of the packaging in temptation and teasing you. <br /> <br /> Of course it's the age, the movies I've mentioned, as well as stuff like Screwballs and many others, captured the imagination and for many years I still remember with kindness and some with contempt for many films that help keep your love for genre like parody or trap. Made many years after the enormous success of "Animal House," and I have seen, over the years, I knew that this film would never have lit up how the box would get the money out of it, nor would it be remembered, just like the National Lampoon holiday. honestly, not everything that came with the National Lampoon logo was a wild hit, but me The RÃ©union remains one of my favorite movies with instantly recognizable characters, such as Bob Spinnaker, who played the perfect Gerrit Graham, so good at "Terrorvision" Charles Band , which still lasted in the past glory of his youth. Or about how Stephen Furst crashes and magically turns out to be a college of lazy drunk sex crazy Hubert Downs. Sweet like. Which thinks me. As I said before, a personal taste that did not last. People can be so cruel, so they never get any prizes or compare themselves with similar peers in the comic world. It has some merit. It was one of the previous scenarios written by John Hughes, which would later continue to make one of his own favorite songs, "Weird Science", as well as a wonderful theme that sang the great Gary US Bonds. <br /> What else can I say is a movie just waiting for rediscovery, over and over again.
