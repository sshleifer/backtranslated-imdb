"Cold Blood," directed by Richard Brooks from Truman Capote's novel, deals with the brutal and nonsensical murder of a four-member family of unfortunate criminals. The film excels as a character study of the killers, especially the punk man Perry Smith (Robert Blake). Cast includes several recognizable names, yet they bring the story to life with ease. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are great as two criminals with different personalities. They play together effortlessly, while Blake gains plenty of opportunity to explore the idiosyncrasies of his character. The rest of the cast is just average, and it is not worth noting. Richard Brooks earned Oscar nominations for both the script and his direction. In my opinion, both were excellent, although the late-stage scenario mistakenly estimates some bad information. Conrad Hall Oscar Cinematography is also top-notch as well as editing. Also worth mentioning is Quincy Jones's jazz score, which has secured the last four Oscar nominations. Unlike many other crime films, this film does not affect violence. Brooks converts assassins into decent characters rather than condemning them. Whatever your mood, the film is an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach. I recommend the film for this reason and also for the technical expertise that the technical aspects deal with.
