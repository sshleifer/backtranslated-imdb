Who says Pokemon is stupid can die. This movie is great. I even charmed the tear when Celebei died. I do not understand much! This movie is a moving animated thriller. <br /> <br /> In this fourth installment of Pokemon, Ash and friends have to stop a bad blockbuster to get Celebei's top evil weapon with his dark balls. At that time, Sam and Celebei travel in time and are constantly pursued by game hunters. I like the part with double battle and Sam has a magician pokeor (if you played pokemon gold, silver or crystal, you know what it is.) I also enjoyed having a miramax instead of Warner Brothers. Putting the mini movie at the end was a great idea. Pokemon in this movie will come alive more than ever.
