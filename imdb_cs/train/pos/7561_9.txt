The version I saw from this movie was rent with a similar name, but I swore a word in it. The movie was funny like hell. It was also true bone. If you've ever spent time in Hollywood or around, you'll understand humor. If it is not, you can not even notice it. The story of two people in business trying to achieve until they reach the break point, it is a precious gem. It says it's a drama, but it's a drama, just like Deer Hunter's comedy. Loren Dean is great, as always, as a supporting actor. Jamie Kennedy managed to keep his own well. His performance is extremely impressive during a poodle scene. The only downside was Carmen Electra, but we can not have everything.
