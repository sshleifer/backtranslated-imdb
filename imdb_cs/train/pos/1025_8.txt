My rating refers to the first 4 seasons of the Stargate SG-1, which are beautifully fresh, creative and addictive. When cast cast the gate, you never know what lies on the other side! Beginning with Season 5 it turned out that it turned out different - still good, but different. The series follows the adventures of a team of people (and one foreigner) who regularly find themselves in a planetary transport facility called the Stargate. The predecessor of this series is based on the Stellar Gate movie and event, in which the device is discovered during an archaeological excavation in Egypt. Episodes are light (innocent and easy to watch) and very creative. Many of the stories of the invention could easily be made into large sci-fi films. What's going on has always been unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The characters on which the show leans are also well defined and well done. Their tone is serious, but the dialogue is blooming with incredible joke and humor. They are simply fun to watch. Beginning around Season 5, the series began to evolve as an ongoing story based on the fight against a single enemy (Goa'uld, then Ori). Land becomes more complex (much more politically / strategically oriented) and more dependent. The figures were still as big as ever, but the show was of a different nature. <br /> <br /> One thing that should be mentioned is to watch episodes that resembled the 100th and 200th episodes. They just can not miss a show. They exhibit a creative and wildly humorous genius that was transmitted by the series during 10 seasons. <br /> <br /> If you are a sci-fi fan, watch several episodes of the first four seasons and you will probably be hooked. If you like the evolving story line between two opposing sides, you can look forward to 10 season shows.
