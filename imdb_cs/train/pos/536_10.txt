Several films can be seen almost 60 years later, but they still remain as amazing as this. Technological progress has not made this classic love story. The special effects used are remarkable for the 1946 film. The game is excellent. David Niven, Kim Hunter, and above all Roger Livesey do a great job. The use of black and white / color adds to the creative nature of the film. It has not been seen on television for 20 years, so few people are aware of their existence. It's my favorite movie of all time. Waiting and hoping that the DVD will be released for many years is in itself "a matter of life and death".
