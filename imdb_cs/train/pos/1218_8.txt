This cartoon was weird, but the story actually had a little more depth and emotion than other animated movies. We have a girl in a low-confident camp and barely other friends, except for a brother and a sister who's just as bad as her. It will reach the final lowest point, and when the opportunity arises, it literally closes the deal with the demonic demon. I thought this movie was very true, and just when it could not be worse, the girl sees what she has done, regrets and then changes and then helps this dark, mystical creature to learn the human quality of love. Twins also improve by helping small bears and then getting a sense of self-esteem. A very positive message for children, although some elements of the film were strange, was and still is a rather nice film. Stephen Bishop's music (Tootsie's song) made the film even better
