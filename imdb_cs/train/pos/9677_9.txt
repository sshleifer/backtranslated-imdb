This film looks on the surface as a run of children's film lovers that parents can regret to watch with their mostly entertaining young children. The film seems and is mostly focused on children, but it does not stop at this level. At first I watched this film as a young child and found it funny, fun and hearty and did not see it for several years. I looked at myself again at the age of 18 and found it almost as funny but just as hearty and entertaining. This film is highly underestimated and contains many real-life news. This film is an inspirational story designed for children who are epic in their own right. I recommend this movie to anyone at any age.
