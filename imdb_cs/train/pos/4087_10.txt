I have to say, I thought I saw it all. I'm an extremely crazy movie fan. This movie did not taste me in any way. I'm over that point. But he took me to some emotional places I did not know I could go. I had no idea that I could ever find (ick) the idea of ​​beastality erotic. Never ever. At all. At all. But you go there. He did it. I have to give credit to the director. He took it out. <br /> <br /> During the first 40 minutes, this film is a complete work. We start with a very clear shot of two horses that have sex. After five minutes, I began to wonder whether to buy this movie was not a mistake. Then an old wheelchair guy talks to another old man about marrying two husbands. Then some nervous person shaves. Then we see (briefly) the hot cat that gets her with a valet (but it's very brief). At this point, I cursed the movie loudly as I tried to stay awake. In fact, I fell asleep for about 40 minutes and I forced her to finish another night. Finally, we get a good thing when a girl (who knows who is or who is in this movie) has a dream of a Victorian gala that has been destroyed by insects in the woods. The scene continues for some time and is really the hen-heh of the whole deal. He is beautifully shot, dressed and delivered. They try to try the plot at the end and it makes sense, but it is not. Oh, okay. I would definitely recommend this film. In the first 40 minutes, I wanted to shoot (and my television), but the last 50 minutes will completely redeem her.
