The four prisoners share one cell: the dominant transvestite, Marcus (Clovis Cornillac); Marcus's idiot Swedish friend, Paquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who will eat something in sight, including pocket hours, cockroaches and his little sisters; Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach), an intelligent librarian who murdered his wife; and Carrère (Gérald Laroche), the new person who was involved in corporate fraud and is now focused on escape. After the brick is launched from the wall of the cell, the hidden logs appear, written by the "obsessed murdered" Fountain of Youth, who occupied the cell in the twenties of the last century. Is this magazine the secret of their escape? Or is there something much more sinister about it? I was a little tired when I got into this movie because the only other experience I have with Eric Valette was a terrible One Missed Call (2008) which I consider the worst movie I've ever seen. However, much of what was wrong with one missed call could probably be attributed to Klavan's horrific scenario because (as I recall) the Valette directive was not the worst part of the film (if it decided to include a child). Anyway, Maléfique was a good way to get my respect back. . . it's a French film (apparently something I like) and is in prison (which is my second favorite horror environment after asylums). So that's two points before the movie starts. Thankfully, Valette got me the movie. Maléfique is a rather deep, rather complicated, somewhat convincing story of obsession and despair. . . desire and the need to bring fantasy into reality. While it's not a frightening film in the traditional sense, strange power makes it pretty damn scary. The time between the climax and the end was one of the best movies I've seen long ago, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a decent psychological thriller with some pretty gore. <br /> <br /> Ultimate verdict: 8.5 / 10. Director Valette gained a lot of respect. <br /> <br /> Note: Paramount got the rights to make an American remake (surprise surprise). It's scheduled for 2009. I'm not sure why, to be honest, because it does not seem to be something in the state. But I was surprised. <br /> <br /> Vive La France! <br /> <br />
