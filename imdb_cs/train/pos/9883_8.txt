The 8th season was the first, at the beginning of 1959 and the last, in the autumn of 1965, was shorter than the period 2-7. CBS Leader William Paley canceled Rawhide's production after watching the first year of Season 8 in September 1965 because he did not like the series without Eric Fleming as Gil Favor who left after Season 7. Last Last Episode Released in November 1965. Lonesome CBS Broadcasting 1966, 4 January 1966, repeated. <br /> <br /> I often wondered why Rawhide did not change the colorful shootings of the last season. Most of the 1920s westerns went into color until 1965. CBS was broadcast in the fall for many of their sitcoms, but the westerns like Gunsmoke and Rawhide remained in black and white. Gunsmoke was the last Western (and the last series of time series to switch to color) on September 17, 1966, for an episode of Snap's decision.
