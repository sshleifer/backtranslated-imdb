Everyone who thinks Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is one of the best movies ever, needs control of their head. Somehow he will be completely crippled and ruthless, but at the same time scary and conscious and clever. One of those rare movies that really improve on him, you can enjoy Bogus Journey over and over again. A remarkable warning is the duel with Death and the end that is highly "emotional". Keanu wants to forget all the litter trash and do what he does best, Ted Theodore Logan in Bill and Ted: Return.
