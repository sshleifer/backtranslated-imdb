Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger play the role of good and bad that they held in "All the Brothers were Brave". Taylor looks a bit uncomfortable in his wrong role, but Granger plays his role perfectly. However, the real hero in the story is the buffalo and the northwest. The film is perfectly made, with the atmosphere of the time that has been beautifully given. The direction is tense and although the film is not fun, it is my main way of thinking that is a major film that is unfairly ignored by cognoscents.
