This film I saw last year at the Taos Film Festival was just amazed. It's a rich, warm novel he brought to the screen, beautifully acting and well controlled. More than anything, I reminded David Lean's films, both in his ability to handle a complex story, and his ability to create powerful scenes that affect you at several different levels. The best movie I've seen for years.
