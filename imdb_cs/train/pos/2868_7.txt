First of all I need to say that I am Portuguese and it is not usual for me to spend my time watching Portuguese films, probably once a year or even at all ... And the reason is almost a general idea among Portuguese people, that national photos are terrible, really close to the worst ever! Nevertheless, in the last decade, I am surprised when we return to the fun of the 1940s, when "Leão da Estrela" and "Costa do Castelo" are among the best times in the world with films such as "Pulsação Zero" or "Sorte Nula" from director Fernando Fragato, with some actors and music in common. This is also good, not of the same kind, because it is not true. in fact, it's officially a drama, a female drama, has some unexpected fun parts, the cause of humorous characters, or fun things that happened to them, like a hypothetical trip to the Caribbean, just to get it. <br /> <br /> The story works and can surprise us a few times; actors are all right, places regular as scores; but the truth is that it all makes sense, then we can count it as a nice effort for a national cinema that seems to be from ash as a phoenix. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a Portuguese film, you may have a better chance, but it's still one that's going to be measured.
