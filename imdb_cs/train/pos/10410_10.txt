Thief of Baghdad is one of my ten most popular films. It's exciting without a gore, it's beautifully shot and the artistic direction is flawless. Casting could not have been better. Rex Ingram believed me in the genes. Merry Evil is certainly conceived by Conrad Veight as Jafar. Set the bar very high. <br /> <br /> I watch this movie at least twice a year ... and I will never hurt it. This film is an adventure for all ages ... no one too old to enjoy it. The thief in Bahgadam recalls the innocent times ... I was the ten years I saw for the first time, and the US is just about to go into the Second World War. Conrad Vieght was such a great actor that a few years later in "Casablanca" he managed to continue this "anger". And Korda, together with Justin and Dupree, reunited in "The Four Feathers" ... a great movie!
