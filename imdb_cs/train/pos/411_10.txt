This movie is well done on so many levels that I am amazed that the score is as low as it is (5.9 / 10 (576 votes) from this writing). This movie has incredible special effects, a true epic story, complicated great interaction with characters and crazy bats - must be seen to be believed! The only complaint I have is the subtitles for the HK DVD version I received (some lines have not been translated - ???). I just do not understand when I read and hear from various sources: "I have a confused plot ...", "I could not follow the story ..." or "Characters came from nothing ...". From the first moment I watched this movie, I understood it, followed it, knew why there were characters and I loved it absolutely! I've been watching it eight times and every time it's pure enjoyment. And this is not just my opinion because I have shown this film to many Americans (people who have never seen a HK movie before) who feel the same. None of them was able to follow the story, and everybody declared their love for this movie. Oh, man, why can not we have such things that came out of Hollywood? At least the Lord of the Rings had a nice marriage of special effects, character development, and action. This does not come from the Asian lover. I own an extensive library of Asian films and I must say that this movie is one of my biggest DVDs. When you look at it, you will be blown away by the amazing special effects and epic feel of this movie. You will be attracted to this fantastic world and you will not want to leave! I saw both the 1983 version and 2001 (both performed by Tsui Hark) and 2001 is much better compared to the IMO. Apart from the subtitles, I have one more complaint about this movie: I did not want it to end ... Please, Mr. Harek - can we please continue?
