This movie is probably a low budget and filmed in British Columbia, Canada. The obstacles that had to be overcome to make this film convincing (in California and the late 1960s and 1980s) were well conceived. Do I believe this is the best and most accurate version of the Zodiac killings that plagued the city of Vallejo and the Bay from 1968-19? (he was never caught) .Edward James Olmos (Dave Toschi) and George Dzundza (Zodiac-at the time believed to be Arthur Leigh Allen because of the deleted DNA and fingerprints) play the game cat and mouse again to visit the scene crime together, everybody is trying run the other into the emotional revelation. Olmos is dying of some kind of terminal illness, and he knew Dzundza did it, still totally obsessed with losing his family and becoming a full-fledged alcoholic along the way. totally unconscious and self-proclaimed (like all serial killers) to the massacre that remains in his awakening. The only disappointment was "over the top" ending otherwise quite accurate. If you are a tire of a typical Hollywood fluff or you are interested in the Zodiac case, look at it.
