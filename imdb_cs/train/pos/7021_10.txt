I was pleased to attend the The Pacific and Eddy screening last weekend at the International Film Festival Santa Barbara. This film caught me when I came across an article about Jalouse. It seemed interesting at the time, but nothing very exciting. Anyway, I saw it on the festival program and decided to review it. The only thing I can say is that I did not talk when the final credits started to crumble. This is one of the most beautiful and most refreshing movies I've ever seen. Photography, artistic direction, acting and especially directing were seamless and flawless. There's nothing written about you in this movie, and you're really thinking. Something that most films do today is the exact opposite. The dialog is carefully crafted and although this script is not spoken from wall to wall, character words are very deliberate and meaningful. It's definitely one of those films that deserves a second view, and the more you see the more things you'll notice. It's a very layered and intelligent film. You are not sure when or where he plays again, but he must definitely see movie enthusiasts.
