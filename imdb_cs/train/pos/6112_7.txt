It's a cat in particular, it's a romantic comedy. There is a fair balance between these two. This particular movie has the addition of some pretty sweet combat scenes, I do not think any wires were used or if they were not stationary. This is not a terribly complicated film, so it's easy on the brain, there is no need to analyze anything to achieve a deeper meaning, fairly simple, good chemistry between the guides and the fun watch. I would like them to provoke the full potential of the girl just once, because she can be so cute, but she keeps her in a small key all the time. I would look again ... with the girl.
