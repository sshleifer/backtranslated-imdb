Great movie - I loved it. Great Editing and Using Audio Tracks. It captures the real sense of Indian life, but we can all concentrate. Well, he chose to cast with some great characters. The film develops all the characters to make sure you really care about them and you feel like you know them. The use of Indian music and drums in some soccer scenes is great and the direction really works when everyone gets out of the box as real and natural. You just can not help but roots for Jess in this movie! The game was really good, even the tomboy walk and the posture of the two leading women is very convincing as someone who played a lot of football.
