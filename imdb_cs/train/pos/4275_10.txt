Actually, I'm surprised that there were so many comments to this movie. I saw this as part of the Slavic Film Festival at a large American university. But no one in the US has heard of it, which is a real shame! Dynamics among people is what makes it both fun and sad. They are connected on a long bus journey - somewhere most of us were! But I never did that! <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where she stops at the funeral. Then the men and the woman slip out for some love in the woods, but everyone is watching them to watch them without knowing! Just like she stretches her skirt and he enters her all the way - consuming begins hacking & they realize they're all looking! Talk about being surprised! But ... you really have to feel them, even if it's funny fun! When you see the end, it's ironic that they liked it when they did it! Serbian humor is the best!
