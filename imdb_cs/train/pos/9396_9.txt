In any number of films you find Nicholas Cage as a strong, quiet hero, Dennis Hopper as a murderous maniac, Lary Flynn Boyle as a vamp / tramp and late, lamented J.T. Walsh as heavy. These are the types of roles that these four can play in sleep, and so often that they are seen to play them again on the clich√©. What a relief from the fact that John Dahl, the master of having received a lot of mood from a small hit, directed this nuanced Noir thriller. Hopper has managed to keep an unbeatable peak, Cage is somewhat more deep than his plainly superficial heroes, Boyle is again frantic, innocent and frantic and man has a sense of hard iron soul that is central to his character, Wayne. Dahl's direction makes you feel the emptiness of the Big Sky land where the story takes place, and is intimately intimate to show how a rumpled eyebrow can indicate a radical change of plot. The conspiracy plot is top-notch, and one of the other great moves in this film is that some of the supporting characters actually behave as if they had brains. It is not often that smaller characters, such as sheriff representatives, have more brains than their superiors. But with the director as catchy as Dahl, you should not be surprised by the intelligence of everything that is related to this movie. Great movie.
