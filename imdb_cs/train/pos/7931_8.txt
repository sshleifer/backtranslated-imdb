Man, if anyone reading this title waited for a great zombie movie, then you are a retarder and you deserve to be disappointed. As for myself, I was expecting a zombie, which is low in the budget, and that's exactly what I got. I was not disappointed at all. I thought it was a great little movie. The zombies were just as they should be, because all the zombies have turned JUST so they are fresh-dead zombies. They obviously did it, because it would be expensive if they made a full frozen zombie FX. I understand the whole thing, I have no idea how anyone could seriously disrupt this film. It's called "HOOD OF THE LIVING DEAD" for love of God! Would you like to watch "Redneck Zombies" and ANY movie Uwe Boll and actually expect it to be great? Of course not! So why are there some fools on IMDb, like a little girl, I will never understand. Oh and YES, there are worse movies, so stop saying that this is the worst you've ever seen since you know you're full! Have you ever watched "ZOMBIEZ" ???? Or "Feardotcom" ????? Or "House of the Dead" ???? These are some of the worst I've ever seen. If you do not see that it's just a small budget zombie apparently made by fans of zombie movie, then there's something with you. I just enjoyed it. He's coming from me, and I'd like to see the sequel.
