Although I do not generally like remakes to believe that remakes are a waste of time; this film is an exception. I did not know so far until I read the previous comment that it was a remake, so my opinion is purely a true film and not a comparison. The story and the way it is written is no doubt: it's Capote. No more words needed. <br /> <br /> The game of Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts is great. I've seen some movies with them, each in one or the other. I was sure they were good actors, and in the case of Eric I always wondered why his sister is the famous star number 1 and not her brother. This time security becomes reality, no doubt. His game, like Mrs. Edwards' play, is clearly the pinnacle of her entire profession. I recommend that this movie be on your top 50 movies so I can see and keep DVD on my fields.
