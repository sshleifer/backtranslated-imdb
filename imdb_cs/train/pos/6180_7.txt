During the first breeze night, the woman is found dead on the bridge over the stage. When the show continues, the police try to get together, who killed who and why before the final curtain. I've always heard it was a big classic comedy of secrets, so I was thrilled to find a copy. Unfortunately, nobody told me about the musical numbers that go on and on. While numbers are certainly the type Hollywood did in their famous days, they are becoming disruptive, because they usually stop the movie even though they try to weave around. It would not be so bad if the music was half-hearted but not. There's only one good song. Even worse, as if they knew they had one song, Cocktails for Two, and we were forced to hold four versions: the duet, the big serial number, the victory finale and the background as random music. I do not think Spike Jones and his Slickers played so much. The rest of the movie is pretty good with Viktor McLaglen, who fits perfectly with Jack Oakie. Charles Middleton is very entertaining is his scene as an actor in love with Mrs. Wardrobe. <br /> <br /> In any case, I can not recommend if you think you can get through music numbers or are willing to scan over them. It's a fun movie of the kind that no longer does.
