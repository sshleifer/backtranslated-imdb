Marion Davies plays in this remarkable "Show People" comedy released by MGM in 1928. Davies plays in Savannah, Georgia, coming to Hollywood with her father (Dell Henderson). The jalopes that they come in are humming - just like Davies's outrageous southern costume. Davies is going to work in a haunted comedy, not what she wants, but it's bringing her success. Meet colleagues with horror star William Haines, who is immediately killed with her. Well, Davies gets a job in a prestigious studio ("High Art Studios") and goes to work in stuffy stuff. A nice but fake actor (Andre Telefair) shows her the rope to be a typical prestigious Hollywood star. Davies leaves his friend and father for a good life, but of course he learns that this is not what he really is. Marion Davies is wonderful all over the world because she - furiously - manages the whole range of emotions required by the "serious" actress. William Haines is his usual amazing comic life, and there are portraits of Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert and other famous stars of today, including the director of King Vidor. This is a silent movie with a few "sound effects", as the soundtracks just got into their own. Treasure of the movie.
