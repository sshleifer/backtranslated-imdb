I was lucky to have seen it in the pre-sale last night (Oct. 20), and I was incredibly surprised by a wonderful plot and really felt the heart of acting. While the plot is not too complicated or exceptionally new, the story unfolds in a way that feels fresh, unique and distinctly "indy" in style. It's not something that can easily be compared to past films, it's a unique shot of a classical, depressive love story of middle age. <br /> <br /> I was especially struck by casting the movie. About every last family allowance it was a beautiful and talented cast. The three daughters had a great job, the talents were evenly dispersed among them, and none of them "blessed" the other two. It was a wonderful film suitable for all ages and laughed loudly funny and at the same time really touching and warming the heart. It was an amazing break from sexual jokes and nudity of recent films.
