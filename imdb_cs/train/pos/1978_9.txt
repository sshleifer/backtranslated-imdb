This Oliver's production is masterful in displaying layers of evil in the human soul. What makes the story remarkable is a brightly invisible sign that penetrates this darkness when it guides a flawless boy across the safest danger into the hands of his relative. Yeah, though Oliver walks through the valley of the shadow of death, he is not afraid of evil. The pull and staff are there to please him. Eventually they are saved from the remnants of humanity. At the bottom is Fagin, the most ominous. Fagin thinks of repenting his travels not once, but twice, but he is falling because he is not willing to pay the price. Fagin is worse than Bill Sikes because he has small handkerchiefs that become murderers. In the middle is Oliver. His innocence is tireless but untested. The best is Nancy. Lack of judgment ignores the violent nature of Bill Sikes from her deep need for love. Still, unlike Fagina, with the probable cost of his own life, he repents for his sins by saving Oliver from Bill. Things are not as it seems. In my opinion, this quality is what makes utility art - unpredictability. I give this movie "10", but its 70-year-old soundtrack and the atmosphere that was made for television has distracted. Overall, this is a fine parable and a thorough story for all viewers.
