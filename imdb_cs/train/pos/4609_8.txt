Probably the best Jackie Chan movie in the eighties and the one who put it on the map. The scope of this self-regulatory police drama is evident from the opening and closing scenes during which villages and a shopping mall are destroyed. There are obvious differences between original Chinese and dubbed English versions, with many jokes failing to get to the other. The other is also braked by stars that do not sound like their Chinese originals. In fact, the only thing dubbed by dubbing is the trial at that time, studies in colonial Hong Kong were conducted in English while the original has this scene in Cantonese! However, Chan's martial arts style and martial art choreography places humor wherever possible, so the non-Cantonese audience will never miss. It is not, after all, a dialogue that makes Chan, but action and painful out-takes. The story is easy to watch: Chan plays an inviolable detective in Hong Kong, which tracks the gangland godfather (Cho Yeun) and has the task of protecting the star witness (Brigitte Lin). The action is excellent from start to finish and there is not much time to breathe. You will never think about it, but what fun and well-connected film. It's probably one of the best martial arts movies.
