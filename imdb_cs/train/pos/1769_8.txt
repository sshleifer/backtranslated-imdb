He simply came out of the preview for this movie. I laughed every 30 seconds. The end was so sad that tears were tearing and I wished I did not buy the big coke. Certainly there are some quiet periods, but overall very fun. The film allows Steve Carell to have the chance to shine when he steals the Jim Carrey spotlight in Bruce Almighty and Will Ferrell's "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy" in his films. Paul Rudd is cheerful as always. I love being so entertaining in these great comedies and continuing to work in Indian drama (like P.S.). I think Seth Rogen should get more work because he's so exciting talented and pilgrimage. Leslie Mann also had incredibly entertaining moments. I recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac. However, if you are easily offended, this movie is not displayed. If you are a frantic feminist, you do not see this movie. And please, no matter what, even if you think you are one of those parents' hip, do not take your children into this movie. Sure, you should let your teens go see this movie, you just do not have to watch them. It would be for some incredibly unpleasant moments.
