When I first watched The Shining, I was expecting a decent movie from what I heard about it, and I liked Stanley Kubrick's work, but when I started watching it, it was much better than I thought it was will be. Sometimes I really felt ridiculously uncomfortable and I could not take my eyes off the screen, it's still something very worrying in the movie. Now some people do not like Kubrick version of The Shining, because it's not entirely according to Stephen King's book, but in my opinion both Kubrick's version, mini-series and book are all great. Jack Nicholson gives amazing performance. If you are looking for a good original movie that you he'll think about the movies you watch The Shining.
