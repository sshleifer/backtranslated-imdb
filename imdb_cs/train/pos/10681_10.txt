While the British produced in the 1990s some fun and smooth sitcoms - Ab Fab, men who behave badly, one foot in the grave, etc. - the 1970s were a real golden age. completely exploring new territories, including the sexual revolution, feminism, and slowly developing awareness of the need for "sensitivity" that would become Political Correctness twenty years later. Attempts to confront the confusion of this thoroughly modern world were subtle and not so subtle themes in everything from the Flying Circus Monty Python to the sitcom, such as the man on the house. (By the end of the 1970s, this "guess" led to more meditative and hot sweet situations, such as the masterpiece of Butterflies.) A man about the house is a perfect example of good British times - mildly merciful, irritated, fresh, inventive, sometimes outrageous, good remarks about contemporary life. Compare it with a cynical 90th-year show like Ab Fab, and it's hard to believe they were created in the same country. The man of the house is one of the greatest British of the 1970s, right there with good neighbors (Good Life), and about the house is to split George and Mildred. Its quality shows that - as well as good neighbors - its creators, writers and many of their actors have continued to be successful on British television.
