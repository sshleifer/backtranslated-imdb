A very cute movie with great background provided by Boston and Fenway Park. As a baseball fan and addicted to the film miracle, Homerun struck me. Lots of laughter and lots of authentic baseball scenes with real gamers and true links to Bosox's past failure. And how good was watching a baseball movie without having to stand up to the supernatural, supernatural, self-defeating Kevin Costner, who is trying to get the faithful from a critical audience? Jimmy and Drew did a great job as a young loving couple suffering from Jimmy Bosox "jones". It was a bit swinging and left-handed, but they are really Sox fans who are fanatics and live in the wealth of their beloved team. The film shot at a rapid pace and the end, though predictable, had the charm and sentimentality of many other popular movies without being too demanding. <br /> <br /> It was also pleasant to return Willie Garson to the screen. I miss my favorite "Stanford Blatch" forever from Sex & the City. It's always fun, even when it says or says very little. <br /> <br /> So buy two boxes, some popcorn and get ready for fun. "Fever" is the winner.
