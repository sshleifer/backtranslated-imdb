When a plague appears in New Orleans, it's Richard Widmark to rescue Panic in the Streets, one of the lesser celebrated films by Elie Kazan. Kazan keeps pace and there are plenty of stunning scenes - the scenes between Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes that his wife plays and the scene at the police station show the family and work lives and relationships of average citizens, a sharp contrast to lives and the relationships of low lives portrayed by threatening Jack Palancem, his weak man, Zero Mostel, Tommy Cook and Louis Charles. There are also some interesting visuals - Palance has a few scenes with actors who seem to get to their knees at a height. The acting is awesome and the dialogue sharp if the story is not quite upward towards the direction and performance. It has several dubious aspects that the viewer can easily see. This is worth the attention. Kazan was a master director.
