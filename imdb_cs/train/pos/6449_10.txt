I was admitted to this film by a friend and was skeptical about the Swedish film with subtitles. I thoroughly enjoyed this beautiful film every minute. The unnecessary cruelty that one is capable of has been witnessing self-confidence without great images - although animal lovers can protect their eyes within seconds for the first 10 minutes. The traditional story of humiliation versus brutality and hope versus tragedy was illustrated by a satisfying fresh angle using the spectrum of characters with very natural defects and traits. I really liked how the film managed to address several aspects of hypocritical human behavior that are related to bias, discrimination, and sacramental pretense. The absolute jewel of the film that I support all who will listen.
