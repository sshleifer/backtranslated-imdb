In general, it is difficult to judge these cut and pasty films. Some segments may be quite good, while others may reduce overall product ratings. For example, in this scene, all-girls in the doctor's office were quite exciting ... one of the best in the audience's (restricted) viewer. Then there is the Asian segment ... the lady is always fun. And the story that connects the whole was an interesting concept. The swap scene that closes the bid is also not bad. Technically, the production values ​​are relatively high. Recommended.
