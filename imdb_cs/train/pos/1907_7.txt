8 Simple Rules is a fun show, but she also has several life lessons, especially a mature lecture on the sequel to the loss that was the episode when Paul died, the first episode I've ever seen on a show appearing on ABC. Clan Hennessy - mother Cate (Katey Sagal), daughter Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson) and son Rory (Martin Spanjers) - after the death of Paul (John Ritter), family patriarch. Cate's parents (James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette) lend a hand. I'm glad that later in the second season of this show they decided to put David Spade into this show, since he ended up with NBC's Just Shoot Me! But all and all these shows are pretty good. This show reminds me of a lot of classic family sitcoms from the 1980s and 1990s that were on ABC.
