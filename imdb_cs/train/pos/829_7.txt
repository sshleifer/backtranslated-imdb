I admit that I thought this movie would be nothing good, but soon changed my mind. The film has guessed in what direction. Pierce Broson is awesome in his role as an assailant who suddenly burns up and asks the man he met in the Mexican bar for help. Greg Kinnear is an amazing direct man, like his role as a mild husband from Denver, who starts an innocent interview with Pierce in the Mexican bar. You'll be laughing in the movie because Pierce brings funny linery (mostly about sex). Imaginary in this film is very well done, especially on the scene of bullfighting and when Pierce sees himself when he tries to finish his last job.
