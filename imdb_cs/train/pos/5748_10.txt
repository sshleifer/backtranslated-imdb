This movie was great - the emotional power of the Tom Hulce and Raya Liotta shows me tears in my eyes and the joy of my heart - this film shows us that there is still hope in the world. If this movie came out at the end of 1988, instead of Rain Man, Hulce would certainly be nominated for Oscar for Best Actor. You must definitely see!
