I do not give a movie or show ten very often, but this show has touched the nerve in a way that no other show has. I found the whole series on mysoju.com and I thought the assumption looked interesting, so I looked to see. I was not disappointed with what I saw; I was moved. This story remains on the side of the offer because the main characters move us through the scenes. Sumire Iwaya, which Koyuki looks thoughtfully, shows us human nature because she wants to have trouble showing up. Nobody really wants to put their minds ahead of perspective. Instead, he replaces the man who plays the adorable Matsumoto Jun as an animal. This animal is like any other animal we would consider to be a pet. Difference; he may be likewise punished, after all, Momo is a man, not a dog. When treated as a domestic animal, it responds to situations where the dog can respond. She spends time with her new friend, Momo is jealous. It is when she realizes that her pet is not just an animal, that the sexual tension between the two begins to be strong - Momo is a dance miracle. Her thinking slowly changes as we begin to look at our own thoughts. Matsumoto drives us from seeing the character, which is very unilateral at first, on a two-dimensional one when we see it as a dancer, on the three-dimensional nature when we see it fall for its master as a human, not as a dog. In my opinion, it is worth watching this story just to develop this character. Plus Matsumoto plays Momo with such a tenderness that he almost started wishing you too. He does not want to think about the future and how their relationship changes, but how Momo (the name that gives him as a new puppy), says? we both knew it would not be possible. Look at this open-minded show, it's worth it.
