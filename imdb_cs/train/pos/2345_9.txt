I really enjoyed the first episode and I look forward to the next. Somewhat soft on the queue of crime (it's almost an idea, and it's not very thrilling or exhausted), but she thought romance was amazingly charming. He will be sure to watch! <br /> <br /> I hope these aunts that are wonderful actresses will have a bigger role and this time they were somewhat inadequate. The actress who plays an assistant / waitress (also from Bewitched I think) is very sweet and bubble and it will be like a pretty tiny and sweet place for stupid and unpleasant, which is very nice.
