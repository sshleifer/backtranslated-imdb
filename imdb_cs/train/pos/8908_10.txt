At first I did not see "The Blob" from her 7 or 8 years and seeing her as an adult was an incredible experience. The pages could also be written about his influence on horror films. And even more could be written on his social context with 50 years of "fear of teenagers". But this simple little story about interplanetary horror is still a damn gentle scary film if you let it go. <br /> <br /> Sure, it looks like it's all right when everyone gets into our modern world. But "Blob" packs in some really scary moments when a group of children watches an unstoppable creature when the adult does not believe it. In fact, there are even some nice moments in the world of candy. And Steve McQueen gives much more than the story deserved on paper that we really caught the audience in a moment and believed in him. <br /> <br /> A summary, if you can take off your postmodern ironic filter, there is much more to look forward to.
