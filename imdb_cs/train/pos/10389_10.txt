I saw this movie when I was a child. She blew me away. That was before the days of television, and so a film of this size, could send a small child into orbit. That made me feel like I was watching this movie for twelve consecutive days. The special effects used at this time were long before. Sabu was a real joy, just like Rex Ingram as Genie. I found out that I'm singing "I want to be a sailor" a month after the film left the city. I would recommend this movie to everyone and everyone. I forgot to mention Conrad Veidta, who was like the colorful character you would ever want to meet. Also, June Duprez was never enchanting than she was in this picture. The color was excellent. Give this movie AAA!
