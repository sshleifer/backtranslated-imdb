There is no relationship between Fortier and Profiler, but the fact that both are a police series about violent crimes. Profiler looks creepy, Fortier looks classic. Profiles are very simple. Fortier's conspiracy is much more complicated ... Fortier looks more like Prime Suspect if we have to see similarities ... The main character is weak and weird but has "clairvoyance". People like to compare, decide, evaluate. And what do you like? Funny is that people who write Fortier look like Americans, but on the other hand they argue that they prefer American series (!!!). Maybe it's language or spirit, but I think this series is more English than American. By the way, the actors are really good and entertaining. The game is not superficial ...
