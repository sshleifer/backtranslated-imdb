I hear this movie was good from many of my friends who saw it, and everyone said it was amazing, so I had very high expectations - and Nancy Drew overcame these high expectations! She had fun, I enjoyed it with the action, and all the guys who were trying to kill her, and Emma Roberts was amazing like Nancy Drew. The rest of the cast was also very good. I would definitely recommend this movie! Nancy: "I wonder why the boys are trying to kill you?" Corky: "Yeah, I was wondering it was a bit of a burglary!" Nancy: "I hate trying to kill me, it's so rough!" Nancy Drew
