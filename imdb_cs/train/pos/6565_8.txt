I know film snows are snooping. But if you're looking for a surprisingly fun ride through the B-film jungle, try "Jake Speed". Sometimes thin, but its one-time and placement more than just top up for this. John Hurt (God loves him) seems to be having fun doing his role as an ultra-white white slave. The Germans from Crawfords, Jake Speed. The film adds a dimension that can only be provided by a professional such as Hurt. Crawford and Dennis Christopher (Jakes sidekick) are a good team, although you're wondering why they both get together. However, both Crawford and Christopher together have a team that is just as funny that if you can get over yourself for a moment, it may happen that you behave like a child in situations and the natural tension they provide. Karen Kopins does a great job as a girl in need who is more interested in the motives of her rescuer and her torturer. <br /> <br /> I still have to find a movie that is just as fun without going through the movie or loading the movie by trying too hard. Not every film must be the latest "Citizen Kane". And believe me, Wells was the original. So, let's remember that sometimes the movies are fun. Not a social commentary or an attempt at a political audience. Just because we are alive and live at a time when our hero lives in a celluloid dimension.
