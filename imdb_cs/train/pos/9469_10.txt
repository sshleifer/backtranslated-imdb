There is a scene in Dan in real life where the family competes to see which sex can complete the crosswords first. The answer to one of the keys is Murphy's law: everything that can go wrong is going to go wrong. That's exactly the case of Dan Burns (Steve Carell, Office), a local newspaper editor. Dan is a consultant in everyday life, yet he realizes that things are not so perfect. Dan in real life is fascinating in capturing these ironies of everyday life and is successful in receiving comedy, tragedy and beauty of all. Besides, this movie is pretty damn funny. His wife's death forces Dan to raise his three daughters on his own ... each daughter in his own key stages in life: the first anxious to try a driving license, intermediate in the adolescence phase, and the youngest one to leave the early childhood. Things are in a row behind Dan when he goes to Rhode Island for a family gathering and finds an interesting woman in a bookstore. Her name is Marie (Juliette Binoche, Chocolat), and she's looking for a book to help her avoid the unpleasant situations ... which is exactly what's in store when they get into the Burns family home. If you've seen Steve Carell in the Office or Little Miss Sunshine, I know it's incomparable with comic timing and a very dynamic actor. Steve Carell is amazing in capturing all the emotions that come with family life: frustration and sincere compassion. The family and the house itself provide a warm environment for a film that contrasts with the inner confusion that builds throughout the film and eventually explodes in a totally exciting climax. The film is only short in some predictable results, but at the same time, life is both ironic and predictable: it is ironic in itself. <br /> <br /> Dan in real life is definitely worth seeing, for the only experience of watching all the funny subtleties that we often lack in everyday life and most likely I enjoy it a second time or even a third. Just "put it on my bookmark."
