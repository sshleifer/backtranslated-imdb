If your thoughts on the thriller of car racing, blasts and dozens of people are shooting, then "house of the game" is definitely not the film for you. If you like and appreciate psychological drama and tension, then you can see it. <br /> <br /> "House of Games" tells the story of a respected psychologist and writer Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse), who tries to help the patient and engage in the shadowy world of people who lead the charismatic Mike (Joe Mantegna). To say something more about the conspiracy would destroy the tension. Frankly, it's hard for me to believe someone who says they see how the twists and turns are coming. Like a noble artist, this movie attracts you to your site and attracts your vigilance. The story is tense and well-done, dialogue clever and laconic, it is equally well (Mantegna is greatly charismatic). Some have complained that Doctor Ford is not very sympathetic in nature and wondered why Mamet causes Lindsay Crouse to look so physically unattractive. But Doctor Ford should be cool and overwhelmed; Moreover, her honesty is an essential part of the conspiracy (at some point, I believe that the damage to her sexual self-confidence is a key part of her motivation ... I'm not saying). <br /> <br /> "House of Games" is a dark look at the underside of human nature, ending on an inconvenient ambiguity. Every second will keep you alert while you watch and stay with you long after.
