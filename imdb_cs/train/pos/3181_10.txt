I had the opportunity to watch this film debut at Appalachian Film, where she won the Best Picture Award. This movie is great done, with an excellent cast that works well as a set. My favorite performances were by Youssef Kerkir, Justin Lane and Adam Jones. There are also some great effects with dragonflies and cockroaches, which surprised me when I discovered that this film was made with a small budget. Writer-director Adam Jones, who in my opinion also won the award for his writing, does a great job in the direction. Viewers loved this movie. Cross Eyed smiles you in the whole movie. Surely he must see.
