LOVE AT THE TOP - the completely wrong American title for the superb French film "Le Mouton Enrage" (meaning, I think, Rabid Sheep) - is such an original film, the fact that dates back to 1974, seems all the more stunning. This film was long before; even according to today's highest standards, it achieves things that seem rich and new. Filmed by immensely underestimated director Michel Devil, it rather opposes the description in that it combines social criticism, comedy, mystery, love, sex, and satire into one completely original mix-leaving a great but subtle surprise-is suddenly sad and comprehensible. Cast is beautiful as well as writing and theme. But it's Deville's delicious tone that keeps you in balance, but it attracts you, making this "lost" movie really evolving to a very high level. (A written conversation with the director about the "Special Functions" section of the DVD is definitely worth reading if you have time.)
