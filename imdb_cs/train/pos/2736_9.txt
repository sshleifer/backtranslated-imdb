Unique movie ... one of the best of all time. Acting, screenplay, Quincy Jones scores, cinematography, editing, etc. - just fantastic. As most viewers know, this film is based on a book by Truman Capote about the famous murder of a family house in Kansas (disorder) by several young people during a bad robbery. I have never seen a movie that has transformed such a wonderful story into a riveting movie. <br /> <br /> The actors are absolutely solid, but they focus on the murderers, Dick and Perry and the team that is pushing them. Scott Wilson, like Dick Hickock, is amazing. Cocktail, disturbed and without sympathy, finds it so charming, greasy and credible. Robert Blake as Perry Smith is exceptional - lonely and at the same time empathic and cold-blooded. Who could compose these properties into one individual and get him to buy it? He does it and it's great! The key point of the book is how it came to penetration of these two very different sociopathic individuals to create a critical mass to commit such a stupid and angry crime, and these two actors do it beautifully. Both had moments in their subsequent career, but these performances are high water marks, and that means the acting period. <br /> <br /> The cops are great too. The investigator is John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are also great. Unlike current movies, where producers find it necessary to provide the police with superhuman wealth or weakness, they are just true beings, they work with determination and competencies. They look so real. I have never seen policemen on screen so strong in their authenticity; and I saw most of the criminal classics go back. In this respect, it is truly unique. <br /> <br /> PARTIAL SPOILER COMING (This movie is unique in that you already know what happened but I alert you to the record). <br /> <br /> The best scenes of the finest criminal performances and movies are, of course, testimonies - intellectual fencing between police and cheaters, Mano and Mano. This movie has its hands down the best questioning scene you've ever seen on the movie. Watch Dick and Perry try to slip and run slowly without realizing that the police have the goods on them. But police officers need to skillfully prepare their suspects to break their alibi and hope they cause conflicts. These are some of the best games you've ever seen. Think of Glengarry Glen Ross without showboating. <br /> <br /> Helps translate the sad and terrible angles of this true story, ICB was filmed in a real Clutter house, and I've heard that students are playing a mess to give them a real feel. It works. They look like decent, simple people. The crime is so tangible and sad. <br /> <br /> I will stop here. It's not a good movie, but it's one of the best movies ever shot and so unique, it's a must-watch every movie.
