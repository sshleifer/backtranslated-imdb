Since I first saw it in the theater, it was my favorite. Since then, I've seen it countless times, and it never tortures me. The setting has a lot to do with it (Colorado I know it would be jealous), but the story is original and I liked how the heroes used small mountain people. There was no film I could compare. John Lithgow plays an intelligent villain, but he likes being totally out of his element - he has to watch Tucker, and that's what amazes him. This is an action movie in the best place. I do not think I'll see another one that's so funny. <br /> <br /> You do not need 50,000 rounds to qualify as an action movie. He just has to be fascinated, not shocked.
