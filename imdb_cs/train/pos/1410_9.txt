EARTH (2009) *** 1/2 The Big Screen adaptation of the BBC / Discovery Channel series "Planet Earth" offers a fairly majestic sampling of nature in its beauty with some really jaw-dropping moments "how the hell got this record?!" the amazing scenes of animals in their natural habitat, and the environmental message from the circle of life can be cruel (witnessing the Great White Shark that collects the walnut seal as a fast food!) and adorable (various children and their rent). Basso profundo tones of narrator James Earl Jones consolidate his "eyes of God's eye" and deepness. From literally hundreds of hours of footage, the only problem is that it should be in IMAX format and it could be even longer! Well, it's always the next time (since Disney Studios produced this number for another series). Parts: Alastair Fothergill & Mark Linfield.
