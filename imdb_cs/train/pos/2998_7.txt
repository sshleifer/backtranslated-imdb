He enjoyed viewing this movie on TCM and watched very young William Powell (Philo Vance) play the detective just as he did with Myrna Loy in the series "Thin Man Series". In the 1930s, William Powell starred in the Philo Vance series, and in this photo, famous veteran Mary Astor (Hilda Lake) became one of the suspects in a murder / suicide where Archer Coe (Robert Barrot) was found dead and Archer was in a room that was recessed from the inside. Ralph Morgan (Raymond Wrede / Archer's secretary) provided a great supporting role and was brother Frank Morgan, who appeared "In The Sorcerer of Oz" 1939. Eugene Palette (Detective Sgt. Heath) appeared in several of these Philo Vance films and also did great performance at "Robin Hood" with Errol Flynn. Always remember the least likely that an actor could be a very murderer. Enjoy the great classics of the past.
