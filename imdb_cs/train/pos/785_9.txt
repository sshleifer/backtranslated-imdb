I was of Irish origin, loved this film, was not only that hot and funny, he was also sincere and sincere. I loved the girl he fell in love with, she was pretty. They were such a cute couple. The end was so sad. Love this movie! Although it is a bit dirty, it reminds the British or Irish version of Prime. If you liked this movie, you should watch what is best. The same story a young boy falls for older women, older women are falling on a young man. Lots of paths cross, eventually decided the best or the task is completed. I have nothing to say without destroying the whole movie, yet I thought the French guy was ugly and less like me. Umm ... if you like Irish movies, I recommend "Circle of Friends", the movie is so good. Quick quotation, maybe you will not, if you do not watch "well, that's my dinner destroyed." LOL
