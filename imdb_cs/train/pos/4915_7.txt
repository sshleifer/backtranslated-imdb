And rather an unexpected plot of plot - for this era: there is a plague in New Orleans - and only Richard Widmark can stop it! The secrets of Elie Kazan: water areas, working men, crowds, refugees, blue collar people, street violence - here are presented. Jack Palance is quite effective as a glacial gangster big score, Zero Mostel as Dom Delouise a little miskast but certainly observable as his go-fer. Barbara Bel Geddes liked me like a crazy, cool woman - I thought she and Widmark were a credible couple. He himself reminds me of somewhat Sinatru - face and in a very quiet way - and that is kind of a compliment. I've never heard of this movie and yes, you have to imagine Widmara's performance. I also enjoyed Paul Douglas - he seemed to play this role many times, making an unlikely but effective team. Mor is McGuffin himself - and you have to know it's not exactly the way it's been in real life - somewhat small scale in the least? - but I found it was pretty nice. <br /> <br /> Look at this. It's good. *** z ****
