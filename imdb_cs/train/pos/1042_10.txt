The American woman, her European husband and children, return to their mother's home in "The Rhine Hour," a 1943 film based on Lillian Hellman, and Paul Lukas's lead role (I think he repeats the acting role here), Bette Davis, Lucile Watson, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Donald Woods. An anti-fascist, a worker in an underground movement, often wounded and wanted by the Nazis, Kurt Muller (Lukas) needs a long vacation at the estate of his rich mother-in-law. But he finds out that there is really no escape because one of the guests (Coulouris) is suspicious of his true identity and more than willing to sell it. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there are great performances that Lillian Hellman should think liberally. It was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time she was released, because war and what happened to people from other countries hit the safe American home. Today, the film is a big controversy that Paul Lukas won the Oscar for Humphreya Bogart in Casablanca. Humphrey Bogart was a wonderful screenwriter and fabulous Rick, but Lukas is transcendent like Kurt. A monologue who has the need to kill is nasty just to mention one scene. Although this is not what we think of as Bette Davis's film, Kurt's loyal and dear wife, Sara, gives a masterful performance here. Her acting is in the heart and the love scene between Kurt and Sarah is beautiful and tender. The last half hour of the film had me in tears with the integrity of emotions. Lillian Hellman is not every cup of tea, but unlike "The Little Foxes," she wrote some really nice, gorgeous characters and a great story that won the Warner Brothers award. Highly recommended.
