The brutally depressing scenario and some subtle low-key performances by Petra Strauss and Pamela Reed and some good filming in Ohio drive this great television movie on hard times in a rumble. As the mills close and the workplace in the trade union disappears, all workers are at risk of blue collar workers: leaders, owners, their wives and children. Strauss is completely credible in her role, and Pamela Reed is, as always, awesome. Find out if you know John Goodman before he lifts weight. Heavy metal score - Was it someone who did the game? - is occasionally nasty, but Frank Stanley's cinematography is discarded, especially the mill scenes.
