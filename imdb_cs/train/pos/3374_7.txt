"Soylent Green" is one of the best and most disturbing science-fiction films of the 1970s and still very convincing today's standards. Although flawed and a little dated, the apocalyptic touch and environmental premise (typical of that time) still feels very disturbing and provocative. The quality of this film overcomes most of the current SF flicks due to its strong cast and intense sequences that I personally consider to be classic. New York from 2022 is a depressing place where he lives, with over half of the population, unemployment, unhealthy climate, and the overall shortage of every major food product. The only available form is synthetic and distributed by Soylent. Charlton Heston (in great form) plays a policeman investigating the murder of one of Soylent's leading executives and encounters scandals and a dark secret ... Scenario is sometimes a bit sentimental and climax does not really come as a great surprise, the atmosphere is still tense and strange. The series of rebellion is really exhausting and one of the most deadly moments in the 1970s cinema. Edward G. Robinson has recently been impressive in his last role, and Joseph Cotton ("Baron Blood", "The Abominable Dr. Phibes") has a great (but too modest) supporting role. This is science-fiction in my book: the scary and inevitable intersection of mankind! No fantasy spacecraft with hairy monsters that attack our planet.
