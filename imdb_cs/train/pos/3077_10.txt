I missed the whole season and started watching it on the ABC site in the summer of 2007. I'm absolutely crazy about the show. I think the whole cast is excellent. It's one of my favorite performances at all. I just checked ABC for this autumn and I did not see it as planned. That's really sad. I hope they bring her back ... maybe they wait for Bridget Moynahan to have a baby? Or is it just my wish? <br /> <br /> I read some of the commentary on the show and I saw so many bright notes like me. I certainly hope ABC will reconsider its decision or hope that the next station will pick it up.
