I first thought LoG at random one night while I was waking up on television: ever since, I've never missed an episode. It's humor is very weird, like the cross between the social commentary Brass Eye, the fast show is excellent single-liners, and the amazing plot that seems to be developing every week without going anywhere anywhere. The best example was the strange Hillary Briss - what was it all about? <br /> <br /> Humor will not please everyone. Some will say that it is too ill and it is easy to see where they come from. Try it. If you do not like it, do not look, but if you like it, you will be glad to have advised me.
