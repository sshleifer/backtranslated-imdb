The question of whether or not you like this movie version of "Ghost Train" depends on one thing and one thing: on your reaction to the performance of Arthur Askey. It tends to steal almost every scene in which it is and not always good. Sometimes you would like to settle down or just come back a bit to allow lots of character characters to plot and develop (which they do to a certain extent). But somehow it still points to Askey's character, Tommy Gander. <br /> <br /> I personally like the movie and even as Askey to a large extent. I always seem to have plagued it in the morning of the morning when I can not sleep and really can not find the energy to watch something else. There's something to watch old black and white films in a quiet dark before dawn that I find attractive ...
