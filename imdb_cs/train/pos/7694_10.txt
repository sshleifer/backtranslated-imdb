I would like to know why John Amos left the show and how he died again from the show? I could not concentrate on everything, but sometimes she got home with the problems she faced. By the way, did they ever get it out of the ghetto? I think an episode of black Jesus was my favorite. We have to see them experience some good times. something they did not do too often. I wish they could bring the show. During the day, people can really keep watch. I do not think the movie or the new show will work. Especially without the original cast. They are really what Good Times did Goodtime. These are my questions and remarks. Thank you!!
