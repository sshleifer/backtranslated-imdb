Lin McAdam (James Stewart) wins the rifle, Winchester in the shooting competition. Ghost Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) is a bad loser and steals a gun. Lin takes his horse and goes to the Dutchman and his men and rifle with his friend High Spade (Millard Mitchell). The lion gets into different hands on the way. Will he return to the right owner? Anthony Mann and James Stewart collaborated for the first time and came up with this masterpiece, Winchester '73 (1950). Stewart is the right man to play in the lead. He was always the right person to do anything. Amazing Shelley Winters plays part of Lola Manners and she is great as always.Dan Durya is awesome in Waco Johnnie Dean.Charles Drake is brilliant as Lola's cowardly friend Steve Miller.Also Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson are seen in the movie, and they are played by Will Geer and Steve Darrell. Young Rock Hudson plays Young Bull and young Anthony (Tony) Curtis plays Doan.There are many classic moments in this movie. At one point the group is surrounded by Indians because it is western. It's great to watch this survival game, where the fastest draw and sharpest shooter are the winner. All true fans from the West love this movie.
