Cross-eyed is a very original and fun movie. I think Adam Jones brings a refreshing new set of eyes to the comedy genre and really re-shapes it. This movie is clever, concise and always fun and entertaining. As a writer / director, Jones has complete control over his characters, who are both absurd and nice. The story is definitely something you have not seen before, which is good. It's unique and fun and can work in visually fantastic elements as well as the long lost genre of melodies together to create a hearty comedy. Very promising first movie.
