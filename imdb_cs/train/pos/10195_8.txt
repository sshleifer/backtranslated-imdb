Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who are often better than his material and almost always under price. He was either tough or heroic in tons of films, and he has the type of strong and solid presence Wallace Beery has done half a century before. Baker can deliver material that sounds ridiculous when he comes out of another actor, and that's what's so great about him. It seems that means what he says, no matter how clich√©, obvious or stupid, that connects him with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. This has caused the WALKING TALL Trilogy to work so well, and the same spell is here in FINAL JUSTICE. In the 1980s, it was a major hit in theaters and video and it was much better than many of the better-known action moves of the time. Moving events from Texas to Europe has a real timeless quality that will not get you out of action on the screen. To be honest, I always enjoyed the films of Greydan Clark, who is not a nonsensical director in the same spirit as the 1970s Clint Eastwood, and this is one of his best. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the lost gems of the late 1980s, just like MAN ON FIRE in its real sand and violence. I suppose if they did it with The Rock, a whole new audience would love it just like me.
