Producer Joel Schumacher, who also directed the 02 telephone booth and many other great movies, showed that no one can really be trained to be a killing machine without destroying their own personalities and real fears that one has to face when going to COMBAT ! Colin Farrell (Roland Bozz), "Intermission", "03, gave one of his best performances and in fact his whole image on his back." Matthew Davis (Jim Paxton), "Blue Crush," 02, Whigham (Pvt.Wilson), "All The Real Girls", 03, showed her real acting skills in the role,. There were two short scenes where soldiers could find a short romantic holiday in the local city and had to pay for their love and sexual desires. One military veteran instructor from Vietnam told soldiers how to actually torture the enemy using electric wires in all the bad places on the human body. Comfortable and fun movie to view.
