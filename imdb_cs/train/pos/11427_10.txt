I loved this film, because in my mind it seemed that it was so perfect to capture what I imagined in French colonial Africa, it had to be just like in the 1950s ("my" generation). But I was really enchanted by his quiet stimulation and the glorious end. During the last 5 minutes of this movie, you have to focus on what's going on. I was never more impressed by the fact that the film "wrapped". I remember crying "wow!" when I realized it was over. On the other hand my two daughters fell on the couch!
