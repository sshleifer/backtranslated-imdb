I have never seen four hours as fast as I saw this movie. This film recreates the power and art that Hamlet always wanted to have. Even those famous speeches are made in new and inventive ways. And cast is incredible, Brannagh the brightest star. It's his charisma, the power and the role control that defines the movie. Because it is a full and complete version, it fills in so many holes and allows a new evaluation of the tragedy despite its length. Where one would expect a dark, gloomy clich√© castle, we were treated to a rich feast for the eyes. The only gloom comes from Hamlet itself. It's worth it, all four hours.
