I suppose I've always felt the Hotel du Nord is studiously bound, the movement of cars and cameras was effortlessly smooth and scenic to be shot on the spot. But no problem - it's still a lot of undervalued composition by Marcel Carne. The conspiracy seems to be a bit shaky sometimes, as if it did, but because it is unpredictable, it keeps an eye on the bitter end. Money, when two lovers are lonely in their room, are populated by a somewhat cramped conversation, but it is so beautiful that it falls into any incurability, it can be accepted. Are these two young people a symbol of cancer hopelessness in pre-war France or just idiots? Suicide pacts are fairly common; if suicides are young and healthy and their lives in front of them are insignificant, do you think anything other than just being misguided fools? Arletta played a good prostitute - she kept busy in every case on her dress! I've seen only a few Jouvete movies - it's the most impressive invention as a pimp in HDN - my problem is shallow: every time I see his face I think of Sonny Hale in Evergreen! <br /> <br /> And a remarkably atmospheric, well-worked and photographed film with so many stories, needs a few insights to put it all in place. Annabella and Aumont created an exceptionally beautiful couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his second film had a small entertaining role as a homosexual. Everything in all: wonderful.
