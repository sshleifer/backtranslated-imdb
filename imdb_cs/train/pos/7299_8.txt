A bad cast, a creepy scenario full of holes, a hot blonde is alive alive, a bad scientist has a bad ugly mustache, one person gets a platoon of trained shooter and wins the winner, terrible special effects, fix the problem by blowing his head off the monster ... Amazing. All that was missing was the unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the murders. Ha-Ha. Good effort, full of predictable twists and ridiculous packs. I liked this movie very much, but before you look, make sure you're in good laughter. I recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so seriously. I can not, in my opinion, think that this film was meant for people to take it seriously. However, if you can watch it and sit down and enjoy yourself, I really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was intended for use. Very simply. So a little popcorn and a few beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie. I brought some joy to my life.
