I know a lot of people do not like this movie, but I think it's adorable. There is not much I can say, but the movie is a good movie I think. The pics are beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the voices are beautiful, and there are lots of funny lines in the movie, especially when Briggitta learns what they are doing and what they do. If you like musicals, I think you'd like that!
