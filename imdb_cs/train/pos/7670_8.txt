I really liked "Dr. Mordrid". It's a low-budget movie that may be for some, but I have no problem with it. I admire it even more, because it's much more fun than the one that Hollywood scrubs every year. It was a shame that this was not a theatrical release; I do not know about any other, but I would like to see him in the theaters. "Doctor Mordrid" is a very entertaining science-fiction movie that boasts everyone, especially if they are in science fiction like me. I do not understand why these are R rated movies; only one f-word is said, and there are no shrink death scenes, no blood at all. The timeless rivalry between the wizards Anton and Kabbalah (Anton wanted to use his power to save the human race while Kabal wanted to enslave them), gave the story a sense of enchantment, while the mythic plotline added the magic of the story itself. Basically, it's a movie that's just fun. In this movie, however, one is unintentionally fun: seeing Jeffrey Combs holding a straight face while wearing the silly blue coat and suit. It makes me laugh every time I see it. But I turn ... By the way, acting is great; the main heroes (Anton and his friend, Samantha) are very nice; Anton is sympathetic and hospitable, and Samantha is friendly. Additionally, the setting was awesome. The floating island in the second dimension was very cold; We only got a double look at it; it would be great to see other scenes here. The main settings were also very clean; Anton's apartment is very spacious and has several great facilities, especially a monitoring system, which he uses to monitor the world's occurrences. He even has a nest he holds in his apartment called Edgar. Overall, it's a great movie; it was fun to watch and the main actors put a lot of feelings into their roles. If you can find anywhere that you rent "Dr. Mordrid", you should rent it (or in my case buy it was definitely carefully spent money)! <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 out of 10. <br /> <br />
