Since it's been a few years since I reviewed this classic, I decided to go back and re-evaluate her more in the department, but first some confidential comments from the film critic. This animated series is one of those that I grew up with making my childhood happy, it was amazing, I miss some of these things today that we clearly do not see as much as we did in the past,> <br /> Talespin or Luftens Helte, named in Denmark, is a great animated series, it's like a chip and a lot, ducks and a lot of old ones, so it has the weird feeling that surrounds it, I can not forget this series just like I want to remember it . But, in my opinion, it was great, it came with some kind of message, not with the wildness of the news, but it is one of it to be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Now I do not want to sound old or anything else but feel like time slipping out of my hands with these cartoons, today we see something like Ed E dd and Eddy or something weird, we all have these new or almost new performances such as Hannah Montana or something like that, but I feel we do not have the same spirit in cartoons or real ideas as we did in the early days. <br /> <br /> Now maybe I'm wrong, but I feel that time has changed a lot to decide that I would be thrilled that these series like Talespin will be re-published on the television screen instead of all the new ones, give me my children's cartoons, give them the kids I have a day to give them again ...
