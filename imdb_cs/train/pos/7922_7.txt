In this broadcast of horror films, paranoji of the 50th Cold War, America's Reagan era and college films, Adam Arkin plays Tony, the star quarterback Full Moon High in the 1950s. He and his father (Ed McMahon) travel to Communist Romania, and while he is lost in the streets one night, a werewolf is given him. When he returns to the side, he can not control animal desires and continues killing. Frustrated, the city has fallen. Ten years later, the immortal Tony returns to the city and registers again at high school. He still can not control his transformations, urban people and his friends realize that he is not entirely human. Everything culminates during the big football games of the schools. <br /> <br /> I expected it to be one of those movies "so bad that's good" since the early 1980s. But I was surprised that the movie was really fun. The cast, including Kenneth Mars as a perverse coach, Race Kelly as Tony's delicious former flame, Demon Wilson as a bus driver and Alan Arkin as a courageous doctor, will all go out with cheerful results. <br /> <br /> When watching this movie, I was amazed at how similar font and humor were on the "Family Guy". "Full Moon High" has the same attitude and never to take seriously.
