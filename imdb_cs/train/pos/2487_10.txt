I have to say that looking at Hamlet from a student's point of view, Brannagh's version of Hamlet is by far the best. His determination to remain in line with the original text should be delighted. It helps to revive the game on the screen and makes it easier for people to keep track of the text as we did when studying, watching and analyzing text. One of the things I've heard many times criticized is casting the main Hollywood names in the game. I find that it helps the audience to recognize the characters easier, unlike that actors who all look and sound the same way as they help in the confusion that is usually associated with Shakespeare. Also, its flashes help to eradicate many ambiguities in the text. For example, how far the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia really went and why Fortinbras finally met the castle at the end. Overall, this release includes not only the great performances of actors who are known and Shakespeare are not familiar. It is so that you do not have to be Ph.D. English literature to understand and enjoy it.
