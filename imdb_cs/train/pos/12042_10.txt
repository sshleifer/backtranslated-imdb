........... like I was when I saw this movie) Never will this movie never appear, not because it's a bad movie but because it made me so horrified! As I said, I was 14 when my English teacher decided to show us; The reason is that we have read the extract from the book. All the girls in my class were TERRIFIED when a black woman walks through the window and sails over Kidd's bed, though, just before it's something that scared us, which was when Kidd found a toy under the pillow and he heard a child's voice say " it's for you ". The scene still haunts me until today, almost 7 years after I saw the movie. If you are easily afraid, avoid this movie !!!!!!!!
