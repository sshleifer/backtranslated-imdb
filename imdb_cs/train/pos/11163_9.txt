I love this movie for free! Walsh is a true master of cinematographic form, and his film has sometimes been overlooked in my view. But this movie is my favorite, because it really makes sense when the movie was deployed. <br /> <br /> All the beautiful characters that existed, lifestyle, way of dressing, way they talked, fine could be exaggerated, but it is good to know that there was an opportunity when two men tried to overcome each other with crazy pieces. I just felt that it was part of history that should be that I realized it because I noticed it. <br /> <br /> Can I get it somewhere on DVD? I just saw it on TV. But for anyone who wants a movie about this time, it's the perfect one.
