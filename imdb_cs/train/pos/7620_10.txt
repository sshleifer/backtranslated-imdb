Lost is the best TV series here. First of all, he has great actors and gorgeous overhead. Writing is a very controversial issue, because in the first two seasons writing was exceptional, but after Season 3 writing became very complex. , who is Jacob? Why are polar bears on the island? What is the fog? How did the island disappear? Who is Richard Alpert? Many people think writers are lost and they have raised a lot of questions and secrets that they can not explain. I believe these people are bad. I have confidence in the writer. I think if the secrets reveal ever since, all the magic of the series will be gone. In any case, the lost is undoubtedly the biggest TV series and it will continue for a long time.
