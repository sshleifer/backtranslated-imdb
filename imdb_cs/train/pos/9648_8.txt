I enjoyed this movie very much. The story goes relatively little and is not easy to follow. There is no solution to this story and you are interested in what really happened. Since I like such a movie, I enjoyed it. I especially like the dating scenario between the boys and I was drawn into their lives. And, of course, every naked Staphane Rideau movie gets a few more points. ;-)
