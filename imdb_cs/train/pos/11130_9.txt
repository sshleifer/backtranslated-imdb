Jon Voight is great at Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, although recalling his later reversal in Rainman, is a performance that keeps me watching movies. As a portrait of the character of New York, only Daniel Day Lewis's portrayal of Billy Butcher in Gangs of New York recalls comparable and Den does not give his character the emotional depth that Hoffman gives to Ratso. <br /> <br /> It's typical of Hoffman's way of acting that the actor we most identify with Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of the film while playing people around him in a way that increases their performance well above their normal levels. <br /> <br /> Voight's Buck is so naive that he's floating out of the movie, except Ratso pulls him down - pulls him away, but also teaches him, a lot about how to survive, and more importantly how live. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy is an escape film that will turn into a movie about self-seeking. I think it's like a sandy movie, it's got a very beautiful message that no matter how much you could be lost (Ratso clearly defines the "loser") if you can find a way to be true to yourself, You are in possession of the secrets of life and you can even share this view with someone else. <br /> <br /> I can not help to compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute, a few years later, which I think is more like a movie about being in a movie about escape.
