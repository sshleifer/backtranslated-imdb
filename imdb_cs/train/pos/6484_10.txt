I remember watching it in the 1970s - then I recently borrowed a few episodes from our public library. At almost a 30-year break, I came to the next conclusion. Most of the interviewers in this series - some in the center of power, such as Traudl Junge (Hitler's secretary), Karl Doenitz (German Navy) Anthony Eden (Great Britain) - are long gone, but their first-hand accounts will live. General and Admiral Sergeants, Russian Civilians, Concentration Camp Rescuers are all records. <br /> <br /> I remember an interview with Lord Mountbatten (killed in the 1970s) <br /> <br /> This is truly a gem and I believe that the producer of this series has been awarded for this work by Queen Elizabeth - deserves it. <br /> <br /> When I see these few episodes from the library, I want to buy the kit. <br /> <br /> This is the only "10" I've seen, but I've been discovered as a fine bottle of wine, with a little more time ...
