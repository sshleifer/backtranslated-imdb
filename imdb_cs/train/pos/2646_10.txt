I think most people do not seem to have the right idea about the movie, at least that's my opinion. I'm not sure it's a movie about drug abuse; it is rather a film about the way of thinking of those genius brothers, drugs are side effects, something marginal. Again, it's not the commercial movie you see every day, and if the author wanted it, it's definitely failed because most people think it's one of many drug-related movies. But I think there is something else. As in many films displaying different cultures, the audience usually fully understands movies that show their own culture, ie something you've grown and who are quite familiar with. This movie is to show what people "genius" people often think and what problems they face. The reason they behave like this is that their minds are bored :) They have to meet people who do bad things and take these things as if they were launching a space shuttle every day. They begin to work rather hard and excel in no time. I feel it - I went to work, did nothing, still twice as good as the boys around me when they were all in their projects what to do now with my free time. And what's more boring? When you can begin to predict behavior not because you are a psychologist, but instead because you have seen this formula in the past. So, for one thing, it is difficult for them to work, which is sometimes quite boring and starting to understand the behavior of the other. It's a recipe for a great boredom. And the saddest things are usually done to get out of this state. They wanted earlier, who mentioned that their biggest problem is that they are trying to orientate life from logical point of view (mathematics describes logic), while life is not really a logical thing, it is absolutely true.
