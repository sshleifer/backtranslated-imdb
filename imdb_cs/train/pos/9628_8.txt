Some of my favorite films, Laurel and Hardy, have very little, very little conspiracy. Instead, they give them a fairly mundane situation and let them be cheerful! Movies such as HELP MATES and BUSY BODIES are among the most fun, as you can see boys working or cleaning the house. Here at DIRTY WORK, most of the film is similar to the other two films - Stan and Ollie are cominovers and spend most of the movie trying (quite unsuccessfully) to clean the mad professor's chimney. When we see that Ollie goes through the chimney, the boys who make the house a complete mess and Stanley's bad behavior all work together to create a very nice movie. However, in a slight twist, there is also a really weird subplot that begins and ends the film. The professor seems to be a really crazy scientist and is working on making things younger. Later in the movie you can see that the duck is going to the duckling and even the ducks in the egg! Because he leaves the boy alone in the room, is he surprised what will happen next? While this subplot was useless, it worked well. What worked extremely well was the central part. Give the boys what to do, and you'll be surprised that it's strange results. One of the better movies of the team and almost gained 9.
