It must be one of the most beautiful, moving, thought-provoking films. It's a good family fun and at the same time thinks about what it is about. Every time I see that "the spirit of Zacus rides a bicycle through the puddle at the end, I can not help but scream my eyes." John Thaw's performance is so touchy and it's a shame he's not with us anymore. Excellent movie.
