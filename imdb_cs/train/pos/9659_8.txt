"Presque Rien" is a beautiful portrait of the experience of a young French homosexual. By omitting both stereotypes and sermons, it is a beautiful naturalistic film that works great, made with feelings for the seaside town where the action takes place, never melodramatic, but often painfully real. If anything is realistic, because there is little in the way of a conventional conspiracy, just scenes of life. But the absence of conventional dramatic tensions counts less than it could be in a world so gently drawn. "Presque Rien" may not be the most interesting film ever shot; but its ordinary humanism works well in comparison with pre-conceived festive or fake opinions that often refer to the treatment of this subject. It's a lot of watches.
