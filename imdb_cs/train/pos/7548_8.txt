Short, but long enough, Cat Soup is a very wild race. One day I searched the anime section on demand and found out that I was looking at it. I spent all the time basically sitting with my face agape. All of a sudden I was either empty thought or a fleeting one who shouted "turn it off!". But I do not. And in fact, I'm glad I did. Animation is stunning. Very artistic, strange and dark. I personally loved him for amazing animation, but the seemingly empty story behind him is equally necessary for me. Young boy - well, cat - he is looking for the soul of his sister. In the first part she is sick in bed, and soon she will pay a visit to some gloomy rider. Her soul is divided in half. One is recovered by a baby boy while the other half is lost. Then the rest of the film is lightly lost, honestly. I expect them to come back and their world is ... maybe they're slowly falling apart? Perhaps the absence of the soul is the answer to the fact that the rest of the film contains different phases from which the world is turned on. First there is a huge flood, and then it flows into a gloomy desert and then it freezes (thanks to either God or fate, as you will see). Then I believe they will find the soul of the sisters in the form of orange blossoms. Then the whole world disappears. Haha, he did not do it, but he still sends me trembling behind his spine. In spite of seemingly random scenes, I'm sure this will be a deeper message if you look at it enough and do some research. Personally, I like trippy things like this, and I'd like to spend the time doing it just to understand. But for some people it's probably not their cup of tea. It looks very unsettling, so if you like your direct anime, it's not a movie for you. If you have an open mind, I recommend this movie.
