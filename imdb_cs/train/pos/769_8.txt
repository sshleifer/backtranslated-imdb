Of all breakdancing / hip-hop movies that were released between 1983 and 1986, the 1984 Beat Street movie is undoubtedly the best. The story follows a DJ, his younger breakdancing brother, a graffiti artist, and a promoter who wants to be a showbiz during one winter in which he tries to come out of the ghetto with his "street" talent. The performance is not always balanced and the characters are not completely exhausted, but they are more than offset by a down-to-earth dialogue, a credible story, fantastic dance sequences, and a timeless hip-hop soundtrack. It should be noted that this film was shot at the birthplace of breakdancing ("It's not about New York, that's the Bronx!") And there are breakdancing fathers, rock band Steady Crew and rapper Africa Bambaat. Rock Steady Crew provides the best scene in the movie when they control the dance battle of Roxy's premiere breakdancing club in the early 80's. It must be seen for lovers of hip-hop.
