The cute little episode played mainly for laughter, but with a clever deep veil. Somehow the Martian got aboard a broken bus on his way to nowhere, but who is a passenger (talk about your illegal immigrants!). Starring a supporting actress, from Jack Elam's wild eye (seamlessly to him), sexy Jean Willes (if it's Martian, then I say, let's open the boundary!), To the cruel John Hoyt (the most obvious suspect)), along with the familiar faces of John Archer and Barney Phillips (and a nice turn from Bill Kendis as a bus driver). It's done in a very fun half-hour, even if the action is limited to one set.
