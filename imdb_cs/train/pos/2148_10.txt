I always look forward to this film when it's on TV. I have to get a DVD. The range of different types of people is great. He tells me that someone can be a dancer if they try hard enough. My favorite character must be Mr. Achi. It's so special, but full of emotions. It's a perfect movie with wonderful dances. Unfortunately, we will never get a chance to see them going to Blackpool. It would be a perfect follow-up if it should. But I think it leaves it to your imagination what could have happened. <br /> <br /> A very simple and innocent story. He remains faithful to his wife and daughter. I did not see the Hollywood remake. I do not know if I want to. I really do not like Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere is more in line with the original than Lopez. I feel that the remake is not so simple and innocent.
