This film has surpassed my expectations. I thought, and I heard that it would be litter, so I did not expect much. But I was pleasantly surprised. At first I did not get to the leading girl and did not care if she lived or died. After a while, she grew strong enough for me to become a nice figure. It's not just a movie that dies because people do not die. There is a story that takes only a few seconds after the film, but it explains a lot. I would recommend this movie to everyone. If you are not sure, just watch it, it's only an hour and a half of your life. You will live 80 years.
