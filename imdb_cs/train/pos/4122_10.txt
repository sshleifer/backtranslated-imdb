I would definitely want to see the resurrection of the Seahunt series with the technotics they have today that would bring me a thrill of a child. I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt and Gunsmoke were my hero every week. You have my voice for the return of new hunting at sea. We need to change the pace on TV and it would work for the underwater world of adventure. By the way, thank you for such a shop that sees many views on television and many movies. So any way I think I have what I want to say. It would be nice to read a few plus points on hunting at sea. If my rhymes were 10 rows, you would let me obey or let me be in doubt and let me leave. If so, then I have to go let it do it.
