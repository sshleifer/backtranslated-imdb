When you read the summary of this film, you can think it is something special and in some respects it is the primary nature of this film, Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbé), to see and hallucinate. The belief Gerard sees are all (more or less) gentle indications of what happens to him, as the story goes on, and the viewer is very entertaining to try to read the symbolism used in the film. Despite the use of symbolism and a few breaths at the end of the film, the film retains a very high level of excitement and is bored for one minute. This is due in particular to the great performances of Jeroen Krabbe and Renée Soutendijk (Christine) and the great direction of the whole of Paul Verhoeven. His directorial style is clearly visible and can be said to look at it from different angles that "De Vierde Man" is a typical Verhoeven film. It's not just about people familiar with his American films due to nudity and graphic violent scenes, but it will also look typical for people who are familiar with his Dutch films, for the same things and talents to tell a great story. When people look at American films Verhoevens, shortsighted people can say they have no talent to tell a good story and focus only on blood and sex. This is what some people think, while I think it is a very talented director who is trying to reinforce each of the films with a deeper message. Although not a good film, Hollow Man (his latest American film) is an example of the fact that Verhoeven can do more than sci-fi movies, and perhaps have more faith in his company and offer him more helmet movies. He needs it. Just watch his Dutch movies. Not only do they show that they need some freedom but also show that they have remarkable talent. "De Vierde Man" brought him a step closer to Hollywood and is certainly one of his best. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
