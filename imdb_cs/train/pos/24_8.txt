Although it was probably the low budget of production, performances and songs in this movie worth seeing. One of Walken's few roles. (he is an amazing dancer and singer and he also demonstrates his aerobatic skills - beware of the cartwheel!) Also play Jason Connery. Story of great children and very nice characters.
