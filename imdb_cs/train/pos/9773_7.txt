The conspiracy is really terrible, the atmosphere is really depressing, unusual for low-volume production, and at least for German production. A bit of Indian spirituality, a mystical thriller and a movie slasher mixed together. The development of plot and characters is great, the sets are very close to reality, without a studio atmosphere. It could be perfect, but unfortunately some things were a little disappointing, which inevitably must be typical of low-budget movies: 1.) Sometimes the footage is no more than average. Almost every actor looks like a layman. Some of them do good or very good work, but some act as actors of miserable German backyards! But I was very, very disappointed in meeting Mathieu Carri√®re! His acting (in many older films of his acting was fine) here was below average! But that might be the reason why they are now participating in miserable German soaps or TV series on private channels. <br /> <br /> 2.) Dialogues are sometimes at the soap opera level. <br /> <br /> 3.) The bad sound made it sometimes difficult to understand what the characters say. I saw it on DVD and it was glad that she could come back and listen to it again. This caused a set (big halls like in a hospital or with an esoteric group) and sometimes strange dialects of actors! But overall, it's an interesting movie that's worth watching, far behind commercial films that are often more terrible.
