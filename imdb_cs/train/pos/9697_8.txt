This is really a heart-warming family film. He has absolutely great animal training and "acting" (if possible also called) (just think about the dog in "How Grinch stole Christmas" ... it was just a bad training). The story of Paulie is extremely well done, well reproduced, and in general the characters are actually processed. I think it's a great movie! <br /> <br /> My rating: story 8.5 / 10, acting 7.5 / 10, animals + fx 8.5 / 10, cinematography 8/10. <br /> <b> My overall rating: 8/10 - BIG FAMILY FILMS AND VERY WELLCHTHATING!
