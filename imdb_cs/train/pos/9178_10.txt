I really have to say that it was always my favorite when I went to see my grandmother. And it's still. It's very, very close to the book. The way they are filmed and the players were all great! I have to recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it. Almost everyone I talk to hate TV movies, but this was really great! I gave it 10/10.
