The episode Caprica (S01E01) is well executed as a pilot. Indeed, this episode is exactly the same as the DVD pilot edition. That being said, episode 01 gives a very substantial background to the very popular "Battlestar Galactica" series (both original and 2007 remake). It is most relevant to the 2007 series. Just like the late trend sci-fi movies, this series explores the "virtual" life or environment. In addition, we give us a lot of insight into Adama's family line, as well as their relationship with the undefined (in the Battlestar Galactica series) creator of the Cylons. For the most part, this first episode focuses on the popular theme of "Virtual" life and (as expected) the early life of colonies and the birth of Cylons. <br /> <br /> Overall, I enjoyed this episode. Although it was not a new material for himself or for someone who has already seen the DVD of the Caprica pilot, the series looks very promising. As with many pilots, episode 01 leaves us hanging cliffs to ensure audience watching (sci-fi community). I'm sure to keep track of determination and development. <br /> <br /> I give this series 8 stars.
