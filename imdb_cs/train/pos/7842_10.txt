so in the middle of the season I went to school and into my activities that I did not realize the show was canceled in half, which is bullshit. I think the followers of this show should write a fox and ask them to at least complete the shoot so the season can be released on DVD later. Maybe then see how many people were disappointed that the show did not survive its first season. I loved the show and enjoyed it every Thursday afternoon. can you imagine my disappointment when I come back to try to watch the show just to find out she's gone? Needless to say, I'm not very happy with the flesh now. even more after finding out that they DO NOT WORK FILM. I mean, if you work on a project, at least complete it to find out what's going on. Semi-profiled show is like a half-made car, it's quite useless. fox, shoot damn and make some of the fans a show of peace.
