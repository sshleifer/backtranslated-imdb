I saw how long he died when he first appeared in the cinema, I thought the film gave good looks to the soldiers, gave a realistic look to the men in the war. The story moves at a nice pace, showing a group of men behind enemy lines and trying to get back into their lines with an enemy prisoner. Characters are well-developed and credible. David Hemmings is a good actor and plays a leading role with conviction, like Alan Dobie (like German Helmut), I was surprised to find that I was unable to find this movie on VHS or DVD and I feel like it was a forgotten movie, which is sad , because it's better than many other war movies I've seen.
