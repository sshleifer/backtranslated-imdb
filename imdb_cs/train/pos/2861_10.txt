I love this show and my 11 year old daughter and I love it together. They teach good old fashioned values ​​in a fun, adventurous and entertaining way (though with most of the time with a somewhat predictable story). It's also really fun to make fun of ... you know, rewind and paste your own dialogue instead of actors. "I have my DVR recorder, which records all the episodes and I caught the tail end of the episode (just before the start of the next ... so I do not know what the episode was) but there was absolutely TERRIBLE sequence error!" Adam gave Sheriff's coffee a small sample " skin "that was torn from a desk when he tried to escape.I suppose Roy has a jacket, put it on his desk and put the sample right where it was torn off.The pattern was exactly rectangular ... which in my opinion would it was almost impossible to tear off the skin (naugahyda after 1950? Yes, skin?) Well, the sample was perfectly balanced and the mystery was resolved.Without 10 seconds in the scene we can see the coat still lying on Roy's table.This time, shaped North Carolina and is now in a completely different place on the coat (but still perfectly matched with the hole in the coat) and the seam (which melted in the center of the swatch) is now gone .. as well as a seam coat My daughter was very laughing when we played a short scene over and over again! It's best for youtube, I'll tell you! <br /> <br /> We still enjoy the show and the sequential mistakes make a lot of fun!
