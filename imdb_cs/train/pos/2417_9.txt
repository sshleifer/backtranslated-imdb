Going Berserk is actually one of the funniest Candy movies I've ever seen. Sure, it's a bit of a budget, but it's a constant comedy de force tour. There are a lot of unforgettable quotes. For example, when his father-in-law, who soon wants to ask how much he earns, Candy says, "Oh, I'm dragging up to thirty and ... eleven thousand dollars a year, sir." Of course, it's Candy's van that sells it. Just classic stuff. Eugene Levy will also become a bloody performance as a dirty filmmaker. The clip of his terrible, low-budget film "Kung Fu U" will bring you to life. <br /> <br /> So if you are a Candy fan and want to re-discover a forgotten gem, I can not recommend this movie so far.
