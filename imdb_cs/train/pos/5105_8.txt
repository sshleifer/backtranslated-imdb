How can anyone say that Urban Cowboy was and still is the best document of Texas life for this period. Consider the following: men defeated their wives, drunk at night, marrying to settle, commit adultery, and fight mechanical bulls. Try and name a movie that vividly portrays real life. They do not do it anymore. It seems that contemporary films are always about people with lots of money, they live in huge houses, drive expensive cars and they do not work. This movie has a scene celebration to win a trailer for pete's jack! <br /> <br /> Anyway, watch it at least once a week. No fun. I cut this movie from end to end. do not hesitate to send me an email to learn more about my reason why I called it a document. Imagine the following scenes: Bud sees Sissy - they are divided - friendly hongs and waves, she wakes him up - he returns half of the peace sign that unfolds his corner and gives a shot, then breaks off. <br /> <br /> Mummy's mother calls him roughly. 18 hours after he entered the city, on Sunday, to find out if he still has a job - everything he did, he drank and laid (x2) with the help of his uncle and aunt covering him. <br /> <br /> "You all live like a pig" Think about why this scene is needed. Think about it. It was necessary? Could we not find it without showing a dirty sink? God I love it! <br /> <br /> Sissy will allow Wes to help her drive the bull. Only a few days (or perhaps the next day) when Wes just kicked his husbands off. Steve asks - Hey Sissy, do you remember Wes? Oh, yeah, you did not manage my husband until the second night, and so let this lesson not mention later looking at them during one Buddha and Sissy's many battles, which in turn happens in public - in Gilley ! <br /> <br /> Wedding reception with a meeting (oh mankind!) could at least arrange or move the chair out of the way. "My legs are blessed by Mommy" <br /> <br /> Finally, you do not have scenes like this one in the movie to try to show insights into human psychology.This is a real-life document. <br /> <br / > I just wish there was a director ...
