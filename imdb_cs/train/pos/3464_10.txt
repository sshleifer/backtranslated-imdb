* WARNING * Spoilers before ... The writers of this story knew these men very well. Also actors are very well portrayed. As a result, you feel like you're actually watching John Lennon and Paul McCartney for the rest of the movie. Expected tensions are there, especially at the first bullet points. But as they both begin to relax, the old comradeship that makes the Beatles so well begins to show off. The heat is still there and interrupts at times, but at the time John gets the idea of ​​taking Lorne Michaels to pay his Beatles $ 3000 to show up on Saturday Night Live, there could be two identical boy pranksters who terrorized Liverpool together as a teenager, and survived playing rough nightclubs in Hamburg to rise to the Superstardom. But in the end, this gorgeous fantasy comes out gently. We recall why the Beatles' assembly was unlikely to have been before Lennon's assassination: The two drivers of the group overcame each other.
