One of the best trainer of the Three Stooges ever. A haunted house full of bad guys and "The Goon" invites the best men of the detective agency. Shemp is in peak form in the famous scene in the dark. Emil Sitka provides excellent support for Mr Goodrich as a target of murder. Before finishing, Shemp's "faithful little shovel" is very effective. This 16-minute gem moves as fast as any Stooge is short and packs twice the wall. Highly recommended.
