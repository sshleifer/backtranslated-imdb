in 60 seconds is a very good action comedy movie that has earned more than $ 100 million, but most critics have fired it. Personally, I thought it was a great movie. The story was believable and probably has the largest cast for this type of movie, including 3 Academy Award winners nicolas cage, robert duvall and very hot anjolina jolie. besides the delusional stunt at the end, it's the perfect mix of action comedy and drama. my score is **** (from ****)
