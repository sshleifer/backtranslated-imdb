I loved Sabrina Teenage Witch and saw every episode. I remember when I sat at 6pm every night and waited for Nickelodeon, but when Sabrina left high school, the show began to go down. The best series must be when she and Valerie were friendly (I'm not sure which one is). Since then, the next series (Dreams with Friends) has been very good, but when she went to high school, it did not seem right. All the main characters seemed to have gone, which meant she did not have so many "sparks", but the first series in which Sabrina is in college is still relatively good and observable, however, when her aunt leaves and Sabrina moves to their home is just not right. She is no longer a teenager, so the name of the show is not right and without Hildy and Zelda and Josh show it just does not seem right, especially when Sabrina almost married someone who is not Harvey. Thank you for the good that he came in the last five minutes of the last episode to take her. Overall, I'm still keen to watch the old episodes of Sabrina Teenage Witch, but I think the writers took it too far to let Sabrina leave high school. Because after this show she definitely lost some magic
