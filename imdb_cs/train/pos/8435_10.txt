Although there were several rough spots and some conspiracies that were not exactly true, it was classical H: LOTS. The characters outside Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito) were true and the scenes of Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) were so deep and well-functioning as if something nice little canvas. /> <br /> <br /> "Murder: The Movie" aka "Life Everlasting" is a fan, but stands alone as well as every 2-hour episode of the series. Fontana, Overmeyer and Yoshimura did a terrific job of pulling out of free seasons of seven seasons and each major cast casting the "best damn TV show" together for a final series that NBC has never bothered. The true form of "Murder", there were no happy endings, such is life. This is what the show has always chosen, except that the television show is made of soulless cops. Kudos writers and cast for making something across the line and in a movie that has invaded TV viewers and producers alike. <br /> <br /> ** I am called "Homicidal Maniac" if for no other reason than to keep my co-workers in a cooperative mood. **
