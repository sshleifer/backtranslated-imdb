Michelle Rodriguez plays Diana, a high school girl with embarrassed frown and 2 x 4 on her shoulder. She is ready to fight someone, especially with a father who pays for his brother's fight lessons. Diana decides that boxing would be a good way to target her anger. I liked the relationship between Diana and Adrian. Santiago Douglas as Adrian is excellent. Watch how their emotions are shaped by square circles.
