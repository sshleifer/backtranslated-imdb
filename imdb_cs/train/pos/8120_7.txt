The stuff that comes is an early science fiction movie that portrays the world or "Everytown" for 100 years. You can divide it into about 4 different scenes or parts. The film stretches from 1940 to 2036 and it is mainly about how this ruler or "boss" wanted to get the ability to fly again, after Everytown was bombed and the war broke out. has about 3 mistakes: it's a muddy sound and the video has some cuts, the characters are not deep and the overall plot is not entirely solid. The conspiracy is missing something I can not put my finger on ... it seems a bit "fluffy". But if you like science fiction and you are interested in what H.G. Wells became in the next hundred years, it is necessary. It is worth seeing just that we learn what everyone feared: a long and exhausted war because they are going to war with Germany and the threat of biological weapons and everything. <br /> <br /> Things that come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once.
