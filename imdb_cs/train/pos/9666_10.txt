Bette Midler is Divine again! Pleasantly funny. In love with Burlesque. It can bring you to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or only with old songs with more power and punches than ever before. Everyone in the singing of all the new ballads sings the old good / permanent, like "The Rose"; "Stay with me" and yes, even "The wind under my wings". The best way to appreciate the Divine Miss M was always good - because that's her best chance, I strongly recommended to everyone with a mixture of adults a wide-eyed enchantment and recognition and child's wicked desire to push all the borders!
