The true extent of some fictional work is whether the characters grow out of their experience and emerge from the experience that has changed in some significant way (note that this change may not be positive or beneficial) at the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ As a movie generally succeeds a relatively well-excellent occupancy cast, well-developed characters you are interested in, a wonderful script, and beautiful files and locations. In short, the movie is charming. Although all performances are first class, three must be mentioned - Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent and Joan Plowright. She says something when Miranda Richardson does her usual job and yet is occupied by so many others in the cast. Most recommended, especially if you are romantic in the heart. Another representative did not say.
