I saw ZP when he was first released and found to be the main disappointment. His screenplay was forced and arched and too fake. It's too candid and ridiculous politics. And frankly, I was still in love, known as BLOWUP, and I did not turn her completely yet. Now "love" is twisted with all sorts of nostalgia it evokes, and well. . . Good luck to me! But the time is marching and time was kind to ZP and time was a teacher for me. This film is being researched every decade and is constantly improving and improving with age. And ZP is your own "experience" and is really only associated with BLOWUP through your creator, late, great Mr. Antonioni. Twelve years ago, I was very lucky to see a totally untouched print, projected to its proper size (enormous), restored by an Italian governmental cultural agency that knows a good artwork when it sees it, and knows that it is important to maintain such beauty in good shape. To this day, I recall the desperation from the audience when the first Death Valley shot. It was like a thousand-volume visual shock that Antonioni deliberately delivered to awaken us to a new level of awareness. And indeed, what follows is a completely different kind of "place". What is amazing for me is how this movie comes into its own. when I saw it for the second time - in the early eighties - I began to feel affection for the film as a whole and specifically for Daria and Mark. While before these two appeared as the intelligent shadow versions of Zefferelli Olivia and Leonard (readers: Romeo and Juliet), she was dealing with me now - especially the Girl in her urgent glory. She took her. . . Live. Everything Everything around me is dying. <br /> <br /> After the excitement of the theater, Reality's daylight began to quickly erase my new "fun" found. The hit shoulder padded and big 80s whispered "But it's hippie fantasy --- let it go" Antonioni's vision had the power I realized I was working on the first one so I answered "80s" with "Uh- Huh "and guarded my" love "secretly, wealthy and jealous. But this is what good art is in you, and if you want, it has its way and "loves" you back: secretly, jealously and wealthy. And you have "changed". <br /> <br /> He was thrilled that Turner Classic Movies decided to show the ZP in the March report. Undoubtedly, ZP has to be seen on a huge screen so he can really take you to his design environment. But hey, sometimes even a glimpse of the beloved in a newspaper photo is nothing better than to see at all. <br /> <br /> Today's real hit, ZP has been mysteriously revoked and replaced by ALICE'S RESTAURANT. <br /> <br /> So it's still too "difficult", too "worrying", too "what"? Maybe it is like all good art, everything around him is dying. <br /> <br /> Peace.
