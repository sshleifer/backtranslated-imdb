As for the erotic genre, I'm lucky to go through the first 20 minutes of the conspiracy without picking up or looking for something else that could be tracked. This movie is different. Julie Davis (I love you not to touch me) in this stunning thriller was directed by two very strong lead actors Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery. Kira is convincing like "Kim," a sweet innocent romance portrayed in Doug Jeffery's seduction network "The Man," a handsome stranger. Kira loses control over her inhibitions in a role and as an actress, giving what could be just another T and A depth and credibility. I believe it's her best performance so far. And director Julie Davis is a great gift for eroticism.
