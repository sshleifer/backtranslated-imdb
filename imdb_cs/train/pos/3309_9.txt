It's a great movie. If it's an indication than Hong Sang-Soo is really "the best secret of Asian film." It is in style very similar to Tsai Ming-Liang and Hou Hsiao-hsien and it covers themes for much the same reason as they, but I think I like it more as a whole than any of their films. Apparent minimalism is somewhat less pronounced than in their work, although it still suits this style (the camera never moves once) and somehow I find that the movie is less self-conscious "slow" than Tsai Ming-Liang or Hou Hsiao-hsien , which I think is part of the reason why I enjoyed it more. Moreover, this does not mean that they are completely separate from Hou. I felt that the film was also somehow "finer" and less open (barely) than some of its work, though it does not mean that it has a lot of what it reminds of a forward-moving plot. It would be hard to believe that Sophia Coppola was not directly influenced by this film for "lost in translation" (scenes of a young woman walking alone and chewing in her hotel room with punk panties can not help but seems familiar).
