I could not wait to get to my hands when I read about Fred Astaire, who had teamed up with George Burns and Gracie Allen in the screenplay of P.G. Wodehouse and music by Gershwins. It's definitely worth seeing, but it lacks the cohesive quality of Fred & Ginger's films. The story would probably be better read in the Wodehouse book, where humor gets better. Some of the acting is totally painful to watch (especially young boy and girl). But ...! Funhouse Dance costs more than most movies. I never knew Gracie Allen could dance, but there's a boy in this movie. Have you ever tried to stay on one of the rotating discs in the castle? Imagine Tapdancing on one of the high heels! Astaire keeps it cool and greatly contributes to the overall picture quality. A few nice songs, especially fun, are a nice job if you can do it and a stiff upper lip. <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to come back and watch the rocking dancer once the credits turned.
