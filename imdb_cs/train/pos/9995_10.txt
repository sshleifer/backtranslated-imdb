This is the kind of movie you want to see with a glass of wine, fire and legs up. It does not require a lot of brain power, so it's very good after a long day. I think it is very unrealistic - if you expect something serious, then do not bother, but it is very fun. Just the idea that the businessman goes so far as to agree for a moment that he wants to live in the slums for a while, and then he really enjoys it ... I would definitely recommend it.
