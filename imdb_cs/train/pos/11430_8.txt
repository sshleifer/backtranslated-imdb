Unfortunately, due to the tendency of American audiences to avoid titles, this film did not receive the distribution or attention it deserves. His subtle themes of belonging, identity, racial relations and, in particular, how colonialism hurts all sides, go beyond the obvious dramatic tension, the nostalgic memories of the protagonists' childhood, and the exoticness of her relationship with the houseboy parents, perhaps the "real" person she knows. We will not even look at the relationship of mother with this elegant man. Push! I hope I've got enough of your hook to get it, whether you speak French or do you have subtitles or not. I urge you to be as brave, strong and conscious as La P'tite.
