How can a movie that poses singing Curtis Mayfield be bad? It can not! Groove Tube is a series of scathetic exhausting sketches that make fun of everything from 2001 to the Olympics. Tops (Koko clown, easy lubrication recipe) exceed the minima (too long "Dealers"), but the minima are funny. Best of all, Ken Shapiro manic dance is on Manhattan's busy sidewalk. (This is Shapiro, not Nat King Cole sings Just You, Just Me). She certainly dated, but at that time The Groove Tube was disrespectful, courageous, brazen, and hysterically funny. Ken Shapiro did this little cult hit, then 7 years later he made a Christmas crash, Modern Problems (even though I enjoyed it) and then unfortunately nothing. (He could play drums in a jazz band) The Groove Tube remains an endless explosion of positive energy to me, a film that, after 26 years of my initial view, brings me real joy!
