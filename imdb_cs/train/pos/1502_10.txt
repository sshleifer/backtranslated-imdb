Late, great Robert Bloch (author PSYCHO, for those of you who did not pay attention) wrote this horror story and it was absolutely one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen as a child. (I had to walk MILES to see a movie, and when I emerged from the theater, it was usually dark, I saw the horror movie was always disturbing, but especially when it was as good as this one.) When I had the opportunity to see this one a few years ago on a videotape (which should always be the last option), I was surprised how well it took. Take a terrorist test: watch it at night, alone and then tell me it's not scary ...
