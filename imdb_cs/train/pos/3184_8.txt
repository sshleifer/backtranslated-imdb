This Hong Kong made a potboiler pack in more melodies than the one-week The Young & The Restless. This is rather a return to the original "Emmanuelle" trilogy (especially "Goodbye Emmanuelle") than D'Amato sleazefest. Chai Lee (Emy Wong) undergoes a wonderful transformation from a nurse to hot-shot. Future Italian porn star / politician, Illon Stallero, who later named Ciccolina (and had sex with HIV-positive John Holmes), plays the Ema contest. Exotic locations and some decent scenes of the soft core around this. Recommended for fans of the original 'Emmanuelle', of which I am one!
