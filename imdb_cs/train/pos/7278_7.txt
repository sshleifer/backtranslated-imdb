Ghosts That Still Walk is one of those movies that will catch you and will not let you go to the end, especially when you see it as a child. When you see the movie as an adult, you have to admit it's not really scary, but the story is very fascinating and contains a lot of mysterious scenes (especially those that have a scary mummy) <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes in the movie is undoubtedly scene with grandfather and grandmother in their new RV; the scene with stones is very exciting and quite frightening. Also, scenes where the main character discovers the secrets of his mother are quite scary. Well, playing in the movie is not all that great and the movie sometimes seems a bit boring, but overall Ghosts That Still Walk is fun. It is a pity that few people have seen this film, and this film really deserves better. I just want to say, Mr. Flocker, you did a good job! And for all those Hollywood producers; If you want to convert a movie, edit it!
