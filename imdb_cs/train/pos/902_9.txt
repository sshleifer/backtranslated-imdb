I thought this movie was really great, because in today's cinemas in India you can see only skin, music and bad acting ... in this movie you can see tradition, ethnicity, and at least certain decency ... some parts were a bit dramatic, guess what? that's what an Indian cinema! after watching this movie at least you will not get the headache out of all overly overrated music or violence, it's true, it teaches love, and of course cares for the person you love for life ... it's a wonderful movie ... Kids can undoubtedly watch and adults will be able to enjoy the simplicity that was earlier that India was a certain depth ... until all of these rap hits, miniskirts, and skin had appeared.
