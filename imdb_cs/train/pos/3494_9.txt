For what it is, "Raising Victor Vargas" is as close to perfection as the film can get. Either a pure genius from a young author or just one of those happy mixes where everything clicked (probably some of them), this simple little piece of life in urban life first loves the movement of his young characters with a depth that almost can read their minds. The film starts with a strong taste of the "street", but its journey into the family affair of Latino and then focuses on a story that speaks of a wealth of youth uncertainty and a deep natural desire to love others. In my experience, so much has never been done with so little (casting a tyros, novice director, etc.). He praises the critics, but not everyone, "Stretches Victor Vargas" is recommended for indie lovers and realists in simple stories rich in humanity. (AND)
