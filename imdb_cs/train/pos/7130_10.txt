Well, when I saw this movie before, I was not sure if it was my cup of tea ... how bad I am! I thought this was one of the best films I've ever seen, a real family classics. The story of a young evacuee and his new "groomed" dad, this film tapes all the boxes. I did not read a book (maybe it's a good thing and it means I liked the film), but when it comes to the story, I really can not think of bad points, so I've rated it 10 out of 10 (and I hardly ever think that everything is guaranteed by the best brands!). At a time when William said, "I CAN I DRIVE MY BIKE!" I sang my heart (everyone who saw it, I understand it, I'm sure). Really warm and definitely recommended.
