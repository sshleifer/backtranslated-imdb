Robert Duvall is the direct descendent of the Confederacy, General Robert E. Lee, according to the IMDb.com film database. After you've seen this movie, maybe you think Duvall's look is reincarnation, it's the best. One of my favorite movies. I wish the composer, Peter Rodgers Melnick, had a CD or soundtrack available. Great scenery and music and "all too true to life", especially for those of us who live or have moved to the south. This is "a real moment in time". Life moves slowly, but "strangers we do not stay."
