SPOILERS This is an amazing film about Grifters. But who is here who is here? When does the hunter change into prey? This shy, dark film is slow and seductive. It will attract you and attract you down through the proverbial garden path just to keep you as you think you are safe. He has a riveting script with a good actor (at least from the lead). I did not notice the music in the background, but it was never scary, so it had to be right. I was very surprised that I liked this movie because it is not usually possible. genre, but he sucked me in and kept going until the end.
