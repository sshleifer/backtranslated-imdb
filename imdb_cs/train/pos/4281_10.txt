One of my favorite "home" movies. I do not know if there is any person in our country who did not see this movie! It's funny and sad in a few moments ... I do not know how people from all over the world (who have had the opportunity to watch it) have taken this movie because you have to know some moments of our Serbian history and character of the Serbs in the first half of the 20th century, ! But as I see here, there is someone from Canada who watched ... and I liked it. I think I'll try to put all the good quotes from the movie on this site but first find out how to do it ... <br /> <br /> Healthy.
