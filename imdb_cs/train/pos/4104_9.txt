It helps when you understand Czech and you can see it in the original language and understand the obsession of Czechs with "Professionals", but if not, One Hand of the Netlaska is another great Czech film. It's funny, dark and extremely enjoyable. The highest compliment I can pay is that you never know what's going to happen, and you'll even feel good in the second and third views. For a small country, the Czech Republic has created an amazing amount of world-class film and literature from Hrabal, Hasek and Kundera to the films of Menzela, Sverak and many others. Czech humor is, by its nature, dark and often uncompromising, but often with a naive and warm mood behind him. This film is just that it is unflattering and deals with the less popular sides of human beings, but beneath it is a beautiful story full of promise, good intentions and optimism. and most other projects involving Trojan and Machacek. Enjoy it, it's a movie made for that reason - it's so close that the Czechs sometimes come to write a really happy ending ...
