For the first time, I saw this movie about ten years ago, and I thought it was really fun. It was not as bad as some critics did. The fact that John Hughes usually wrote it shows that you can at least expect some fun dialogue. (By the way, I also think the strange science is pretty good, too, which Hughes wrote in lightning speed). The film has a great glimpse of it with all the primary colors - red, yellow, etc., making it look unique. Cast is also quite good. Speedy Bunny Packard and Devil-owned Delores Salk are performing. The film definitely dated a bit, but I personally prefer all of the other 'Lampoon' series.
