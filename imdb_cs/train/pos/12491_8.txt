This movie was very good. If you are a person who likes watching horror films, I recommend this. The acting was very good, even though I thought the actress playing Julia could have had more emotions. Allan was very good and I thought the cinema was amazing. I've been on the edge of my seat all the time while my friends have disappeared and screaming. It was a complete success in my opinion and it should do it on the big screen. I give him two thumbs up! I would certainly say that if you have not seen it yet, you will rent it. If you saw it and did not like it, go and watch it again because there are parts that were totally unreal. I also liked the film being filmed around the campus.
