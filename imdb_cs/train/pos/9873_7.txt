Lily Mars, a little girl living in India, feels she is big on Broadway and her lusts are lured when successful Broadway producer John Thornway returns to her hometown for a visit. Lily is trying to do everything she can to see Thornway, but she's upsetting her. When Thornway returns to New York to introduce herself, Lily follows (John of course unknown) and Thornway finally gives her a small role in her next show just as a favor for her family, but Thornway begins to sink to this young girl and romance, which makes the main woman show, Isabel Rekay, jealous. When Isabel gets full of John-Lily's romance that frictiones with the show, she leaves and John decides that Lily will make a star. Isabel returns later and Thornway is forced to tell Lily that she has returned to her small role in the game, which can also jeopardize romance. A very charming film and refreshing change when she saw that Garland put her comedic touches in her role (her reading of Lady MacBeth, which was supposed to be humorous, never threatened her singing career). I liked Heflin's character (Thornway) more when he was upset by Lily rather than being romantic. The film was to be somewhat predictable and the scenes were not gathered so well, but a very entertaining film. Rating, 7.
