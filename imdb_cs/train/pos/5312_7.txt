Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci are an outstanding pair and show off with their unique charisma featured in this film. This is a typical "alternative" or Indian film with a plot of land that is characterized by a rare situation that suddenly becomes really important. Pecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is photographing exotic residents of a small town where he lives. Suddenly somebody else is paying attention to his work and hires him to expose his work at some major festivals and others. But Pecker's life is changing drastically, as luck and glory seem to be annoyed by urban people who are Pecker's main inspiration. Even his sexy girlfriend is crazy, because she does not pay her "adequate" attention. Well this is an indie film with a border, but not for everyone. I may seem boring or demanding for some people, but I think it's worth seeing just because it offers something "different" to the typical Hollywood standards. <br /> <br /> To describe it: This is typical of Christina Ricci and John Waters film. That's it. Oh and I almost forgot to mention that the lines of "full grace" are really annoying. God.
