Originally, I saw this movie a few years ago at Cinemax Friday after the dark series (back when the wardrobe was built as a keyboard), and it caught me. Although the film has an unnecessary aspect, it is well done. Depardieu & Dewaere's performance is very fun. They have good chemistry together and Miou-Miou makes the pink coat looks breathtaking. be at these politically correct times (at least not in the USA), because it seems like stunning things like violence, robbery and casual sex. This film proves that a talented cast as well as talented director film is a good movie no matter what it is. He disappointed me that he discovered that Patrick Dewaere had committed suicide, and in the near future we will meet him with Depardieu & Miou - You have to get out of your armpits.
