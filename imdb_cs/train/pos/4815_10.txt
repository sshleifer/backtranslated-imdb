That's on my top list of all the most popular movies! It's a fantastic and grateful movie. It was historically interesting and great to watch! I thought Emily Blunt's acting was fantastic and Rupert Friend was a fantastic Albert, the best actor was chosen for Alberta. The costumes were beautiful, and the settings and scenes like the opera were amazing and detailed. I just loved it, it was all! I loved children's scenes when she got a "bully" John Conroy. And where my mother says she must go up the stairs with the adult. One of the authors did it again! They produced this fantastic script! <br /> <br /> They thoroughly deserve the awards they have won.
