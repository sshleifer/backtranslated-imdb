I do not know ... Maybe it's just because it's an impressive tribute to some Muslim religious action (hajj), but I just felt that the film was so underestimated. I can not believe that the film was just approved by 223 people because the film was produced in 2004 and has since been awarded many awards. About the movie ... it's one of those great sweet movies.Red, a French teenager to sit at Baccalaur√©at, is asked by his devotees to his elder father to take him to Mekka.Strange, as it may seem (if you do not know too much about Islam) father wants his son to drive from home in France to Saudi Arabia on a religious pilgrimage one after another. The generation gap between father and son is based on simple enough terms ("you may know how to read and write, but you do not know anything about your son's father), but some sort of bromide generation gap literature is excluded, all of them loving in their frustration. The father never speaks in French, although Red understands Arabic, but can only answer in French, although they meet many people on their way: "There is a creepy old woman who gets to the Bosnian border on her way to Belgrade, and Mustafa's speech (Jacky Nercessian ) who helps them on the borders of Turkey, the shy women who wear a burqa on their way to Damascus, "is always focused on a disagreeable father and son, and there is not much talk in the movie that makes it pleasant for your eyes. in every city they go to. The director will even show you Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia, although the film is not quite In general, I do not like movies that do not have enough dialogues and that take their strength from the camera of subtlety, but this was really great. Although some unanswered details (like Reda invisible French girlfriend) the film appeals to the senses. A great work of art and remembering this film is the debut of Ismael Ferroukhi.
