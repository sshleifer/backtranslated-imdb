The Japanese Indian film with humor and philosophy, where the three main characters run literally throughout the film, chase each other for strange circumstances and comic casualties. When they're running, we see what's going on in their minds and how they get where they are. The act of running is a metaphor of these lucky people's lives. In some ways, what they really chase is not what they originally chased, but a sense of their lives and escape from their personal problems and broken dreams. Running makes them feel really alive. The great life adventure that changes life ends when they happen to be in the middle of something big, violent and so absurd that it makes sense. One of my favorite films ever made by the brilliant director Sabu.
