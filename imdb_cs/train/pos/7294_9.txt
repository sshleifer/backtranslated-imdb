After reading a few comments, I felt I had to add my two cents. "Sorrow Lost" is one of the most memorable shorts I've ever seen. I had a chance to see it at the Independent Film Festival in New York. I felt that this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional. The story was beautifully complicated - especially in such a short time. The story is aimed at a young girl who is abused by her abusive father. He is soon given the opportunity to "stop" the demon, played by "Eric Etebari of Witchblade". When I watched the show, I was overwhelmed by how he played such a unique and different character. I never knew he could act so well! His character was profoundly complex and he was very convincing. The game was absolutely superb. The girl was all right and my father was decent. There is also death that follows the girl around until she can escape from her future. The effects and cinematography were totally disgraceful. I wonder if they have at least a hundred thousand budgets for it. It is rare that you see such high quality. The opening was absolutely breathtaking, comparable to any major feature film. This does not mean it is not without its shortcomings - I thought it took a little while before we got there and the introduction was a bit long. But this took me in my head a few days after I watched it. In this quality there are very few shorts.
