Probably the most accurate adaptation of Stephen King. No wonder he wrote the script himself. The story follows the Creed family, moving to a beautiful Maine house. One of the other inhabitants is Jud, a nice old man who knows a few areas. One of them is a motorway that runs through their front. The second is the way that leads to Pet sematary, where children have for decades buried animals killed by the motorway. Ellie Creed's cat, the church, is soon found dead. Fortunately, this happens while the family, except for Louis (father), leaves for Thanksgiving. Jud will take Louis to the next burial ground outside Pet Sematary, where the Church is to be buried. Later, Louis greeted (not so politely) the churches. He came back and seemed to have made his way out of the bag he was buried in. Perhaps he was buried alive. Maybe not. I can not say anything more without destroying the story. Of all the king's adaptations I've seen, that would be the most scary. The characters are real and the situation is normal. Mary Lambert does a great job of driving. The conclusion is fairly high throughout the film, partly due to the development of the plot. The scene in which Gage is killed will hold in your mind forever. Then of course we have a conclusion. Easy to find out what happens, but Lambert pulls out some really scary and sometimes disturbing moments. Overall, it's a good movie and great adaptation. If you like fear and do not mind that some disturbing images are being haunted by you, then "Pet Sematary" is just what you are looking for. Non-Horror fans want to avoid it.
