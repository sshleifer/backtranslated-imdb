It is a beautiful, rich and very well made film with a rich and meaningful story. In essence, it tells how the old story must find a male heir to perform his craft but ultimately does not get what he expected in his very dominated world of men. Characters have to deal with their situation and the old man has to deal with the conflict of his desire for companion and heir and his traditional conception of society. The story is fun, emotional and intricate. The exploration of characters, their lives and emotions is rich and convincing that character development is strong, while characters are complex and not at all dimensional. The film professionally expresses the emotions of an old man and his desire to find an heir and convincingly shows how to deal with the child with the situation. There is also humor, sometimes quite subtle, in appropriate places. The film also examines good and bad traditional Chinese cultures and creates more interest and depth of film. Direction, acting and scenery are excellent. Added to other strengths, they create rich and convincing visual images and convincing, real characters. As a result, the film produces strong empathy and feelings about characters. Some say the end of the movie is weakening, but I do not necessarily agree. Perhaps it could be stronger with another end, but any improvement in the overall movie would be relatively small.
