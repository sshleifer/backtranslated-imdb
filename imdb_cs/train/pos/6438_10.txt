"SÃ¥ som i himmelen" .. as it is above, so .. it's a very special place where Divine and Human meet. ADORE this movie! Jewel. YES amazing grace! <br /> <br /> I was so deeply shifted by my very humane quality. I laughed and wept through the whole registry, even a few octaves of emotion. Mikael Nyqvist is BRILLIANT as Daniel, passionate performance, charismatic and powerful. His inner light and exceptional talents experience every scene, every interaction, every encounter. I was totally enchanted, enchanted and enchanted by the story, which is our collective story, a story about life itself. The film was also so encompassing many archetypes, messiah, wounded child, magic child, artist, teacher, priest, abusive, abusive, sacrifice, crazy, divine fool - all characters so real and true to life - all awakened great love and compassion in me . <br /> <br /> It's a real experience to see such a thought-provoking, but thoroughly enjoyable, fun movie. Oh .. Do not forget the heavenly chorus of angels and the amazingly beautiful sound. <br /> <br /> WELCOME ALL - This Swedish film will surely attract people all over the world. BRILLIANT!
