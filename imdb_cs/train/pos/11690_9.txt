This movie was dying to see. It took a long time to decide to really borrow it. It was totally worthwhile. This movie laughed me from the beginning to the end. Chris Rock is funny no matter what movie he's in. However, it should be really close to being his biggest. If ur is looking for a family movie, then pre-teens and then it's one u can not go.
