Good. Yes, it was a very low-budget movie with continuity errors (as single scenes apparently shot in sunlight and then in shadow and then mixed) and like Nick Nick Mancuso loved, it was often too much burning (and at least one actor was used for two different but noticeable roles). Come on. Richard Grieco was hysterical (only his hair is worth a trip). Steven Ford was very nice. Mancuso had some great lines, while Nancy Allen, ironically, was totally insignificant and uninteresting. Classical? No. Bad parts? Yes. Entertaining? Great yes. I would love to be on the day when they decided what Grieco hairstyle would be. "Are you fast?" ... "It's not fast."
