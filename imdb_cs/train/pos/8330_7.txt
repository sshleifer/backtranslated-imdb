What a wonderful story? a highly comprehensively filmed movie that has so many spells and the feeling that a lot of romantic comedies lack. Einstein is great acting Walter Matthau, while Catherine Meg Ryan is unforgettable? better than I saw her in those films against Tom Hanks? as a young mathematician who seeks recognition. You do not have to be a young woman who would understand Catherine's struggle and feel instant compassion with her, and as a young man it is easy to understand what he must have been going through Ed (Tim Robbins) thinking in pursuit of his true love. There is a universal appeal in these emotions, although I.Q. keeps it all light, fun and nicely tied. <br /> <br /> It is not difficult, but when you look at it, there are some subtexts. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist, yet he was a great spiritual; his statements like something like this: "If it's not impossible, then why?" indicates that he is believing in meeting higher goals beyond the immediate shot. In this movie are questions about what's really an accident? such as whether Albert and his crazy assistant in a Catherine bout away from the stiff-upper lips, without the love of James (Stephen Fry ?, who gives this otherwise cardboard the character of life and you can not help but feel for his lack of feeling) counts. How many interferences are happening in our lives that we do not see, and how do they strike it on our own? And, of course, we'd like to think in real life, and despite what we often see about people we know that Edwards gets Catherine and James, we have to learn to defrost the ice water in our veins. How pleasant to know that it could work in an innocent (and disturbing, exclusively Caucasian) IQ country in IQ.
