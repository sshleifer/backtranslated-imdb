Here I get some weight and I say I enjoyed it. However, the cartoon really only appeals to those who have very absurd tendencies. It's definitely something most people do not get, just like the nature of absurdity. Animation is terrible, but yes, that's the reason. The main character is dirty, violent and stupid. no redemption of quality at all. his wife screaming and screaming, seemingly barely capable of the most basic communication skills. most of these stories completely lack any point. <br /> <br /> But this is the reason; <br /> <br /> If it's your thing without sequencer, dirty language and complete and complete randomness, you'll love it. <br /> <br /> It's really short, so I probably would borrow instead of the purchase.
