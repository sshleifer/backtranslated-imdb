Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room with blood on his hands and tries to understand what he has just done. Meanwhile, the CIA chief in NYC will outline the agency's response to what has just happened on the screen. The US flag stands proudly at the center of its table in the foreground of a shot, but as it speaks, it slips out of focus because its plan throws itself into the morally dubious territory as though it did not want to be linked to the course of action decided by the government is necessary for national security . <br /> <br /> This image effectively captures the film's mood. Just as Bourne's attempts to find out how he became Jason Bourne, the Ultimatum is also examining the human cost of measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security. <br /> <br /> Probably the best movie you can see this year in the cinema. <br /> <br /> It's so intense. Bourne tells Simon Ross (Considine): "It's not a news story, it's real," and you almost believe it in the audience. The camera shakes, but it stays stable enough to see everything and you feel that you are with Bourne when you try to persecute your pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys look as if they were the characters they are showing instead of being actors who perform well-written roles. The action scenes are so brutally quick and well choreographic that they seem instinctive instead of planning the smallest movement; stunt work is amazing. <br /> <br /> Stimulation is simply unbelievable. He continues to drive forward towards his conclusion, but not so fast that he lets you fight to conspire. the script will provide you with the information you need as quickly and accurately as you move to another tense action file. While they are often simple (the Waterloo sequence is basically just a person on the phone that is tracked by a person on the phone), they are accused so dramatic that you can not take their eyes off them. The film is so focused on power forward that you can not help thinking about it. Thanks to intense actions, brilliantly passing stories and intelligent exploration of decisions made in the name of national security, the Bourne series is the one that accurately captures the ambiguity of our age. Ultimatum is its pinnacle.
