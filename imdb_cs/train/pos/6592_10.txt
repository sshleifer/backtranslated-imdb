I did not see this movie, but I have to. After reading all three Thor Heyerdahl's books (Kon Tiki, Ra and Aku Aku), I was actively looking for a copy of this film. The thesis that the peoples moved to Polynesia is alive and well. Since this crew did not have a GPS and only an old-fashioned 6-W radio tube (tube), their journey was really proud. <br /> <br /> Please reply to this message if you can tell me the location of the copy of this video. <br /> <br /> I'm interested in buying this video.
