Visual creative epic form of inimitable style. This film may not have alternative dramaturgy or artistic acting. But who dares to say that this film is not art? I'm not a supporter of the idea that an important film must be serious, non-commercial, or annoy me questions. Even there are plenty of films suitable for these attributes that I like. <br /> <br /> Bogus Journey is certainly not one of these films. What you get is pure, excessive creativity with a very positive and childish energy. This film does not reflect reality. His friendly - naive and utopian. Imagine the world of the future described by Rufus - it will be quite a nice combination of time and place to live in! In addition to this music; -) Technically, Bogus Jorney is very well. I have always liked the cinematography and the scenery of this film. Particularly at this point, Bogus Journey overcame his prequel by far. Also, the effects are good and I think most of them were very cgi-free. Generally, I prefer good old effects in big budget movies. Sure, it's just another Hollywood movie from some people's point of view. But I think it's very charismatic. <br /> <br /> The short word for soundtrack: all the band and orchestral music fit very well into the movie. Also, the sound design has no deficiency. I'm not a big fan of rock music, but I had to get this track from Winger from the scene of the station I built and the parents in the van. I love unorthodox camera work at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Let me close this: <br /> <br /> This movie is very naive and very imaginative! It is much better than Panzerkreuzer Potemkin, Godfather, Eraserhead or Aguirre - the wrath of God. He is totally superior to Kane, apocalypse or chris markers sans soleil ... ... is even better than Total Recall ... No way! Yes, the way! <br /> <br /> Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey are simply the best movies ever. <br /> <br /> Whoever dares to disagree is guilty of "artsie-fartsy behavior" or likes Terminator Salvation <br /> <br /> PS: Part 1 is no better movie. So Bogus Jorney is a great sequel. Even Terminator 2 is not a great sequel! It is not!
