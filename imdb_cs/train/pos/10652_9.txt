I do not know why critics scared this movie. I almost disagree with them at all. The movie could be a little frightening - I do not usually go to horror movies! I even had to mentally try to see it in the day. I did not have to bother! ;) (The cinema was also full of children, heh!) ... Liam was great as always. I also liked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell). The house was very gothic and beautiful scary way. The special and sound effects were amazing. I also loved the music score, especially the fine tunes for Eleanor, and her way to rescue children as she grew up from her stagnant life routine and eventually gained her strength, peace and freedom.
