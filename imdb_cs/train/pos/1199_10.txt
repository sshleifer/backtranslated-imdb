This is the most convincing and excellent performance Robert Taylor ever gave. He even surpasses his great performance, as "Johnny Eager" is coming 14 years after this film. His gaze is still amazed to see, but now he has a maturity that gives him the advantage of this brazen and violent role. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is the last of his breed, a buffalo hunter who does not kill for money but for pleasure. His wild eyes killing not only buffalo, but human beings, it's amazing to watch. He is essentially a lonely man who needs people around him, but he does not like his sociopathic behavior. His partner is Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger), who is just bad, and it's just that it's a failure in nothing else. On the way, Charlie kills the family of Indians and captures the beautiful Debra Pagent. Charlie tried to calm her down, but she was also interested in Sandy. Granger is a bit sad to get her attention, so she got into the hunt, longing to go away with the girl and her baby. Lloyd Nolan as a drunken skinner is amazing with his wise cracks and harmonica. Russ Tamblyn plays half of the breed trying to enter the white world. The group is a special blend of good and evil, both young and old. Eventually Taylor gets a haunted buffalo that many hunters have before him and ran out of Sandy with a girl. Upon return, that evening, Sandy leaves the woman and Charlie gets out of the killing to get to Sandy and the girl for herself. The final confrontation comes in the snow storm and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it. It's Taylor's film and he was a really underrated actor of this time.
