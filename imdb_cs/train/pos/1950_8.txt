Diane Keaton has played several long "heavy" parts on many years on the big screen, but is mostly known for "light and fluffy" stuff with Woody Allen, like Annie Hall. He deserves Oscar as the best actress in the drama for this effort, and it does not matter what the competition was in when it was first shown. Try to find a scene where it does not appear. And it was all heavy drama, exhausting pace and repetition, action, all at full speed. Make-up made her smallest and at the age of thirties she faded into detail, but she played half the age and very fast. The entire movie was quite well done, staged and fired well with a strong support cast, but Keaton carried the load.
