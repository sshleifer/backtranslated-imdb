I LOVED IT and it was so broken that there is not another season !!! I wish! it was the best show ever !!!!!! There is probably no chance they will decide not to cancel the show! ha ha I wish I had it! I would be so excited !! I really would! I miss it! and he was particularly broken to not know what was going to happen to Jason! I think they should do more .... it also think its stupid that u must writr ten lines to post a comment .. it makes your comment drag it .. and no one will not read it! I really want to know what would happen between Jason and Nicole ... Maybe they could bounce!
