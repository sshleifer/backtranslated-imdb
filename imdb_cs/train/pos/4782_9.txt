Well, that's not what Lynch is managing. No supernatural thing, no violence, no dishonesty. Still, it's a beautiful movie. It's relatively slow, but maybe it was deliberate because it's a 6-week old man's story (that's my best idea of ​​its duration). Characters are ordinary people and are therefore credible. The performances are good and the last scene is incredibly touching. Anyone with siblings can join. Lyle and Alvin have nothing to say. For a moment they will return in the old days and all the fighting is forgotten.
