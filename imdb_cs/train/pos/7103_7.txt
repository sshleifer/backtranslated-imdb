I was quite surprised by this movie. Although they apparently lacked the bud, it must be remembered that this film lasted for 7 years and still proved to be good. The game was quite impressive, and the story really caught me. My only complaint would be that the end really was a bit too sudden to my taste. But hey, if your audience is left behind and want more than this movie will succeed. I would really recommend anyone in Hollywood to look at Antonella Ríos, who is a great Spanish talent (something hard to find days with all the bad news about acting). Antonella Ríos is in fact a star on the rise.
