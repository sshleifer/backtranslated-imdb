He loved it, but he had nightmares over the hotel manager. The film was presented well, with a selection of actors who carried their roles in the reality of writing. Many scenes captured imagination and created a nail. The situation was skilfully written, which made me believe that the story was the only way to find a new step in what I thought it might be. Pity there must be advertising spots. I told many friends to watch the next show and of course I will see again. I liked the scenery of the movie, and I felt it was joined to fences and intrigues. Husband and wife were upset by discussions (or should I say matches?) They were very realistic. The initial situation is routine, but the escalation into the story, which fortunately is not. I want to thank all those involved in this great entertainment movie. Thank you! Looking forward to other movies --- when? Whidbey
