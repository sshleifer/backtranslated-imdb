The book on which the film was based was excellent; it took time for Houellebecq's unconventional style to struggle, but once I understood the mood for writing, I was completely drawn into the author's world of mourning. Actually, no other book has changed my mind. This is not necessarily a good thing - it has clarified my personal struggle and has made the uselessness of my own struggle more difficult to accept. Houellebeck's views are masterfully portrayed by Harel, and the hero of apathy and indifference to the world that refused him is perfectly rendered. It's a movie that reveals today's society for a humiliated man in his horror. Hopefully things will change in the future, but for now we have to accept the rat race, as shown in this film. It is probably best that Harel or Houellebecq do not create such a brilliant work. One is enough for every man.
