The most agile fat guy in martial arts does it again. An early Sammo movie to imitate his hero, Bruce Lee, Sammo is amazing Lee as in his actions and struggle. The way he slips into Bruce's style and then back to his own well-known kung fu is a joy to watch and shows how perfect and adaptable he is in his art. Throw a bit of humor that is so kind of this kind of movies and the movie that has everything - a comedy (some unintentional like a fake black boy), action and some incredible fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> Great beer and movie buddies, worth an hour and a half of their time.
