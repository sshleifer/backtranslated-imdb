I remember seeing this movie a few years ago on the Lifetime TV network and thinking it was an interesting story. A few years later I see it again and fall in love with this movie. The story behind the movie is fascinating in itself. Casting makes it much more interesting. Meryl Streep is definitely at the top of her game in this slide. She packs Mrs. Chamberlain's manners, accent, and even a look. She shows the pain, sorrow, surprise, and anger that Lindy had to endure, and it's hard to remember that it's not Lindy. In my opinion, this interpretation of Meryllo was better than her Oscar-winning turn in "Sophie's Choice," and should have her third Oscar. Sam Neill is as perfect as Michael Chamberlain, and for some surprising reason he has not been recognized by the Academy at least for nominations. Overall, this film receives ONE Academy AwardÂ® (Streep Actress for Best Actress.) However, she received several Australian nominations and nominations. Definitely the best movie: Talks about a great story and you get great performances from all over the cast.
