Ossessione is in a very bad condition, but is now undergoing complete restoration at the Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen. The material used is the second generation of the "positive master", originally from the press that Visconti managed to hide from the fascists. It was scanned on Spirit 4K (like 2K RGB data) and then processed using DaVinci Recovery Software Recovery. The remainder is manual work and we do not expect completion before spring. Sometime next year it should be available on DVDs and perhaps also released on HD DVD. This movie is beautiful and we hope that the renewal effort will be enjoyed by many generations to come.
