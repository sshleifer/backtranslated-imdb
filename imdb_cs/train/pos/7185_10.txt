Sitting on the front porch of his Burbank house, Ted Mapes told me that he and Reed Hadley wore exactly the same size in every outfit except the hat. Ted, one of the biggest stuntmen, said that every time Zorro put on a mask, he was the one on the screen. It was a bit exaggerated: There were times when Zorro was obviously Reed Hadley, but in stuntmen we can be happy that it was Ted at work. And what bits! "Zorrova bojov√° legie" is one of the biggest series, as he witnesses the comments here. It's exciting and generally very well done. Reed Hadley was a fine actor, and, as someone else noted, he did a very good fop. But, of course, this is the action that makes this movie so great. And what else can we expect with the leadership of this great team, Witney and the English, with great music from incredibly productive William Lava (the classification here says he's unreliable, but that's wrong, the other composers mentioned here are really unreliable and I do not know, if they write some music - sounds like Lava) and the crime, among other things, the great Charles King, and tens of bit parts? Also remarkable was the villain played by Tarzan Radio, Jim Pierce, who was Edgar Rice Burroughs's son-in-law. (I'm asking you to read his mini-bio.) There is one chapter that slows down things depressed, but, damn it, it's only a few minutes long (maybe 20) and when you're walking it, well, you're back to excitement. <br /> <br /> Turner Classic Movies deserve great great THANK YOU for the presentation of this great series and we should ask TCM to bring us more. <br /> <br /> And we should thank all those involved that we consider it to be a chapter game or a serial game and not a new feature.
