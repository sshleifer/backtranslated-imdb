Does anyone know the exact quote about "time and love" George Ede aka, father Fitzpatrick in motion, had to be you? Did he talk to Charlie and Annka in the church when they left? If not, I'll have to borrow the film. It was a great movie. I loved Serendipity! Big Love Story for the Soul! <br /> <br /> I met one true love (my Soulmate) and although I had the experience to meet him when I least expected him, I was not ready for such an emotional relationship. <br /> <br /> Otherwise we married, I was not mature enough to give as much as I thought. I was happy and I took my love for granted and it lasts for 7 years. <br /> <br /> Eventually he left excitement, but we were still wounded and angry and disbelieved as it turned out. I had a rather difficult lesson, and now we've been separated for three years. This movie was a lot, because I'm still waiting for one and the only true love. I can now appreciate that there is a clear feeling in me and the quote about Father Fitzpatrick was true to me. I know that when he recovered enough to trust me again, we will recover. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> NEVER EXPOSE COMPLETE AND YOU GET YOUR LOVE TO PROVIDED! It was the most powerful lesson in my life. <br /> <br /> Also the music in this movie is OUTSTANDING and MEANINGFUL! This film is DEEP and spiritual uplifting. TRUE LOVE is worth waiting for it to be, it will be, no matter what happened! Nothing is impossible, even if it's the second time! Thanks!
