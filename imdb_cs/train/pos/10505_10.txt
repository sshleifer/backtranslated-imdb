Yes it is true. I firmly believe that the N64 and the strangely looking controller are both designed to create this game. It was amazing for the first time I saw it, with a huge environment and colorful characters, and now it's amazing. Game controls are perfect, the graphics are beautiful and have the magic of Nintendo, which is always so intangible but undoubtedly there. And it must have for each owner N64 and the reason to get N64 for everyone else.
