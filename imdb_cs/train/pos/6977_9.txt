I'm really addicted to Caprici because it's a really good series of battles for Battlestar Galactica. It's a really slow start, but it's definitely going to be highlighted soon after the new episodes continue broadcasting. For the first season, I've heard great things about future episodes and guest stars. <br /> <This Sci Fi drama will surely delight fans who love the mix of both genres. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz does a great job, just like Polly Walker as Clarice Willow !! <br /> <br /> It is worth checking out !! <br /> <br /> Catch Caprica On Friday at 9pm / 8pm Central on SYFY
