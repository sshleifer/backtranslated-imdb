The adaptation of Spirit Eisner SPIRIT on the TV screen followed by a number of other offers made on comics or comic sites. (Remember, the two are not exactly the same medium) It's really ironic that it's the only and only adaptation (as of this time of writing) of Eisner's intelligent alec, wise cracks and heroes on the tongue. <br /> <br /> The story is that Republic Pictures was interested in the film version, and in the mid-1940s negotiated with the copyright owner, but never been able to conclude an agreement. The shot to the left through the screen became a serial, THE MASKED MARVEL, one of the best in the republic. Maybe it was just as good, because this studio was interested in shooting with material adapted to comics, pulp, radio and comics. As far as what happened in 1987 for television, it is quite obvious that it was an unsuccessful pilot for the proposed TV series. While an old, long comedic reader like me may be a little harsh in criticism of adaptation, a viewer who is not capable of that character may be able to give some new observations without any prejudice about what this screen should look like. <br /> <br /> Well, as she sits and looks at the story, she develops, with characters that develop in the middle of a criminal wave, Little Lady (my wife, Mrs. Ryan) leaned her with one statement. "It can not decide whether it's serious or not!" It's pretty well described by both SPIRIT and his creator, Mr. Will Eisner, a true creative genius in a comic book. The film is a sincere attempt to bring Eisner's world to the screen. Casting Denny Colt / Ghost, Commissioner Dolan and Ellen, was a really good job. Although in the current environment it was still in the tradition of "good old days" when it comes to costumes, you know when men and women still wore hats! This means that the director and production have made conscious efforts and managed to give Will Eisner signs as distinct as facial expressions and body language. We call them Kudos for their efforts. <br /> <br /> It is terrible that no series has ever met! Oh, well in today's movie world, it seems that comic fixtures are hot stuff. Maybe some big producer and timer director could make a large screen SPIRIT 1st class for a big screen. We can only hope. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: Dateline, Chicago, Illinois. 6 April 2008. Now, everyone who goes to the movies in the Multiplexes shopping center has seen a poster that advertised the new film THE SPIRIT (MY CITY SCREAMS); to be released on Christmas Day, 2008. Well, then we'll see what we were talking about. Just keep your fingers crossed! WE CONTINUE ............. <br /> <br /> UPDATE II: We saw a new film, a few days ago we filmed director Frank Miller, director Frank Miller. Well, we have our wish; but it's a good thing or another case "Be careful what you want because you can get it?" Please read our listing elsewhere on IMDb.com. THANX!
