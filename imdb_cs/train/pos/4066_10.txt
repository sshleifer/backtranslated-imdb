Lapyuta (Castle in Heaven), more than any of Hayao Miyazaki's films, brings joy to the audience. It is a kind of film that makes you feel like a child again; it's just magical. It is a crime that it took a long time for it to be released in the States, but now that it is here, check it out! And to stick to the original language; Oak changed some of his impressions of attitudes, which is something to avoid when transferring a movie (or books, anything). <br /> <br /> I give him ten / ten.
