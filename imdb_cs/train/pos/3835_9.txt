This movie is amazing - it's like a nightmare. Bizarre story, dark decorations, swinging insects everywhere, idea jumps and surreal dreams ... Really great! People who love cult movies or very dark thrillers will find it fantastic. It seems to be a little for David Lynch's films: a strange story, bizarre dreams, red curtains. Nuit Noire contains almost no storyline. It is rather a sequence of surrealistic events, nightmares and meetings. This is a disadvantage. If the movie really had a fascinating plot full of tension with a captivating disarray, I'd give it 10 out of 10. But it's missing and that's why I made the film 8. Nuit Noire is a movie that's worth watching. Locate the DVD and you will be rewarded!
