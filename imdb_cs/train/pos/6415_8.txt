Drama TIllmana Jr. the first African American naval championship (Gooding Jr.), who defies himself completely and achieves his goals despite a strictly damn coach. The script is not bad, a bit extreme, but direction and acting are first class and this film is inspirational and achieves what to do. DeNiro liked the lead, though not parallel to his masterpieces (taxi driver, godfather and all others), is as good as his other good performances, such as King of Comedy or Angel Heart. DeNiro is always convincing and credible, very good performance, Gooding Jr. not bad, definitely one of his better performances. --- IMDb Rating: 6.6, My Rating: 9/10
