Comparison with Sleuth, the older film at the playback stage is obvious, and at first glance I also thought Sleuth was better, but Deathtrap has at least for me more repetitive views than Sleuth. > <br /> I bought Deathrap in Wal-Mart's basket, who thought Caine and Underestimated Reeve were worth $ 6. This was one of the best DVD purchases I could take. <br /> <br /> It's one of the best kept secrets that movie fans always love to reveal. And this is a really arranged tour. Although Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine turned into bravado performances at Sleuth, I was amazed twice with Christopher Reeve as Clifford Anderson. Reeve, rightfully linked to his legendary Superman, portrayed the show in what was supposed to be Oscar's good performance. I always felt that Reeve was an actor who did not have the chance to shine off Superman movies and a few other bad but funny movies like Somewhere in Time but this film shows that his potential is actually knocking and using, . <br /> <br /> Absolutely appreciated the performance of Michael Caine. It was a glib, deliciously manipulative and sadistic. And watching how he works with Reeve and Dyan Cannon is an absolute joy. In fact, thanks to this film, I got into Michael Caine's stage and started to rent as much of his stuff as humanly possible. <br /> <br /> As far as Deathtrap is concerned, there is enough juicy dialogue to fill its part of 'unforgettable quotes'. (Unfortunately, most of the dialogue would inherently spoil an extremely fun plot). It's really hard to talk about the movie without spoiling the important points of plot that are so much fun to discover themselves. Needless to say, it is necessary. But for me, it was the biggest and most successful blind purchase of all time. <br /> <br /> Repeated viewing is required. <br /> <br /> And it deserves to sit next to Sleuth on the DVD box. <br /> <br /> I will leave you with this beautifully written quote from the film: "I wonder if it will not be ... well ... just a little starry eyes to enter such risky and exciting cooperation ... where I should not rely on a sense of moral commitment ... at all. "
