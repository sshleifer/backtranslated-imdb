For a long-awaited viewer, "Winchester '73" has something to do with Casablanca. As you watch it, you feel like you are looking at a number of clichés that have met so often in the genre; then you realize that clichés have become clichés after they were copied from this particular film and that they were so widely copied because this movie was so great. In other words, it is a key job. <br /> <br /> Winchester '73 is a joy to watch. Broad conspiracy lines are somewhat predictable, but mainly because you have seen them copied so many times in later films, yet still contains a number of twists that will surprise you. Dialogue, movement, and Mann's direction are excellent. Stewart is special, and if you're a fan, it's "must-see," but he's not alone in delivering good performances. It is remarkable that many of the most thoughtful and / or funny lines go to smaller characters. Because these characters (much more) are more than cardboard cutouts, the film has brought more realism. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkably undervalued movie that's worth watching. The DVD also includes an interview with Stewart, which provides some background on the film.
