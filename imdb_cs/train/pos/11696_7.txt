"Thiever at Night" is a movie that was generally ignored by movie fans, due to the low budget (which was obvious) and its subject - The capture of the true Christian Church and the fate of those who left it. However, it was a breathtaking story that held the viewer and definitely made an overview of their relationship with Jesus Christ. It touched everyone - even showing the pastor who preached the Word, but he did not believe it because he knew exactly why he was left. This movie and its sequel to "Distant Thunder" must be seeing movies. Even with the new "Left Behind" series, which tells the same story with a much larger budget, the impact is still the same - "Thief in the Night" broke the ground of this genre and will always be remembered.
