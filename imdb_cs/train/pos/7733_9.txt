Foley's quality in this saturated and intense pulp film is seemingly perfectly connected. Shot shot, editing, the film unfolded around a disturbed boxer revealing his own purpose (or his lack). Other comments may indicate a lack of interest in pulp, but personally I think it's a great cinematographic piece!
