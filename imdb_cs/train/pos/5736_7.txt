Dumland focuses on the lives of one (American?) Family ... father; a violent and obscene person who loves fuss and abuse and has no redemption. Mother; who seems like a paranoid psychotic, never says much. Son; hidden annoying repeating little boy. The animation is simple and rough, but it is related to stories and characters. Episodes were originally only available on davidlynch.com, but have now been released on DVD. The DVD has 8 episodes, followed by a brief overview: 1 - Neighbor: We meet a neighbor with another door to see that there are three things about him ... he has a really nice shelter, he has only one hand and he likes to do naughty things with ducks. <br /> <br /> 2 - Treadmill: We found that a woman is addicted to exercise, but her husband really thinks it's not a good idea. Finally, the exercise is running. <br /> <br /> 3 Doctor: Your father has an unfortunate accident with exposed live wire ... the medical exam is quite thorough (if not unconventional), but the diagnosis is "you are absolutely normal" (but we knew that) . 4. Friend Visits: After a conversation with a new elevator, a friend is visiting (believe it or not, but when he meets, we can understand why), no surprise when he tells us what his hobbies are. <br /> <br /> 5 - Get the Stick: We meet another neighbor, his mouth (though we never know how he got there). Unfortunately, removing sticks from his neighbor's mouth will end up being heavier (and more violent) than expected ... but eventually he won ... Jesus some people can be ungrateful! <br /> <br /> 6. My teeth bleed: it was my favorite episode ... and it was the most wise and repetitive (hmm, what does it say about me?). You do not know why the teeth of your son have begun to bleed, but trust me when I say it's the least of a story. Which is an oxymoron, because the story has no conspiracy. But Uncle Bob: After meeting Uncle Bob and uncle Bob, we have a clear feeling that the Dumbland gene pool is very shallow. Uncle Bob is a sick person (I will not develop to destroy you). The uncle Bob is sure to wear his trousers in his family ... and his father will end up on his bad side with his good fist (and spend the rest of his visit standing in a tree in the back yard). <br /> <8. Ants: When home gets infected ants and a bad attempt to blur, it 's bad ... eventually spraying face to face with spray and hallucinating. The ants have a wonderful song and a dance show ... the berserk tries to kill them, the wind in the full body of the plaster ... and let's say the ants are revenging at the end. <br /> <br /> As bad as these stories is something that keeps me constantly watching. They give another look to the mind of one of my favorite directors. David Lynch. Maybe they were a salesman for him to get rid of some of his violent thoughts? In fact, I laughed out laughingly in many episodes. Many aspects are ridiculously fun!
