Radiofreccia is a movie about each of us, about our dreams, our friends, our obsession, our inclinations, our concerns. It's a great movie where a group of friends, just like everyone else, has a life of growing up in a small town in one of the most important decades of the last century. The film does not have a happy or sad attitude, but it tells us a story that everyone could experience. One of happiness and excitement, sadness and sadness. The power of this story is that we like to love characters, it's one of those films you'll watch over and over, to feel closer to the small town of Emilia Romagna where it is held. One day he hopes he will finally be able to walk through the streets next to Freccia and his friends, listen to music that has changed the world through the crackling sound of old radio played by Radio Raptus International and playing dreams, our dreams. Radiofreccia makes you laugh that you will cry at a time, it will and comfort you will shock you that it will give you and take from you. Personally, I think it played an important role in my life and my friends, and I suggest that you all look and become part of yours.
