There are so many "Hollywood" films that are not limited to torture but have no effect on one's life. Films do not always have a profound meaning, but it's nice to know that there are still filmmakers who are interested in telling "human" stories. I will not make the premise of this brilliant film, but the script is one of the more complex and memorable I've ever seen in my life, and I'm a 32-year-old movie fan too! Errors are among the top ten on the list of favorites, including: On the waterfront, Sunset Boulevard and Black Narcissus, to name but a few. This "moving" movie should become one of your favorites - that is, if you have a heart!
