This is a short, harshly revived David Lynch series (as he says at the beginning), and it follows on bad occasions when a man wearing a big man has a woman who has a stress disorder and an unpleasant son. Both of these elements are repeated in short episodes and no real plot is seen. It's easier when you think of it as exceptionally odd, slightly macabre Looney Tunes - with much more blood, furiousness, bloody violence, and occasional moments of cheer. I bought a DVD along with Eraserhead, previously seen by Eraserhead. Do not look at this series if you want artwork - that's all. In fact, it seems to be almost a statement against such things, because its rough style spits out face to face with any kind of animation convention you can see. As Lynch says, "If it's funny, it's funny because we see the absurdity of everyone."
