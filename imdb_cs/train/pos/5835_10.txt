Stan & Ollie become SAPS AT THE SEA when their tiny small ship is dominated by a sinister killer. <br /> <br /> Boys are great in this function, starting with one of their most funny bits,. Always a few steps out of sync with the rest of Creation, Laurel & Hardy are inhabited by the world where they are the rule, not the exception, the ice radio and the bedded goats. With its short length, the film is more in style with its classic short subjects, which explains its episodic nature. Only boys gain credit on the screen, but the filmmakers will recognize other familiar faces: James Finlayson appears Richard Cramer, as a drunken doctor, fulfills the fairness of his wrong role, sweet Mary Gordon playing the boy's bewildered neighbor. This is Charlie Hall as an office clerk and quiet comedian Ben Turpin shows the strangest plumber. One of the screenwriters was a quiet comedian Harry Langdon. <br /> <br /> & Ollie are the main focus. Watching Hardy for the sound of a corner, or Laurel's banana fool, for example, reminds the audience why these guys remain absolute cinematographic giants.
