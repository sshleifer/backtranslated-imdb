I knew about it like a similar program to Jackass, and in Freeview I saw one or two episodes, and that is the same, the more extreme. Basically, three Welsh guys and one mad British boy were associated with a love of skateboarding and utterly insincere / masochistic pleasure to hurt themselves and their health and safety. They had puffs, eat pizzas covered in pubs, jump in torturous nettles, naked color, look at a smaller man while sleeping hard / snoring, workplace pieces like army, cowboy and many other crazy stunters that cause bruises, bumps, vomiting, perhaps not just for yourself. Led by Matthew Pritchard, who is doing almost everything, Lee Dainton is also preparing for something, Dan Joyce (British) who barely does a lot of physical stuff and laughs OTT and Pancho (Mike Locke) who does a lot but is more popular for being short, fat and lazy. It was the number one of the 100 greatest entertainment moments. Very good!
