BASEketball is an extremely entertaining movie that adds to acting, which usually makes the movie much more fun, comic material that is more than crap in your trousers funny, and a pretty good conspiracy despite the fact that its classic slackers vs evil rich guy.The and the only thing , which I did not like BASEketball, was that the kid did not really need the movie, but if the kid was not in the movie, some of the fun scenes would not exist. If you have read some reviews for this movie, exclude them all because basically all reviewers did not like this movie.BASEketball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want8.
