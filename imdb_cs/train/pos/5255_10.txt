Tim Meadows must be the most underestimated of recent SNL members. What originally appeared on the dirty gigil, develops in a 90-minute run, though little eyebrows. Do not forget that you expect beautiful cinematography or oscar performances. Go ahead and look forward to great stupidity with Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell doing what they do best - making laughing audiences. Leon "The Ladies Man" Phelps is a naive, sympathetic host, very little about anything other than wang. Like a gifted lady, she gives out to the women of myriad juices who have joined together to hunt him. The director performs an inspired work in which the actors are conducting a comedy event that completely exhausts the lack of development. How much could be expected from SNL skittles? While some scenes are a little out of the mark, for the most part Meadows' one liners and absurd sexual commentary hit the funny bones directly. For example, in one scene, Meadows compares with Mother Theresa, but for bonin '. Sure it is nasty, but not everyone in the privacy of our homes mixes from their advice to the whole city for "doing it in the ass"? In another scene, immediately after a hearty kiss with female leadership, she suddenly recalls the name of her affluence, the woman he slept years ago. She stands in front of a woman who apparently falls for him and declares that "The ladies man is back" to her obvious sadness. Billy Dee Williams will hit the ball from the park as a barman / narrator. Will Ferrell, a suppressed homosexual, captures solid performance. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you are an adult. If not, stay out of the reach of extreme prejudices.
