I did not see this movie until I heard about it for years. Needless to say, the real experience has turned out to be a bit anti-climatic. But Alec Guiness vigorously leads an amazing cast in a cheerful, though formal, prospecting through industrial after World War II in England. This is a familiar story about the straits to invent a perfect everyday product. Do you remember the car running on the water? Do you remember the promise of nuclear power? In this case, it is a fabric that does not wear, avoids even the dirt! Of course, cloth manufacturers and their workers are horrified from the point of trade exclusion, so the conspiracy becomes a bit stiff. Guiness makes the whole business worthwhile and looks at him blowing up factory research laboratories over and over again is quite a blast! (The British ... always stiff upper lip when it's under the fire.) The film could be as bad as Guiness's fucking invention, but it's a good ride anyway.
