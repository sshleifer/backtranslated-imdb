I sit here in November 2006 and still can not help this movie. Arnold's best films came for about 4-5 years. Running Man, Predator and Total Recall (1990). All three are amazing. An Arnold cheese inlay in this movie will laugh you more than once. I think the acting in this movie is surprisingly good, as was the case with Predator and Totall Recall. They did a great job of trying to shoot futuristic scenes in the year 2017 but you can not help, but in the 1980s, you have to stutter stylish hairstyles for men and women in the crowd and normal TV monitors in Studio Running Man, all of which we know here in 2006, are on the way out with the advent of flat panels and HDTV. Also, the computer graphics of "The Running Man" would not look much like in 2017. However, the story is absolutely fantastic. Not once during this film I did not want to get up and I do not care about the end, which is something I often do with today's movie. I really think Arnold's acting is much better than him. Now I would not elect him a governor, but that's for you California. Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero are also fantastic "stalkers," and I find that producers are not trying to overcome combat scenes. When the stalker is dead ... he's dead. It does not work for 20 minutes. Stalker scenes are fast and fun, but they do not try to play it. I give this movie number 10/10 and come from someone who does not have many movies today. If you get the right actors and the right story, the futuristic graphic rendering you would see in 2006 is not important or necessary.
