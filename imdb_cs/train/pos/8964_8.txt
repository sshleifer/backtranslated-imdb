With some lucky chance of the same year that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak have made Alfred Hitchcock's spooky "Vertigo" masterpiece, they have also made this light comedy. Perhaps the two actors had to do it after they had been hitchhiked to Hitchcock. In any case, he's a great companion to "Vertigo," because he's re-examining a very unlikely but strong romance. The film can actually be considered a "Vertigo" side with its happy ending. Here, again, Novak is undergoing transformation, in Vertigo essentially two women are playing and here she "transforms" from a witch to a deadly one. Stewart is once again enchanted and suffers for a moment by his love for her. Unlike Vertigo, these two meet in "Bell Book and Candle", which is the perfect hit for Hitcock. Again the dynamics of love and attraction are explored, but in a completely different vein. The cast is amazing. Lemmon cheerful like Novak's brother and Elsa Lancaster, who gives classical performance as an aunt. Ernie Kovacs as a writer of alcoholic cult and, of course, Hermoine Gingold playing Novak's competitor are all great. The scene where Stewart is drinking a potion is a comedy in the best. Everyone who saw Vertigo or even if you did not have to see this memorable light comedy.
