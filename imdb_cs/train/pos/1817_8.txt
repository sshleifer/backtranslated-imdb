All the dogs, go to heaven, play on the dirty underworld. The film is a joy for children with a comic and dark, but satisfying and happy ending with lots of songs and dances. Based on the exile Charlie, who is murdered but murdered by the dead. She meets a human homeless girl who looks at him and through this relationship he realizes the meaning of life and self-sacrifice. This is a cute animation that I loved very much like a child. I highly recommend this film to children. I'm sure adults react to it. (I tried to watch her on VHS a few years ago, but these recordings do not last long, right?)
