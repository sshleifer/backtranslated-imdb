One of the very best movies of all time. The change from black and white to color for heaven and earth sequences was an excellent director. The plot is extremely clever, the complete film lets you overcome all human emotions and even though the war film does not discriminate. I had to see this movie more than any other, and I never loved it. It is a film that challenges you with your own mortality and beliefs about what's going on after our extinction.
