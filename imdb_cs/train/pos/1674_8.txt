Lisa Baumer (Ida Galli) is an adulteress of a great merchant's wife who will inherit a $ 1 million life insurance when her husband is killed in an airplane crash on a business trip? She is initially suspected of responsibility because her wife will have recently been changed , so he is sure that insurance investigator Peter Lynch (George Hilton) and the Interpol agenda are on their tail. Baumer travels to Athens, Greece to pay for his inheritance, but insists he has a cash ... dangerous event. Lynch, who is the same, is now known to Baumer trying to protect her from her lover Lary Florakis's lover, who, however, along with her friend Sharif, tries to kill both for the part of the money he considers justified. And that's where our masked killer starts brutal killing. Lynch, as it is customary for our hero to be initially suspected by the Greek police, and warned not to leave Athens police policeman Stavros (Luigi Pistilli known in Giallo and Spaghettis). Lynch helps the beautiful Cl√©o Dupont (Anita Strindberg), a local journalist who helps him investigate murders. To say that another movie could destroy anyone who did not see it, just tell that there are plenty of red games and most of them are likely to be happy with Mystery / Thriller fans in this fairytale film Giallo. DVD No Shame has excellent translations with both English and Italian soundtracks. It also has a very catchy score just for the good luck of Bruno Nicolai, who stays in your head for a while ... all in all the top Giallo.
