Albuquerque is a movie that has all the elements of Class A Western, except one: a story that really belongs to Class B or C. It was acceptable at the time the movie was made when people were so excited to see the Western in color, but today it looks very primitive. However, for people who have old westerns, it's fun, original color and sound are very well stored on a recently released DVD. Gabby Hayes is a good helper, Lon Chaney is always as always and Randolph Scott a little cheerful than usual. In the film called Albuquerque, you would expect to see something that reminds you of the city, but the city that is shown here could be anywhere.
