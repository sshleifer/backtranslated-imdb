First I'm a small, straight white dog. But I also love this film with this disability. They are real people. Real time and place. And, of course, New York City in the eighties. In the eighties, I had many homosexual friends in New York, which I have always admired, their courage to live their lives in the way they wanted to live. Regardless of the consequences. That's courageous. You must admire it. This is a great movie, watch it and see what it was like when you were performing in New York in the eighties as a glamorous African-American or Hispanic gay. It's a real life. In the bottom line it's real life.
