It must be the best movie I've ever seen. Combine breathtaking cinematography with a stunning acting and gripping plot and you have a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> The film left me with a deep impression. It's shocking violent scenes that differ greatly from mysterious and gentle "love" scenes. The film does not deserve its Cat III category (nudity); there are no naked scenes, and the "love" of the scene does not include either kissing or "exhaling". <br /> <br /> The message I introduced to this film? All human beings, no matter how they may seem violent or cruel, have a tender side. Edison Chen does a great job playing part of the murderous Pang. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is 10/10. It is a necessity.
