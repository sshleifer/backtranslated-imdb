This is a very dark and interesting horror-based thriller based on the idea of ​​religious murders. The story centers on an unpleasant man who lives in Texas, the US, who suddenly continues a killing spree with his two young sons after being instructed by God to redeem the world of the bad people. Bill Paxton, who directs this film, plays a shattered Father who is known as God's Assassin's Hand, while Matthew McConaughey plays his oldest performances as Fenton Meik's eldest son. The film revolves around Fenton, who decides he can no longer take the burden of his murderous childhood himself, and uses flashbacks to tell the story to FBI agent Wesley Doyle (played by Powers Boothe). I can not think of many movies that literally keep the viewer bound to its place from start to finish, and it is definitely one of them. Even if you want to stop watching, you will not be able to do it because of the sheer power of this movie. The directors shot this movie very well and helped set a story in a good scenery. Appearances in this movie are great, but if there is a disadvantage, some parts are very strong and can disturb some people. Although the concept of this film is very dark, it helps young children introduce ideas through brilliant acting. It really is a spine filter and it is guaranteed to be on the edge of your seat in the whole. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who has horror, distracting and powerful movies or someone who just wants to see something different. <br /> <br /> 8/10
