it's really a treat for every Bolan fan, some might think it's a bit over the top, and that's just about Ego Ringo and Marc, but I think it's like any other concert video, except that it's Marc bolan, not just a guy! I really enjoyed a music video for kids of the revolution, with Elton John and Ringo Starr. this clip is worth all the money, I can not believe they did not make this version as a single. The film is really great, especially for us. I was not in the 70's now. but taxpayers were totally shot out of what is happening around them. the media did not play or show any popular music at the time, including Marc Bolan and T.Rex, they played just a bit with The Doors but only very popular songs. so I know from my father that when I see it, he gives back some of his youth, he never had to live. <br /> <br /> I got used to it for too long, so ... If you're the least fan of Marc Bolan, you have to see it. you may find it boring or, as mentioned earlier, a little over the top. But at least you've seen one of the best musicians ever in action! The only thing that makes me a little disappointed is that Ride A White Swan is not on the tape. but forgive it because Jeepster and Get It On are so great played.
