Dan Katzir produced a wonderful film that brings us to the roller coaster ride over a real novel that meets the challenges of modern Israel. For anyone who has ever fallen in love, the film brings insecurity, intolerance and suffering that make love so bitterly sweet. The atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with heavy times in Israel at that time only serves to intensify the feeling. You are immediately drawn into the Dan situation, and you can not move him deeply. <br /> <br /> You can not write such drama and passion - the contrast between Dana's desperate reality, the relationship with Iris and the reality of the state in turbulence make this eminence observable. If you have an endless passion and when you fall in love, look at this movie.
