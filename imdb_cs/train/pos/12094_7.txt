Blood Castle is a good example of a high-quality work in the horror genre that took place in Italy in the 1960s. The film has all the right elements - an old dark house, atmosphere, a decent story, and Barbara Steele. Steele makes most of the movie worth seeing. The story is about a spooky castle. People visited, but nobody returned. Our hero makes a bet that he can spend the night in the castle and come back to win his winnings. But the night he's visiting is a special night. It's an annual night when the dead return to survive their deaths. The only bug I see in the movie is the run time. She almost feels cushioned. There is a large part of the first act where nothing really happens. Our hero is in the dark and finds nothing interesting. But once he finds something, the movie rises and becomes quite pleasant. Blood Castle is a must for fans of Steele and fans of Italian Gothic horror in general.
