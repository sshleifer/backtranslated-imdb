"Toi le Venin" is the masterpiece of Robert Hossein and one of the great thrillers of the 1950s. Based on the novel by Frederic Dard, a writer often co-directed by the director (see also "le Monte-Charge," which Hossein did not say but who was also the lead), the screenplay grabs you from the first pictures on the desert road at night, when a beautiful blonde may be the worst of those criminals in a mysterious house where he finds his femme fatale ... and her sister. the game of cat and mouse begins. One of the nurses is on a wheelchair. But is she really disabled? Which one is a criminal who was trying to kill a hero at the time? <br /> <br /> Two actresses, Marina Vlady and the late Odile Versois were sisters. <br /> <br /> Turn off all the lights before you watch. Highly exciting.
