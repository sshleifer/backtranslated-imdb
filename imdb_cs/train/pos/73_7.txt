This is basically a variation on House of Wax, both in the plot and in the role of the star of the two films, Vincent Price. In both paintings, he plays a talented artist who is sent over the edge into insanity, when his creations are assuaged by other, less talented and less smart people. In this film, designers play illusions for scenic wizards who strive to act in a career just to be frustrated when another illusionist, great Rinaldo (John Emery), honors his treaty and gives him the first choice of any illusions, which he proposes. The price is badly placed against Rinaldi because his ex-wife is now paramour Rinaldi. He uses his talents as an illusionist and a brilliant mimic to revenge Rinaldi and others who have defeated his plans for recognition as an artist and designer. The prize is almost the whole show and the well-rated star turns like a spoiled person, whose fortune makes the audience sympathy. The rest of the cast is competent if it is colorless and the weight of the whole business falls to a price that bore the burden with ease. solid B Film melodrama, it's a crime film rather than a horror film and it's nice, provided you do not expect a masterpiece. The shot in black and white is low on the gore and is best seen as a melodrama and enjoyed in the presence of his star giving idiosyncratic performance
