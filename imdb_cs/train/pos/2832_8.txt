I saw this film in 1969 when he was first released at the Cameo Theater on South Beach, now a famous Crowbar Night Club. It was the last year of wild 60 years and this movie really came home. She has everything; generational gap, sexual revolution, the search for success and the conflict between the following "traditions" of the family and those who seek their own way in life. It was a fast, very nice film. Vegas was at the hippiest peak, Sin City in all is glory. Beautiful women, famous portraits, laughter, conflicts, romance and even a happy ending. Very pleasant time over all. <br /> <br /> The poster of this film lies on the wall of your bedroom. I look at it and come back in time; the time of my youth and my times with my father, a great time in my life.
