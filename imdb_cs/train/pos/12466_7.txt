If the first film by Jean Renoir "The Whirlpool of Destiny" first brings us into the world of the peasant life of the peasantry, which will continue to explore, it seems appropriate that his second film is largely concerned with the rich and privileged upper classes, who are trying to bend upwards. Put the characters from the first two films together and you have the seeds of his great "great illusion" and "game rules". It is beautifully shot, while the turbulent camera takes full advantage of the incredibly vast apartments and backstage that dominate the interiors of the film, and playing, though often overcrowded, also offers some great moments, especially from Muffatt Werner Krauss. But the charming and furious Mrs. Hessling, who first seems to be giving Louise Brooks a way for her money in clamping, never goes beyond one note, selfish portraits. Maybe this is in part a problem with a scenario that usually looks at high points and excited emotions; that I did not read a novel, I'm not entirely clear whether the choices are well done or not. <br /> <br /> However, the differences between the Nana suitors are well-drawn and I particularly like the relationship between Muffat and Vandeuvres Jean Angelo - a tragic understanding that seems to have each of them their ultimate fate and compassion with others, especially in the scene at the bottom of a huge staircase, where Vandeuvres warns Muffat, and we ask if violence erupts - this and other revelation of the absurdity of rich help give the film the depth it has. Far from his greatest success, and for me, just a shy "Whirlpool of Destiny," it's still worth seeing for fans of Renoir or those interested in a quiet cinema in general.
