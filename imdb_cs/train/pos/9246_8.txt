One of the great secrets of life that suffered daily is why pretty girls are so often interested in predators and heels rather than pretty boys. <br /> <br /> It's worse when dear boys even want to marry those girls, girls still prefer bulls and heels, even after their pupils and heels have shown their contempt, they have shown they have interest in using the girl. Stu Erwin is a nice guy who is still nice after being deceived and cheated and even after he completely lost the girl. Clark Gable is a jerk and he is perfect in the role, a rather sad note to his fans. </ Jean Harlow encounters as leaner Mae West, even sounded like La West in some of her cynical throwaway lines. It's a little mysterious that so many other characters, I intended to be bad - I mean, hell, they're locked up, so they must be - they're obviously nice people. In fact, there are a lot of nice people, people who, in the woods movie or story, would grow up and back-stabbing, but they are going out of the way to help someone else. So, maybe the story is a clichÃ©, at least modern standards, but eventually the viewer will like to watch. <br /> <br /> The biggest complaint I have is that so many really good actors are not given. Again, we can say that "IMDb.com" is passionate about "Thank you".
