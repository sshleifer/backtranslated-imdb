Cheryl's best seller of horror, her husband Tom (sympathetic Paolo Serra) and their son Bobby (played nicely by Patrizio Vinci) are going to a summer holiday in a remote summer vacation. A local legend says the area is cursed. Cheryl discovers a haunted, hairy, ugly sorcerer (fat David Flosi in a strikingly striking costume) living in the basement. Cheryl has to overcome her deep-rooted child's fear of the beast to defeat a bad find. Director / co-author Lamberto Bava performs a professional work in creating and maintaining a scary and disturbing night's mood. In addition, Bava avoids standard bloody screaming in favor of the crafty and provocative dark adult tale of how best to overcome what frightens us is to face the source head. Peaceful support comes from Sabrina Ferilli as friendly teacher Anna, Stefanie Montorsi as hottie babysitter Maria and Alex Serra as painter Dario. Gianfranco Transunto has shiny cinematography, boasting several fluid imagery and a lot of atmospheric lighting. Fabrizio Sforza is a lazy make-up f / x, Simon Boswell is a spirited spooky'n'shuddery score, and a dark, dark, spider-covered cellar set all hit the skin crawl space. It's worth seeing.
