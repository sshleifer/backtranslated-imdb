I know that originally this movie was not a hit box, but in light of recent Hollywood releases (most of them were definitely excluded from the formulation, less conspiratorial conspiracy, "save-the-blonde-chick-no-matter-what" the film, as well as the book, loses its anchor in some historical affairs, but it depicts a unique American dilemma built against the uniquely horrible American institution of human enslavement and some of its tragic (and entertaining and touching) <br /> <br /> And the worthy dedication is the young Robert Ri'chard, occupied as a leading figure, Marcel, whose idealistic enthusiasm is truly universal as he sets himself up at the beginning of his "upcoming age" only to be cruelly disappointed by the team , which turns out to have become his true education in the paths of the southern plantation world of Louisiana, at the height of the antebellum period. When I saw thumbnails with (dreaded) blond-haired Ri'chard, I was expecting buffoon, fop, cartoon - I was pleasantly surprised. Ossie Davis, later Ruby Dee Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Victoria Rowell, and even Jasmine Guy give live paintings and impressive skills as tapers placage, voodoo, creole "aristocracy" and hait rebellions woven into this story of human passion, hatred, love, family, and racial mistrust in a society that is supposedly gone, yet it is still with us.
