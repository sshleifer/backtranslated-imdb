yeah, it's a little silly movie, so if you're looking for Oscar performance, forget about this ...... but if you love John Candy's humor, it's necessary. We lost John Candy before he got enough of his great comedy, and he's better off in one movie: planes, trains and cars (with Steve Martin). Excellent supportive performance from Eugene Levy, perhaps his best work ever like the hot-blooded Sal DiPasquale. Also good acting by Richard Libertini, Alley Mills & Pat Hingle. If you are a fan of John Candy or Eugen Levy, you must see this obscure and printed movie.
