I just saw The Saint Strikes Back and found it pretty good. This was George Sanders's first appearance as a saint, replacing Louise Hayward. In this, the saint is sent to San Francisco to investigate shooting at the nightclub. With the help of his famous inspector Fernack, who came from New York, the boss's daughter helped the crime. The Sanders in the cast are Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad holy movie. Worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars of 5.
