In 1967, I visited the Lake Elsinore glider and flew to Pratt Read. To return to Germany the aforementioned serious run on television and one segment related to high altitude flights in California in the early 1950s. (The real-life pilot was Bill Ivans, I do not know who played it in the show) It turned out that the wing in the movie was the same (the same number N) as I was flying on Elsinore Lake. From the moment I saw this segment, I searched for it and wondered if it was available anywhere. (other segments that were serious were related to the Baker Ejection Seat, a tool for finding avalanche victims and others.
