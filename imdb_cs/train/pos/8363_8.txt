This is one of the better classic Edgar Wallace films from the German series - it contains all the basic information about a very pleasant film from the crime film Wallace from the 1960s: Although his Majesty Mr. Kinski is missing, you still have a young Joachim Blacky "Fuchsberger, who again plays as a typical the clever American "feminine," you have a young Eddi Arendt in his best (and equally typical) role at all - a cool, sophisticated British servant - and you have (not so young) Lowitz as a melancholic, yet very "dry" ironic funny) police investigator, plus a frog mask (from now title title!) You get a wonderful and very nice "bad guy", you get dazzling rocking sound, classic b-film action scenes, partially shot off the wildest views of your birth!), the cry of the queen, and on and on ... All you ing the rediens shuddered well in a cocktail of sweet coffee in the clean German camp of Edgar Wallas - we highly recommend !!
