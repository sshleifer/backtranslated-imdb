First, do not go to the revolver that is waiting for another Snatch or Lock Stock, that's another kind of gangster movie. At night I saw a gala and this film definitely divided the audience. It's a kind of movie where half of the audience lets think what it was? It was terrible, and the other half left to think what it was? It was great. I personally like movies I do not understand, like Mullholland Drive and Usual Suspects, so I enjoyed the Revolver. <br /> <br /> It was definitely not perfect. I noticed that the big turnover comes a mile away, at least in part, and although there are sometimes some loose ends remaining inexplicable, Revolver leaves many questions inexplicable for no reason. Also, some scenes such as animation and the scene where Sorter goes to a killing spree (actually one of my favorites), though it seemed that the amazing scenes to watch looked like because they were great to watch, not because of the movie. <br /> <br /> But there were also many good things. I thought the acting was excellent from all major actors, Jason stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore and even Andre Benjamin (which was a pleasant surprise). This movie has definitely kept my interest, with one great, exciting, scene behind the other scene. When Ray Liotta was held under the table, you have to see it. The script was extremely well done, and the soundtrack, like most of Guy Ritchie's films, was great. Though it's a step behind such movies as Fight Club, Mullholland Drive and Usual Suspects, it was still an amazing fast, psychological, action-packed movie with many twists and turns, and lots of scenes you remember long after the movie ended.
