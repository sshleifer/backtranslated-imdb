OK, this movie was cool. I do not think it was the best movie ever made, but it was fun. My brother and I are always talking about the scenes, and occasionally pulling the film out of the case, blowing the dust and going in. It's nice to the end, but a great concept. This is a movie that one must forget about criticism together and just enjoy it. Judgment is the victory of Robot Jox.
