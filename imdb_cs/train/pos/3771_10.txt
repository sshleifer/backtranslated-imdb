In 1991, two of the best sequels of all time were released: TERMINATOR 2: Decision Day and BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY. Of the two, I like BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY a bit better. TERMINATOR 2: A GOOD DAY is better, but there's nothing like Bill and Ted. In addition to Chris Farley and David Spade in TOMMY BOY, it's hard to think of a larger comedy duo than Bill and Ted. They are unique. <br /> <br /> Apparently influenced by O.C. National Lampoon. and Stiggs, Bill and Ted created Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, two incredibly talented writers who invented a duo while performing at the local LAA theater. in 80's. Two quickly began writing a two-story script and BILL & TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE was born first. The film, shot in 1987 and released in 1989, has become a great success of boxing and instant culture. It was not long before work began to continue. Stephen Herek, director of "EXCELLENT ADVENTURE," was not interested in continuing to work because he thought it was too bad and unlike the first one, so Peter Hewitt, who debuted on feature film, was brought to manage the sequel. He could not be a better director for this work. BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is beautifully managed. It is filled with its own unique style and energy that can not be compared. What makes "BOGUS JOURNEY" one of the best sequels at all is that while it's darker than the original, it's just fun. It will not change characters like most of the sequels. Bill and Ted are the same kind of characters as they were in the first movie. This is because it was written by the original writers. Most of the sequel is not written by the same writers as the first, but because "BOGUS JOURNEY" had the same scriptwriters, it ended up as good as "EXCELLENT ADVENTURE" if not even better. Just as the first is "BOGUS JOURNEY" absolutely cheerful, well written, fun and especially original. It is full of spectacular special effects and fantastic comic performances from Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves and William Sadler. It's an unforgettable journey. 10/10
