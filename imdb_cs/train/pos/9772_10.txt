Theodore Rex is perhaps the greatest film experience of all time and is certainly a milestone in human culture, civilization and artistic expression! In this stunning intellectual masterpiece, Jonathan R. Betuel co-opens with great 20th-century filmmakers such as Francis Ford Copola, Martin Scorcese, Orson Welles and Roman Polanski. The special effects are nothing but breathtaking, and Spielberg does any job look trut and elementary. At the time of his release, Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary gem that highlighted filmmaking at levels that the filmmakers had never expected. The notion of not only a movie with a dinosaur, but an adaptation of the exciting, exciting, exciting detective novel that follows the "talking" dinosaur with a postmodern name like "Theodore," and the existential cop turned to humanity as we know it. The world could never be the same after experiencing such beautiful beauty. Watching Theodore Rex is like looking at God's face and hearing he says, "You are my most favorite creature." This is one of the few movies that are just PROSTŘÍ !!!
