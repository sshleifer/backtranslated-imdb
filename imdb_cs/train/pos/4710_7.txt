As far as parodies are concerned, there is little that is worth time and energy. but with the recent revival of terrible parodies such as Date Movie and The Comebacks, it's a touch of fresh air to come back and discover a truly fun farce like Johnny Dangerously. After mother has no end to health problems, little Johnny works for the crowd. What is happening is a series of gags, most of which work, but sometimes they are flops. But a strange gangster who can not handle the American language (the least wickedly wise) is a rival gangster with an inclination to fire his mouth (... once!), Younger brother with D.A. who is out to get Johny out of danger, and the hot young hot star for his affection have Johnny busy. And the viewer will have a busy laugh, for the most part, as every gangster-film clich√© is skilfully talented and decent writing. <br /> <br /> Not perfect long shot, but definitely good for a smile on the wrong day.
