I've heard of Eddie Izzard, but I've never seen him in action. I knew it was a transvestite, and when I saw the last time he went to HBO in HBO last summer, I did it without knowing how my husband would react. Well, he threw us away. He's better than Robin Williams. He has total control over the audience; when he does that "Englebert is dead - no, no," routine, the audience does not know what he thinks to the end. God like James Mason is also inspired by his touch and his version of the Python Spanish Inquisition, carried out by the Church of England - "Cake or Death?" is invaluable. My jaws were laughing after the show. After a few months we searched the TV lists to see it again, and they were lucky to stick it on the next arrival. If you can see this show, cancel everything and stick it, you will not be disappointed.
