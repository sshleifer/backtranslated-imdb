No hidden agenda. Pure scifi. All fun. <br /> <br /> I saw the original on TV and I was terribly wrong. I was a kid :) <br /> <br /> The original one can be appreciated more in comparison to the new I've seen and forgotten. The original movie starring starring star film star Steve McQueen (BULLET) is by far the better and the smallest one one can see. Film production is dated but fx is used to test time. I was convinced that the thing was moving alone. 10/10 <br /> <br /> -Views
