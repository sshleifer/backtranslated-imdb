Monarch Cove was one of the best Friday's drama that has proven to be a long time. I ask the writer to write a long series and send it to life, SOON. Every person was very interesting and he did a great job with his lines of plot became a reality. However, the film must continue for a long time. I would like to see that Bianca and Jake's child grow up and gain a leading role in the film along with new grandparents who are planning her future. Also bring the kathy back to see her niece and help her support her life. It was great to see grandparents solve their problems, but the family business needed to be restored to work and see Jake and Bianca survive marriage for years.
