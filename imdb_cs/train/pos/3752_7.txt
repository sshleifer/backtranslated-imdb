This film is unusual and bizarre and is very unusual and bizarre. I give this short 7 just because it is so unique and out of the wall, but most of the time seems like it's bizarre just because it's bizarre. If the film managed to integrate its bizarre moments into some form of plot, it would be really fantastic. The main problem here is that the creators seem to have gathered a bunch of spatula bits, then put a bunch of crap into the bunch, sounding as if it sounded funny, coming from the mouth of the spatula. It is definitely worth checking out, but it is not the highest measure by every section of the creators of the wild idea.
