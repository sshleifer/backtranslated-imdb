If it was just a great animation, it was great. This film is classic because it is strong, there are two simple aspects: story and character. The characters in this movie are beautifully personified. I felt all the characters and the human-animal relationship in the movie works perfectly. Beautiful animation and 3-D computer animation did not work better in any other movie. It's a great movie for kids and adults who want a classic hero's journey. 8 out of 10.
