I went to the cinema with two of my friends and I chose this movie out of my hat without knowing what to expect. And it turns out to be a very pleasant, sad experience! It's a great movie with a very unexpected story, very good dialogues and crazy humor. All the characters are probably made in "Alan Ford" (Italian satirical comic) style, but it did not bother me for a while. In fact, this kind of porno-bums line-up made the film totally unique and interesting. Sam Rockwell gave a very good and persuasive role, to Williams Macy as well, Clooney is hardly recognizable and brilliant. But the real star is actually Guzman. He has played the role of his life in this movie! The scene in which his character Cosimo dies in the movie is so cheerful that I was strangled and almost died with him! We highly recommend all fans of "Alan Ford"!
