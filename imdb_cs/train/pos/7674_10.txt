I had the privilege of watching Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival last week. What a Strong and Exciting Story! Holly is a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl who sells to prostitution with her own family and lives in a brothel in Cambodia. Patrick (American) comes to Holly's life and decides he wants to help her. When Holly sold again, Patrick is desperately looking for her. We see it is a difficult journey through Cambodia, and we hope to meet. Holly is one of the millions of children who are sold and traded each day. The movie shows this difficult problem without crossing the line. I went away to know more about the problem of child trafficking and asked how can I help? This movie should be seen by everyone because it is a beautiful story and explains a problem that we should not ignore.
