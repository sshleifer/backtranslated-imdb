I remember that I had such an effort when he was released for the first time. James "Not Jim" Belushi, actress and brown title John Hughes. You could not pay me for it 15 years ago. But it got me in the spotlight when I took the Sunday afternoon, and it occurred to me at several levels. The fairy tale (part Pretty Woman, part reverse Pretty Woman), very vulnerable, Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street-like performance by Kelly Lynch, escape. All in all, gently pulls out some very nice strings. It's quite hard not to fall into the story, shuffle to Kelly Lynch, identify with James Belushi, do not like the tough bad guy and laugh at Curley Sue. It has all the ups and downs with a happy end and the kind of message you want to hear. Continue, waste your time on this movie, it's worth it.
