And I gave her a high 7 ..... <br /> <br /> Why? Because it nodded bloody well. At a time when there were many other shows that were tied with toys / games, this show was unique in having overlapping stories. As others have said, it was some time ago. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that's why the show was condemned. He released 4 DVDs with 16 episodes of the series. I hope more will come out. <br /> <br /> It compares it now 20 years after it first came out .. I do not know that I like it despite the sometimes clumsy animation and that IMHO is just a mistake. <br /> <br /> I hope for more DVDs or even a set of all episodes in the right order ... DVDs are good but I do not think that stories are in their right order, but the show was still rocking.
