You sit there for half an hour and watch the story, believe it all, then let's look at another half-hour of the same story that will completely fall apart ... and then come back again. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting films at the International Film Festival in San Francisco is a documentary. I do not know if - besides Andrew Jarecki "Capturing the Friedmans" - something like "Broken Bow" by Anna Broinowski sometimes appeared. It contains, reveals, defends, reveals, and challenges everything about Norma Khouri, the author of "Honor Lost," the acclaimed bestseller of Honor Killing in Jordan in 2001. What is incredible and what makes the movie so extraordinary is that this "exposure" of Khouri is happening with the full participation of Khouri. For the early part of the film Khouri presents her story about the supposed killing of her friend Amman, the story of the book. It sounds completely trustworthy and convincing. Then her story breaks down, revealing seemingly credible and persuasive people such as women's rights activists in Jordan, investigating journalists and Australia where Khouri lived for a while. <br /> <br /> Khouri returns and denies the allegations, and has successfully done a successful lie detector in this process. There is another segment of destructive exposures - not specified here because it would reduce the value of shock ... and then Khouri returns and faces accusations (not all but essential in the book). /> <br /> And Houdini's act continues, following the round after this heavy weight, for the first time a surprise surprise - and there is no "happy end" in the resolution. Brilliant.
