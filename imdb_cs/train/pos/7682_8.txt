Holly deals with child sexual abuse, which is uncontrollable around the globe (with about 2 million children being traded every year) and doing so sensitively and without manipulation - a high instruction that makes the team with priority films a great success. American actor Ron Livington starred in the movie along with newcomer Thuy Nguyen, a Vietnamese actress who plays Holly, and together they bring on screen what is common to people in the notorious K11 Redlight neighborhood in Cambodia. Although it deals with the heavy theme, the film holds moments of laughter and hope, because we recognize the characters up close and keep a two-hour film such that it is too difficult to watch. I am glad that such a film brings the world's attention to this problem. Child prostitution has to be stopped and this is a very good first step. It's a great movie and every movie has to see.
