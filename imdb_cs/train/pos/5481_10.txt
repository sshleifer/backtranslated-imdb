It was more arouse for me to realize that most of what we see, hear, read and think about, depends on what the media feed on us. This is a classic example of high-level spin doctors who attempt to control mass through controlled information. It is also an excellent example of how people with an institution that they have freely bought will not be influenced by this media control nor by attempts at incorrect information. It again shows that at the end of the day many need to outweigh the needs of several. It is also clear that in a country where there is no religious civil war, democracy is not a real hard thing to realize.
