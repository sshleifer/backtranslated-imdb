I saw this movie again and noticed how close it is to the novel, if we ignore part of Cary's childhood [Leslie Howard]. Since the obsession with Mildred [Bette Davis] is very well passed to the audience when the screen does not show much [not that much in the novel]. I recommend this movie to anyone who has ever fallen behind the other person and the other side has tried to use him or her. I read that Maugham was asked to make a novel for sale, but when he started studying, he started crying and could not finish more than a few lines and the whole project was dropped. It can be said that the novel is written from the heart and the film is a good adaptation of at least part of his work.
