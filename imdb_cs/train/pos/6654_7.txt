The film shot a new look into Gandhi's life, which is nice to see and show what a person is. His relationship with Harillo is something that Gandhi was struggling with and referred to him several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography. My big problem is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly uncharacteristic in the film. It could have been better to act on the person who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too lonely, and he seemed to have been deliberately drawn in negative parts in some parts of the film. The film is not really versatile but focuses only on the relationship between father and son. The rest is blurred and only used to display the time frame and general movie settings. Total nice movie if you do not forget it's not a complete picture.
