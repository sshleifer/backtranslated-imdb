This show has come so far. First, all in the cast from Eric to Fez were all new actors and actresses, fresh faces, and just seeing what they did. They stayed with the show and it was a success. It's one of the best performances ever made, and probably the most entertaining sitcom I've ever seen in my life. It will be sad to see it over, but if it ends this show, I hope God that the series finishes with one of the biggest bangs that some final season ever had. I do not care if the whole season is upset because it saves all the fuel for the final episode. Go swinging and get one last shot. The exhibition deserves, fans deserve it if they go, they all know it will end up, as with friends, and let the final be huge. I say that Donna and Eric got married, I say Hyde and Kelso fight and they will become friends again. I'll say something interesting between Fez and Jackie, because Fez has been trying for so long, but of course it will not work for him. YOU ARE CLOSE SERIES OF LARGE TIMES! <br /> <br /> The 70th edition will always be the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, I wish I had you as friends. You are the best! <br /> <br />
