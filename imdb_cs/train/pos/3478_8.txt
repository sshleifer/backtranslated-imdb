This was actually my favorite Scooby Doo series when I was younger. I thought each episode had more to do and the villains had a lot of creative thoughts (and even scary and credible). Some of the best episodes were "I left my neck in San Francisco," "Twenty thousand scream under the sea," "Ghoul, the bat and the ugly," and "When you want the star of the creature." If you have never seen these episodes, please. This series was a bit of a mixed bag, although there were other episodes that did not seem to have the same edge as "Rocky Mountain YIIII!" and "The Return of Boss Scooby". Just like the series before him, it was very well together, interesting story and brilliantly cartoon. As everyone says it would be much better without Scrappy Doo. The character was tedious and disturbed the story that was narrated.
