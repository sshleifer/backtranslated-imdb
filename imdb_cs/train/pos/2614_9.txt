Why was not it released? I thought it had to be a bit of garbage because it was not. How bad a girl can be! This film is one fascinating word. <br /> <br /> You will be interested. He gets his attention from the beginning and his pace never slows down. The last part of the movie, the "episode" as it was (you did not see anything, you saw it in a trailer) is also overlooked. Choose your favorite, you will be shocked, you will not be able to go and you will make a cup of coffee because you need to find out what will happen. Adrenaline rises and you can not look. Cudos to the actors, it's very plausible. And they will not stop there, they have the ultimate shock for you. It also challenges reality TV and if you watch. And how far from us are we really? Endemol (who makes a big brother) last year made a television show in the Netherlands in which patients in need of a transplant offer the kidney of a dying woman. The show was eventually revealed as a scam, seemingly raised awareness of organ donation, but we get too close for comfort?
