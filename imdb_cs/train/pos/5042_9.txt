The synopsis for this movie does a great job explaining what to expect. It's a very good thriller. Good shot. It's hard to believe it was Bill Paxton's debut, though some pictures look exactly like the script. <br /> <br /> Still, there are several pictures that really look good and show true imagination from Paxton. <br /> <br /> It's a solid story with some great twists, a few of them, all credible, entertaining, and best of all covered so well that they are real twists. <br /> <br /> Children's actors in the movie are also great. I'm usually wary of movies with children playing in roles because they're too often leaving because Nickelodeon refuses but both of these kids do a good job. This movie is not horrifying. It's not very scary. But it's very, very scary.
