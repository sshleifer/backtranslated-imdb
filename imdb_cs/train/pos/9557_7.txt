I love this anime! I'm laughing away with all the jokes and violence (mostly from reluctant Akane Ranma but a short temperate "fianc√©e") so Ranma's slapstick deserves it, but he's trying everything to change ... clumsily. The main character, Ranma, goes to China to train only to fall into the cursed Jusenkkyo Spring and turn to the girl when cold water splashes. Since then, it's pure chaos one after another. Between the shots is a crazy brother and sister duo Kuno and Kodachi, a sexy shampoo, prone Happosai, which causes trouble for our heroes / heroines. However, it is Ranma's selfish father, Genma, who most of the time blame him for being the culprit. If someone wants an anime that's funny, it's the one. It's nicer and better with Japanese oak.
