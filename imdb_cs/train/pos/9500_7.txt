I saw this movie on TV and fascinated the beauty of Jennifer McComb. It was a clean movie that you can watch for the beauty of Africa and of course for McComb. At that time I was thrilled to watch this movie and since then I've been trying to get the VCD of this movie, but I can not find it. Huge African Lions appear in their film and we are limited by the magnitude of these animals and their graces. All of the audience can watch this movie, especially children will enjoy this movie. But some scenes involving McCobb's parenting power for this film. It's a nice holiday film for everyone.
