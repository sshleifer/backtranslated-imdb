SHIRLEY TEMPLE Short subject. <br /> <br /> In the Buttermilk Pete Caf√©, it can be very harsh when it comes to the local peculiarity of the BARBAN WAR BABIES dressed in diapers for their milk break at noon. <br /> <br /> A primitive little movie - the spoof of military films - provides a couple of giggles, but little: small tips that speak hard can begin to develop in the short term. Shirley Temple, who plays double-hip-swinging French, does not have much work in this pre-premiere work. Highlight: the actual hints of a toddler temperament when a few children unexpectedly get well and really dabbed with milk. Often overlooked or neglected today, one and two-reel short items were useful for studies as important training grounds for new or growing talents, both in front and behind the camera. The dynamics of creating a successful short subject was completely different from the dynamics of the film, which resembled writing scripts rather than novels. Economic output in terms of budget and timetable and capable of rendering a wide range of materials, short items were a perfect complement to feature films.
