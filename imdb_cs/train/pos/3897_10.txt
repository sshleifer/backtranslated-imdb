This video was my first exposure to Eddie Izzard. During one night we had several friends and for some reason we had the opportunity to visit HBO during the evening. Someone under the name "Eddie Izzard" was on. I tried not to sound too loud at the first vices. I did not want to be "responsible" for the rest of the group enjoying something that, of course, kills me. After lying in my laugh more than she was healthy, I set out - just like the rest of us (by the way, we were not stoned or talked about insurance and pensions ...). We were then killed. Stories, conspiracies, bizarre, but brilliant connections through sketches are nothing but clarity. Since then, I have been addicted to every Eddie-Izzard comedy I can get in my hands. His work is a pure genius. His comedy seems effortless. It looks more like a hysterically funny friend hanging around your house and longing for this or that ... It's convulsively funny. It gives you the impression that the joke is between you ... and alone, the only real lover of humor. If you're disappointed in this video, you have no sense of the last-minute humor - or humor, as they say in the UK.
