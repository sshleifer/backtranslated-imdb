I was overwhelmed by this film. It contained the basic elements of depression, grief, loneliness, despair, hope, dreams, and society. He was not just a brilliant musician who hit the bottom of the bottom, but it was probably a man who was grieving to find drastically the comfort of his music. Finds a companion who comes up with his own problems. Claire and Des were able to provide each other with friendship and love, but more important is the conclusion of the events that shaped their lives to the worst. <br /> <br /> Des is an unlikely character according to today's rock star standards. Yet he has a musical genius. In the past, he has an event that has led him to stagnation, while the things around him are literally falling apart. His focus is the creation of his whaling music, in fact becoming an obsession for him. Claire is a streetwise child who needs a place to stay. She finds hidden talent when she's in Des Society. She also finds a friend who accepts her. He's been taught to trust him for some time. <br /> <br /> These two are looking for love among themselves. No mind blows, sex has driven some passion, but love, where friendship and understanding means more. For the two people who were hurt, they will find trust together.
