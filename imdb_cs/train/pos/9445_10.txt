It's undoubtedly one of the best movies I've ever seen. I first saw her for about 9 or 10 years. I started looking for some rape scene before. And when I saw it, I was really shocked by the idea, "What is a bad movie?" Today I've seen it from the beginning and really understood how great this movie really is. It's exciting, frightening, shocking, and in its own way disturbing. The best thing, however, is the end when the audience has shown that this experience will haunt the characters for the rest of their lives. He will torture his conscience and fear for the rest of his life about the bodies in the river. And there's nothing to do with it, it's something to live with. This end is one of the most unfortunate endings of film history and is very clever, brilliant and frightening. And acting is also great, especially Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds. The spectacular acting in this movie. Overall, John Boorman has created one of the best films in the history of the film based on the novel by Dick Chaney. It must be seen for all movie lovers
