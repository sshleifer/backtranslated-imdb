Surely one of the smallest musicals Astaire / Rogers. It is very poorly rendered and moved. It runs only a few minutes longer than Swing Time, for example, but feels much longer. This is partly due to the secondary novel between Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard. Scott is rarely interesting. I like Hilliard. It's sweet and I love at least one of her songs: "But where are you?" ("Get Satan behind me," her other number is a weak remnant of Top Hat, fortunately cut out of this masterpiece). Watching the fleet would in fact be a bad film if not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between Astaire and Rogers. The dance competition focuses on the first place of any of their numbers. Dance is just fantastic. "I put all my eggs in one basket" is a two dance test, which has not yet finished. His imperfections make it even more perfect. And "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is easily one of Irving Berlin's best songs. The movie is worth watching for its great moments.
