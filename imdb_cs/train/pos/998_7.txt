It's a really interesting movie. It's an action film with mixed comedy. Foxx joins with Epps comics in this film to give him comic rotation. He'll think about what happens to Foxx. It was a well-shot film, the director used the right colors in this movie (dark blue colors) to give him the right feeling. Kimberly Elise has also starred in this movie and is always pleased to see her on the big screen. He plays his role well. Even Jamie Kennedy is in this movie. It is worth seeing that you have not seen it. It's definitely worth it if you're a fan of Jamie Foxx. It deserves more credit than it really is.
