Steve Carell plays Dan Burns, the uncle of newspaper agonies and the devoted father of one father. With a great family return, Dan meets his perfect wife just to find out he's in touch with his brother. What is a person doing? "Dan in Real Life," but I would imagine the success or failure of this movie will be whether you're willing to accept Steve Carell, who plays the role relatively straightforward and restrained, rather than going through the broad comic moves that have done it so successful. If you can not accept it, do not worry, "Get Smart" will be later in the year, but I thought it was very good for the record. <br /> <br /> "Dan In Real Life" begins as your typical, amusing, family drama, but it's fun and fun as it goes, and Carel's frustration is growing. It's not a massive original (but if you only saw movies with original ideas, the movie tracks would be very rare, right?), But "Dan In Real Life" is fun and good acting in love at first glance with the light Juliette Binoche?) the most accurate enough script that contains many considerations about the meaning and passion of love. I hope Steve Carell is pushing and doing something so interesting.
