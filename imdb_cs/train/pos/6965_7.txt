This film answers the question of how the relationship survives when your girlfriend is addicted, clinging, needed, jealous ... and has strengths and abilities far beyond the deadly women? Without losing the movie, I can safely assure you it's not, but it's great fun. Uma Thurman is perfect because she is a super-heroine who is the mysterious name of G-Girl and who, unlike most of her sisters, do not always like Truth, Justice, and the American Way. <br /> <br /> Thurman is also credible as a thoroughly exhausted, yet still nobleman, Curator Jenny. When G-Girl is thrown away for a less-endowed but more emotionally safer and well-tuned rival, it is ballistic and what follows is not nice. It's funny, but it's not nice. It's a wonderful assumption that hell has no fury as a superhero, and those who have taken it do not take it, but it has its own moments, and I think I'll get a DVD. <br /> <br /> I like this movie ..
