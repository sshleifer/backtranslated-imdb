I just finished watching the movie and wanted to give the movie my own opinion (and justice). First, to make things straight, this film is not pretending to be anything but a solid action comedy movie. It does not aim to revolutionize the film industry and get critical feedback, nor does it want to be considered as one. If you really want to enjoy this movie, I suggest that you eliminate the critical idea and the desire for a good conspiracy because you will not find any. With what we've realized, we're going to the movie. I had little expectation for this movie because it did not have a strong plot (yes, the audience, I also underestimated this film), but I never expected to like this movie very much. I even enjoyed more than Stephen Chow's moves (which I consider to be Kung Fu Hustle for his best efforts, and that I would have rated him as 9). The action is tense and epic, while the comedy beats at the right places. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS alert, I think the action could be unreal, but why would I want to watch a serious basketball movie anyway? There are plenty of other sports movies (drama) that have already done well, why create more? SPOILERS ends <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why you are reading it. Go on and look at it. Just remember, do not think - just watch, enjoy, smile, laugh and every moment they (the film industry) create masterpieces such as Pulp Fiction or The Godfather movies and sometimes create movies that are better in the stack of dump. I'm not saying that Kung Fu Dunk deserves recognition that they have the previous examples, and then, when we talk about the Stephen Chow-ish comedy, it's ten of the best. <br /> <br /> love: -no braine movies with really good action -Kung Fu -Death Trance -Kung Fu and comedy -how the hell, watch it. you will have a great time. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for you to cast Kung Fu Dunk. ^ _ ^
