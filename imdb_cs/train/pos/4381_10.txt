This dramatic drama has everything: top acting, incredible photography, a good story. It is often compared to "Braveheart," because both films take place in historic Scotland. Even though I love Braveheart, I think it's better than both movies. Jessica Lange gave an incredible performance (nominated for the Oscar). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the lead role. Tim Roth plays one of the worst, more despised figures in the history of the film (he was nominated for an Oscar). John Hurt is excellent as Lord Montrose, another enemy figure. I am always surprised by the incredible range of characters that John Hurt can play. This is the story of a money dispute between Rob Roy and his clan and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is the man he invented himself, but his problems with Montrose will not solve if he breaks his sense of honor. Montrose, who inherited his title, has no sense of honor. And that's basically what this story is all about; the honor of a common man against the corruption of the nobility. This movie is very funny, it should appeal to everyone. She has romance, action, beautiful scenery and has an exciting plot. One of my favorite movies.
