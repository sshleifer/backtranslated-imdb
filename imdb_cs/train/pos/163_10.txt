The first director Tom Kiesche returns the winning film in the spirit of cutting, a dark comedy. Spent on the budget that had a chance, but he had a taste of Blood Simple's short film movie soon ... and throw some Monty Python flavors into the shoes! It needs to be seen more than once to appreciate all the elements that bring one scene to the next. Expect more good things to come from this writer-director-actor.
