I thought Grinch Christmas was a pretty good movie. It was not terrible, not even great, but it was nice to watch. I felt as if Jim Carrey was sometimes annoying. the strange person he needed to be, was ominous, but it turned out to be slow. I thought the landscape, when it was not inside Grinch's cave, was beautiful and there were a few parts where I laughed but most of the time I thought it was just uncomfortable. This movie could be much better if they changed Grinch's personality and included more laughter, because most of the humor was not funny. I liked Grinch's Stole Christmas as well, but that's not what she's excited to see.
