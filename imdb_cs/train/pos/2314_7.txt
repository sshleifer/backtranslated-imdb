I heard good stuff about this movie and you were, you guessed it, a little disappointed. Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly good, surprisingly certain, at a young age; indeed, all (small) castings are fairly solid, in their simple 50s American environment. The reason why I did not rate this movie is that I did not like the end of my life that my older sister seemed so real, and it took me a little out of the movie. Perhaps the conspiracy is waiting for us, or the film must be a little longer. Maureen's character is relatively little developed, I think. It is understandable that Dani (Reese W., Younger) will be traumatized and angry, but why is her sister proven more upset? Because he's a few years older? Did not the end of the rest of the movie end up? Moving the film, Maureen and Court seem to have just met when they got into the tract (warning: this scene is surprisingly brutal, in retrospect it seems she may have tried to shock her a little bit.) It works!). Depends on what you want - if you want a happy story of a girl about a young love that looks as if you were getting, you are surprised. The man on the moon is both quaint and dreamy, so is the rough arrival of the film age? a rather unpleasant combination? But I enjoyed the character of the court, I see the girls watching what they can watch. And I loved having the courage to let him hurt the younger sister (most men would, most movies would not) and kill. 7/10 on my rough rating scale. For some reason, I found Jason London on the tractor funny.
