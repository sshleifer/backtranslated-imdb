Okay, at first it looked like "Shrek," a lonely man who consistently followed a comic jolt. Then he develops into something really convincing because the gloves are set. And the result is a fun movie that has moments that agree that they are too dramatic for kids (like Manny's past). The assumption is probably long worked, so he succeeds in producing a film set with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks) and three characters. It is good to know that they are doing something emotional. As I said, it can sometimes be a trick, so, kids, be warned. Real animation is a real mess. This was not as imitated as stories of toy or shriek movies, and it shows. People are unreal and years ago we have seen better examples of CGI. But do not leave this stain record: like a solo effort, "Ice Age" is praiseworthy. And I gather many fans, I have no doubt. Oh and yes, moments with that little mouse are invaluable and show-theft.
