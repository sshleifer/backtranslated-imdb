From the very beginning I was so excited to see this movie. The poster is perhaps the most amusing thing I've ever seen for the movie. Immediately I bought one for my college in September. Every element is so great in this movie. It's not often when you see a movie with so many penises, homosexual and racial jokes criticized by critics. Carell and the rest of the cast bring every insidious joke sensational. Carell stays sweet over the film, where the end of the movie rooted for him will succeed in his relationship more than you are for him to lay down. Support for the cast is brutal, each of them has some problems with the ladies themselves. One of the things in this movie is the many unforgettable scenes we give. This is what makes the film easy to remember kindly. This film often appears when talking about the terms "chest waxing" and "condoms" in the interviews. <br /> <br /> While watching the theater, I was surprised at how many older people there were to look at it. I saw a group of four forty-year-old women. Despite the older audience, this film still filled the whole theater with laughter. I think people who will like it are the fans of the office and Steve Carell. Many jokes remind me of the type of jokes you could see on Family Guy. The film is shallow enough for teenage boys and is still smart and smart for middle-aged women. I do not recommend going into this movie if you are not a fan of immortality or if you easily offended. However, when you are in the movie, remember that this movie is in good humor. Jokes are not "gay jokes", they are just jokes. And it's funny.
