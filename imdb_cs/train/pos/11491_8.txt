Unborn is a very, very different film. James Karen & Brooke Adams are in the movie and played quite well. this movie stays firm and keeps you. Though I think you have to be a horror fan to watch for scenes and plotting. There is one short, nude scene that could be missed, and for some people this scene may disappoint someone like me who's into the movie and thinks things have destroyed a good movie, but that's when it comes. There's a scene where Adams's character goes nuts and kills a cat, but you can say it's not real. Music is very different but very good. Unlearned, in my opinion, is really a scary movie that is greatly unpredictable and it's quite strange! I recommend all the horror fans of this movie!
