This is best from the high quality "Faerie Tale Theater" series Shelley Duvall. Ugly counselors are a Broadway-based comic relief, and Eva Arden is the personification of a bad half-step mother. Jennifer Beals is doing a great job like Cinderella, especially on the garden scene with Prince Charming Matthew Broderick. Jean Stapleton plays a fairy fairy godmother, although I'm not sure I liked the characterization of the "Southern Lady" with some lines. Steve Martin is a comedic relief as the Royal Orchestra Conductor is Martin's major, but a little bit lost in the show's flow. <br /> <br /> As usual with the series, there are a few horrible comments threw for older children (aged 15 and above). With some small bumps the show overlooks well and lives happily to the end. Children under the age of 8 will continue to watch after the parents finally get tired - I found it to be three times a day because it is too few.
