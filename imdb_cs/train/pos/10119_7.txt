Everyone who is into the incredibly productive work of Takashi Miike may want to think twice that this amazing film will have the first experience with this true director. In line with Miike's practice of working on every work that comes his way and then grab his own feelings on the script, it's basically quite a basic yakuza thriller, with a morally ambiguous policeman to chase the gang that his lawyer brother fell with. What, however, takes the film of the same old old realm is a totally unwavering attitude, so some of the fastest and most terrible violence seen in today's cinematography. And this is not such a nice cold, pure violence that is loved by the American cinema - this is unpleasant, painful and nasty! This means that the pace is desperate, the characters are unusual without being burdened by eccentric shares, Miike's sense of humor is revealed and the most unexpected moments and his camera is never where you expect it, which is hard Watching away from the screen, anything he could show you! No "Ohmigod" end of "Dead or Alive," but if you're not squeamish, it's time to get on board the Miike fleet before ending up on a Hollywood studio "New John Woo" ...
