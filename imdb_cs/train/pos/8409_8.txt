Good movie and one that I will watch several times. The rich (previous commentator) is right: there is much more to be done than it is clear from the title tables, and I have to wonder how much it overcame the translation. Was it more in the original? Or is it expected that a native speaker will read more? Or - because the script was written by the author of the novel he was originally from - it was a popular story, with which the audience was already well known? In short, it's a lot to look like, but it probably requires more work from current audiences than the original 1913 audience had to put in. <br /> <br /> Alpha Video releases a new organ score, but music does not agree with the story in any way. Sure, it starts promising but degenerates into the repetitive monotony of Phillip-Glass similarity that does not reflect anything on the screen. After a while of listening I turned off the sound and just watched: much better!
