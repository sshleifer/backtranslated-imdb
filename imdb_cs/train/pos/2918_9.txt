... I saw it on the cable back in the late 1980s as a big fan of wrestling since 1986. I saw it on VHS in a "sell" basket and bought it. In 1998, I started training for the Air Force as a wrestler, and I always came back to watch it to see how it was a very accurate rendering of the people involved in the wrestling (families and friends who would not understand us, travel, heart, etc.). Henry Winkler is funny and sometimes sad because no one else can understand what is brilliantly creative. A great way to separate the Fonz character that he played on Happy Days at the time. In addition, check out the cast ... William Daniels (Knight Rider), Polly Holiday (Alice) and wrestlers Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr. If you have a chance, look at it.
