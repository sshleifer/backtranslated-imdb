from the perspective of a NASCAR maniac like me, the movie is interesting. Since 1983 you can see many racing cars. Even heavy racing scenes are not as realistic. But I have to admit I did not see any race before 1995 because there were no NASCAR races before in Germany) from the point of view of fan Burt Reynolds I'm, the film is basically what we're used to seeing from Reynolds in the eighties: Burt behind the wheel of fast like Bandit Movies. If you like NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, this movie is a must. If you love just one of these two things, I also recommend watching it. If you do not like NASCAR or Burt Reynolds, you should still give it a chance, but remember that this film was far from winning the Oscar Academy Award. It's a typical humor of the 1980s. If you like movies such as Cannonball Movies and Police Academy, you will also like it.
