Abhay Deol's second film, written by Imtiaz Alia, directed by Shivam Nara. Soha probably has her first (?) Mas role as Megha, a girl who has escaped from home and is waiting for her girlfriend Dheeraj (Shayan Munshi) to meet her. She waits and waits and eventually appears as a distressed girl Ankush (Abhay Deol). She spends many days together as she breaks her from one tough situation to another and finally falls in love with her. Then your friend will return! Aage pardey par dekhiye! Does it sound familiar? This is another adjustment to Dostoevsky's white nights with small loans from Le Notti Bianchi (but very small - Ankush keeps lovers apart by telling his friend that he is dead!). This is a much more realistic (duh) adaptation than the much slower and over-exhausted Saawariya. I wonder why nobody did this little bit when we discussed Saawariy a madness a few months ago. The setting in Delhi is wonderful - it is obligatory to go through old Delhi, footage of Jama Masjid from the top of the roof, Connaught Circus, street with rikousa (Co?). The colorful lights in the hotel are enough to tell you that it's a dirty joint with places to rent an hour! <br /> <br /> More about Abhayi, the more I like this young man. In this second film she is quite good as a witness who has the task of being a beautiful woman in her life. Soha looks beautiful, and when she smiles that she suits her, but in the more serious moments I did not convince her. I'm not quite sure she has a big actress in her, or she might be late for her brother. Himesh Reshammiy's music is not so great, and in fact the film is chasing songs, interrupting narratives, and disagreeing with the characters who are trying to sing. Support for cast is excellent and I give this adaptation of White Nights thumbs up. BTW - the fact that I love the cute holes of Abhay Deol has nothing to do with my evaluation.
