A man about the house is a true sitcom in every sense of the word. The comedy deals with a character called Robin Tripp (played by great Richard O 'Sullivan), who finds himself in a wild party, ends up in the house of two ladies Jo and Chrissy. Ironically, the party was held to say goodbye to their old roommate. The apparent end happens when it moves in. The man was the predecessor of Cook and Mortimer's spin-off show George and Mildred, who featured two characters who owned Jo, Chrissy and Red. These two characters would actually turn out to be the man's link to the house with Mildred (late and much omitted by Yooth Joyce) especially to get some of the best series lines. The poignant nature was Larry (Doug Fisher), an unnecessary person who was always on scrounge and only sometimes came around when he wanted to borrow something (and never come back). a version called three companies, but it does not have a chance compared to this much more fun original. Thames took the risk of producing a comedy about a man who shared an apartment with two women in a very conservative time, but they should care, since ratings at the time suggest that about 20 million people wanted to watch good old fashion comedy inspired casting and a sharp screenplay. What damage to a modern comedy can not achieve to such a high standard. <br /> <br /> This program is available on a network DVD
