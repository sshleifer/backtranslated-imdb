A very underrated black comedy, preferably in a series of big guignol films that follows "Baby Jane". Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young convicted murderers (nodding to "Compulsion") who are fleeing to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for future films, a bunch of fun kids attending terrible moms. Debbie in her blonde wig ("I'm Harlow, you're more Marion Davies," she said to Winters), conducting a concert and winning Weaver's wealthy father. She also makes a deliciously funny tango and, forever, gives excellent performance, unlike anything she has done before. Atmosphere is a great combination of comics and secrets. Looks great with great detail (30 years). Lots of wonderful moves in Hollywood and a scary movie. Micheal MacLiammoir has a ball as a training coach: "Hamilton Starr", which has "two r, but prophetic". See it and love it.
