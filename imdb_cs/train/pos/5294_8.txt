"Pecker" proves that Waters does not intend to change his ancient ways. Lots of things have changed since Waters began filming movies in the 1960s but 40 years later doing what he wants to do. Over the years, Waters' budget has grown considerably. This is one of his latest productions but I was surprised to see that Waters still has the "trailer-park" touch. Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a child who is obsessed with photography. He lives in Baltimore, where he lives, with his friends and family. But Pecker attracts the attention of the artist from New York (always observable by Lili Taylor) and his life is changing to the worst. Waters again makes fun of art, glory and heterosexuality. It's not among his best movies, but there are some big belly laughs ("Memama" has the best lines in the movie!). He's always clever and entertaining and has such a "terrible" sensitivity that I loved in Warters.
