Wrestlemania 14 is often not seen as one of the big Wrestlemania, but I personally put it in my top 5 if not at the top 3. It has so many great things and it really meant the birth of The Attitude Era, which was WWE best time, in my opinion. HBK has a lion's heart, and relocating it through Austin as he did on his path, was clean on his side. It has one of the hottest crowds you've ever seen, and it's J.R and The King when they're notified! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 15 ?? team fight royal LOUD pop for the return of L.O.D. I'm not a royal battle fan, and that's another average. Very predictable, even if you see it 1. it's obvious that L.O.D would win. If we look at the Sun for 8 minutes, it will definitely help us. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> Vs Aguila. <br /> <br /> It also gets a surprising pop with the entrance. Fast, high flying and very exciting. If those two had more time, they would have taken off the roof and their stuff. He will also win with Michinok driver. <br /> <br /> 3/2/5 <br /> <br /> WWF World Championship. <br /> <br /> Triple H | C | Vs Owen Hart Determining Chyna here is attached to Slaughter. Nice pop for Owen, mixed reaction to trips. Indeed, a really undervalued match that ranks among one of my favorites for Wrestlemania. The two mixed up very well and Owen can go with no one. Trips win with Chyna interference. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> Goldust & Luna. Defining pop for Sable, unheard of that time, for a woman. Sable really looks hot and the crowd will just go! Constant Sable sings and explodes almost every time they get into a circle. It's not bad when it comes to a mixed-label match, it has fun fun and it's a good time. Sable's team wins when Sable hits TKO. <br /> <br /> <br /> 2 <br /> <br /> <br /> Ken Shamrock against the Rock | C | Before I look at the game, I'd like to realize that Rock has shown its tremendous potential with an interview with Jennifer Flowers before her match. Nice pop for Shamrock, great time for The Rock. She was too disappointed too soon, and I thought the end was quite stupid, though Shamrock's pieces were amazing, and they saw the crowd for her. Rock retains the title when The Ref confuses the decision. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> <br /> <br /> Funk against the new age. The inhabitants are not as skipped as they were at this time. Crowd is actually somewhat dead, but I thought he had some great Hardcore bits, with some bad-looking bumps. Cactus and Terry win the titles at the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> Big time of the ovation, for The Undertaker. Much better than that trip to Wrestlemania 20 and the big man in a big man's game was really good. It was great for everyone to fight when The Undertaker looked around the table. WWE was clever when Kane looked strong, despite defeat. After 2 tombstone kick out, Taker is finally put off, third. <br /> <br /> <br /> 3 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Special Enforcer Guest "Mike Tyson" <br /> <br /> HBK | C | Steve Austin. Big heat for Tyson. Crowd is Austin, it's definitely one of the biggest explosions I've ever heard. Mixed reaction for HBK. This is really a special match, one of the biggest events in the history of wrestlemania, you can tell when J.R is even breathless. HBK gives him everything to be his last match, and Austin is rarely better. Hate and energy from the crowd is amazing and it's just as exciting. Austin wins with stunning, and Tyson joins 3:16 by eliminating Michaels. Austin's festive victory is amazing when we look at one of the hottest crowds you've ever seen, the King said it's right, nuts go. <br /> <br /> <br /> Wrestlemania 14 is one of the largest in the world. In Wrestlemania, he has everything you want, and true kick has begun the Attic era. That's very strange to me because it was the first Wrestlemania I've ever seen in 98. "Austin's era began!" <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 / 10
