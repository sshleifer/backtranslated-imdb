This is a movie for fun; I did not think the world made a social commentary from a small movie. I personally consider this film fun, courageous and unforgettable. It's a fantasy that does not resemble a little girl who becomes a princess. This movie was very successful, and I could add that in the seventies, the time of the best experiments in the film appeared, when I could mention human sexuality. This film is not about homosexuals or not, but about love in all its special forms. This film shows some of the fact that they are homosexuals in the 1970s in Hollywood or California. Pretty boys who care about older, not so nice men. Women who had to remain deeply locked in the emotional wardrobe or risked not having a career. Bathrooms were an integral part of the gay community. <br /> <br /> Then start the fantasy! Combine the lesbian with gay and add some alcohol and what do we have? But this movie, which was in any way better than the deep redo "The Next Big Thing". Perhaps someone should ask the entire crew to see this movie and then try to do better. I like this movie when I saw it in the 1970s and it still brings a smile on my lips. I cordially recommend to anyone who wants a fun and gentle film - to cover up some popcorn and have fun. Some people need to clarify! And this is the movie you should be doing! <br /> <br />
