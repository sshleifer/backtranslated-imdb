As a lover of surrealism (art and film), I was pleased to discover this film at the IFC. It's definitely a goalkeeper. Most other reviews say general conspiracy (not all right) so I will not bother anyone to carry it. The main thing is the concept of alternative worlds, which Ana brings to a terrible illness and the way she can connect with someone else after being "alone" and finally with her family, which I think is at least a bit worried. This can only be called a horror film because it has scary scenes, but it's fantasy (with a little hint of "coming of age" just because Ana is a pre-school boy who "hates boys"). I cordially recommend those who appreciate their imagination.
