I saw this film at the 18th Haifa Festival and it's one of the best movies I've seen this year. Seeing it on the big screen (and I think BIG, not one of those television screens that most cinemas are) with an excellent sound system always enhances the movie experience because the film takes your eyes and ears and sucks you into the story picture. <br /> <br /> The movie is a set of characters that are loosely linked. Their stories intertwine at certain points, and many stories remind me of the great Robert Altman and his excellent films. But the real hero of the film is of course the city of Madrid, which provides the background for the whole film. It contains characters, contains sidewalks and roads on which it walks, and sets the background atmosphere for all events, all in beautifully shot scenes. The film returns again and again on some subjects (footwear, for example), and basically Salazar makes his metaphors more and more understandable to the viewer as the film progresses. It combines city views with character shots and elegantly matches the feel of the scene to the background. A set of talented actors helps him portray a wide range of characters. One of the great examples is the scene where Juaquin first takes Anita across the street. Maybe it will not work on a small screen, but it gave me goose bumps on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The movie is very positive, so the movie is light and fun sometimes. The music alongside the movie is usually pop, with several instrumental pieces (I hope to once put my hand on the soundtrack, although I seriously doubt it will). All together I came out of this movie has a sensational feeling and I'm not easily impressed (you have to talk about it). For this and others I give this film a solid 8/10.
