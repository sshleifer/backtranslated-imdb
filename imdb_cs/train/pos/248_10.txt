"Ned Kelly" is a beautifully crafted Australian film that honors a true Australian hero. We are admitted to the world of Ned, his best friend, Joe Byrne, and other members of Kelly Gang, as he explains and perhaps justifies the action of Ned. There is an exceptional actor talent that all provide stellar performances that bring the film life. (Great work, Heath!) Orlando Bloom was fantastic like Joe, who played very well as a quiet, loyal lady. At this moment I was raised. For a moment I almost believed that the Gang would win the battle in Glenrowan, unfortunately it was not. Some aspects of the film are fictitious and as an enthusiastic fan of Ned Kelly (and supporters), he was slightly disappointed. Perhaps the film could have gone longer to cover Kelly Gang's / Neda's lives - I felt it was not covered enough. Regardless of a few shortcomings, it is a film, all kinds of emotions. (And hey, I suppose this movie would be better to watch than Mick Jagger, who was trying to portray Ned ...)
