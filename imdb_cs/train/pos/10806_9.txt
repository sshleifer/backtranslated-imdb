I felt this movie - all. I am impressed by the talent of Russell Crowe in developing his relationship with Lillie, such a typical Aussie blend of gently silent approach, a little self-defeating and very persistent. He really loved cinema and direction. Pace was fine, and the ideas of almost all the characters were impressive. God, Russell did not even experience talent in 1993! .. and I still saw Gladiator.
