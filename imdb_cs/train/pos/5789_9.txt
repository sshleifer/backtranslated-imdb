This is one of my favorite films with Mariette Hartley and Robert Lansing "Sandy" and Agnes Moorhead and small space episodes. Since mid-1961, it has been important for the long cold war in which the US has been involved. The bustling urban scene, the sparse dialogue of almost hungry characters, their tired uniforms, and the minimal action "they say" all: the absurdity that threatens the destruction of human life, modern civilization, and everything that is sweet and redeemed. It is a "fable" because it was produced at a time when the events turned out to be the second Berlin crisis (spring 1961) and the subsequent Cuban crisis (October 1962), it would be a sensible representation of one of the largest American cities, destroyed and full of several few dead survivors. I see this as a "fable" because it's not just a warning story, but because it's the most redemption of all our popular myths: it's a love story that is in an impossible situation and includes two highly confused lovers.
