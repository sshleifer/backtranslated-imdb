I chased this movie because of my interest in American history and a particularly strange story about mormons. This film seeks to understand how Joseph Smith can change his "vision" to a major world religion. First, it focuses on the problems that the Mormons had in their settlement in Navuoo, Illinois. It portrays the trial of Joseph Smith. During this process, Brigham Young is worth mentioning about his conversion to Mormonism and his belief in the spiritual message of Smith. Then Smith is murdered and Young has to deal with his own doubts about whether he was elected to lead the Mormons to a new country. Despite his serious doubts, he persists and eventually has a vision (that Utah is the site of his colony), which gives him confidence in the correctness of his leadership. Later, when the crops are destroyed by the crickets, again doubts that it was actually chosen - but a miracle that becomes its history appears. <br /> <br /> I found the moves to move, and the story is convincing and interesting. I would like to know if the Mormons believe it is an accurate display. Polygamy is a part of the story, but the reasons why it is not a key issue for LDS are not raised. The problem is not stressed. I'm sure people are away from this film due to their religious content but they have a great actress and they will be interested.
