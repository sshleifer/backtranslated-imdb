Kudos to Fawcett to assume the roles that were considered controversial at the time. To my memory, rape in the 1980s was still taboo, and women's rights and emotions were rarely so deeply explored. <br /> <br /> Fawcett is simply a woman who is followed by actor James Russo. He is reasonable as an obsessed psychopath but occasionally a bit transparent. Diana Scarwid has a little role, just like Alfre Woodard as a friend. Woodard fears legal consequences when Fawcett, the victim of rape, avenges the culprit. The scene in which Russo throws hot hot oil grids is classical and like the rapist he deserves. She then keeps him in slavery and he has to face the consequences. A very true story that reflects the emotions and anger of the victims of rape who have been physically and mentally broken. Highly recommended. 8/10.
