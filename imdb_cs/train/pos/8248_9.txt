When you see a DVD envelope, you are convinced that it is a Class B cheesy left, a $ 1,000 movie in the house of someone. <br /> <br /> Wrong! <br /> <br /> This is good quality and really good. It's a comedy and clever about it. It is also very moving in places with a nice place of kindness. The production values ​​are very good (it looks great), the actors are known, the direction of the film and the files are great. It's amazing. Who would think? Carrie-Ann Moss, playing opposite, is awesome like "Helen Robinson," Cleaver's wife in June; Billy Connolly is great as a grueling good-natured zombie "Fido"; Tim Blake Nelson ("Mr. Theopolis") is a neighbor of sexy zombie girlfriend "Tammy" and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as Daddy (check) are also outstanding K'Sun Ray as a young "Timmy Robinson," should not be overlooked. In fact, he's probably got more lines in the movie than anyone else. When I explain the story, it sounds so stupid that few of you will be watching. You will have to take the word of people here who liked them and found it to be a very, very pleasant surprise. But you need a dark sense of humor; absurd appreciation.
