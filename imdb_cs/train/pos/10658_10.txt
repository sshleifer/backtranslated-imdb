The only time I saw this movie was when I was 10 years old. I remembered all these years because I could not sleep a week or more when I saw it. It just shook me. I was on holiday with my aunt in Ft. Worth, Texas and I will never forget it. Now, 48 years later, my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me to see her as an adult. A lot of research has begun to find out what movie it was, but I always remembered that Barbara Stanwyck was in her and eventually managed to get her name and reviews. I liked it very much, but it made me afraid! Jaqui
