This story was probably one of the strongest I've ever had. John Singleton definitely went above and beyond the boundaries of compiling this masterful masterpiece. Brilliant performance of the cast, but Epps and Rapaport have turned to the best and most convincing young star of their career. But as a student I am alone, many of the questions that Singleton touched were taken to the extreme. In a sense, while the problems that are faced with many college campuses, they are not presented as big or outdoors as the film would do. In some cases, it seemed almost ridiculous to think that something like that could really be. Besides being a bit dramatic, the film was great and it was amazing to me, unable to talk, just to think. One of the things I remember forever is a quote from Lawrence Fishburne: "Knowledge is power, without knowledge, you can not see your power." Brilliant, just brilliant.
