It was one of the best episodes. Officer Sean Cooper was murdered in 1966 in a patrol car. A dying prisoner in state punishment reveals that he stole a car heroin block from the car after shooting. His case is reopened, assuming he was injured as a policeman. Another investigation into him as a policeman and human being reveals a war veteran involved in forbidden love. This type of love was considered shameful and at least at that time at least hidden. <br /> <br /> Although it is not the type of love that I personally support, she was still a policeman and a human being, and he was not to be killed. The soundtrack was great (still watching me on the DVR) and the selective use of black and white mixed with color to emphasize one object or give some sense of the scene was particularly tempting. I'll watch it in repetition!
