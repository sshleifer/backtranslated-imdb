I went to see that Antone Fisher did not know what to expect, and it was pleasantly surprised. Derek Luka's acting work was excellent and the story was excellent. Of course, Denzel Washington did his usual job of acting and directing. He realizes that people with mental problems can help and this film is a perfect example of that. Do not miss this.
