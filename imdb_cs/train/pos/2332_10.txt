"Imagine if you could only return to life once." As soon as I first heard it, the attention was locked on the trailer, and after the first episode I found myself in love with this show. A modern fairytale that brings my spirits and holds me throughout the whole show. I think acting and shooting is just perfect, each character brings something unique to a show that enhances perfection. Even once, the Villains can overflow with a unique sense, from Bee Man to the Guy, who can miss Kittens, they never lose me. And the deaths that would normally lead to a depressive moment often ended up as purely comical (like Book Exploding Scratch & Sniff) <br /> <br /> Even with a large number of criminal acts we have days now, Daisies is one of the few, who really stands out from the others, is not just a secret, but a love story, a comedy and a fairytale story with a hint of drama, all baked in one beautiful cake ..... err show. <br /> <br /> What really shocked me was that it was on ABC, For years I never had reason to turn to ABC, But it brought me a smile on my face every week. It was like Pushing Daisies brought ABC back to life for me. But just after two seasons, several awards, big fans and positive reactions from critics, the show was released. It seems as if the Touched ABC had never again and forever killed me. I will always be a fan of this show, and I recommend it to anyone who likes to talk a lot and much love of the programs they watch.
