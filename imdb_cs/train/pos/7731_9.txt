<br /> <br /> "After the dark is my sweet" strange mixture of sensuality and dullness. The film runs slowly, very slowly, but takes the rhythm to tell the story of murder and passion. Jason Patric has never been so sexy and powerful (man gives real performance) and Rachel Ward is all sexy. Sexual tension, psychic heat, traces of the past ... flashing scenes, the strangeness of Patric's character, all become sexy secrets. I recommend this one cause is a very sexy blunt film I've ever seen. Look at the scene of love, it's especially sexy.
