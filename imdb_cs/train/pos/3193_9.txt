The short film that begins with this movie is a real shot of a guy named Gary, apparently it was accidentally picked up in a parking lot on Gary's TV station in Beaver. Gary is a bit "different"; he is an impersonator and directs an old Chevy named Farrah (after Fawcett). Lo and behold, the director gets a letter from Gary, later inviting him to come back to Beaver to get some shots from the local talent competition he has made, including Gary's stunning performance as Olivia Newton Dawn. Oh, mine. The two short films that follow are Gary's story, the same as you just saw the first one, is depicted by Sean Penn and the second Crispin Glover titled "The Orkly Kid." If you are in the mood that you are making fun of someone, it is definitely the movie that will watch. Most of this I've doubled in laughter, especially in the case of Crispins, which might well be on their own. When it was over, I had to flip over the film again to watch the real Gary and all his shiny idiots. Although Olivia was concentrating, I would like to see one of the "fictitious" shorts attracted to Gary Barry Manilow, who is just as ridiculous.
