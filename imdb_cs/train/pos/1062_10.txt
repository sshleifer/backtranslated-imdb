I think this show is definitely the biggest show. Jessica Alba is doing such a great job. Michael Weatherly also does a great job, just like the rest of the cast. The show is very interesting and they have wonderful happenings and their pieces are amazing. It's like watching an hourly movie. It is definitely worth the attention.
