For people of a certain age, W.W. It was the limitation period of their lives, and what was followed could never be compared. As the film opens, a recently widowed but still alive woman (Judi Dench) hears a street musician trying to play the classic song "Stardust." It reminds her of her memories of, almost all-girl band, who enjoyed raiding bombs during the war. Drummer Patrick (Ian Holm) happily avoided the design and enjoyed the ladies. <br /> <br /> Patrick and Dench's character meet and decide to reunite the band that takes them to a series of mini-adventures. Despite the ups and downs, the band reunited and successfully emerged. The movie is beautifully written and undervalued, with outstanding performances by all involved. The characters are well-developed and all the people who have not ceased to live through their years. And there is everything that is a beautiful old swing! <br /> <br /> This is not a pontification by Steven Spielberg, but a serious film anyway. The war has affected everybody and this lesson is not forgotten in a movie that is not afraid to have fun while learning.
