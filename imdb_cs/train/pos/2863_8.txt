Although this show has been turned off since 1973, after watching the DVD set that I borrowed in our library, I felt compelled to say a little about it. I remember when it was the only color show on television in the 1960s, and sometimes there will be a small "Sunday Evening Party" with friends to watch NBC on one of the few color televisions. <br /> <br /> I love the history not so much about names and dates, but how it affects today and how much can be so deeply based on the most important acts of time. Virginia City, Nevada, which became one of the world's richest cities for silver, gained its name from the character "Old Virginny," who in the early days of the city turned from the salon, fell and broke a bottle of whiskey. Old Virginia did not want to waste the opportunity for a precious liquid to get into the dirt and decided to baptize the city of "Virginia Town". This area became known as the Comstock Lode, because another character, Henry Comstock, had the reputation of trying to jump on all claims and the area became known as the Comstock Lode. I just watched the early episode that dealt with these two subjects. Other episodes concerned the literary rise of Mark Twain, while a reporter for territorial business ... It was a healthy (and often educational) family entertainment. As someone else noted, each episode would really be considered a movie in its own rules - rich scripts and characters. <br /> <br /> One thing that the truth tilted was the proximity of Virginia City and Ponderosa. In fact, jet from Ponderosa (all of the North Lake Tahoe), one would have to ride his horse about 3,000 meters down Spooner Summit to the high desert (3,000-4,000 feet) of the Carson Valley then another 30-40 miles to the city of Virginia. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the Cartwrights would have some painful back ends that regularly do it. But every writer should have some truth. <br /> <br /> I miss this show even today.
