First, in JOAN FONTAINE's defense, Ginger Rogers would be a terrible miscastast like Alyce, a young British lady who has a leading role. Fontaine recognizes the acting photo as a heroine, but her acting experience shows poorly, and her dance is better left to mention. Fortunately, she went for better things. But here are FRED ASTAIRE, GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN, who get a top-of-the-line invoice - and they are great. Fans Burns & Allen will be surprised how easy it is to fit Astaire dance routines. Especially interesting is the routine of a great entertaining house that won the choreographer Hermes Pansa Oscar. He joins Astaire in what is supposed to be the most inventive top of the movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is not much to say about the slow passage of the story, nor about some centuries of situations that require a lot of patience from the viewer. It must be said that some of the humor is falling and the usual romantic misunderstanding that occurs in any Fred Astaire film of this period is given conventional treatment. Only musical interludes give the story of the elevator he needs. Some nice Gershwin melodies appear once in a while, but not everyone gets the treatment they deserve. The well-supported actress includes director Reginald Gardiner in his best performance in a polished comic performance as a gorgeous servant, Constance Collier and Montagu Love (as Joan's father is mistaken as a gardener Astaire). <br /> <br /> When Burns & Allen approached us to remind us how funny they are in radio and television. Both are surprisingly acquainted with keeping Astaire's foot up. Director George Stevens has made sure that Joan Fontaine's dance number with Fred is shot at a discreet distance, but the clever camera can not disguise the fact that she is beyond her element as a dance partner, Astaire, something she seems to be painfully aware of.
