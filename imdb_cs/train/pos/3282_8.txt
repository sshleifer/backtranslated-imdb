I did not know what this movie was about, I checked it in the video store, and after seeing it I enjoyed it. A little-seen multi-movie shooting from director Bernard Rose (Candyman, Immortal Beloved). Big story and characters. As a fan of Glenn Healdy I was surprised by my British accent. The only exception to this movie was the end. However, it is worth the rent.
