I recently saw this movie in my International Business class. I did not expect anything but a tedious document (I do not say I do not like a document, I just have a bad luck with the movies in this class) Imagine being surprised when this movie appeared, it's actually a movie. <br /> <br /> This film is a reputation for all the cultural differences in the workplace and how they need to work together to get anywhere. The cultural conflict shows how different the world is and how we perceive it differently until someone comes and does not come to wake us up. I highly recommend this movie to everyone in business or just wanting to laugh, because yes, it's funny. <br /> <br /> Well, that's probably it! Cheers
