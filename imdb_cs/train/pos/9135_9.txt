I do not care how many bad reviews you get the violet rain, this movie stones! Excellent movie, it has everything, great music (Prince of Cruel!), Romance and drama. <br /> <br /> This is really a very sad movie, very moving. I do not want to say much more, I do not think I would divide it, but I will say it - the film is very realistic, there are so many romantic relationships going through these problems, so many families that resemble the one that is portrayed in the movie. I see this as very realistic and so real, it makes the movie much more moving. My generation loved this film by growing up, so many of us loved the Prince, and there are plenty of links for all teenagers who have gone through similar problems. <br /> <br /> That being said, it's definitely not just a movie for teens, I recommend it to all age groups. And it's not all that dark, the movie has great music, band performance scenes and sexy fun scenes between Prince and Appelonia.
