I just saw this movie at Turner Classic Movies last night and blew the performance of Victor McLaglen: In every sense the word "tour de force". The 1922 atmosphere in Dublin evoked by cinematography and production design really predicted the techniques used in the best movie legs of the 1940s and early 50s. Very nice attention to detail as well, during Frankie McPhillip's (Wallace Ford's) wandering, grieving all praying in Gaelic. Score Max Steiner is unforgettable. Like in later films, such as the 1939 GWTW, he used folk ballads to give them a local color and a sense of place and time. John Ford: already a film giant in 1935!
