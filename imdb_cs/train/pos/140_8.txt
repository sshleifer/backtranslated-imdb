Usually I do not like serials. All are predictable and tend to be very boring and boring. <br /> <br /> These series are well playable, the story follows all the episodes and even if you miss one, the story will still capture your mind. All the episodes are filmed in the hospital and take you further and further into the secrets of dark and old secrets that lie just below the surface of a powerful hospital.
