Some people have said that as early as the 11th season South Park began to tend to abandon its politically biting satire for shallow spoofing; but it can not be further from the truth. While this episode spoofs the Living Dead series, there's more to it. This is a satire about how people treat homeless people. Characters say things like "Pretend to be like us" or "They want to be human." This episode attacks the culture of people who ignore the lower class who are often in luck. <br /> <br /> So yes, it's still satire and also a wonderful spoof. What more can you want?
