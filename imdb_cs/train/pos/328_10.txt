I was fascinated by I Am Curious (Yellow) and it's a companion piece with great anxiety. I've read a lot of reports about my widely toupetic, controversial and explicit sex. What I received was not that, but thoroughly thoughtful and engaging cinematographic experiences unlike others. I sincerely believe that most of the commentator, who felt the film was "lame" or "boring", approached the film as if it were pornography. It may be pornography, assuming that pornography is something that is designed to alleviate the senses, but is intentionally neo-erotic. Lena, the protagonist, throws everything into her performance and gives her a realistic and human being that is simply convincing and lasting. Their breasts can be broken, her nipples are unusually large, her thighs fat and her face stiff. But until the end of the movie, the audience meets her identity and accepts her mistakes as human. This touch gives her even more credibility than necessity. If the director handed over the Briget Bardot bomb, the effect would be canceled. I can not provoke this idea. Be prepared to invest a lot of thought into this deliberately tempo movie. The patient and the unsatisfied viewer will be thoroughly rewarded in the way most other films could dream of.
