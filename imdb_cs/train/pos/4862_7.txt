This musical is definitely mixed, and none of the elements actually get together, but somehow it will be very pleasant. Dej contains some elements of Wodehouse's novel, but none of his virtues, though he wrote a script. Although the pranks, though charming, do not have anything in common with this particular film, they are unusually brutally squeezed into a conspiracy, even before the Oklahoma standards. Burns and Allen make their usual shtick very competent but lack the tone of the rest of the film for about forty IQ points. <br /> <br /> There are several high points. Reginald Gardiner does a good job when he remembers that he is a dancer and stops hiding like a quiet actor. And there are several songs that only Wodehouse could write, although most of the film feels like producing one of the Hollywood meetings he later parodied.
