The moment I started watching this, I realized I was looking at high-quality production so I was not surprised to find that the script was written by Andrew Davis and produced by Sue Birtwhistle. Both brought us an excellent production of Pride and Prejudice from 1995! So my only problem is that Emma did not run for 3 or 4 or maybe six episodes like Pride and Prejudice. The game was excellent, and I think Prunella is excellent as Miss Bates, but I still loved Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong. The language is a pleasure to listen, can you imagine that he is right now to go to someone without actually omitting the oath? Samantha Morton was excellent because Miss Smith was actually casting in place, as was the case with pride and prejudice. I really enjoyed watching her twice in two days !! So once again, thank the BBC for another good quality TV. I saw the Paltrow version and it's okay, but I think the BBC version is much better. Great production I love very much on DVD!
