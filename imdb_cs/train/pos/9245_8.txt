Jean Harlow and Clark Gable were a great team on the screen and that may be their best movie together. Yes, Hold Your Man can be sober and predictable, but that's not what I like about the movie. I love Harlow and Gable together and are just amazing in this movie. It is obvious that they really enjoyed working together, and that is part of what makes this wonderful movie. Funny dialogue, great script and attention to detail are other things that make it such a good movie. I loved this film for the first time I saw it, and every time I watch, I notice at least one new detail. It's a great movie for me. Dialogue and script are better than most of the films of this time (early 1930s). I love classic movies, but I admit that most of them are average and sometimes I do not care. Hold Your Man is one of the exceptions. <br /> <br /> It has to do with the fact that Hold Your Man is a movie "before the code". (The Hays Code was enforced until the year after Hold Your Man.) This movie could not be done under the code. It was possible, but it would be quite different. Thank God that the Code was not enforced until 1934. Otherwise, we would lose that gem.
