Written as a story by Steve Biko - he played great Denzel Washington, as you would expect - it was actually more a story of Donald Woods, played by Kevin Kline. It was undoubtedly to make Kline as a serious actor and was surprisingly good in the role. Attenborough has given you this kind of direction you would expect, and often the spectacular scene of the Mass was as he could get. The remaining cast was competent enough and did a good job, which eventually ended like a sadly sad story about South Africa that is not far off.
