The number of times I had tears in my eyes when watching the movie is low. And it's only the time I really cried and it was when I saw this movie. This movie has some keys, but it really does not matter. I scream, even if I write it, and it was a fairly long time since I saw it. It is perfect and all the production values ​​are good, but what really matters is a simple and amazing message. We all know it in our hearts, but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters about life is LOVE in all its forms. Only when we love that we are really alive. I know how sentimental I sound and I promise I'm not like that. I'm pretty cynic. This film brings in me stronger feelings of sadness and happiness than any other movies and it will probably always be the first film I recommend to others to see.
