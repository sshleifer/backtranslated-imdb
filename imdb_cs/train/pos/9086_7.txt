If you are under 13 and you are quite annoyed, you will have fun with the D-War. If you are a seriously devoted fan of all kinds of unattended action movies, you will have fun with the D-War. Otherwise do not bother! Today I saw my film with my nephews and 3 friends. They really loved it, and it made me feel good. After the film, all the children (my nephews and their friends) could not thank for taking them to the theater. CG is good. Efficiency and direction are terrible. The story is very simple. But since half of the audience was children, they scream, scream and cheer every time the dragon appeared on the screen. This caused the viewing experience to be much more exciting than it should be. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie in which kids will come, but D-War is a disappointment in addition to the final battle. I give this film 7 out of 10 mainly because the kids loved so much.
