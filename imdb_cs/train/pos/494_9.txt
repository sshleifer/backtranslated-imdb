This is the start of a new and exciting Star Trek series. It has "down to earth" - it's feeling with a darker and less "plag" scene. <br /> <br /> The characters need more time to develop but have the potential. One thing that is quite disappointing (with all Star Trek serials really) is that in the future they display such a grim picture of equality between men and women when they portray a very positive image of everyone else. (Earth stopped the war, famine, etc.) Female figures here are two, subcommander T'Pol, who is a volcano and communication officer Hoshi, who is a human. Hoshi is quite frantic and T'Pol becomes a "volcanic babe." Some crew attitudes are a bit too American (unlike the TNG's international opinion), but it creates an interesting dynamics. <br /> <br /> A very good pilot, although in a very good series.
