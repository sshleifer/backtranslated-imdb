What does not like about this movie? Every year you know that during the Christmas hours you get one or two movies for the July tide and most of them will be terrible. This film is definitely a fresh new idea that has been drawn quite well. Very funny to take a wealthy young man who pays family and simulates real Christmas for him. What is good to have money like this if I can not do fun stuff with it. It was a victorious situation. A regular family gets six personalities and a rich guy gets the experience with Christmas as he imagined. Only when. Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly difficult to cope with, and it was just a rebellion when she saw the family reluctantly adjust to their absurd demands. It was a fun and entertaining movie.
