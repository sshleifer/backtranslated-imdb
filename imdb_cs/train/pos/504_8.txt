Well, the recent history of Star Trek was not good. The next generation has faded in the last few seasons, the DS9 has bravely abstained where no one has left before, and Voyager has started very badly and has never really achieved his promise. So when I announced the new Star Trek series, I did not have much expectations. And the first episode, Broken Bow, had some problems. But overall, it was a solid material for Trek and good arms. <br /> <br /> First I get inside. The opening theme is boring and I look forward to a regular sitting, but these are far away. What was really bad was a totally inappropriate shake scene that just drove my wife out of the room. They have to reduce those nonsense. <br /> <br /> But this conspiracy was strong and well moved. The characters, though still new, seem to be well rounded and not always what you would expect. Vulcans are clearly presented very differently than before, with a slightly ominous motive. I really liked the linguist who is the first Star Trek figure to be unable to face death but rather to deal with her phobias and fears. It seemed to be true traction, which is a significant problem in the past series, even though they have a lot of time to bring us things like gunshots, an instant invention of technology that can fix anything, and the inevitable predominance of time stories. Anyone who wants to start swimming, how long before Borg appears? <br /> <br /> Overall, the series has a tremendous potential. He sees the universe with fresh eyes. We have a chance to learn how things got the way they were in the later series. How did the Klingons get the insult to the war? How did we meet the Romulans? How the Federation formed and who gave Earth the responsibility. Why is the primary directive so important? If they were dealing with these things rather than episodes of time travel, it would be an interesting series. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: Zephram Cochran says "where no one went before" (no "nobody")
