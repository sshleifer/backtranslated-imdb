Presentation by Lily Mars (MGM, 1943) is a cute movie, but in my opinion it could be better. Judy Garland is great as always, but some scenes in the movie seem out of place, and the romance between her and Van Heflin is developing too quickly. I mean, he's ready to kick him up for a minute, but he'll fall in love with her next minute. I believe that this production, film edition and script (although the photos were great, the landscape was pretty and the costumes were nice too), it could have been a bit better. They feel as if the production has gone too far. <br /> <br /> Support was also good, especially small Janet Chapman as the second youngest daughter of Rosie. At the age of 11 she looks really cute and it's a shame she did not become a teenage comedy actress. She is much better in this film than in previous films like Warner Brothers in the late 1930s (except Broadway Musketeers 1938, she is really good at it) when they tried to put her into the Shirley Temple / Sybil Jason hybrid. Overall, this movie could be better, but eventually Judy gave her everything.
