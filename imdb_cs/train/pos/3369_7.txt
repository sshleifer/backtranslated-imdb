Despite what the name suggests, "Pigs Is Pigs" does not play Porky Pig. Rather, it contains young appetizing pigs that are more insatiable than John Belushi in the "Animal House". His mother is repeatedly shouting, but that's not good. So much so that he will go to another house where he can scare the scientific officer who feeds him more than any mere mortal can handle (but at the end is a surprise). Mostly I would say as a place holder among really great cartoons (Daffy Duck debuted three months after it was released). But do not make any mistake, doing some clean things. The entire power feeding sequence looks more important nowadays, given the epidemic of obesity that anticipates our country. In any case, it is not the biggest cartoon, but it is worth seeing.
