This movie is terrible, but you have to see it. I'm not here to discuss the entire movie, the biggest scene he ever played. When Eddie fumbles at Tim, he's silent in the hallway. Eddie puts obstacles in a jocks way with cheerful consequences (like a cymbilus on a trumpeter nail, buy a DVD and watch it slowly). The biggest obstacle is the reversed mop blade, which jumps down, but slides to the door. But when it slides, it raises the speed, preventing physics (mainly friction); but what lies behind the door is the highest. The steepest staircase case in any school that works in the air. In fact, he would probably have a broken neck. Not only does it prevent all concepts of reality, it makes the most funny noise ever made in this situation. Go and buy this. Believe me, this scene is worth your $ 6.
