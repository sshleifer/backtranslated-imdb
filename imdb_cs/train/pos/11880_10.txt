"Scarface" has a significant cult post for 22 years after being released. He was also widely criticized as very flexible, irreversible, over the top and all inflated! They are people who compare Scarface to The Godfather. It is true that on the technical side (cinematography, screenplay, direction, etc.) Scarface is worth the Godfather. But it is also true that what Scarface and some other gangster lack of movies is the roughness, pure gangster access. Latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and really than any polished Italian or Irish gangster from other gangster classics like The Godfather or Goodfellas. This is one of Scarface's major winning points, and I firmly believe that this was criticized by most critics as "stickiness"! I have seen the original Scarface from 1932 and I must say that both of these films are very different from each other and should be seen as two different films instead of praising the original of the "remake"! <br /> <br /> Al Pacino was criticized in this film for being on top and loud. But what if you think this is the way the filmmakers wanted the character of Tony Montana! He is the angry young man who remembers the decision and throws the bouts of seizure every minute! There is no quiet Michael Corleone. He is Tony Montana, a very labile, uneducated person who really does not think much and is still angry! <br /> <br /> There is definitely the 80's to feel this movie. The soundtrack is 80s! I like some of the songs, including "Gina and Elvira", "Push It To The Limit" and the instrumental title track. There are some unforgettable and beautifully shot sequences, including the famous chain scene, hit Rebenga, the first encounter with Sosa and Tony's mother's visit. <br /> <br /> About performances: Al Pacino is great as an angry Cuban refugee. He allegedly said he enjoyed Tony Montan most of his career. And it really seems like he liked it in all his scenes! One wonders what would be without Scarface without Pacino. I just could not imagine anyone else telling Tony Montan and most likely the film would not be so effective without him! <br /> <br /> Steven Bauer shines like Tony's friend Manny. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia is great as Tony's boss, Lopez. So is F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) in a small role. <br /> <br /> Then there is some eye-candy in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. It looks beautiful and is proportionate in its role. The director will be a bit overboard during a certain part. Without revealing, I would only say that it was the only small part that suffered from improper manipulation. "Scarface" is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies out there. Enjoy it for what it is: raw portrait of the drug of lords and their gangland!
