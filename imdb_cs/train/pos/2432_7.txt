I remember Casper's comics, but I can not remember any cartoons. Maybe they were not memorable; I do not know, but at my advanced age, here I watched this very early Casper animated short yesterday. Then I was shocked when I read user comments. Did people miss the end? I have to learn again that Casper is not like the other spirits who want to go every night and scare c-p from everyone. "He sees no future in it," the narrator said. Instead, one night he goes to the rural section of the city, unintentionally scares some animals and can not find any friends. He brings him to tears until a little fox starts him, as he enjoys it and gets involved with him. Both of them become friends, but soon the fox kisses her life with the fox hunting in progress. Other reviews have mentioned what will happen, so I will touch it. Fox is killed by hunting dogs (not mentioned) and Casper is in tears that he has lost "the only friend I've ever had." Nobody, however, mentions the happy ending of this story. "Ferdie" the fox becomes a spiritual figure like Casper, jumping on his lap, licking his face and telling the narrator "lived happily after all." Both characters look supernatural. <br /> <br /> What's so sad? It's a nice story with a nice, happy ending.
