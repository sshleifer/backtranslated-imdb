Yesterday, I went to the cinema, because here in Mexico most films from other countries are part of the so-called "Camara Alternative" (alternative camera). But when I saw this movie, I realized that not all foreign movies are alternative. Fortunately, this is a good example. But I have to say that I enjoyed this film so much ... that I was happy at the end ... this film is a bit of hope these days. And the main lesson for me ... is that at the end of the day ... love is the main force behind us. It's a good opportunity to see a good Spanish movie ... and I have to mention good music .. especially the main song of the movie .. Cosas que hacen que la vida valga la pena .... Excellent song! !!
