While the "special effects" and technical attributes of this film may actually be ridiculous to some, I have never been able to erase the images of this film etched on my young and moving mind when I first saw it for about eight years. The story of the survival of this girl and of the trials she had spent remained with me all those years, and I thought the girl was doing things that were far beyond what I saw. <br /> <br /> The fact that this is a real story and the fact that I was just a child when I first saw it may be the reason for my high rating of this movie. Each time this film was broadcast on television in the 1970s and 1980s, I would be forced to watch television in every scene with interest that I can not explain. I suppose this is the first time I see as adults (and with a crazy view of the world) may not be so enjoyable for some. In fact, I went out of the way to get a copy to show this movie to my son. This, like many other movies, is not for everyone. If you are impressed by the remarkable human survival stories, you are part of Peru / Macchu Picchu and / or the Amazon, then I think you could enjoy this movie the same way I have enjoyed the last 30 years.
