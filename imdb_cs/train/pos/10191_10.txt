What is contained on this disc is the first speed spectrum of the first frequency band. This disc will NOT be for the weak heart ... the music is incredibly intense and very cool. What you learn when watching this movie is precisely why Who's been so great for so long. It is true that their records were great, but their shows were the pinnacle of the pile. In 1969, when this concert was shot, the gruesome teenie berries that threw jelly beans on the Beatles were gone, and bands (and audiences) settled into long and often stunning performances of musical virtuosity - something that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity to watch in age of preserved music by Britney and Christina. What you learn in particular here are amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise. Try a concert, it's really amazing.
