This highly underestimated film is (for me) what should be good writing in the movie. Kasdan tries to find meaning in our lives and explains it to everyone to see and be interested. The film is about the dividers that people create to isolate themselves from violence and hatred and bigotry of everyday life. <br /> <br /> On the way, we ask ourselves a question of life. Davis (Steve Martin with a large beard) asks himself: "Do I make a violent film (and thus his enthusiasm) causing violence in society?" Claire asks, "What kind of world does something as dear as human life?" Mack is not immune when he asks, "Is it possible to cross the border of a race and (even a heavier step) funding? Of course not quoted from the film but general, others also ask questions and are honest, but that is the nature of life. We try to find answers to all our lives on questions that we will never completely answer, and in some cases we have to answer our answers to our own needs and desires. For people we will prosper about issues that we can not answer. Some answers are real. Mack realizes that even though they could take the easy way and let the state take a child, their discovery made it the responsibility for Davis 'sees the light' and decides not to make violent films, but the next day he turns and rejects his epiphany as subordinate its art. <br /> <br /> All of them are looking for answers. This film does not answer them, it simply reminds you that you will look for answers. <br /> <br />
