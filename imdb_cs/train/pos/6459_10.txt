Back to roots with "as in heaven" - what are the real values ​​of life? These Swedes carve the message that appeals to every heart. We have seen it twice in cinemas packed in the last place: a pure and joyful love in choir music that is simple but full of strength once everyone finds their inner tone. <br /> <br /> From the gloss of glory to school your youth, now empty and ready to adapt as a new home after collapsing on the stage, Daniel wants to start listening and drawing on the life simple, warm and rough people in the north. <br /> <br /> Wins the heart with music and gains the ability to love and to be unconditionally loved. <br /> <br /> Do not forget if you were normalized to Hollywood. These things do not contain any extras, just your laughter, your compassion, your tears!
