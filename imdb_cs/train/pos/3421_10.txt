This shorter film is the embodiment of the expected results when imbetil runs asylum. It is sad how the future of these young people slipped into the table when neither Saddam Hussein, nor the people of Iraq, God rested souls of the 350,000 plus who were killed, are dealing with terrorism or al-Quida. <br /> <br /> After this movie, an attentive browser will have to pick up or download a copy of "free change". This movie is available for free on the internet until Bush cabal is blocked by the fact that we do it as a matter of course as indicated in brackets. <br /> <br /> God save our country. It will not do this by following the Christofastes who have been running the Congress Hall more than 10 years before November 2006!
