"Vanilla Sky" was a well thought-out film. Or rather, "Abre Los Ojos" was well thought out. I watched the film late at night, excited about what was coming. I was not disappointed. By the end of the movie I was amazed. I could not take it out of my mind. The whole thought just snapped me off. The end, it was more of a surprise than Shyamalan could do. The conspiracy line was also something that kept me interesting. Cast, great. It was a wonderful worldwide movie. You can watch the type of movie over and over and always find something new. I've seen it four or five times, and I'm always looking for something new. It's a movie that interests you forever.
