I just bought a DVD and I have to say (after seeing in Brazil and Fear of Disdain in Las Vegas) Terry does it again. Like a fan of Monty Python movies, Terry Gillian's genius follows in this sci-fi thriller, with Bruce Willis starring as James Cole and also (perhaps my favorite character) Brad Pitt, who played Madness Jeffrey Goines. It has to be for scifi fans, or a movie fan of any kind, because it involves tension, drama, action, etc. Any way to plot it, In the future, 1% of the world's population survives a disease destined to eradicate the human race that has been unleashed in the past by "the Army of the Twelve monkey ". James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back to 1996 (the moment the virus was dissolved) to learn about the disease, so scientists at his time can find a cure. Before I go on, James Cole lives in underground society, and the animals rule the world on the surface because of a disease that kills people. once sent back in time, she is actually sent back to 1990, where she is sent to a psychiatric facility for telling her about the virus. During his stay he meets Jeffrey Goins (Brad Pitt), who is later responsible for the eradication of the human race. He also meets his psychiatrist (Madelein Stowe), who eventually joins Bruce to save the world (as he sees fit in his narrative), is sent back and forth from his time to the past, and eventually sent to 1996 where he then casts doubt on his own reason, but later he stretches to reveal the thrilling final quarter of the film and later builds on somewhat shocking culmination where he tries to stop the man who bears the virus (not Brad Pitt in fact) and instead shoots a cop when a murderer disappears .
