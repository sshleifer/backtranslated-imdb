For anyone who likes the series, this movie will be watched. But it also leaves you with more. I loved the way each character (detective) appeared. At least with the end of who is the fourth chair because they leave the reason for another movie. My guess is, of course, Bayless. This series was a very well-established series of scenes. This is the series I wanted to live on. Thanks to cast for some amazing TV program.
