Of course, when you read my reviews, you've already seen this movie. "Raja Babu" is one of the most popular characters. I just love the concept of a spoiled braty with a biker 24 * 7. Watch movies and imitate characters, etc. I love the scene when a stone bursts in Kader Khan's mouth at mealtime. Also where Shakti Kapoor tells the story of Raj Babu at dinner and Govinda, who wears the dharam-veer uniform, makes sentimental notes. This is my favorite movie scene. "Achcha Pitaji Main Chalta Hoon is just a chima between two great Indian actors who make a comic scene without dialogue, and it's amazing, it's a cat mouse, just look at how these actors are helping each other and are still giving up the scene. If you like Govinda and Kader Khan chemistry then it must be I think RB is on my list sixth David Dhawan "Deewana Mastana", "Ankhein", "Shola or Shabnam", "Swarg", Coolie 1 "precedes this jewel of the film. 7/10.
