There are many reasons why this film looks: to see the fact that it lashes Latin America in terms of kidnapping, the issue of police corruption on a continental level, among so many things in which we live Latins. <br /> <br /> The performance of Denzel Wahington was great, this guy continues to be a great actor and that goes on like this. Dakota Fanning for only ten years, great actress has become and I congratulate her. The rest of the movie was weird, I have it in my collection. I hope they have become Hollywood producers to shoot a movie in Venezuela where they show us our reality better in terms of delinquency, drug trafficking or political issues. They have only a few movies played by Venezuelan countries (for example: Aracnophobia, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly), they should do more, as they do in Mexico. The song "Una Mirada" I hope it leaves in the soundtrack, it's great. My vote is 10/10
