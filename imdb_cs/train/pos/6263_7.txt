The first collaboration between Schoedsack and Cooper is the perfect document on the migration of the Bakhtiari tribe from Persia. Twice a year, more than 50,000 people and half a million animals cross the rivers and mountains and get to grazing. You will feel like petting the poor people after watching these people, herds of their animals with cold cold water and walking barefoot over the snow to overcome the mountains as they try to get their animals to stroll along steep and narrow mountain paths.
