Due to the lack of art in African cinema (or Black American Cinema). Idea offers a multidimensional view of the community assigned to hoods and dealers. But the funny thing is that it's not an outbreak or even a short subject. But it is an uncertain assertion about independence on these topics, which are most glued. The genre is unique and not typical of expectations. It's almost this exit that first caught eye, so watching is critical twice. The film has an aesthetic quality that lends itself to its true art of cinematographic art. And this true art is with an extremely precious African voice. The film does not copy to reach out to its message, innovates and provokes it by pulling out fine stereotypes (not racial, but stereotyped characters). From the point of view of writers, the film is great. Contains multiple reports that include very fast character development. It must be remembered that this film is less than 10 minutes and can quickly create a character. Using colorful textures and music is also pleased. However, with the director Owen Alik Shahadah announced 500 years later, music is expected. But from a thematic point of view, it seems that the idea is to leave, but satire indirectly escapes the social problem. Brilliant things!
