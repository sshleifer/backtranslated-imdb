I bought Dark Angel Seasons 1 and 2 two weeks ago after I captured a couple of episodes in season 1 on Channel 5. Nothing could tell me how great the show is. I did not like Firefly anymore (just as amazing show). I admit that Season 2 is not that good, but there are still some amazing episodes (see the labels, Bag 'Em, Berrisford Agenda, Harbor Lights, Freak Nation, etc.) And Alec is great. I've heard some plans for the planned season 3, and I have to say that I can not believe it was canceled - they will not spoil you - but that would be rocking! I also think it has great potential as a movie (although it seems unlikely at the moment). As proof of my obsession, Max's barcode is 332960073452 and in two weeks I've had it, I'm 3 episodes from watching both seasons twice. It's too good.
