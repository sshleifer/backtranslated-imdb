Several references to the Blade Runner appear in the film, but one of the most obvious is that the Cain 607 and its unit are all genetic constructs, behaving like consumed warriors. But as my favorite quotation from the movie is, "you should have made them smart and fast". Kurt Russell did an incredible job, facial expressions or a lack in movies gave more ways to relate to this story, and then the rest of the cast together. Even if he falls in love with Sandra, but he does not know how to deal with these emotions and tears when he is out of the group or shakes when he dresses them, and his attractiveness to a young boy who in many ways Todd remembered himself , and what he might have been if he was not for his soldier's choice.
