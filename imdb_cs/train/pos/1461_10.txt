The film reveals the spectacular exploitation of Chinese workers - generally female - collecting shots from a Chinese business owner who shares his unwavering and devious view, his American counterpart as also the uninhibited and vicious, oppressed workers who have received a voice and, of course, drunken Americans who wear beaded necklaces , which is thoughtlessly celebrated in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> A flash of hope comes when some Americans are really outraged that people who make beaded necklaces get paid as $ 0.10 an hour to do so. You also feel that laborers may be able to escape from working in a bead factory, but they will probably do so when they get right with the punishment popular with the factory owner and / or become too exhausted to work for 20 hours of hard work. I wondered where these necklaces came from and did not know how exhausting and strenuous it would be if it were. I really appreciated this film because it beautifully illustrates the impact that American reconciliation has on something we consider to be relatively harmless in our society to the peoples of the other side of the world. Honorable mention concerns Wal-Mart. It's just amazing. And clearly, just the tip of the iceberg!
