I love this movie. It's crazy, fun, violent, unreal, playing in a crazy head and certainly not your usual comedy. <br /> <br /> If you do not find a fun movie, I think it's just not for your taste so it's hard to write a review. some other comedies I like are The Big Lebowski, Princess Bride and Zoolander (he only got me a second time). There are others, but my taste is definitely unusual and I am willing to accept that most people just do not like the things they like. I apologize for an unusual sense of humor - at least I have one. The scenes and characters of this particular film are well composed, verbal humor is funny, situations are interesting, acting is very good (as you would expect from casting), although the casting requirements of the script are not too high. The overall package makes fun, fun, observable and violent fun.
