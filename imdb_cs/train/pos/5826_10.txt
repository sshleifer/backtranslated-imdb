I remember when I first saw this short, I was really laughing that, like many other movies I saw, no sound came out! Curly is really great in singing the opera in this, I'm surprised he did not think of a career as a professional singer because he was really good! <br /> <br /> If you noticed it was shot near the end of Curly's career as a Stooge, you could really say it changed because it lost weight and was thinner, his voice deepened, his face was raised the wrinkles, though he could still pull it, looked as if he were fifty-forty years old. That was because he suffered many small strokes before his big, who finished his career. He still managed to pull the last one! <br /> <br /> If you do not mind that Curly is really getting worse at this time, it's actually one of the most fun shorts. I know I did not mind Curly really changing because I still thought he was great! <br /> <br />
