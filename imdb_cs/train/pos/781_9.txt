Crush explores friendship among women, for the most part avoids the quality of saccharin that spoils so many films with the same theme (eg "Steel Magnolias"). At the same time, it reveals the power of sudden passion that will surprise you and surprise you. Proven events were very unlikely, but the basic emotional truth seemed to me to be true. It's not a movie for a crowd with a quick cut and explosion, but adult women certainly react with both laughter and tears.
