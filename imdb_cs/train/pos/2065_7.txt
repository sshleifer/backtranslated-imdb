Stunning symmetry is a pleasant episode with a few flaws. The first thing about an episode is that it is taking place near the Mountain Home Air Force base in southwest Idaho. The first season of "Deep Throat" takes place near Ellens Air Base, also in southwest Idaho. I wonder if the basics of the aviation are one and the same, but they have chosen to use a real name in terrible symmetry. Mulder and Scully have some good dialogue, always plus. Ed Meecham, the zoo owner, reminds me of the miserable old teachers. You have to like kids at once, you just can not imagine how. Just like he had to have another animal care at one point. I liked the concept of an episode, but I felt it had some inconsistencies. If the aliens are so skilled at abducting people and making a safe return, why can not the animal return to the right place? And aliens just have problems returning animals? I do not buy Mulder's theory of the space-time continuity problem. It's like he's an expert. I also thought Jayne Atkinson's performance as Willa Ambrose was not done well. In addition to the nitpicks, I have enjoyed this episode because of the interesting concept of foreigners who harvest DNA from animals and human DNA.
