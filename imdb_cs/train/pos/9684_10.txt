This film brought me tears; John Roberts really knew how to get into the heart of the audience and manage this amazing picture where life is experienced by the mind and heart of Paulie. From time to time we find that with the help of sensitive and talented directors like John, even small creatures like Paulie have hearts. I could not stop my tears, even though the film has a happy ending. That's great, after the thousands of movies I've seen through my life, "Paulie" really touched me. This is after the "ugly duck" the second shot that really turned me.
