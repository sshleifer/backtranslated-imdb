I saw this movie when the secret science theater released him in 1993. It's the worst thing I've ever seen. So it's bad in fact that simple freakiness, this movie has to get ten ratings because it has to be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> Who would write this scenario with children in their minds should be defeated. I mean, really, the devil vs. Santa? The vision of hell? Terrible laughter with wind-up reindeer? Forced child labor with racial stereotypes? It's not Sesame Street, that's a matter of course. As Crow calls out during MST3K and shows: "That's a good lead nightmare!" <br /> <br /> There are lots of strange ideas and bad theology. Merlin (probably Arthurian Merlin) hangs in Santa in a crazy castle in the clouds (the so-called Heaven). Santa talks about Jesus and sends letters to "Mr. Stork" for children who ask for siblings. There are symbols around the castle, which either look like pentagrams or RAF stars. <br /> <br /> My best friend and I have been looking at him every year since 1993 and we are exhibiting someone whom we can hold for more than 2 hours to watch with us.
