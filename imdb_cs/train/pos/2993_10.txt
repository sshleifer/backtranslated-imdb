In addition to the usual stereotypes of the 1930s, Eugene Pallette as detective policeman, Jack La Rue as a "skinny" Italian, and of course James Lee as a "Chinese chef", this film is a great secret to the murder of the locked room. For the movie of the early 1930s, this step-by-step "peeling of veneer secrets" is similar to the COLUMBO series, except for this movie you do not have the advantage of knowing who was a killer in advance.
