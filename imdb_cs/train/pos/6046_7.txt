I was pleasantly surprised by the film. Let's look at it; the assumption does not sound too attractive when he had to pass money for a night shot, but he had an easy character that will win one. There were no moments to experience, and I doubt that I will remember the next day, but it will not disappoint as a nice diversion. What I found humorous is watching here in Beijing my Chinese girlfriend who will never understand what I like. I told her it was a conspiracy - the three men had to return to London some weeds. She barely satisfied her. There is no alarm for the camera that I expected after reading a few comments. But I have an exception in terms of comparison with Bothal and myself; not in the same league, and I doubt it should be. www.imperialflags.blogspot.com
