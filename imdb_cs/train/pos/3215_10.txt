It was great. It touches, works and is perfect for Kurt Russel. I loved this movie, deserving more than 5.3 or so stars. This film is a story of an outdated soldier who learns that there is plenty of life than troops and people who learn that it is time to fight, the need to defend. I cried, laughed, and mostly sat in the astonishment of this story. Good working with writing for action movement and plot was appropriate and fairly robust. The end was not twisted, but it was still excellent. If you like New York escape or rooting for underdog, this movie is for you. It was not an unnecessary amount of blood or violence, it was hard to follow in this regard. Something for everyone.
