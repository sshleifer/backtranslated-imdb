A typical 90th comedy, a sitcom similar to today's "My Family". Thatcher, who is the pinnacle of most political jokes, Bill (Belinda Lang) accuses Thatcher of doing everything he can. "Bloody Thatcher" may share with most of us. David a typical teenager, cutting his brains with a knife for bread, Jenny, an elderly teenage baby with a mood, only interested in boys and other boys. Bill and Ben are working as much as possible to keep their family in a struggle in the economic climate in the early 1990s. Since the first two series were not as successful as the other, the Series 3 is where everything starts with more laughter that I care about counting. Overall, this show did not get the best viewing times and should stay a little longer. they clearly could not go on after Gary Olsen died, but I think they should get rid of "Catherine Tate" "office" of "Little Britain" and return the classics!
