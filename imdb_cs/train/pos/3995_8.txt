Kureishi has not been blessed with films that justify the quality of his writing. A recently-modified transvestite like 'Intimacy' has destroyed a great font. But Mother overcomes all of her previous incarnations that even overlap My Beautiful Laundrette. A middle-aged woman overcomes a widower by having a very physical relationship with a friend of her emotionally weak daughter. The fact that you believe all this is a good deal, because it is the ultimate gift of writing. And in Daniela Craig we have a throbbing, harsh, cruel anti-hero that denies audiences to ever question why the young piano would think of the beds that were entangled by his grandmother. Beautifully shot, the film fails only in a weak representation of peripheral figures, but as a study of incomprehensible lust, it is the winner.
