The second time I look at this movie I like it more than it did for the first time. It is full of nuances and perceptions of life as fairly common and often afraid, but what brings up this horror film that we rarely realize is its focus on small occurrences in our lives, which we usually offer the very least attention. Here the film is filmed for celebrations of these events, a meeting of the driver of the towing truck and the client, a runner who can hear a child's scream from the bushes. Dialogue, acting, casting and direction are excellent. No two in four, no great revelation. What I watched was how those characters were true to their basic nature and how they raised their lives when they were celebrating. Whatever we are involved in, we need more "big canyons" in our lives. 9 out of 10.
