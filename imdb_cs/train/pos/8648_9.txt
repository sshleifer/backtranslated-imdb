California is a movie about lost ideals. The road on the darkest road at all. Path without return. The story is about a couple who decided to find a better life in California. The man (David Duchovny in his best role to the present) wants to write a book about the famous crimes that happened in America and his girlfriend - a photographer - is about to take pictures. So they went on a track of famous murders, who did not know what was waiting for them. To share travel expenses, they decide to find another couple and put an ad. But the couple who responds is not just a couple. He's one of the strangest couples at all. The girl is a naive, fragile creature that loves and loves cacti. The man is exactly the opposite. A cruel ruthless murderer. We learn that at the beginning of the movie and we follow him on the way to California (not with C as usual, but with K, probably symbolizing the word killer), his way of betrayal, murder and ultimately defeat. All the leadership, Duchovny, Pitt, Lewis and Forbes, are really good performances and you have to take into account that when the film was shot, neither of them was a star. The shooting is amazing, the darkness covering most of the film, and the music suits the dark character of the film. Overall, it's a really good movie. Do not miss it. You will think again before taking an unknown to your car to share it with gas!
