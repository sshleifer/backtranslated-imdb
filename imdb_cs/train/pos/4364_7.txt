I have never heard of Robert MacGregor before Rob Roy came out, but the movie is definitely worth seeing. Liam Neeson, who plays the title character, brings the same spirit to the role he has brought to Oskar Schindler, and Jessica Lange also does a really good job like his wife, Marie. Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) is one person who very likely slows down the skin. <br /> <br /> Overall, it looks as good as "Braveheart" (maybe even better). I laugh when I think of Hollywood releasing the two films almost behind them. Very good. Also starring John Hurt, Eric Stoltz, Brian Cox and Jason Flemyng.
