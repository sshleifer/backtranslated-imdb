When John Singleton is * on * !! And this is one of his better movies. Not as tight as Boyz-n-the-Hood, but close to him (and much of the same star cast). This film was very well written, very well compiled and very well shot. There is very little criticism and most of my complaints are superficial (for example: where did Fudge get money for 6 years of college and a lot of expensive stuff?) No mention of the rich background ... And why Professor Phibbs has a Professor of his character * should one ... And when we're in for an engineer, a hut or not, Remy is a pretty stupid figure - I'd think he'd have a bit more in the way of basic intelligence - he's talking and acting like a complete coffee). But that was a very sharp film. A good series of characters and opinions; and Singleton is not interested in the story - many of the characters are uncomfortable and doing a good job of scattering the Panthers and Supremacist scenes together to show the foolishness on both sides. cinematography was excellent; Especially I loved the scene where Kirsty Swanson gets along with Taryn and Wayne, every scene well connected. Also the Malik / Deja scenes were really well shot. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was a little bit of time; this movie has sometimes tended to get a * really * sermon and also tends to knock on the points it makes over your head if the points were as clear as they were not obtuse (they really did not need the American flag with 'UNLEARN' wrote on, give some credit, we are not crazy ...). And to the top of it, though * most * time of Singleton uses the melodrama fairly well, sometimes it gets * too * too frantic (like Deja's death, it's fine until he says "WHY!" Which simply destroyed the effect and scene). <br /> <br /> But the acting was generally the upper line. Wonderful performance by Omar Epps (perhaps the best I've ever seen), Kirsty Swanson (who knew Buffy could act?), Michael Rapaport (surprised me from hell ... after True Romance and Beautiful Girls even though he was an actor) and of course Ice Cube and Laurence Fishburne are * always * excellent. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages? Jennifer Connelly was flat; though it is not entirely her fault: her role was stereotyped and one-dimensional. Generic to the highest degree. And Tyra Banks, who played the role, was nothing but terrible. She cried out, cried and cried. One more of the long line models - actresses who have unfortunately disappointed (although there are a few who have shown an exception to this rule). Finally, soundtrack! Wow! An amazing soundtrack (which is definitely worth buying!) Which matches the movie as a glove. Each scene has a pair of songs (although the songs of Tori Amos have really begged me * to really end up ... not her best work). Liz Phair, Rage Against the Machine, Ice Cube ... how can it be wrong? <br /> <br /> Everything in all: a really good watch, a really strong cast, a great screenplay, a great movie. 8/10.
