Streetfight (also known as Coonskin) is a very unique film directed by animation pioneer Ralph Bakshi. It's a strange cinema and it's worth seeing a lot. It's a live action mixed with animation, seemingly influenced by the legendary Disney song in the south, almost as if it were a reaction to this film. Philip Michael Thomas, later Donjon's assistant to Miami Vice, and Scatman Crothers, the most famous for his role in Kubrick's The Shining, are jail assailants. Charles Gordone and Barry White (yes, that Barry White) are Thomas's friends and are planning to help him out of jail. They are stuck in a police barrier, and Crothers tells Tom about black rabbits, bears and foxes moving from the South to Harlem to find a more peaceful existence. The story is revived and provides plenty of amazing things to see. Like all Bakshi movies, most of them will be upset and will not like animation. True lovers of animation will forgive their fragility and fall in love with their inventiveness. The film is very violent, very sexual, and it's mostly about battles between races. For a long time, I thought I was looking at something extremely important, but after a while, especially after watching it, it looked more like a common black conspiracy held in Superfly. It's very careless and does not say anything. Besides, Bakshi is not white? Whatever you answer, Coonskin / Streetfight is still very good at watching animated fans and fans of cult films. 7/10.
