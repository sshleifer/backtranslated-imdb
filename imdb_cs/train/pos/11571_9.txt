'An Itch In Time' is one of Bob Clampett's home runs for WB in the early 1940s, including 'Horton Chips Egg' and 'Tortoise Won Hare'. Soaked in manic timing and exaggerated chaos, it's basically a saga of fleas that is busy for a new home and a dog whose land is broken. Since Master Elmer will give him a dreaded flea bath, if it's just like scratches, the unfortunate dog is forced to withstand the ascending spiral of suffering because the home pouch uses dischargers and power tools to clean the "earth." Eventually, the little monster lights the fuse on a small mountain with high explosives, and he is stacked on the back of his victim! It's a huge explosion and the unfortunate smell covers his eyes when his back end explodes in the glowing fourth red display! It really has to hurt and the dog takes off, but soon stops the action and says with a cheerful smile: "You do it better because I think I like it!" For years, this crooked confession has been censored, but the actual prints have renewed the clip, so viewers can enjoy it in its original diabolical glory. Still, it is a closing gag in which a cat blows his brain when he laments, "Now I've seen everything!" This was a common gag on the WB, but since then it has been cleared from this cartoon series and several others, including "Horton".
