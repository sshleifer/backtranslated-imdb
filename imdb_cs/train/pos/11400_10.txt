I felt it necessary to respond to the comments on the front page of this movie because some of them were slightly disinforming. <br /> <br /> Originally, I posted quotes from the original poster, but I was not sure it was correct because it was a "comment" index rather than a message board (even though we used them to be back before IMDb added the movie boards), so I'll make it unnecessary. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> When Vincent Minnelli decided to shoot Gershwin's "panoramic" film, he wanted Kelly to be much more sophisticated than the goody two shoes he played in most of his films (except "For Me and My Gal"). Alan Jay Lerner was commissioned to design a new story in Paris based on the story of "Pal Joey". It gave Kelly a chance to play his famous role on Broadway, although Warners beat MGM for "Pal Joey" rights. In my opinion, the WB movie "Pal Joey" is a wreck, though Sinatra was suitable for the role, but other problems sank the movie (the script changes and the wrong direction ============== ==== =========================================================================================================== bad art clearly suggested it to be bad, and it is necessary for the story / characters The pictures are so bad The audience knows that Kelly is not ready for the show even though she knows it although Milo is a bit tuned to a point where she almost but it is important that the audience does not sit there, "but he is a great artist if he only had a chance!" You want the audience to be fully informed about their shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Then you complain that they are interested about your interest in the show, you will not understand the structure again The story is rejected because it does not want to feel like a gigolo and knows that the exhibition is not really ready. "Joey's" enthusiasm for "setting up a nightclub," but it's the same feature in the chart, remember that in "Joey Joey" (play) Joey has to leave his nightclub after realizing he does not deserve it . Just like the art show. If Kelly's pictures were really good, he would undermine it all. ================================================== = <br /> <br /> Then you complain that Caron and Kelly do not have "chemistry". I think it's in the eye of an observer. I agree chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be, but for me it was okay. Compare it with even worse "forced" romances, like Cary Grant and Sophie Loren in "The Pride and the Passion". ================================================== == <br /> <br /> When you say that a big dance finale has nothing to do with anything else in this movie, it just shows that you did not dig under the surface of the film into its symbol. Many elements in the dance sequence relate to the story and the characters, and over the dance the fence is solved by paintings and symbolism. It is about finding love, using love, losing love (looking around and having his love gone). Symphony movements are designed in such a way that part of each dance scene reflects the distinct stage of Parisian art as well as a separate phase of their relationships. If you have not seen it, it's not a movie error. It's definitely not "damnation." ==================================================
