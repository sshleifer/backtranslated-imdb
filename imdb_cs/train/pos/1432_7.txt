I'm very excited to see this movie because it was advertised as a movie for people who love nature movies. The film shows the different climate and animals associated with them by starting at the North Pole and going down south as the film progresses. The footage of this movie is often amazingly beautiful and I have been interested in how many images could be taken underwater or in the sky on Earth. Whatever beautiful, much of the video I've seen on Planet Earth, David Attenborough. I found Attenborough's story about Planet Earth much better than Earth's narrative. Earth is an easier film. It skips a lot of scientific details that Attenborough covers in the Planet Earth series. For example, Earth will tell you that the tropical sea is the ideal nursery for young whales because there are few predators. Planet Earth tells you that the tropical sea is a good nursery because the water is low in oxygen and does not contain enough nutrients to support large animals such as big sharks, etc. It is an important difference to me. This, along with Attanborough's much worse voice, makes Earth a much better document than the Earth. Still, I think the Earth is worth watching beautiful shots, and the fact that it's easier to understand, makes it even interesting for children.
