It is so gratifying that one large piece of artwork is transformed into another without distortion or creation. I had no idea how such extraordinary literature could be recreated as a movie worth seeing. If you loved Bulgakov's book, of course you would be afraid to see some misleading interpretation that would do more for an art film project than actually bring the story's deeper meaning to the screen. There are some examples of this with the Master and Margarita. As complicated and exhausted as a story, the film does nothing. It is as if the filmmaker reads Bulgakov's works in the same way that the orchestral conductor reads the score - without any change. Why can not we find such talent in the US? So my favorite book and movie have the same name.
