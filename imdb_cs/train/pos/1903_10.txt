Ok, even if you can not stand Liza - this movie is really cheerful! The scenes with John Gielgud will make up for Liza. One of the true romantic comedic classics of the 20th century. Dudley Moore is drunk and irresponsible looks cute and funny and it's damn fun to watch! One-time lines are the best.
