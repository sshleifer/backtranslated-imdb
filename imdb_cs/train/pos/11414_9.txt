A great news story. Joan Plowright is excellent as "Phoebe," Mike Kopsa is cheerful as a "coach," and Richard de Klerk plays a great role as "Carmine." Mischa Barton as "Frankie" gives good performance and Ingrid as "Hazel" plays her first lead very well. This movie is excellently managed by Jo-Beth Williams. Editing is the first.
