All people watching this movie and probably many professional film reviewers will not get it. This film was made with maturing sequences and artistic techniques that resembled a part of the great Czech filmmaker Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I recommend that you get one of Zeman's films, such as Fabulous World of Jules Verne, Baron Munchausen, The Way to Begin Time or Comet. If you can not find a movie, read reviews of AMG. They will explain the processes used. If one looked at Zeman's work and tried to compare it with some other sci-fi fantasy films of that time, the audience would probably not even get it. It is unfair to compare the styles of these creators with the standard technologies of the day because Zemen and Hines "do not count". They have a style that is unique to them and should be judged only by their creativity. If you look at this movie from a perspective where you know that you have deliberately tried to create a pastiche of a mat collage that blended with a live event, you can easily conclude that he has done master work. It's not easy to do a lot of computer cutouts. I thought that creation is also quite good, and also considering how it was made. Hines took a big gamble, and I think his movie will not be fairly judged for the coming years. Someone who promoted the film was supposed to broadcast the audience about what they would see before blindly going to the theater to expect the usual work of CG. As for the actors, I think Hines also took the page from Zemen's book, because many Earth actors were initially somewhat impatient, but it became much more fun when the film went on. It's totally refreshing for me to have this movie in my library. I'm looking at it all the years, all three big hours.
