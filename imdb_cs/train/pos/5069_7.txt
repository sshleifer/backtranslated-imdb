The film is about a pony more than a gray owl. It's also about Native Americans, Canada, English, Gray Owl Aunt and North Bay Nugget. An excellent story. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie, rather like a book that raises interesting questions about cultural identity and values. The key scene is Gray Owl, who admits Pony and her reactions are a cheater. Several comments on user ratings. Note that user ratings are a 2-level grouping of levels 5 and 7; it is not for all but has a strong follow-up. This film is underestimated and overlooked but will be recorded for several years. Few women watched the movie, but they rated it more than men. Has it been properly marketed? <br /> <br />
