The brilliant Russian emigrant proposes the "Stanislav" system for the victory on the bridge, making him his beautiful wife GRAND SLAM Sweethearts of America. What could be just another stupid soap opera is enhanced by fine production values ​​and great effect on the position of a very pleasant little comedy. Several unexpected touches are given to the viewer's attention - the way in which the main performance is presented as faces on a card deck; introducing a thieving acrobat into a fence for no other reason than enjoying a little chastity; and the way it is proven that a wide range of different kinds of Americans are interrupted by listening to the broadcast of the final game. Paul Lukas & Loretta Young are doing very well as Bridge Sweethearts - Lukas beautiful and sweet and beautiful Miss Young (even if the script keeps her on a cigarette a little too much). They are fun to watch, even though their behavior is not always the most just or the most impressive. Frank McHugh gives another good performance as a constantly cheerful ghost writer who loves Miss Young. Adorable Glenda Farrell misses her usual personality in a small task like McHugh's Ditty Gaelic friend. Roscoe Karns can handle quick conversations as a radio announcer. The diminishing Ferdinand Gottschalk is amazing as a snobbike. <br /> <br /> The film recognizes Dewey Robinson as the patron saint of the nightclub; Emma Dunn as a nurse reporter; Paul Porcasi as the owner of a Russian nightclub; Charles Lane as a Russian waiter; and Jimmy Conlin as the kibitzer on the last bridge game - all this is insignificant. The film uses shots for the String Bridge, which has moved around the country since its development in 1920. He expects the viewer to have basic knowledge of the complexity of the game and will not try to explain anything uninformed.
