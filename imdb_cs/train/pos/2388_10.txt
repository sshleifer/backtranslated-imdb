I love Doodlebops. My son has been watching them for over a year. Last year, we attended the Doodlebops concert as well as one concert yesterday (connecticut). He loves them. Doodlebops do not teach alphabet or numbers, but who cares about it? are you serious? Television does not expect your children to learn about numbers or alphabets. parents should. Transfers over it. Doodlebops can actually sing. Deedee has a beautiful voice and you can say in the concert that all three of them have nice singing voices and they do NOT sing vocals. Imagine dancing, jumping and STILL singing. have talent, children love them and even enjoy watching the show. This show is by far the best show on TV for children. A rock band for children. How amazing is that? Why do people say Chad (rooney) is gay? where did you hear it? Whether it is or not, it is amazing! Let him be. His not like him or someone else supports homosexuality our children!
