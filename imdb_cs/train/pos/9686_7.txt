Sentimental story with a sentimental soundtrack. It's a small girl (with a voice hurdle) who is fond of her green parrot Paulie. The parrot thinks and speaks as a human being and provides help and advice to his constant companion. The parrot is definitely the star of the movie. Occasionally, it is a bad and sometimes a depression, the bird captures the mood most remarkably and significantly. Synchronized voice is also very well done, and you can really believe in a minute or two that this smart little bird exists. Soon in the movie, her father gives the bird a stopwatch, and the following scenes tell Paulie's story of the constant struggle for many years to reconnect with his lover. One of the many memorable scenes is when he gets into a bad society and is encouraged to spy on people using ATMs. Paulie seems to have a phenomenal memory. The end is predictable, but who would want it differently. Children will love this movie and anyone who holds a bird as a pet will please Paulie's anger.
