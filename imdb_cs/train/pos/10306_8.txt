Like someone living near Buffalo in New York, this film has scored points with me before I even saw it because there is a story. There are even some bit portions with a real-time TV that docks people from Buffalo .. and once again does not clutter the area. Hallelujah! <br /> <br /> Theology-wise, puh-leeze !!! God is still being transformed to look and think as a human ... and, of course, be a bit on the liberal side. It's a light comedy, it's nothing that should win some prizes, but it's still fun and it's a nice way to kill 102 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are some scenario comedy laughs and obviously audiences - from Christians to atheists. - Some of that was, besides a few laughs, like what a prayer really should be. Kudos to writers at least get this theology right and give a good message. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie that should do little.
