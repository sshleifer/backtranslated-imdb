SPOILERS <br /> <br /> My friend said that NEXT MOVIE is the best Cheech & Chong swing and went out of the way to borrow it and BLUES BROTHERS. NEXT MOVIE has no storyline, has no stimulation, really has nothing to define a movie ... but it's funny. And for what it is worth, Cheech and Chong show some heart. Well, in this little paragraph, I gave the conspiracy, but that four fifths of the film did not happen, the story. I'll just say that Cheech's cousin appears. Was there no more fun moment when Chong had beer twice for Cheech? What about the cock? Was it the first film appearance of Pee-Wee Herman? You will have to watch the movie yourself to get it. I do not think NEXT MOVIE has enough strong balls to make it amazing, but the movie has a heart and hey, my friend allowed me to borrow it to get 7.
