"The entire planet of the world and its people are involved in it" - or something like that. Who the hell said the theater stopped at the orchestral pit - or even at the theater door? Why are not they a theater experience, including the story itself? This film was a great experiment that said, "Hey, you are a story and you need more than your attention, you need active participation." "Sometimes we bring you a story, sometimes you have to go to the story." <br /> <br /> At least nobody heard, but that does not mean it should not be said.
