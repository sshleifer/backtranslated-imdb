I just sat in a very pleasant 45 minutes ROLL. <br /> <br /> Roll is about a country boy Mat (Toby Malone) who has dreams of becoming a Sports Star. Mat moves into the city and his cousin George (Damien Robertson) has to pick him up. So it was a plan. George is involved in a gangster, Tiny (John Batchelor) and gives him a delivery. Needless to say that Mat comes to George's world. <br /> <br /> I thought it was great as Mat teaches George about some morality and respect while George teaches Mat to relax and enjoy life. Toby and Damien were well assembled and doing a great job. Each character in the film was very well approved, both cops were great. David Ngoombujarra brought the film a great comic relief. Tiny played a sympathetic gangster that reminded me of one of my favorite "Pando" characters from two hands. One of the other things Roll liked me was that he introduced the cities I grew up and lived for 20 years, Perth and Fremantle. It was good to see the monuments and monuments I grew up, especially the old Russian bike. <br /> <br /> This Rocks 'n' Rolls
