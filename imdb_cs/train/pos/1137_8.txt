It's very fun. You know, just like a comedy to be. It looks very good, like the Hollywood Spectacular. So, what more do you want? Howz on very good Sally Fields. There's a lot better than anything I've ever seen and looks so damn good. This movie is all you need to understand why a star is. That eyes! Just like a silent movie star, but better. In fact, all eyes are so good. I pretended to be a bad creator of my soap with my girlfriend. We do the thing where you look really fast from one perspective to your other partner. It does not make it at all. Great. The eyes are! (sorry) <br /> <br /> There are so many amazing performances, her fun just waiting for each of them to reappear. There's a whole workshop with Kevin Klin on how to highlight Overact very much. I have it? Yeah, he's damn good. So is Robert Downey, Jr., who has since made a sumthin career in playing Slick, Slimy Executive. Cathy Moriarity, though not the most talented actress, is so charismatic and hateful, especially when she's upset. And even Whoopi Goldberg is decent, her natural timing gives a somewhat flat delivery a little Zing. OK, no Whoopi Bashing, I hear you. And then there's the hair. The soap dish was made at the end of the Great 80's Hair, and so the ridiculous dose is like a great figure in itself. They are bigger and stronger than you do. Yeah, we have pictures. The soap dish is better than I thought it would be, better that I wanted to be. I'm wrong with movies that tell me that I have to worry about shallow, self-centered, semi-talented egomaniacs, ie TV soap. The soap bowl looks happy, just to laugh at me. Thank you.
