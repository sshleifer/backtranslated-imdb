Orson Welles I can knock my ass with every image I see. The lady from Shanghai is on the same level as his other masterpieces, The Magnificent Ambersons, Touch of Evil, exam and ringing at midnight. The conspiracy seems to be sometimes confusing, and sometimes it seems to be moving a bit faster (about an hour when it was rendered when testing was wrong). It does not matter. You can not watch Welles' movies and concentrate too much on the conspiracy. Its direction defines how great the direction is. Almost every scene in this movie can withstand any other scene it has ordered. Look at the courtroom scene. Usually these are stock scenes I can not stand. In this case, try to sit Welles' own expression near the end of Compulsion. In the lady of Shanghai just pay attention to the level of detail in this courtroom. Watch out for a jury who always interrupts sneezing. Or just look at the lighting in the scene. I know, it's just a simple Venetian blind, and it has been used constantly in film legs and crime films of the time, but Welles gives her beauty to all her own. Dialogue is also remarkable. Welles had the skill, a skill that no one else apparently had to create a crime film containing examples of the most famous poetry. Whether he talked about Shakespeare or used hard boiled lines, he had the strength to smudge the soul. 10/10.
