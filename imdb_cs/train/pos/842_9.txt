Matador is a humorous, dark humorous and thrilling melodrama that rises above the mediocracy thanks to two very impressive and serious performances by Pierce Brosnan, who has never been better than here and always dependable Greg Kinnear, who has been the best star since playing gay neighbor Jack Nicholson in As Good as It Gets. A big plus goes to writing. A clever and occasionally very ugly dialogue is delivered with Brosnan's gusto and the slow budding of friendship between these two individuals is quite convincing all the way. The story has several unexpected turnovers and leads the viewer, who constantly guesses where to go. Nice artistic touches from the director, such as good music usage, smart adjustments and somewhat unorthodox cinematography, a nice movie tone, and for a long time you do not fully know how to label the movie. But it is also thanks to the very well written script that keeps the viewer (just like me) on the edge of her seat.
