I think people estimate this incredible movie. People see it as a typical horror film that scared us and prevented us from sleeping. Whoever he was trying to do then would have earned 1/10, but I've seen this movie with a few friends and we found it very fun and although it was a good movie, Stephanie Beaton has it. That's why I think it deserves 10/10 for pure film fun. The overall view of this movie is that it has bad acting, a simple script that is 10 years old could produce, and that it can not be taken seriously and people fit it for it. But I see this as a funny masterpiece ... which has a funny fun scenario that makes actors even more fun and although it's not too serious, it's very fun.
