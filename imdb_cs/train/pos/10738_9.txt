SPOILERS 9/11 is a very good and very realistic documentary about the WTC 2 attack. French film makers who are filming NYFD events in New York meet and make the most of this event. Before 9/11, nothing really happens, which gives the movie a horror as a screenplay. On the day of the attacks, it seems to be just another dark day at work, but it will soon change. As one filmmaker goes on the road with the firefighters, he films the first crash plane, that's the only record the first impact. He goes with firefighters at the WTC and goes inside the building. As the second plane crashes people to understand it's no coincidence. In the next time period, we see firefighters planning to save as many people as we can hear the buzzing of sounds, these are the sounds of people jumping down the tower and falling to the ground, this is the most exhausting moment in the document. Then the tower collapses and our French friend has to run for his life, you can hear his breath as a madman as he runs out of the building. Then a giant sandstorm appeared and the screen was black, he was very happy to have survived, and now he could shoot empty streets in downtown New York. Given that this document has so many historical footage, and because the film was something else entirely different, this document is likely to remain in everyone's memory. I saw the attacks live at home because I had an afternoon, so it's even more realistic to watch. 10/10
