It's a really funny movie, especially the second, third and fourth time you're watching. It's a pretty short film and I'll definitely recommend it a couple of times, you'll be "the second time". It's like a spine knock, but a rap version. It has a lot of attitudes, which can be negative in movies influenced by rape, but it's just a complete look and no problem because of the irony it creates. <br /> <br /> Lots of eccentric bits, one of those types of movies that you find in your text with your buddies, and that will raise laughter. My personal favorites are "guerrillas in the middle" of the section. Great video, great!
