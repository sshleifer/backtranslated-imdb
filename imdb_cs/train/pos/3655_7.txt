De Sica became one of my favorite directors, but it was hit-and-miss for me. Slim idiot youth becomes the leader of a community of illegal settlers in an abandoned area outside of Milano. It's a detailed and sparkling story of innocent poor masks, complete with evil capitalists and lots of happy police forces, but slowly evolving into the magical fantasy of the story because the boy of wonder is developing this unlimited superhero. I had this up here with this still smiling with this after 10 minutes, and when the spell took over, I stayed in the dust. There were so many beautiful orchestral shots, so many good figures among the settlers that I thought it was a waste that the film was not more serious with its material. The combination of neo-realism and fantasy is based more on the experiment "how-what-what-can-like-to-do-mum" as well as the full-fledged work / art.
