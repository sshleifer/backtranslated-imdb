You barely imagine a better movie than this <br /> <br /> Hey, before you all go to me Chick Flick. I'm a very strong and masculine, Macho man who thinks it's been one of the best movies in the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> The actor was great and the story was amazing. This is a wonderful remedy for heart and soul. Acting could not have been better, not even a better cast. <br /> <br /> I have learned well that Mercedes Ruehl and Holly Hunter, Joan Plowright, Dame Edith Evans, Sissy Spacek and Judi Dench are among the greatest actresses ever to appear in the movie. And of course Cloris Leachman (even in this movie) in my opinion can actually surpass all in the skid of the magnum her talent and the various roles she has emerged over the years .. In any case, it was an amazing cast. This movie was like a book you can not lay down, and when you've reached the last page, your friends still ... even more. I can not understand why this movie here on IMDb only measures 3.9 <br /> <br /> This review is absolutely amazing for me. Or not. Maybe I really understand that well, and that's what really sad me. It's so terrible that movies such as "American Beauty," "Leaving Las Vegas," "Sexy Beast," and "Fight Club," ratings jumped out of the charts in popularity, when in reality at least in this viewpoint they should receive "R" ratings. ..R is for "garbage". Okay, I realize that there are plenty of different stories in this world for many different viewers, but it 's a sad commentary when it seems this beautiful, powerful ... extraordinary, directing,. <br /> <br /> Of course it was also an Oscar at a price .... How sad it is. And how predictable. My summary is that if you want to see a strong, happy, sad, beautiful story? watch ...... best to own this movie ...
