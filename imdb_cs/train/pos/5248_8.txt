Well, like many other similar films, SNL skittles were created. But Tim Meadows does a pretty fantastic job of doing 3 minutes of one-dimensional characters in a slightly viable comic film character. It's fun and constantly threatens a one-time voyage, Billy Dee Williams is in it, although his Lando days are long gone and the whole thing is filmed quite well. True, it's not great art, but if you went to Wayne's world to find Gone With The Wind, you did something wrong. Useful for what is .......
