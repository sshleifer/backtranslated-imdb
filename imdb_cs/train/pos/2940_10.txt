The first time I came to Delirious, I heard it. I've been listening to all the comedic performances and I never laughed a lot in my life. Eddie's ability to draw merry pictures in our minds and make a great imitation is breathtaking. When I finally saw him, I had to do it, I had to have it. Eddie Murphy's performance on Delirious shows his genius! As it is a new millennium, his actions in 1983 are as entertaining as ever. My parents loved it as teenagers, and I (eighteen) I love it. Since then, I have seen Murphy's other films, such as Coming To America and Harlem Nights. There will be no other comedian like Eddie.
