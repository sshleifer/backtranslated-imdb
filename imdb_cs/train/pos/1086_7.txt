This movie is a bit unusual in that it has a very thin fence and the movie itself is going very slowly and relaxed. While it makes it quite different from the average Grant movie, it is still very observable and fun. It's like someone said, "Let's just watch Cary and look at him when he gets frustrated about all the little problems that come when you have a house rehabbed." Taking into account the pretentious actor in the movie and the great support he gets from Myrny Loy and Melvin Douglas, the movie works very well. While the film has a rather modest pretense, it uses as much as possible. It's a great movie for fans of Cary Grant or for the whole family.
