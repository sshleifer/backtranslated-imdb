Pushing Daisies is just a beautiful fairytale with the shades of aesthetics and romance "Amelie". She has a beautiful palette, her pictures are well thought out and detailed, her names and dialogue are moody and too cute to be real, her imagination was great and her romance was deep. Look at the blue sky (blue) is not in the rest of sets or shots (with a few exceptions). <br /> <br /> Look at a strangely natural and utterly satisfying song. > <br /> His score is amazing, his cast is very pleasant, there is great music and two leading romantic stars can not touch each other or die. How much more sexual tension do you need? (Actually, I wanted to find a way around this, but c'est la knows). It's just a demonstration that it's a pleasure to spend an hour and I highly recommend it. There is no other TV channel, so I want to see more. I got one dirty week over the flu because it does for a good company. <br /> <br /> Bring it back!
