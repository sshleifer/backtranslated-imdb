This film is a true masterpiece. It's rare that you come across such an energetic walk, full of fun, laughter, malice, and a bit of drama that keeps you on your fingers. Genuine family film Homeward Bound tells the story of three brave pets who went through the Rocky Mountains in an effort to find owners, the changes and obstacles they encounter on the road. One of the really stunning things about this film is its ability to give the animals a human personality - voice acting is so good. Shadow is a wonderful figure, old, wise, and courageous, watching him try to save Sassy from the river, was a very strong moment. Chance - who would not like a dog like Chance? It must be the most dangerous and most popular puppy ever seen on the big screen. And Sassy is very funny for a cat - she was stitching me when she was mocking the goalie; "Here the kitty kitten ... not in your life, stupid." <br /> <br /> There were also a lot of well-created emotional scenes like Sassy, ​​which was passing over the waterfall (I really feared), Shadow, which fell into the moat (almost in tears) and then a fantastic end when all three pets return home ... including a good old shadow! <br /> <br /> Favorite all the time - anyone who does not like this movie, he does not like animals. Rent it or buy it now, and leave you with joyful memories that last a lifetime.
