OK, so 10 for the 2 1/2 star movie you ask? ... to see this well and maybe it will be more meaningful .. Hitchcock never mix the scenes together better .... The movie film braids the scenes together flawlessly from the start and yet you do not have that scattered feeling that you sometimes get when the movie runs you many characters that is trying to evolve. You feel that the characters will show you something unusual about yourself and then you will not disappoint when they do it. Scenario / Producer Phil Hay is a Surrealist story about life, coupled with a superb soundtrack that thinks more about 6 degrees of life than a movie about the same title ... I'll look for other good things from this producer's future.
