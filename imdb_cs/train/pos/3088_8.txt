Unfortunately for myself - I came across this show late in my life. I recorded only a few episodes (about three) before the ABC was canceled. I loved the characters and the story - but especially the great actors! I was a fan of Sex and the City, so I saw the two characters I recognized (Bridget Moynahan was & The Character "Todd" was "Smith Jared"), like Christensen (Swimfan) from Jay Hernandez, . I enjoy watching the young actors get maturity, and the feeling that this show will be a driving career further. I hope it will at least return to DVD and maybe WB will ever pick it up for the second season? Meanwhile, I look at it at the beginning on the ABC website.
