And here is another proof that would say that we should all worship the Italian giallo and acknowledge that it is the absolute most unique genre in horror. Emilio Miraglia "The Red Queen Kills the Seven Times" is an enchanting healthy original drawing, stylish production values, charming music, great talent talents and ingeniously violent murder sequences. It's a wonderful giallo (released in the Golden Year of 1972), which is one of the top five Italian cinema fans. The story is not only an average black glove and a sexually frustrated killer but it combines good old-fashioned vengeance with the macabre myth of the murderous "Red Queen." At a young age, their grandfather tells Kitty and Evelyn constantly battling siblings about a strange woman who kills seven people once every 100 years on April 6, whose sister is an inevitable last victim. Forty years later Kitty became a successful choreographer of a prominent modeling agency (even sharing a bed with a general manager) when she suddenly begins killing. Sister Evelyn would be an obvious culprit, but she recently moved to the States ... Or she? Complex but attractive and entangled red herring are every few minutes to throw you and Red Queen is definitely the most fascinating killer in giallo-history. Her face is never seen, but she wears a bloody red coat and produces the worst laughter whenever she makes a new victim. She is not so subtle, because her victims are barbarically stabbed with a dagger, dragging on cars and even pushing on fences! The other one is really one of the biggest violent actions I've ever seen! What more could you ask for? Any elegant and tasteful nudge? Gorgeous female actresses got it more than just, including Barbara Bouchet and young Sybil Danning. Emilio Miraglia is not the most famous giallo-director because he just did and recommended "The Night Evelyn came from the grave", but his influence and importance should not be forgotten.
