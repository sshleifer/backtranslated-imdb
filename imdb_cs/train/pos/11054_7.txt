My siblings and I met the champion when our local station sent out re-running that one summer in the 1970s. That's what we absolutely adored. There was something so exotic and mysterious, especially when compared to regular American re-runs (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres ... you get an idea). He had a similar feel to The Avengers (it's not too much of a surprise because it was also a British and a spy / adventure genre). I'd like to see it again - hopefully it will lift it. I mentioned this show to others and no one ever heard about it, so I started asking if I imagined my whole existence. But the wonder of the site allowed me to keep track of the information. Let's hope he finds a new generation of fans.
