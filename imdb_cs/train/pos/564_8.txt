Colorful Western. Wyoming cowboy James Stewart's brains on the Yukon Territory dig out gold, sell his oxen, and try to get a date with a handsome seat-Ruth Roman if he can shake the tail of crooked sheriff John McIntire who wants Stewart's cattle. Beautiful cinematography in collaboration with William Fritzs and Bill Daniels. Good Technicolor Adventure by Universal-International, directed by Anthony Mann. Also playing Corinne Calvet, Connie Gilchrist, and Walter Brennan as Stewart's sidekick.
