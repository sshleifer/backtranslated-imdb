2 WORD: Academy Award. Nuff said. This movie had everything in it. Comedy to make me laugh, Drama to cry and one of the biggest dance scenes with Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo. It was the peak of every independent film. Jeremy Earl has been on top for a long time since he was seen from his stint at the Joan Cusack show. His lines were made with the dynamics of precision and the striking joke last seen in the very young Jimmy Walker. I thought I saw the next show by young Denzel Washington when "My Bus! It's ... Gone" This was the real breakpoint of the movie. My grandmother loved it so much that I bought her a DVD and recommended it to my friends. It will bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart, as you see white Tony Donato and African-American bond Nathan Davis. Through a thick (knife-held) and thin (Nathan who gives Tony tips about women) comes a new dynamic duo to conquer Hollywood.
