I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005), and since then I have watched all of his films that come to my radar image. Like Clive Owen, she has the intensity (and even resembles Owen), which just radiates from the screen. I'm sure if it brings some massive roles, once Oscar will ... <br /> <br /> This does not worsen this movie at all. <br /> <br /> A gentle storyline, with very believable people (well, it's based on magazines with rockers), great cast? Chris Cooper is always good and Laura Dern is always on my list of hours? with the right combination of humor, pathos, excitement ... and great soundtracks with so many rock n rolls to get to the feet of tapping. But this film had a very special meaning for me: in 1957 I was the same age as Homer Hickham; like me, I looked up at night stars to watch Sputnik as he spoke in the dark; as Homer also experimented with rockets in my backyard and used exactly the same chemicals for fuel; and like Homer, I also had most of my attempts to end up with an explosive disaster! What fun was it ... <br /> <br /> Even though I have not reached my great (metaphorical and physical) heights. But that's what you find out when you see this movie. Sure, it's a basic family movie, but it seems like this is a dead breed today. Take the time to see it with the kids: you will all have a lot of good laughter.
