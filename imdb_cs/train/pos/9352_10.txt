Most people, especially young people, may not understand this movie. It looks like a story of loss, when it's a story about being alone. Some people never feel lonely at this level. <br /> <br /> Cheadles character Johnson reflected the complete opposite of Sanders character Fineman. Where Johnson felt attached to blessing, Fineman tried to forget his life in the same perspective. Jada is a great addition to cast, and Sandler pulls tears. Cheadle had a comic role and was a great fan of Sandler. Somewhere here I see the Oscars. Very fine film. If you ever lost and felt alone, this movie will make sure you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Jerry
