Von Trier once explained how he made such a strong engagement of the viewer with his films by placing his film world around the center of the real world and the world imagined. So, as spectators, we think we're watching a "true" story, while in fact we're thoroughly manipulated, often to the point that the movie works distractingly (a dancer in the dark) or a painful (Idiot / Idiot). Film films, of course, only functioned as a means for this theory (besides creating some welcome reflector on Von Trier). The story is typical of Von Trier: our hero is idealistic, it seems to balance his relationships with everyone else, but he will soon become a victim of the problems others have created for themselves in the past. Ideal inevitably rejects society to remain idealistic and become a terrorist. Humankind is spoiled and purity leads only to (self) destruction. (These elements were also very ubiquitous in Breaking the Waves and the dancer in the dark.) The film is also full of cynical (and humorous) undertones about the role of Germans and Americans in post-war Germany. <br /> <br /> As a technical success, the film is greatly designed: shifting and fading of faded colors, screen overlay, action on various overlays (shot dead by the nearest mayor as the most interesting). In this film, we see how good Von Trier processes the film as a technical medium. In his later works he seems to be getting rid of it (as if he was not interested in technical achievements because they are so readily available).
