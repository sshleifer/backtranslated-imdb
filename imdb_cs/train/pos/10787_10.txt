So when I was young, I got this movie as a gift and my sister and I loved her. we should watch it all the time. if our friends had come, we would have to sleep and watch mountains with hot shells and witches. I'm 21 years old and still like this movie, some old friends, and I recently gathered and watched it, we knew all the songs and we danced and talked about how much we hated Profster when we were little. One friend actually bought this movie and witch magic toys for her 2-year-old daughter because she wants to convey our love for this movie. It really is a movie that lets you watch your children and feel safe, free from violence, bad language, lots of great songs and important lessons.
