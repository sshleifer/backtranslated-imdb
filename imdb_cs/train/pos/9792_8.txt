Once a year "comes" such a movie and makes it easy for you. You do not want to think it's good, it's just. You enjoy watching it and taking it home with you. I can not say that it is absolutely flawless, but it's close. Performing - great, story - interest and tension elements. It is a small family story that is largely predictable, but it depends on the same secret. that's the way a blind girl comes to get to it. I was amazed at how the director portrayed their deep relationship (blind girl and her cousin). The only thing I did not like was the actress who played the mother was too hard and unnecessary.
