I was not sure what to expect, but I'm glad to see it. A smart, slightly twisted comedy that thinks about you. I was not quite sure how the director could create "nothing" but leave it to Mr. Natali and brilliant individuals in C.O.R.E. create another low budget file that looks real (as real as nothing can be). Well worth your time and money, if you can see it, please go. You will be glad you did.
