Masterpiece. <br /> <br /> So maybe it's not for everyone. The camera works, plays, direction, and everything else is unique, original, great in all directions - and very different from the rubbish we are used to getting. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix creates a deep, believable and interesting Esther Kahn. As in this film, her acting is unique - it's entirely my own - neither the "British" nor the "American" nor anything I've ever seen. It's something charming. Long, uninterrupted, natural shots are beautiful and remind us that we are too accustomed to a few limited ways of shooting and editing.
