Clint Eastwood again shares with Dirty Harry's role, this time in the case of a vigilante (Sondra Locke) killing people who have raped her many years ago in her carnival. Eastwood is doing his part and the movie is mostly action and then talking, not that I'm complaining. Sudden impact is really fun.
