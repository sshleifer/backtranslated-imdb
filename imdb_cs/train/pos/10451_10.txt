"Before sunrise" is a wonderful love story and must be among my top 5 favorite films at all. Dialogue and acting are great. I love characters and their thoughts and thoughts. Of course, the romantic Viennese music does not exist in the movie (you will not find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night) and you can not get to all places in just one night, either (especially if you are a foreigner and it is your first night in Vienna). But that's no reason. The relationship of both characters is much more important, and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic. Though nothing happened, the movie is never bored. The end is really sad without being "Titanic" or something. Even if you do not like love stories, you should look at this movie! I'm a little skeptical about the sequel that will be released in the summer. The first part, in my opinion, is perfect.
