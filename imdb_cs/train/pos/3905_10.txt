witty. funny. intelligent. amazing. I flipped the channels late a few years ago. he hit it and lit it. I stayed late at night every night and recorded it for everyone I know. a little. as three of the nearly 100 people I watched did not think it was as amazing as I did. the others laughed so loudly that they cried and thanked me at the same time. please do a favor. do not go. Watch it and enjoy yourself. intelligence and humor. it's a good situation. I wish I had an afternoon tea with him and met a really rare comic that we as a company needed more of ... sanechaos.
