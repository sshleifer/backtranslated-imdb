In New York, Andy Hanson (Filip Seymour Hoffman) is a dependent real estate manager who has deceived his wife Gina (Marisa Tomei) with a great deal of her dependence and an expensive way of life. When an audit is planned in his department, he is desperate for money. His child brother Hank Hanson (Ethan Hawke) is a complete loser who owes his daughter for three months, and every Thursday afternoon has a love affair with Gina. Andy portrays his parents' jewels on Saturday morning without the use of weapons and expects to find an old employee who works and without financial damages from his parents because the insurance company will pay a loss. On Monday morning, we would get the money he needs to cover his embezzlement. He urges Hanka to attend because he is well known in the jewelry store where he can be recognized. However, Hank proclaims and calls on thief Bobby Lasford (Brian F. O'Byrne) to steal the trade, but things go wrong when their mother, Nanette (Rosemary Harris) comes to work as a clerk, and Bobby delivers a hidden gun. Nanette reacts and kills Bobby but is also shot dead. After Nanette's death, their father Charles Hanson (Albert Finney) decided to investigate a robbery with tragic consequences. "Before Devil Knows You're Dead" is a comedy of mistakes, a story. Originality and difference are in the script, with a non-linear story à la "Pulp Fiction". Twenty-eight-year-old Sidney Lumet has another great job, and the director's long life is impressive. Philip Seymour Hoffman is awesome in the role of a dysfunctional man with a traumatic relationship to a father who feels the world is falling apart mainly because of his insecure and clumsy brother. Marisa Tomei is still impressively gorgeous and sexy, showing a beautiful body. The violent conclusion shows that the world is really a bad place. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Antes Que of Diabo Saiba Que Vocé Está Morto" ("Before the Devil Knows You're Dead")
