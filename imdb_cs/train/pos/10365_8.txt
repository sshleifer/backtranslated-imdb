This is the true story of an Australian couple who is accused of murder when the baby's baby disappears. Meryl Streep is as good as ever and can keep our interest, even though he plays a character that is not particularly sympathetic. The media madness that surrounded this case in Australia reminds Sam Sheppard of the murder case in Ohio in the 1950s. These real-life situations show that the media can actually influence the way in which criminal proceedings are dealt with. I remember well that the Cleveland dealer has a huge title "Why is not Sam Sheppard in prison?" The prosecutor finally underwent this tense pressure and Sheppard was convicted and sentenced. Only after years in prison was he liberated. I love movies that tell a true story, they make it an interesting way and they make an important point in the process. That's one of those movies. Other good movies that tell the story of innocent criminals include "Hurricane", "The Thin Blue Line" and "Breaker Morant". In particular, it is another Australian film that is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
