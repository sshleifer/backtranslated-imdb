When I was a child, Lex Barker was like Tarzan. I have often heard from older people that Johnny Weissmuller "was" Tarzan and I would not understand why since I have seen a few Weismul's last films in character and I thought he was a bit out of shape. After many years I met "Tarzan and his mathematician," and then I understood. Weismuller has the shape and presence and a rough look that does not require other Tarzan men like Barker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, Denny Miller, Miles O'Keefe and Cristopher Lambert. <br /> <br /> As for this film, I was also surprised by the sensual presence of beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan, a strong, self-centered, active and "non-inhibitive" woman as Jane precedes the times in which the film was shot (Tarzan pushes when she's amused amusedly, one of the explorers kisses her and surprises him, though he does not care, lets a little to do it a little and does not make a big deal of it); such behavior was unthinkable like Janece, like Brenda Joyce, Vanessa Brown, Virginia Huston, or Dorothy Hart, all playing a kind of perfect sweet, vulnerable woman who find it hard to believe they could survive in an enemy place like the African jungle. <br /> <br /> The spirited personality of O'Sullivan's character steals a shot from Tarzan, of course, when it comes to action, and Weismuller takes the lead; the combination is perfect. Another highlight in the film is the secondary role of Cheetah and not as the main focus, as in later Tarzan's films, where he often places the day. <br /> <br /> "Tarzan and His Mate" stands as a fine product of his genre (Tarzan's films) and perhaps even the best, although I must admit that I also enjoyed the "Tarzan's Biggest Adventure" (1959) budget, and strong back-ups (despite a fairly acceptable Gordon Scott in the lead role with his too-perfect "all gymnasium" physical appearance that is not fit for the rustic monkey people). Good for Jane and her friend!
