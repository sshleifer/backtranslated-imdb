Another movie you hear from friends (... or read about IMDb). There are not many fake notes in this. I've seen almost everything that's happening here with a young girl who ran away from home town in Tennessee, Florida, with all her worldly statues in an old beaten car. The heroine, Ruby, does some fake beginnings but learns from them. I found out that he was wondering why he did not rely on Mike's shoulder any more, but ... he had his reasons as it turned out. Just a great movie. The only thing I do not like is the title.
