Note that everyone who disliked and enjoyed this movie commented that it is not as good as a book or that it differs from the book. I do not understand this kind of criticism. Books and movies are different media. While the books have hours and hours to develop characters and short stories, the movies are about 120 minutes long. The film, however, has the advantage of stimulating several senses: visual, sound, as well as imagination. I do not care if the movie is so good or actually has some similarity to the book on which it is based. Who cares? I judge it for what it is. <br /> <br /> This TV movie was charming. An old and often seen story, prone to clich√©, could easily be embarrassing. However, Riffen and Reeves pull it out. One reviewer found that Riffen was too old. I would never admit she was 40 years old when he made this film. Her role as an actress is that she played incredibly well for 23-24 years. I also think it's the best Reeves ever did. The story could have been stronger and I agree that the screen could use "tightening". However, it is worth watching; not a powerful love story, but rather a charming romance that leaves you satisfied that love is a strong emotion and well overcomes evil. And it's nice to see a "love story" without a mandatory word, bare buttocks or spitting hours by exchanging kissing. Ultimately, the score is excellent.
