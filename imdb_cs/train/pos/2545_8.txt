An invisible beam is an excellent performance of Boris Karloff's and Belo Lugosi's acting talents. Karloff pulls out the flawless performance as a confused and conflicting scientist who seems to be giving his scientific success to his relationships with others, even his wife. His already lonely personality becomes unbearable when he becomes paranoid. Lugosi plays a perfect professional who is passionate about his work but still finds time to keep up with good conditions with all but still does not have true close friends. It was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays it very well. It is hard to hear his accent and believe he is a Frenchman. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the film was that it all was based on "unsolicited science," but in a sense even junk science does it works well. Since ideas and theories are completely idiotic, they are now "relevant" as if the film was filmed. And they are as well ahead - and they will always be. <br /> <br /> This is a perfectly beautiful movie that you can watch over and over again. I saw it maybe five times this weekend, and I could sit easily five times. The game is amazing and science is fun. I highly recommend.
