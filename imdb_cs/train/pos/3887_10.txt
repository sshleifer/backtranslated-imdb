I managed to manage my satellite, but I would like to get an original version in a format that we can use in the states. Eddie is truly famous in this performance from San Francisco. I do not remember how hard I am ridiculed. My wife and I enjoyed this tape and our work on Glorious. I just wish I could buy a copy and financially support Eddie through my purchase. We need his concerts to be available.
