I thought this movie was greatly rendered that made me confused and my cousin who was following me with me. To tell the truth, I think younger Kevin Dillon was hot.hahahaha ... but I also thought the girl was stupid to go along with the cop and it was bad what he said before his death "I'm inside you". I think this is what she does for what she has done to her and how she will tell her she is too young when she never cares about how old the other girls are. "I do not think myself I could ever trust a cop as they did. But truth be told, it was quite clear that it was he, even if he wanted to become a cop, I'd still suspicious of him either way. And it was funny when he splashed into the eyes in the shop. it might be stupid, it would itself back into the store, and he was a policeman who died HELLO! it is called a back-up. Sometimes these movies I go crazy when people are stupid and do stupid things.but that's what I think the thought of the movie.
