First of all I would like to say that Edison Chen is extremely hot and that Sam Lee looks much better than XD! This is probably one of the most original films I have ever seen; shows the environment of the Cambodian poverty. Cambodian (Edison aka Pang) goes around killing people to survive; it's over the course of his life. The duty of Sam Lee (Wai) is to conquer Cambodian. There are a lot of violent acts, but a good story to do. The film shows matches between the two characters; they both beat each other like angry dogs. GO AND WATCH PPL ... STRONGLY SUGGESSTED !!! (GO HK FILMS)
