What if Marylin Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe Dimaggio and Senator McCarthy met in the mind-bending evening of relativity? This gorgeous Roman Ã  clef never uses the real names of figures like this thin veils and miserable interpretations not only for the individuals they had to be, but also for what they came to represent over time. If you are confused with allegories, or if you like your movies served up beforehand and tenacious, you will not enjoy this movie. It is a demanding opus that at many levels rewards the viewer with intelligence to appreciate it. <br /> <br /> While the rigid skipping of the use of real character names is followed by falling, we see Einstein, who is about to bring a pacifist speech to the United Nations that bloated with nuclear energy, Marylin Monroe after shooting a notorious 7-year-old scene, that they lead to the end of marriage with Joe Dimaggio. They have a beautiful interplay in which Einstein faces the appropriate teacher's clumsiness around the innocence of perhaps the greatest sexual symbol of modern times. <br /> <br /> Enter Senator McCarthy, who thinks Einstein is Red. He is determined to get Einstein's assurance that he will support the House Unamerican activities of the committee while supplying the ultimate weapon in the name of peace. Add Joe, a surprisingly fragile and vulnerable person who may not be perfectly occupied as Gary Busey who hates Marylin's exhibitionism and believes that Einstein has become her mistress, though Marylin just wants to show Einstein that he understands the Special Theory of Relativity. <br /> <br /> But there is more. <br /> <br /> Just like any of us, these characters have their deepest fears that they reveal one after another in haunted obstacles. These weaknesses ultimately add humanity to the numbers we can not help but today we see almost exclusively in the abstract. Finally, we see the shocking terror of Einstein's vision, and the expression of the film is clear. It's a powerful and unforgettable moment. <br /> <br /> It is one of my five best films of all time. It's absolutely amazing.
