Well, if you have enough openness to enjoy the Barber Shop, then you will enjoy this Canadian film. If your mind is as closed as Fort Knox, then you will give it up to date that it has: 2.5. This is a movie for anyone ready to watch movies outside of their own race. It's fun, it's true, life, in two or three occasions you lose connection between the scenes, but many times, especially at the end, you find that you have tears in your eyes or two simply because it's so often mirrored as it can be life. <br /> <br /> I like it and I recommend it to anyone who has an open sense of traditional American film.
