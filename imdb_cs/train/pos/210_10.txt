Two great comedians in the great movie Neil Simon based on his hit game. <br /> <br /> Great combination, especially when the comics are in Matthau and Burns. No wonder why Burns won the Oscar; is just as sharp and fun as ever. And Matthau is everyone's own match if there's a little more. <br /> <br /> This is Simon's famous territory: the two old vaudeville partners will gather for a television special, but after all these years they can not stand. <br /> <br /> It is a pleasure to watch the two of them choose each other, their scenes together make this film an absolute joy. I just liked "knocking, knocking, knock / ENTER!" scene. And if you are a fan of Burns or Matthau, you will also enjoy it. <br /> <br /> You really like the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Give a little "sun" in your life.
