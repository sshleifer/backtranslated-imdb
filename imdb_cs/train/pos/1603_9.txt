I am really surprised that this film did not get a higher rating on the IMDB. It's one of those movies one could easily get, but for the romantic comedy "Moonstruck" is really in the class itself. It's setting and ethnic charm are things that people think is self-evident. Casting itself is an almost perfect film. Several movies in the 1980s were as good as "Moonstruck" and it's also fun. **** outside *****
