<br /> <br /> I have to admit that I was expecting something totally different from my first "Cut" tour last night, although he was delighted with the unexpected Australian horror gem. I'm a true horror fan, who is as true as they, and found that Cut is not just the best of the genre that has ever produced Australia, but one of the great parodies / comedies late. <br /> <br /> My only interest is that most of the audience can not pick up a lot of comedic elements-the movie was not too much in its application, but I made myself laugh at every step to fit into EVERY possible horror clich√© genre that they could. I'm sure it was meant as humor ... hoping it was meant as humor. <br /> <br /> And of course, there was a gore. <br /> <br /> The use of 'customized' garden scissors has been brilliant - in addition to the expected stems and quarries.Briefly, many violent deaths have been a huge variety of varieties and creativity to even delight the skeptics of these films Kylie Minogue and Molly Ringwald was another reason he saw the movie - both performances were fantastic, just like Simon Bossell ("The Castle") in a brilliant role as a funny technician. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'm you think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last few years, as well as the beautiful satire / parody - toungue-in-cheek to the end. <br /> <br /> He loved it.
