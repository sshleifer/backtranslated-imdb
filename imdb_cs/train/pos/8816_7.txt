Due to the nature and origin of 11 filmmakers, it is not surprising that this film is most neutral in its stance towards America. Probably the most "anti" segment comes from Ken Loach, who certainly does not lead the British New Labor party. Though these events a year ago are shocking and painful for most Americans and most viewers who have seen them developing live through CNN, etc., most writers and directors have decided to show that the tragedy is not an American monopoly. One should be surprised that these 3000 deaths will get the same weight elsewhere than the West gives thousands of Tutsi, Tamil, Bosnian, Chilean, Kurdish (we need to go) victims. If it was a "wake up" for states, then it is equally tragic that in the next 12 months the situation of Israel / Palestine is further away from the solution, while George Bush Jnr. would rather avenge vengeance than make the world a safer place. I think many of the contributors are wondering where the ideals of the founding fathers are going and why America, originally built as a bastion of freedom, justice and tolerance, sees its own interest as first-class, while the third world asks where another drink, food or bullet comes from.
