"Jag är nyfiken? Yellow" is a lot of fun. Like at least one other reviewer, I laughed loudly on many occasions. Yellow is energetic, playful, self-confident, exploratory. Do not wait for Bergman. This film is about youth already in Swedish in the early to mid-1960s and about the problems, reading the * contradictions * that the nation and the world faced. Sometimes it seems that Yellow is a serious social-political documentary, with the main character of Lena and others who deal with both ordinary people and politicians (for example, Olaf Palme at home). Otherwise, it seems that Yellow is parodying this document. All the time, Yellow acts as a personal documentary that examines Lenin's life - her domestic life, love, political views, self-image. Is he a complete person? complex, defective, opposed, happy, sad, curious. And it's all about the extraordinary dimensions of director Sjöman and his crew who document that Lena is documenting. That's why it really gives me yellow wings. Not only do they suddenly appear in some very entertaining times and fun ways, reminding the viewer that it is fiction and hooliganism, but their presence is in itself another layer of film; filming is filming. Do I remember Bjork's music video of the same quality? a music video about creating a music video, ad infinitum, with each iteration becoming more sad and more graphic. I think Sjöman might have meant something like that. While "Jag är nyfiken Yellow" does not have to be every cup of tea, it is certainly intelligent, fun, refreshing, exhausting and authentic.
