In the mind of man, many diseases have been born, which in the modern age have been given life. Continuous alertness or accumulated information in the Pyschos area has led psychologists, counselors and psychiatrists who have been employed enough work to take them for decades. Occasionally, some of these mental phenomena are discovered by those who have no knowledge of their healing or even of their existence. This is the premise of the movie called "The Night Listner". He tells the story of a popular radio host, named Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams), who spends evenings with audiences reviving living stories about the lifestyle of homosexuals. Maybe because his show loses his authentic veneer, which causes Noon to admit that he is no longer alone. The feeling left his lover Jess (Bobby Cannavale) and his best friend (Joe Morton) seeking refuge in deepening despair and isolation. He's here, a mysterious voice at night asking for help. Noon needs to feel useful and reaches the desperate voice of a 14-year-old boy called Peter (Rory Culkin). When reading a disturbing man's handwriting showing early life and sexual abuse in the hands of his brutal parents, Noon is enchanted and wants to help. However, things are not as it seems, and noon soon finds himself wrapped in an elusive and bizarre story that has been drawn directly from the medical nightmare. This movie is pure Robin Williams and it was not for Toni Collette who plays Donna D. Logand, Sandra Oh as Anna and John Cullum as a pop, it can be comic. Instead, it can become one of William's more serious performances. ***
