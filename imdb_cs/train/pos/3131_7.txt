I really liked it. I thought it would be a documentary, but it turned out to be a good piece of language in the face of entertainment. I think it was well done, to a largely expanded TV show in the movie, but because of characters or rather original actors, willing to entertain and entertain, helping this work in the big old style Innocent way. If you are a fan of the original TV series then I'm sure you will enjoy it. <br /> <br />
