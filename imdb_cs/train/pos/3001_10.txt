Cracking good yarn with all actors gives great value. Michael Curtiz at his best. Lots of nice twists and turns and probably the best of the Philo Vance series. William Powell looks amazingly relaxed and at his best debonair. The predecessor of a number of thin men. We recommend everyone. Did you solve it all?
