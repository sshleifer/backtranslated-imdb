I'm not a common commentator on this website, but when I see how this film is underestimated, I try to write a few comments and remarks to it. I enjoyed watching this movie, perhaps because the cat is all I want, I can be, I will not post spoilers or reveal the drawings, but there are things I really found amazing how she manipulates people, it's so divine. this is a very undervalued movie, I have no arguments here, I usually enjoy it and then talk a little about it when you go to the cinema, you have fun and I really enjoyed 1h53 and stayed in the dark room. must be seen again and again until the pleasure disappears. try to be so critical. Thank you for reading.
