Whether they are three boys in their crazy fools who knock on a fellow on a string or a girl says, "What is it, dog?" on a pile of roadkill, it's all in Knuckleface Jones. It's weird and unreal, and not quite a fully understandable yarn ... but it will never lose you. The first time I saw it, I almost laughed. And every night after I came back home, I looked back at it again. Forget about Coyote Ugly ... this is the movie that cemented my crush on Piper Perabo. You see ... before it's too late!
