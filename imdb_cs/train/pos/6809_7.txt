It was a pretty good movie. I'm not sure if this is a spoiler comment, but I did not want a chance. However, near the end of the movie, the prosecutor reads the verse of Scripture and then quotes another of the memories. I do not remember the first passage she reads, but the second is Genesis 9: 6. He says it is Genesis 9:12, but in fact quotes the 6th verse. This is a common passage that many use to defuse death. It is wrong that prosecutors do not dare to cite the Bible today. Has anyone ever heard of John Jay, the First Judge of the Supreme Court in the history of this country? He said the Bible is the best of all books. It's a shame we lost that opinion in America.
