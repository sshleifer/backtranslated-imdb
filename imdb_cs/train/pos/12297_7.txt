Anna Christie (1931) This version of Garbo Anna Christie, which a year later filmed in German with a completely new cast, is in her own words just weakened and improved to work better than English (both are American productions of MGM). Garbo is when something more commanding (or more beautiful as a presence on the screen) and her acting is more reticent. And it seems to be frankly quieter, probably for many reasons, but we can speculate that it does not provide its first picture, so it quickly adapts itself. Without comparing one movie to another, this Anna Christie is still the same O'Neill game with too many words. His subjects of women who want love without losing their independence are here, but come as strangely old-fashioned. There are some scenes missing - Coney island section is shortened and not so good - but overall it is the direct echo of the first movie. Director Jacques Feyder (Belgian-French) simply repeats what has already happened, which I suppose must be a frustrating experience. It is interesting to see both movies gradually, because they are precisely blocked in the same way (not just sets, but the images are the same). There is an occasional scene picked up from the previous movie - some of the storms, of course, but also a short scene where Marie Dressler (English version) goes with her boyfriend across the canal, drunk how it can be. But they are just silhouettes, and when their faces appear on the next scene, we see that German actors collect their parts. There is no Dressler replacement, of course, but for me, the German father is more credible and honest in his performance. Clearly, immigration issues, fathers becoming pregnant, daughters turning to prostitution, and problems of seeking true love - have strong currents, especially with European fibers (Garbo, suitably a Swedish young woman).
