A soldier is not a great movie, and everyone who hates him has plenty of good reasons. I loved my beloved, partly because my expectations were so low that what I saw surprised me. First, the artistic direction is tight and well done. As for science fiction scenes, a soldier does more design than 90% of the genre. Sets, costumes and props were all consistently and comfortably done; I did not like all their future military style, but I was moved by the effort. For me, this made the film worth watching. Secondly, I'm a fan of Kurt Russell. I grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable films of my youth ... Barefoot Executive and his films John Carpenter. A soldier is essentially an action film, and Sergeant Todd's role is an essential action hero. It's not a prize, but Kurt pays convincing emotions with very little conversation. Thirdly, battle scenes and battles are well choreographed. It's not an iron monkey or even a matrix, but it once again exceeds the average level of quality in the genre. If you have not seen it and you like science fiction action movies, pick it up if you go through your rental. Just do not wait for another Bladerunner.
