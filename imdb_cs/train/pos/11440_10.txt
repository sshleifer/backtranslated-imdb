Today I went and saw Rivers and Tides. It's the second time in two days and yes, I see films I like as many times as I need. I was struck by the brilliance of the paintings and the work of Goldsworthy yesterday. This morning when I threw the coins I got # 29 The Abysmal (Water). Goldsworthy has affinity with water, hence title. I got the fifth row of changes that moved to # 7 Army. Blake Art was a war. Anyway, I knew I had to see the movie again. <br /> <br /> I read one of the few reviews that existed online from SF Examiner. Critics loved the film, but said Goldsworthy's commentary was about to make use of the film. It would be better to have pictures and a wonderful soundtrack. So I realized it when I saw it for the second time. Yesterday, I thought I would vote for Andy Goldsworthy as king of the world. Today I could get a little for the pictures and listen to what he had to say. Can I enjoy the film without his comments? What he does, what he says is much more than "art". His understanding of Water, Time, Stone, Change, and beyond continued to make me think that man was the reincarnation of Lao Tsu or an Avatar. Some of his works / words are like Zen. His knowledge ... The film is just (seemingly) here depicted in the bay area. Be trendsetter. Go to the local cinema and tell them, do not say they should book the movie you heard from backgrounds. It is called the Greeks and tides. <br /> <br />
