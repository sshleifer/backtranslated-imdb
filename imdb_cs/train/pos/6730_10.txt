I wrote comments on IMDb, but I will not do it anymore. It happens that IMDb has become massive and consequently subjectivity destroyed the score. What do I mean? That someone who does not like movies and has no expertise in this area is looking at some bullshit (or vice versa), and if he likes, he will deliver 10, and if he does not, 1. Of course he can not measure right. Now for the movie. I really regret that I've been doing some tens on a few movies, because then I have to score this with 12 or 13, which is not possible. This document has something I do not think I'll be watching my life in any other movie. It's just charming and it's not just a way to say; it really is. The last 25 minutes has energy, visual joy and wisdom - words spoken by the stars - that really ... is not possible. I can not keep movies, I rarely make sense, but this is the movie you should buy and keep, and watch it from time to time maybe 10 or 20 times in years. I have nothing more to say. This is real, objective 10 for me.
