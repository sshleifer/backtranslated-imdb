Hold Your Man finds Jean Harlow, a working-class girl from Brooklyn, who falls behind Conar Clark Gable and gets into all sorts of trouble. The film begins with his film, but at a time when he is over, he definitely turns to his character. The film opens with the Gable label, which pulls the game to the street with a partner, Garry Owen and the screaming cops. When the Gable ducks haunted him in Harlow's apartment, and she's such a charming man, she's protecting him. Soon he was united with him and unfortunately with rockets. Gable, Harlow, and Owen are trying to pull out the jazz play on drunk Paul Hurst, but Gable will not go with him. Of course, when Hurst realizes he's a horse, he's still painful and frightening and Gable must go. But then it unfolds outside of Harlow's apartment, and those platinum blond hair can easily identify her. She goes upstairs for a slave to kill. The rest of the film is her and her adaptation to jail. Her interaction with other female prisoners gives her very good scenes. I think some of the materials were later used for MGM classic cages. <br /> <br /> Harlow also makes the title song and makes it a torch-style torch, very popular in those days. She speaks / sings like Sophie Tucker and quite well. <br /> <br /> Gable is well occupied as con man, who develops the conscience, a part he would play often, most notably in my favorite Gable movie, Honky Tonk. <br /> <br /> It is still Harlow who will experience this movie. I think it's one of the best things she did in MGM, her fans should not miss.
