A full mark for Pacino's speech over the dead child's coffin; Shakespeare's Mark Antony would be ashamed! <br /> <br /> Was it Paul Schrader or Ken Lipper, who ought to be admired at remarkable interviews? They are rich and intelligent, and it is worthwhile to enjoy movies with good scenarios. I found a story of a story that developed quite well to the voice post. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else in this movie about what to talk about; even John Cusack did better than this one. Interestingly, the film is very masculine - women are just attachments.
