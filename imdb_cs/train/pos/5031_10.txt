This movie is beautifully designed! There are no mistakes. Not in kit design, lighting, sounds, conspiracy. The script is an invitation to a complex game where participants are on a simple mission. <br /> <br /> Paxton is the best in this role. His manerisms, the infections used in the tones of his voice are innocent. Every shooting game was carefully done! Surprises appear one after another when the film reaches its first hour. This may not be the best picture of the year, but it is a gem that was very polished. It's not for a simple mind.
