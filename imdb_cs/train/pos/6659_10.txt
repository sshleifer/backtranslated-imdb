It took the courage to make a film about Gandhi in India, in which he is not portrayed as a man he could not do wrong. This film shows how Mahatma could not be a decent father (at least in the eyes of his son). <br /> <br /> The performances are amazing, cinematography is fantastic, fabulous, but dramatic. If the intention was to make this film without waiting for a box office, which I suppose is a case, then a brilliant attempt, but if the creators expected it to be commercial success, the film would be condemned on the day they chose this object. <br /> <br /> 20 years since then, this movie will be remembered for the brilliant portrait of Harilal Akshaye Khanna. He deserves an Oscar nomination for this. And honestly, his not the only performance that is worth applauding, Shefali Chhaya is also amazing. <br /> <br /> Watch the scene where Harilal hears about his father's death. No dialogue, no shout, but Khanna fired without a speech. One of the most beautiful scenes ever shot in the history of Cinema Gandhi, My Father is not an exciting cinema at all, but yes, his excellent cinema and he must watch.Brilliant attempt ..
