In the history of comic books, "Mystery Men" is one of the most underestimated. This is not a regular comedy superhero! It comes from the explosions of a modest crew of well-known wannabes, including Furious (starring Ben Stiller), Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), Shoveller (William H. Macy), Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and Spleen (Paul Reubens). "Mystery Men" spoofs several aspects of Superhero movies like "Superman" or "Batman," such as ridiculous statements and secret identity issues. Most superheroes are not billionaires, like Bruce Wayne, but they are blue-collar with massive work and a harsh home. So it seems that director Kinka Usher makes the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to. I found "mysterious men" who are visually stimulating and very entertaining. Even if it does not change in permission, it is still a joy to watch!
