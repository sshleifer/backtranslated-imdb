I thought this step was very good. Several things were less than perfect, but overall, I was quite surprised. The courtroom scene eventually seemed a bit unrealistic, but it was really fun. I find that the film has reported the horrors of military training and the victims that are related to it. As a military pilot, I could connect with many of these parts.
