I first saw this movie when I was about seven years old, and then I was totally enchanted all year long, but for years I could not find out what the film is called. now I'm twenty-one and I hit the film by accident about two weeks ago and bought a copy. although my memory of the film was a bit hazy, I was not disappointed by what I saw. the animation in this movie is wonderful to radiate the whole world that is so credible and so well animated that you are filmed by the same movie. But this film also has a plot that will enchant and entertain adults and children. with a floating island, a mad general, a friendly pirate grandmother and a well-built love story that will not disappoint this film, I would recommend this film to everyone.
