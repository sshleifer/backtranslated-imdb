This is definitely one of my Trek episodes. There is so much in this one movie that it's crazy. First, the boys move to a strange planet to explode. They meet a strange librarian of the type (they played very well). Then Kirk will be able to move back to what resembles 16th century Earth. McCoy and Spock are trying to watch, but instead almost freeze to death on a frozen version of a foreign world 100,000 years ago. Kirk can get locked up and accused of witchcraft while Spock enjoys a bit of time with the sexy cavegirl that has been handed over to this frightened and terrible world by a bad guy. Spock decides, and gives McCoy a royal note when the doctor suggests that he has to look for a way out. Anyway, they all eventually escape and leave a poor cave. It was convincing until Spock finally left and left. You can literally taste sorrow at the end. Leaving the cave in the frozen wasteland itself seems cruel and really touching. Spock had to be from the corpse to leave his greatest hope of love and the human being. Although in this bad neighborhood! Just get so many bangs for your money with this episode ... A love story, a study of Salem's witches, Spock as a man, despair that he remains in complete isolation ... abandoned and three completely different settings on a strange planet. It's amazing that they managed to block them in one fifty-minute film. This is a classic, do not miss it ... I want it on DVD fer shure vulcans !!!!!!
