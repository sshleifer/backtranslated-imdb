A great movie and a pity that will pay little attention outside the circles of arthouse and students who stay up until 2 am to see them on Square 4. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple but works very efficiently , blurring between childlike fantasies and heavy nightmares is very blurry. The budget looks rather low, but it does not seem too frequent to respect the participants. It was not that far. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to have shot it on television when it was a few years ago, and it lasted for half a dozen views. It's one of those movies that they will not like everybody; although as usual, those with more thoughtful access to the cinema would get a lot out of it. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Buerke gives a good performance like Anna, a spoiled sprat and it's a shame he seems to have left the stage scene. The cross is also very good, bearing the attitude of his character very well in the context of the picture. There are some really (and I do not say lightly) disturbing moments in this movie, both half-second shocking and more drawn tensions. Watch with the lights! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
