This one was great because it is the original. I'm really tired of seeing Hindi movies that are a hotch-pot of Hollywood and Brit movies. Some shortcomings were inevitable, but this film is a must. Surya's portrait of a clean, conscientious policeman (unlike the ones normally seen on the banks of potters and money) was amazing. He left work in Nerukku Ner. I liked the film so much that I had to own it. I'm not usually into the homeless kind of violence I actually felt for each character, and that's why I can not really call myself "homeless" violence. I do not want to appreciate the excessive melodrama and sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with most Hindi and Tamil films. I absolutely loved this movie because it's the same. Anbuselvan's reaction to his wife's loss is not exaggerated, heart-furious, and makes me angry. There are certain times when I watch a movie when I want to press the FF button. I wanted to do it a lot in the cinema. He never wanted to watch this movie. I really hope that Ghajini will be released soon.
