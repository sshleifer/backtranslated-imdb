Perhaps there is a special reason why Fox and the child have a special note in the heart. When I said goodbye to my new fiancÃ© - one day ... for a while, I was a little overwhelmed with emotions and suffered from the fact that I had the brave face she needed to see. /> <br /> I've been watching a few movies and TV shows, but my interest has gone from what I left behind, what is there and what I did not see. I want to thank this movie for this. <br /> <br /> Being a lover of nature and hearing about the movie in advance, I was sure I like it anyway. But I did not like it just because I loved it. Technical championship is overwhelming. How did they do that? How did animals get the way they did it? It's just great. The story morale is good, and while the end is oh French and ambiguous, it's happy / sad. Again he caught me a little out of the guard. As a person who usually keeps his emotions for himself, the end was hard, while on a plane full of people I would see another 15 hours! Perhaps it is because the end has been thinking back to what I left behind. But for the few hours of the aircraft I was happy to see something new and original. And that's life. Sure, there are the things you love and you feel good about ... but great out there has a lot of secrets. So next time I saw something extraordinary when I was out; I'm going to explore her, watch her and hug her. That's exactly what's going on in this movie, and that's exactly what you should do with this darn good movie / nature doc too. 8/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. It's two months from the flight. We still do not know when we'll see each other again, but we'll do it.
