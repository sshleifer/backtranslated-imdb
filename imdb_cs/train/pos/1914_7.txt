Eight simple rules began as a very entertaining series. I love John Ritter and his character Paul Hennessey and the relationship he and his children have been the best part of the show. I have always preferred Kerry to Bridget, Bridget was earlier, Kerry is quite unique and I can concentrate on it in many ways, although I'm not sure I like the direction of her character going in the later series. Early episodes were funny, good simple teenage plots about Paul and Cate Discipline children, but I think the show lost a spark when John Ritter died. I admired the cast and the crew because I wanted to continue the series but when I died, I felt that the program had done. For me, the whole performance was based on the guide "8 Simple Rules of Dating My Teenage Daughter" written by a real man with teenage daughters, and that the relevance and angle of view changed without Hennessey's father. <br /> <br /> It seemed that Bridget became more annoying, Rory stayed the same, and Cate always gave her grandparents the lives of the lessons they had previously felt more fun when it was left to Paul. I think Grandfather is humorous (especially when he looks at the Big Escape), but he feels that C.J is useless on the show. He is funny in parts, but I felt the story of the line at the time of his arrival was very similar to another American comedy series. Over all the newer ones is not just a lack of excitement and does someone else think it is irritating that Cate works at school and C.J and Grandpa are always there as well? I always recommend this show to my friends because it was very strong in the beginning, and it is worth paying attention to Paul and Kerry, but later they were on average at best.
