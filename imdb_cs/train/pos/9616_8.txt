It's worth attention twice because of the rapid pace that turns into several interesting stories: "Bug" appears as a completely satisfying work of art that always plays optimistic love for countless examples of frustrating reality. the characters are Wallace (John Carroll Lynch), whose most important concern for life - from cockroaches to airline passengers for which he is partly responsible - is film; Oliva (Christina Kirkov√°), who spent considerable time creating surreal but tasty dishes for her impossible husband Ernie (Chris Bauer); and Mitchell, a cable television technician with unlimited confidence in the news of happy cookies: "You meet the girl of your dreams." Against such optimism are the forces of strange reality, all generated by actions of characters: parking tickets, clogged drain in the Chinese canteen / rug, TV disruption, crushed car bender, ruined dinner reservation that eventually leads to the abolition of the Hawaiian holiday. The film is funny: Olive has drunk at Chippendale, Johnston (Michael Hitchcock), as a customer service that tries to deal with an angry customer. Cyr (Brian Cox) faces restaurant inspector Dwight (Jamie Kennedy) responding to his girlfriend's refusal to have children by typing enemy Chinese cookies fortunes: "Your girlfriend lied to you" and the guy who fell asleep when jackhammer stepped out because he spent the night looking for his missing cat girlfriend. (Darryl These) and a local actor by reading from "The Boy in the Bubble" expresses the main theme: love comes from the heart. "Bug" is at the same level as "trains, planes and cars," but with lower budgets and a fresh eye.
