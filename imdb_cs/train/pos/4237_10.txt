Charleton Heston was wearing one, James Franciscus wore one, but Mark Wahlberg decided not to make traditional lumbar canvas. I hope nobody will roll him like Tarzan. Linda Harrison was wearing bikinis in the first 2 planetary films, but Estrella Warren barely shows the cleavage - her hair is always in her way. Tim Burton could sexize this sexual saga and give adults something in the audience to look at. Even the painted Helena Bonham Carter never comes out of her costume, which looks like a big curtain. She's cute, but all love affairs are limited to anxiety and a bit of kiss at the end. As in Artificial Intelligence, which deals with interdisciplinary sex between robots and humans, it never provides - The Mayan Planet suggests mutual romance between humans and apes but only hints. Lisa Marie is the only monkey that dares to be sexy. This movie features three great actors, Tim Roth, Mrs. Carter & Paul Giamatti, who chew the scenery as a trio of apes and are fun to watch. Superlative make-up (certain Oscar) costumes, sets, music make it a hit summer movie in 2001.
