I've seen Dirty Work several times and it's probably my favorite Stan and Ollie short. This stadium and Ollie smoke chimneys and get a job to clean the chimney in Professor Noodle's house (Lucien Littlefield). While Noodle is doing crazy experiments in his lab, Stan and Ollie cause a lot of chaos to try to clean the chimney and destroy the living room. At the end, there is a place where Ollie falls into the special formula tank that Noodle uses for his experiments, and that makes him a chimpanzee! The best thing is where Ollie falls into the chimney and the bricks start on his head, but it does not seem to suffer much pain. Dirty Work is Stan and Ollie at their most entertaining. Great fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 stars of 5.
