BORN TO BOOGIE is a real find - although it's been a rock fan for almost thirty years, I've seen the film just a few days ago, and I've ranked him among the top rock movies of all time; the music is amazing (T. Rex's cream) and the visuals are still exciting and unusual, so this audience longs for the long-time effort of Ringo Starr, who worked great here. If you love music, you will be in T. Rextasy all over, because Marc Bolan is really a star of the work, front and middle. Even the fact that some songs are repeated, it does not matter a bit: different places, costumes, musical arrangements and bizarre visual concepts are used to provide a different structure and a lot of optimistic humor to what might end up as a "" concert film in other hands. As rich and full of packs as BORN TO BOOGIE, the film is only about an hour, but what is there is absolutely satisfying. There's my only criticism - the video package is about 71 minutes and at least one online source says the movie is 67 minutes, but it's probably like 61 minutes of rocking fun.
