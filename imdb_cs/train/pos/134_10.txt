Someone is filming this movie on a DVD to take his sacred place as one of the greatest films of all time at the age of ten to twenty, when critics and film historians look back on the so-called "Movies of the 1990s" and see how flawed they were and how Lars von Trier attempted to revolutionize and revive the international film world with this masterpiece. Currently, Zentropa (or "Europa", as referred to outside of the US) is one of the most interesting and respected views of uncertainty and almost psychotic uncertainty that culminated in Europe after the Second World War, whose physical horrors were tailored only to damage on the psyche of their people. Von Trier brilliantly paint his screen image. You will feel as if you were watching a lost classical spy noir from the late 1940s with perfectly lit black and white scenes, and at the same time you feel that you are on the verge of something beyond the borders, especially in scenarios such as assault on board a train. Literally, when you see this movie, you are witnessing the development of the artistic form. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Von Trier came shortly afterwards into his own dogmatic movement. And while his "Breaking the Waves" and "The Dancer in the Dark" are classic in their own right, "Zentropa" really raised the art of filming the film at new and exciting heights. 10/10, old as good wine and begs for DVD release.
