Also, for me, this Christmas specialty is very noble. In 1989, I grabbed 2 CDs that I found from a sound track record, I give one of my sister and keep the other one for myself. It's part of my family's Christmas tradition, and I'd really like to see the show again rather than just remember it when I'm listening. It was noted elsewhere that John Denver made a show at the Muppet Show and together they made more than one special. The good relationship between Denver and his fuzzy companions is clear here, in a charming and entertaining show that is good for all ages.
