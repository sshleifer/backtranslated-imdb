This film is described as a comedy, but it was not a comedy at all. Like any Panahi film, it was a very realistic drama that portrays the common thread of social inequality and hypocrisy. But it was very fun; much lighter than the director's dark and serious circle (my favorite Iranian film). The ingenuity of the girls and the cheating between them and the soldiers was as completely believable as if it were a documentary, and so cheerful. Shooting the actual match and the consequences was stunning. She added realism just like Australia Kenny, of course a very different film. Effects of all non-professional actors? soldiers and girls? were very trustworthy. It was very moving to see the passion, disappointment and excitement of these girls. Anyone in this country who thinks Muslim girls wearing chador are different from their own daughters should watch this movie? it will be a true opener. <br /> <br /> For me, the soldiers presented the current paradigm. They began with official official political responses to all the girls. As the film progressed, they found it increasingly difficult to maintain that attitude. When it seems that the whole of Tehran is falling apart for a wild celebration, everyone is caught up in it, and the ridiculousness of current policies is obvious to everybody. <br /> <br /> It was a very moving and unexpected end, and made the movie a really nice mix of emotions, frivolity, drama and social commentary. Although it is an adult cinema, I think teenage kids from the age of seven will really appreciate this movie (if they can read the headlines). It is remarkable that repressive countries such as Iran can produce films of the same quality as Panahi and Kiarostami. The possible limitations here are very inventive. Australian (and other) filmmakers could take a sheet from their book.
