This movie is great fun. I recommend that you watch yourself and then look with your friends again. It was fascinating yesterday night how well Norma Khouri could bring everyone to her world! I felt a little weird that my friends were going through the same roller coaster as I did. But everyone thanked and loved the movie. You know it's a great movie if you spend 2 hours after the film about the movie! <br /> <br /> I once saw a man almost to the level of Norma Khouri, but not where the same ring approaches. He is interested in the fact that my old Berkeley CA A.A. where everyone trusts everyone else. It will "sponsor" only people who seemed very good. Who knew he would have stolen more than 100k (in 1987 when it was real money) after being in the city for only 1 month. His victims were very fragile because they were sober in the first month or week. He was evil with great laughter and a big smile on his face. The above crime is nothing compared to what Norma Khouri did to her old neighbor. But I do not want to give anything. <br /> <br /> I just found this one night on the late night movie channel, "Showtim", I think. This is always the best movie fans to be totally deceived by seeing something and having their mind blown. Just drag your friends to see it and do not tell them anything. It's a very fun movie, it moves fast and never worn you. <br /> <br /> It should be an international classic all the time. I believe all the great movies will eventually rise to the top. Time will be very good for this movie. I'm sorry that no one has heard of it, in some ways it makes the surprise even better. The director and the editor were fantastic. They deserved to win the best documentary. <br /> <br /> You are watching this movie!
