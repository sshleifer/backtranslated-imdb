I read in the early nineties a little ad in a horror magazine about Liebe des Totes or something like that. This, of course, awakened my curiosity and so I ordered Nekromantik 1 and 2 and Der Todesking (The Death King). Necromantic movies are fine, even interesting and unique in approaching Necrophilia (although they are probably horror opera recordings rather than intentions to cause fear in the mind of viewers, they are actually quite fun.) <BR/> <br /> TODESKING is, in my opinion, opinion of one of the best films ever shot. It consists of a series of scenes showing many aspects of death. Death as an enemy; Death as relief, Death as a very physical disintegration of the body. The film is a metaphor of life. It shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are. It reduces the audience for the child they really (we) have. The fact that we can not really understand the nature of Death, and thus the process of dying, is the main message of the film. This is the most realistic movie. Never Buttgereit attempts to hide death behind white roses or anything else. No matter what moral standards you set, death is irrefutable and sooner or later there will be no fiction but your reality. That's about you, dear reader, as it is for moviegoers. It seems that some juvenile reviewers do not understand this, which is entirely justified because of course they will live forever ... This is no exploitative movie. Why? Because death does not use us. It reaps us. We cultivate for seven days, then we are brought back to the able-Andean state before birth, that's Death. Buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest stories. Whether you decide to consider it "optimistic" or "pessimistic" is up to you. At first glance it may seem very dark. Think, however, that something must live to die. "Who wants to live forever?" I believe that when Buttgereit shows the body consumed by worms, it shows not only the breakdown but the generation of a new life. Is it not better to die and give life to worms and then to birds and ultimately to become ground than to remain a living dead zombie, one of the favorite animals of the genre? When you realize this, you see Der Todesking in his right context. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Seven days are weeks (weak, deadly!) Seven times in the last hour. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid of Reaper, says Buttgereit, because Reaper only takes what is ripe. And apples that are not eating will be rotting! Be a good life, colleagues IMDB'ers! (And watch this film, which compares only with Ingemar Bergmans "Seventh Seal" in terms of depth and versatility)
