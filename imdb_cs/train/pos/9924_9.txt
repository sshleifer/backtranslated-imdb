Ah, Domino is actually a breath of fresh air, something new to the world of cinemas. I liked the film very much because of complicated plotting, diverse characters and intense camera effects. I have seen some camera complaints and, in fact, according to the creators themselves, spectacular and wild shots have been the culmination of errors from time to time. All you see is the desired effect. Maybe some people complain because something like this has never been before, though that's what makes it different. In a deeper aspect, see how Domino sees things through her eyes, think about it. Данни, T данни exists. Even though it is "dirty" nature, according to some, it is in fact just a quick form of narration. The plot really is not that hard to follow if you really focus on what's going on. Maybe it's just me because I see films from many different aspects, such as acting, plotting, etc. I'm not an "interpreter" or something that chooses films apart, it just comes to me. That's what I'm saying, I believe it's really a great movie, even though it's a future like a classical culture, a puzzle, or anything else. And those figures, but there is no doubt about how busy it is. I believe the cast is excellent because they all do good work that effectively portrays their characters, that's what ladies and gentlemen do. The characters are all unique and the plus is that you get on the conscience of a small piece of each of their lives that divides them further. Basically, I personally loved casts and characters. Everyone who blasts this film and burns maybe does not see it like me or just does not want it. It does not matter that it's a great movie, it's a great movie time.
