Although the story is basically routine and ends with "surprise," it's nothing but a bad joke about an audience, you can see what attracted these good actors to the project - offering them such roles in which good actors can shine and shine they do. The film is impeccably made - for its time. In 2000 it was modified as "Under Suspicion," and if you want to see only one version of the story (that's all it deserves, really), I recommend it last, with Hopkins up-to-date direction and more explicit references to rendering points , which the original could only indicate. But the end still blows. (** 1/2)
