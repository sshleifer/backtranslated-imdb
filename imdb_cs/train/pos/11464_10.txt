What is most worrying about this movie is not that the school is killing madness like the one she liked, but the truth is that teenagers such as Cal and Andre ... are normal children with normal families. By using camera techniques and Blair Witch, Ben Coccio succeeds in bringing us into the life of two friends who have some problems with high school, although we have never said exactly what these questions are about. They seem to be typical - a lot of people hate high school, so what? Some of you just do not believe that they sometimes make very well thought out Den Zero massacres. Browser camera scenes at school during shooting are even stronger. You can not believe that it really is happening and that it really happened. Handheld camera technology also creates the illusion that it is not a film scenario, a brilliant idea given by the subject.
