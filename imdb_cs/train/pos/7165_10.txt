I've noticed it a long time ago, but only today I noticed it. I was sick, so I ran away from what to watch! I'm so glad I saw it and which I was able to clear my memory for the first time and watch it again. This movie is so beautiful! I was reminded of the fried green tomato at the Whistlestop Cafe. <br /> <br /> The story goes back in time and at the end of the movie we see the continuity. Some people said it was a children's film. I disagree - it can be made by Disney and many characters are kids, but I am 23 and I loved it! There were times when my spine was trembling. The story, unlike other movies, is full of adventure today. I just ordered a book from Amazon, I can not wait!
