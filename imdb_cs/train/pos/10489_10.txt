This light comedy should be useful for entertaining value. It's sometimes hysterically funny, but if you have not done that track for a while, you'll miss comedy when it explodes. they are fairly believable in their roles. As Grace cares about meeting her dead wife, her girlfriend played well. She's the real lady. And my favorite is Grace's white pussy suit she wears. I strongly recommend that this be seen by anyone who wants to laugh out loud, who are desperate to think of a guy or just want to look at something else.
