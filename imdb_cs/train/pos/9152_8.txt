This is a good movie at 99% duration. I feel that this end has concluded this film with a higher reputation. It's filmed somewhat naive. This is clearly done to create a more cool feel for the film - the feeling of isolation appears very soon on the basis of this film technique. <br /> <br /> Gorgeous characters are very well acting and featured in particular 'nutcase' called Joe. However, healthy (normal) characters are a bit too pathetic for my pleasure - granted, they should come across as pathetic, but it is The movie begins slowly (and the naive cinematographic work starts with "B") and very normally, but you will soon get to feel the approaching brutality that is going to happen, this is one of the most "twisted" <br /> <br /> After a sudden and unbelievably lazy end, I felt disappointed, I would have a movie 9 if the end was in line with the rest of the film but just like it was only 7 that appeared formerly in the movie. /> <br /> Give him his watch and excuse the end!
