Jim Belushi is amazing as "average Joe," who gets 15 minutes in "The Twilight Zone". Michael Cane is a mysterious bar offer that not only listens to Belushi's "story, but has a cure for all of Belushi's middle class problems: The Magic Potion that will bring an avalanche of changes in Belushi's life. <br /> <br /> <br /> Flashbacks show that he was terribly ashamed for 15 years as having defeated the championship at the High School Baseball Team. Belushi continues with his "pitiful life", seemingly happy, but always interested in "what if ..." For what seems to be a few days, Belushi experiences a "different" life, a huge success that admire and hate others the same degree . <br /> <br /> This is not quite "It's a wonderful life," but some elements are similar and very nice. "Termination" is predictable but still satisfactory. Watch out for the very young Cortney Cox in a bit like "fatal attraction" - like another woman. Very nice movie!
