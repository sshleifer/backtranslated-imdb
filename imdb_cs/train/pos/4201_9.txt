Pickup on South Street (1953), directed by director Samuel Fuller, features an amazing opening that creates a double complication. Candy's autumn slider (Susan Peters) collides with Skip McCoy's pocket (Richard Widmark dipped in shades of Sinatra cool). They do not know it carries a valuable microfilm; McCoy does not realize he cares about him. Both are not aware that they are being observed by two federal officials. Grift therefore moves to a certain extent in the field of knowledge. Candy is double tracked (Skip and Police) and is therefore twice as naive; The skipper, the convincing tiny thief, is particularly unconscious, dragged by federal agencies; all scientists are ultimately helpless. They can not stop the "departure" of government secrets or the spread of communism.
