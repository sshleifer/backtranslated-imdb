I think it's the best version of Quo Vadis? sometimes made. Well, yeah, the plot is not as strong and obvious as it is in a book, sometimes meandering and losing its aesthetic sophistication. The film is really "beautiful", it has the mystery and the style that other versions - with R.Taylor and the new from Poland - are definitely missing. It has the air of Roman decadence, the beauty of falling paganism and infantry Christianity. At least I believe he has it). Brandauer, Forrest and Syudov have done a great job in showing their characters. Forrest's Petronius seems to be the greatest cast of success (let alone Brandauer, who is one of the greatest actors ever) and accumulates the very essence of this dying world (IMHO). And it is done. That's what happened, guys ...))) IMHO
