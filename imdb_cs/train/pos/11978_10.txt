I love the full house so much that I could not live without a house. Why did it end? This will upset many fans. Can we have Full House II? Come on! But it is better for these DVDs to help us. I need the real ones to come up with another new episode. Love, the heat is filled with the house! All the characters are very cute and nice! Candace Cameron, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Jodie Sweetin, Bob Saget, Dave Coulier and John Stamos, love you! DJ, Michelle, Stephanie, Danny, Joey and Jesse, please go back to the screen, please! How is Michelle after a fall from a horse? How are Nicky and Alex? Is Joey alone or has a wife or at least a girlfriend? Still living in the same house? I want to continue in a full life! and please do not ruin me!
