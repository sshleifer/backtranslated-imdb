"Prison Murder" begins at runtime and does not stop until the end. Everyone had a reason to kill the victim and several people tried. William Powell is amazing as Philo Vance, a gentleman detective. Mary Astor is refreshing when she joins her niece who just wants to marry a Scottish gentleman and enjoy her inheritance. This movie is associated with "Nancy Drew, Reporter" on DVD, which is also fun. If you need to borrow the disk (or check it from a local library), do it. It's pure fun!
