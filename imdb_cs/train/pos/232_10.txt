What a wonderful movie. The characters were not only lively, but also lively, reflecting real day-to-day lives and family disputes. Each character has brought the unique personality of the story that viewers can easily connect with someone they know within their own family or circle of close friends. The story has a real flow of life that the viewer can adapt to and be part of drama, laughter and tears as the story develops. The script makes a good job of capturing the common emotions, actions and reaction of the characters to conflict, opinion and solution. It's not epic, but it's a very nice movie that you can watch with your loved ones. Lots of conscious head nodes and moments "ahhh" share and enjoy.
