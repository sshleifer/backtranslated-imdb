I'm rather a pedestrian, somewhat of a low taste. However, it seems to me that sometimes I try to raise my bar on my cultural awareness. This movie was one of my attempts. Throughout the movie I was amazed. I really enjoyed having got my own tape to see it again. This is a very thoughtful and emotionally striking film. I saw this as a huge question to the audience: What is the depth of sacrifice a person can accept may be asked to accept, should he accept? As a military member, of course, an important question for me. This question seriously values ​​the viewer of this film. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
