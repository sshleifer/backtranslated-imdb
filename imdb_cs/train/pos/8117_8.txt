I first saw this movie forty years ago on New York TV, and I thought it was a depressing view of the future. Wells considers the limitation of private freedoms to be a good thing. ("no private aircraft.") The 30-year war in the movie was the reason why this film was not proven by British filmmakers who are making war, the concept of the future and the concept of Korda and Co. the future is a real star of the film. Best acting is that Ralph Richardson as the boss. The combination of Winston Churchill and Edina from the Absolutely Fabulous comedy series. It is interesting to note that Boss's negative personality is a bit similar to the Churchill War Time.
