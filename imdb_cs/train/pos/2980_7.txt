This movie is just funny. helpless but fun. to enjoy this movie completely, you can not have an idea of ​​how this movie works, and enjoy all of the side jokes and hits that deal with the movie. It still seems to me a little funny at first when she says "I want a beer ........ cock". fun things. but what makes the film decent is the fact that it does not make it difficult to create a serious spin of the film, too many comedies are trying to have serious aspects that you simply do not believe. But that's different and just focuses on being funny. But I have to say that Yasmin bleeth is terrible in the movie and adds nothing but three major guys, coop, remer and whistle are very fun to watch and make the movie great watch
