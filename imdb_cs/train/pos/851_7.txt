Pierce Brosnan drank the last Martini and the murderous separk returns like an aging fake killer murderer, Julian Noble, who has special hobbies for teenage girls, bullfighting and tiny clothes. While working in Mexico City, he meets Danny (Greg Kinnear), a Denver suburban businessman who is in the city to make his life at the hotel bar. Despite their completely different personalities, Julian's rough and unbearable remarks became friends. <br /> <br /> Director Richard Shepard, largely borne by Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear, has revealed that he has not written Pierce Brosnan but I can not even imagine him. He proves he has a real talent for comedy and can be more than just James Bond or a well-witted spy. The scene where the two meet in a shiny hotel bar (stunning sets and beautifully photographed) is a really bravado piece of acting skills. The scene takes almost fifteen minutes and although it was probably carefully written, both actors are largely improvised, but they succeeded! It almost feels like a new standard in the screen. Think about Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in MEAN STEETS that improvise and add one of the finest backgrounds of many genre clich√©s and their own types of actors (Brosnan's James Bond Special) and you've got one of the most beautiful couples in the recent Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story gets lost after a while. After an hour, the film is exhausted. Still, and I can not exactly put my finger on it, I liked it very much. It feels very refreshing and original, with some imaginative use of sets and lighting, and some hints for Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville. Other characters have nothing to do, but this movie offers something new; in this respect almost effortlessly succeeds in mixing all conventional genres into a quite fun spoof. Very funny. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
