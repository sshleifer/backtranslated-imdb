Originally, I watched eight simple rules on the Disney UK channel for the first series and became completely addicted. When they did not show up, he was disturbed, but abc 1 listened, pointing to the second series. I did not think the next series would start after I read that John Ritter died, but the second series was not amazing because the last series came back to being an old excellent standard. I hope they soon went to another show, even though I could watch each show a thousand times. Kaley couco is my favorite character like Airhead Bridget and also works amazingly in Charmed. Rory is also good, shares my name and Grampa anyway. They will keep track of it until the end, hoping it will continue as funny as ever
