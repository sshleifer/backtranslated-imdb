I have to agree with all the others who sent. I've been watching it for a long time, but I'll tell you whenever I hear some music from this anime, I recall the story, the beautiful animations, the characters and the feeling I got when watching, and it makes me cry (such a happy but sad feeling). But I found the love story in him felt he was humbling and did not explain things correctly, but he did not destroy any part of the tracking experience. <br /> <br /> I was so annoyed in this anime, I just had to do some research after finishing (and looking at the end a few more times) and found all my answers and much more. I like how they have configured historical legends to get into this anime, it was amazing and just wanted to explore much more. (I've always been very interested in certain historical characters associated with this animation) <br /> <br /> <i> I think it should be a longer series, but if it's all they have to work with, they chose it nicely. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a sentimental anime with an excellent story, well-built characters (some mysterious) and a little fancy action. Although it was based on H-game it does not have any of these things, and I prefer it in this way (I have no problem with adult anima, in most cases I prefer it)
