It's probably not fair that I should have seen most of all the interesting reviews on the soprano and then added what people forgot but well ......... <br /> <br /> From the point of view of acting, how could an actor with these characters fail? Each of them is enchanting and intense in their life efforts. Tony Soprano - While the crowd "Capo" and suffering from mental illness, he still sees his life in front of him and knows what he has to do to survive. Each of his men sees their lives virtually from the inside as the truest form of voter turnout. It will surely take a boring page from every viewer, and I will add it! <br /> <br /> While some of the above things did not care for Bracco, I must say that this is the freshest role she has ever had since good times. It's Tony's side that makes him listen to his intellect, making him a decent one that offers him a rest when dealing with his human emotions that he has not felt for so long. He is simply given, his savior. (Not to speak in religious tones) <br /> <br /> But the knockout performance here is no doubt Edie Falco. To see her role as a prison guard in another recognized HBO series, "Oz", and then she saw Livia as the ultimate compliment to every actor or actress. She has crossed the famous actress's role, something that actors such as Merle Streep can get. A sort of chameleon that goes beyond the role. But, as I have already mentioned, with such strong figures as can any actor fail? <br /> <br /> The power of Livia is in your daily confirmation of faith in yourself. She is a survivor because she hopes her husband and family will be left behind. She is ready for the worst because she knows the dangers of her business, yet she knows that lifestyle is more than most women in Jersey. It is wise if it is not wiser and more streetlike than Tony himself. Overall, the biggest crime of a soprano family is that the viewer must wait until January 2000 to see the next season. This is, in my opinion, the worst thing in a HBO series. That was what brought The Larry Sanders Show, Sex and the City, Dream On, and others back to earth in popularity and eventually killed them. Too much space between seasons and very sporadic. Until then, I will follow the repetition with the hope that this programming gap is filled.
