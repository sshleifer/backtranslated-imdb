Well, after a long wait after seeing a few clips on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments, I've been waiting a long time for this movie to be shot. The task was simple, beautiful modeling Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves into a residential building that is a gateway to hell. Sentinel is a filmmaker who is terribly horrifying, even if it is quite slow. It's a mixture of Omen and Rosemary's Baby. The game is fine and there are some really disturbing bits, such as an unfortunate orgy scene with a dead father and a stout woman in the middle of an orgy that eats a cake and laughs. The end is a strange mixture of deformed people and cannibals. It's very strange, but in the end I really believe a great movie! One of my favorites in the 1970s, though nothing is original. It's crazy and very scary! Probably one of my favorite times. 9/10
