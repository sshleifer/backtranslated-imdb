I absolutely love this show, but first I saw the second episode. After watching the first episode, I found out why people turned off first. The first episode humor is not the best and tries to run the series properly. However, I still like the light and humorous attitude of the show. The characters are developing much more after the episode and become really nice characters. As the first episode, it really does not exactly represent the rest of the show, which is really good. The episode is not bad at all, but as the show progresses, it gets better and better, so watch more episodes before submitting any review of the quality of the show.
