As an anti-soccer person, I (on the surface) reluctantly took his younger brother to see this film, even though I secretly hoped it might be Eastern Eastern II. Trailers looked funny, so I thought I'd do it. <br /> <br /> It took about ten minutes, but then I was stuck to the screen and it had nothing to do with the spasm caused by sitting too close to the front because of the packed hall. The game was fresh and alive, the characters were interested and the jokes were really funny. The audience laughed aloud every minute. A soccer fan or no football fan, sport has become irrelevant to the main principles of love, friendship, family, independence and rivalry. Add a dash of Sikh culture and you have the formula for the best British comedy I've seen long ago, lets say it .... better than the East is the East. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Though it is not a characteristic twist and turning the film, there are some pleasant surprises on the way and things are not always the way you would expect. <br /> <br /> Let's say there were elements of predictability, but these were used satirically more than used as script fillers. I suppose that, depending on your particular liking for a happy ending, you could either be delighted / dismissed to the end. Personally, if there was any other result, I would write a hard written letter to the writers. As for the actors, I must say that Juliet Stevenson (Paula) gave the best performance. I never knew that such people existed, but her realism with sometimes bizarre concepts convinced me they might do it! The price for the most convincing (the main characters) goes unfortunately on Kiera Knightley (Jules), but do not do me wrong, even she offered great performance, it's just that someone must be the last of Kiera's best and sorry, this time you are. <br /> <br /> Tip: Do not leave before credits. As the lights returned, I realized I might not have watched the movie. My dear, but forgotten Ice Junkie melted into a sweet blue juice. Oh, I say, it was absolutely amazing and I can not recommend it enough. I'll definitely buy it when it comes out and add it to my collection of 3 videos. I'm a student. I just spray if it's worth it.
