This movie was hysterical. It has not been a long time ago. I think it's not "Good Will Will," but should it be? In fact, I went to the advanced screening to expect a lot less and was pleasantly surprised. The comedy strikes hard and is quite constant. Amanda Peet is hot and amazing. The whole audience I appeared with seemed to enjoy the movie just as I did.
