First, it's a quick "silence!" for those who say this movie smirked. You can not go to any movie that awaits Citizen Kane. It was a really funny movie. Jason Lee is good at everything he does. The only bug in this movie is that I do not think there's enough chemistry between Lee and Julia Stiles. They should be more concerned. In addition, the movie is fun. Selma Blair needs something to eat. She's worrying me. But it still looks beautiful. So yes, I recommend this movie for daily or light Saturday afternoon fun. Go see. <br /> <br /> EVALUATION: ** 1/2 of ****
