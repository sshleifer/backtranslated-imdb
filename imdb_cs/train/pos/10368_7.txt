Meryl Streep was incredible in this movie. She has an amazing talent for accents and she shows incredible skill in this movie overall. I really felt for her when Lindy was persecuted. It plays realistically as well. She had a disturbed, disturbed and uncomfortable feeling of how the media and the government continued in their unstoppable witch. From the original film, I did not expect much from the movies, but I really cared about it and the film is based on a real person and real events. It turned out to be better than I expected. Sam Neill was also excellent; that's the best work I've ever seen him, and I really liked him in other movies (like The Piano). I filmed 7, but if I could only rate acting, I would give him 9.5 and even 10 for Streep.
