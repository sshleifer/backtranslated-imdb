This movie was quite surprising. I did not expect much to be honest. Greta Garbo is the first Hollywood movie? So what? Probably something harsh and with the usual exaggerated hands and facial shouts that often show low silent movies. Well, I was wrong. Greta Garbo had to shock people like she did because the film made her star and deserved. She instinctively understood the strength of building, or simply holding a meaningful expression for a long, lasting moment, so its effect could be felt and not just seen. Still thinking about how this modern actress got into a dirty, silent movie? It was only years and years ago. The story is not so interesting, it's the usual story of love found and lost. It's just a Garbo performance like Leonory, a poor village girl who is doing well in a big city and then returns to get the man who disappears, giving him life. Co-star Ricardo Cortez is operational but his character is never really developed and he is humiliated by the script throughout. At one point, he is dressed as wearing Garbo's clothes, left in huff, then murdered back and returns them back. And we do not even talk about his terrible final scenes with Garbo and then with his wife. Too ordinary, after this he did not have much careers, and I understand why. But it's just like the somewhat mysterious subject of Leon's obsession. In this movie there is one absolutely fantastic line that just says everything. "Leonor, you become prominent." Yes, really noticeable. If you really want to know what's going on without seeing the whole movie, just look at the last 30 seconds or so - Garbo is a look when she's sitting alone in her luxury car saying everything. "She must be so happy to have everything she wants" - yes, Garbo's face says all about it. I have to see it again, Garbo is just amazing.
