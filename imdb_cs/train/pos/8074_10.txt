Gyps Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is just as poor as someone on Earth. Living in 1920 Ireland, Gypo and his Irish colleagues are part of the underground uprising against British oppression. One particular rebel who wanted to assassinate an Englishman will come back to the city secretly. He thinks he can trust his friend Gypo, but the 20 pound reward is too tempting. Gypo kills his boyfriend and falls into the pit of despair and drunkenness. Meanwhile, other Irish rebels are looking for an informant. Right now, Gypo is the main suspect, with money burning a hole in his pocket, but they, his friends, do not want to believe it. The story of an informant is simple, but complex in his moral and emotional questions. It's probably one of John Ford's most emotional films. What Gypo did is wrong, but we can understand his motives. We also understand his apologetic nature and there are plenty of sympathies for him. The script is also thrilling. It is a kind of tension in which we are sure we know that everything is over, so we must tear our teeth and carry it with him. The game is remarkable. Victor McLaglen, who worked in many of Ford's films, has probably shown his best performance (and won Oscar for him). Every other artist in the movie deserves his own. In addition to stunning scripts and acting, The Informer is one of John Ford's most powerful films. I love the darker side of the Ford. In my mood, as in The Informer, it reminds me of two of my other popular Ford films, The Long Voyage Home (1940) and The Fugitive (1948); it is also a bit like the Grapes of Wrath (1940) in these respects. 10/10.
