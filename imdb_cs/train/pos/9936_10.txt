It was one of my favorite series when I was a kid. The Swedish Broadcasting Company has decided to re-broadcast a couple of years when I just finished my first semester of medical school. I was surprised to see the depth in which the organs were explained. Certainly, some things are simplified, but most of them were right (although it was done 22 years ago!) And perfectly understandable. I would suggest that all students who will soon be able to look at it. It is a very good way, for example, to learn some basic medical word. Now I'm in the seventh semester and I think I'm watching the series once more once I buy a DVD-box :-)
