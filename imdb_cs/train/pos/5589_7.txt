A band with symbolism and full of beautiful cinematography, Extase is far more than the erotic drama we all expect. It's almost a silent film, with what dialogue exists in German, and this is a very simplified German. Perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest European audience, because someone with even a small high school can easily postpone the subtitles. The story is just as little important, the film continues on a film level rather than narrating. The symbols of fertility and the power of nature overcome human figures - there are scenes where the flowers cover the face of the anticipated stars of Hedy Lamar - and there are moments that remind the viewers of Dreyer, Vertov and Riefenstahl. If the film has a message, I think it's political: the bourgeois man is shy and helpless; the working class man is a happy, productive creature; and the woman is the creator, who is meant to not be fulfilled until she was wearing a baby. This mix of Soviet socialist realism and national-social dogma does not take the film in any way - it's a beauty that can be traced from beginning to end - but that is in a very different art era. Yeah, yeah, Hedy will unpack her.
