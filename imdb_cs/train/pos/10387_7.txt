After reading some other comments, I was expecting something really terrible, but he was pleasantly surprised. REALITY CHECK: The original series was not that good. I think some people remind them of more affection than they deserve, but in addition to the Daisy Duke's cars and legs, the scenarios were weak and bad. The Dukes were too intelligent and unpretentious for the plot hickers, the sharpened Boss Hog was too fragile to be evil, and Rosco was always hyper. It is amazing that the series really lasted as long as she did, because the stories had run out during the first series. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. If you look at this movie in its own right, not as a direct comparison to how you remember a TV series, then it is not bad at all. The real star is, of course, General Lee. The rides and bits are great and that's really what D.O.H. it's all. Johnny Knoxville is his usual eccentric self, and along with Sean William Scott, as a cousin Bo, they make this movie really funny in the funny Dumb-And-Dumber way the TV series has never reached. Beautiful Jessica Simpson is angry as Miss Daisy, Burt Reynolds makes much better Boss Hog and M.C. Gainey makes the credibly ugly Rosco P. Coltrane, as he should always be. <br /> <br /> If you do not like humor crazy and crazy car pieces, then you should not watch this movie anyway because they should know what to expect. Otherwise, if you want to have a fun car-action movie with some good laughs that are not too taxed on the brain then go see this nice romp with an open mind.
