No, this terrifying 70-year-old horrible clinker is not a deadly demon-dessert dessert cake. Nevertheless, this exceptionally terrible, though undoubtedly fun and catchy waste of cathode ray, reaches the breathtaking peak of absolute, unceasing stupidity and suffering, which is very tasty in such a hopeless way - it is an absolutely amazing way. Richard Crenna, who looks embarrassed and probably drunk, and Yvette Mimieux, who acts as if she never crossed the brutal rape she suffered in "Jackson County Jail," grimly portrays the disgustingly nice and decent suburban couple whose picturesque, dull, sleepy town existence is distracting when an adorable German Shepherd receives, because it turns out that as a family pet will become an ancient deadly evil spirit. Soon, Mimieux and her two repugnantly cute children Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann (psychic extraterrestrial Disney paintings "Witch Mountain") worship rough pastel drawings of ugly, ugly dog ​​entities in the day. Boy, is not that really scary and worrying now? But it's funny, horribly frightening, thanks to Harington's hopelessly weak direction, cartoon (not so) strange effects, a nearly painfully hidden, inconspicuous conspiracy, and gameplay that struggle with an absurd story (besides Marty Beswicke and RG Armstrong shortly appear as members of satan culture, and Victor Jory has nice portraits as a helper native to America). Favorite scene: Dirty Mephestophelion mutt gives whammy to Crenna, practically forcing him to hold his hand in wildly rotating mowers. While fans with sniper snobs can hold their noses behind the utterly rotten smell of this unpleasantly pissed conundrum, lovers of religious TV waste should treat this extremely hideous tiny stone as equivalent to Alpo.
