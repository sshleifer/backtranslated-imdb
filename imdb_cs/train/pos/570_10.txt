I was horribly watching this movie for the first time, 13 years after its release. It's a story that every father or brother can have ... one brother is a little wild, the other brother is a typical older child. Craig Sheffer is like the oldest brother too absent, but Pitt is amazing and Skerritt is perfectly occupied as a father. The fishing scenes that were filmed in Montana are absolutely breathtaking ... I did not know that hunting puppets could be so attractive. The film focuses on this book, with some modifications to make it more suitable for film format. Unlike most books on film stories, this is measured. It's a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional film.
