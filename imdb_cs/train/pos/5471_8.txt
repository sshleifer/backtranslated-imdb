Throughout 1933, this film has gained many edits because it has been very superior to the story and the fact that Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck) will do anything to gain great wealth and power. Lily's father forced his daughter to prostitution at the age of 14 and grew up in a steel mill town with very poor people, and her father ran for speakeasis that brought to her home all the male figures who had eyes on Lily. As the story progresses, Lily meets a man after a man and eventually finds the man who has everything and is the player of the banker. It's great to see the very young John Wayne (Jimmy McCoy Jr.), who was only 25 when this picture was produced and Jimmy did not even get to the first base with Lily or for lunch. Very young George Brent (Coutland Trenholm) plays alongside Barbara Stanwyck and both have performed excellently. This is a great 1933 film produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and has been locked in the province for many years and is just recently shown on a silver screen. This film is rather mild compared to what we see on today's Hollywood screens, but in 1933 it was very immoral to watch this type of film. Enjoy
