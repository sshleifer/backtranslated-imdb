This is a very rare example of a film about transvestitism (heterosexuals). The film captures the subject of taboos so that even a general audience who did not know about transvestism is very much sympathetic to its main character. Adrian Pasdar is very credible like Gerald / Geraldine, and he does not forget that this brilliant acting. Director Christopher Monger is very sensitive, with such a difficult issue that she has managed quite well and which puts it in a good story. Not a big movie, not an "artistic" movie, but a small, beautiful movie!
