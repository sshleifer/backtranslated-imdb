"It's not love" is a great example of the genre of chase, which many people think is of fundamental importance. Love between the two main characters may be more than brotherly. I believe Heaton falls in love with Spike, but Spike is too naive to see it. I'm really convinced that this is portrayed in such scenes as blowing sequences and letter writing. Heaton is a great confidential approach to Spike. With his intense facial expression, he pays great attention to writing the name of Spike at the top of his letters. One thing I noticed when looking at external reviews is that when the film was shot, it seems that the filmmaker did not fully understand the film because he did not even mention the possibility that Heaton had sexual feelings for Spike. I also feel that some reviewers have not recognized it by using phrases such as: "Who is Heaton? What does he do with delay like Spike?" However, this person may hit the nail with a note. Spike shows noticeable signs of having A.D.D, even though I do not think you realized it because it seems to use the word "retard" as a derogatory term. Though it is not for the weak heart. The film is immensely based on procedures, after filming until the end of the dialogue between the two heroes is not much. If you are not used to watching such deep, harsh movies, stay away.
