Chris and Andre are two average, ordinary teens. Some misunderstanding and selected others. But they stand together and everyone will pay. Together they form the "Army of Two". They plan and plan "Day Zero". That day is when they decide to rebel against their high school and inevitably assassinate 14 people in cold blood. "Zero Day" is hardly a fictional narrative about Columbine's tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Zero Day" is one of the movies that you can see behind your head. Two main actors (Calvin Robertson and Andre Keuck) are doing so well that their characters seem to be almost any excluded teenage adolescent on the street. Their performances were very plausible, these guys liked it and it was scary. Filmed on the video almost completely from the viewpoint of adolescents "Zero Day" feels very real and authentic, just as you are right there. These children try to rationalize their actions to the audience and the actors are selling them. But be warned that tragedy follows the tragedy from start to finish and that the end is shocking and restless for somebody.
