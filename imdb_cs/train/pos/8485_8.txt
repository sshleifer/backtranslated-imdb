Gung Ho tries to express a lot of ideas while having fun with wise comedies. The result is uneven but generally fun. Keaton equalizes all three aspects of his lead quite well. Wantabedde is even better. One warning: George Wendt is very poor in his supporting role. Otherwise, it's a pretty good time capsule.
