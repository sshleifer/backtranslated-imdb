This gem does not work, 1936 Invisible beam, often. But no one can forget about it. The story is elegant. Karloff, angry and angry in his Carpathian retreat, is Janos Rukh, a genius scientist who reads ancient rays of light to discover events in the great geological past, notably the crash of a strong radioactive meteor in Africa. He is joined by the still elegant Lugosi (as a rare hero) who studies "astro-chemistry". Frances Drake is a beautiful young wife; Frank Lawton's romantic temptation; and Divine Violet Kemble Cooper is Mother Rukh, in a performance worthy of Maria Ospensky. The story moves fast in courageous episodes, with special effects that are still handsome. It also contains some wonderful lines. One Rukh revives the mother's gaze and asks, "Mother, you see, you see?" "Yes, I see it more clearly than ever, and what I see is scaring me." Better yet, when Mother Rukh says, "He broke the first scientific law." I am not alone among my acquaintance in the fact that for many years I have confused exactly what is the first law of science. The film is certainly a desert island material.
