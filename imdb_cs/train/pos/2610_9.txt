Within ten years of Wildside's broadcast, nothing has worked in local production. It includes two series of pleasant but overrated Underbelly that brought to life events in the recent criminal history of Sydney and Melbourne. Miniseries Blue Murder (which also played by Tony Martino, but as someone on the other side of the law) may be an exception. <br /> <br /> Wildside is currently being repeated late at night on ABC. After a long time I watched the show, amazing storylines and very human characters still amaze me. The cast is excellent: Tony Martin as a detective scary by the extinction of his son Rachael Blake (who later joined Martin in real life) as a community worker fighting alcoholism and Alex Dimitriades as a young cop. Also a good supporting role is provided by Aaron Pederson, Jessica Napier, Mary Coustas (yes, Effie herself) and young Abbie Cornish. ABC inexplicably released only the first three episodes on DVD a few years ago. The logic of this type of marketing is outside of me, but I think it may have something to do with license disagreements with the original manufacturers. A great series that was born remarkably well. Here we hope ABC DVD will have a common approach. <br /> <br /> (According to the moderator on the ABC message board, we need to release another DVD release in December 2009)
