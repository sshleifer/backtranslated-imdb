This film was nominated for the best shot, but lost to Casablanca but Paul Lukas defeated Humphreya Bogart as the best actor. I do not know why Lucile Watson was nominated as the best actor, I just do not think he's done a very good job. Bette Davis and Paul Lukas and their three children leave Mexico and come to the United States in the first scene of the film. They go to the house of Davis's relatives by train. Davis and Luke were underground to stop the Nazis, so they are very tired and need rest. But when they come home, the Nazis are living there, and they can not do so much either. It turned out that the Nazis are just looking after the money and are willing to conclude an agreement with Lukas. Their conspiracy is more of a conspiracy, but you can find out for yourself.
