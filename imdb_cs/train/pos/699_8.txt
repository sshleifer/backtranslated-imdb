I've seen Insomnia's nightmare for a long time, and for the first time I have to say that I really found it to be quite good. If you are a fan of Dominic Monaghan, you will love him. The movie is happening inside his mind - or is he doing it? Playing from all the others is somewhat grim and restless, and some scenes can be truncated, but in the end it works. Extra DVDs are just as great as a movie, if not bigger for Home fans. He has so many sincere moments from the set, outputs and a great interview with the director. Everyone who has gone through a separate movie will love to watch Tess (director), Dom and everyone else on a very small, tight personal set will try to launch this little trippy scary movie. It was kind of nice and I'm glad to have it in my collection.
