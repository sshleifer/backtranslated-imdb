"Ko to tamo peva" is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Tragicomedy with very profound consequences on the fate of mankind showed the seemingly very ordinary and ordinary people of the Bosnian Serb province just before World War II. I saw it in a small cinema in Russia, where the film was very limited and I have not had a chance since then. It's a shame that this great movie is almost forgotten. I searched for a copy of VHS or DVD many times and unfortunately - could not find any. I would be very grateful to other fans of this little jewel of film making for designing ways to buy a copy.
