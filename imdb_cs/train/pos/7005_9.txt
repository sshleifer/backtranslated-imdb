When the DVD was released, I came to the market and bought it. And I think my money was right as I expected before I bought it. An amazing film I can say to Will Smith, he was an amazing actor, as if in action movies or serious. It always provides record braking performance. I think it's a movie after an August rush that causes one to cry while watching. The way the director described the story was really amazing. His previous life and his new life in the film were rightly handled to the audience. I could not even find a bug in the story or the way it shoots. I think his DVD should be a household because it will be a really nice thing for your collection. It's not a movie that needs pop-corns for joy, it's a movie that allows viewers to learn lessons. Now, what is the lesson you see when watching. And I advise those people who are critics of the film, please watch out if you could find some criticism about this movie, then please talk to me.
