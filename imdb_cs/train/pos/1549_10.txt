Movies and movies are available. Movies are more often than cinematographic "candy", while films are real works of art. Fraulein The doctor is well placed in the other. Like most audiences, I was very impressed by the battle scenes, but the fearfulness of the central character's image is what I consider to be the most powerful film quality. After doing everything possible to serve his country as the true daughter of Germany, all the time in the bout of morphine addiction, Fraulein dies by the great German High Command despite all his efforts. The scene in which the Doctor is carried on the back seat of the Mercedes Benz auto command, lonely, desolate and sobbed, may be one of the saddest and most realistic images of "spying" a lot in life. Only the anxiety pain introduced by Richard Burton in Spy, which came from the cold, is coming. Fraulein Doctor is a much deeper film than one can imagine in a unique view. I just want its producers to see that it is suitable for DVD release so that those who have never experienced it can not, and those who have seen it can again (perhaps again) enjoy this extraordinary movie.
