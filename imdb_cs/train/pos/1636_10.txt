This is one of the biggest 80s of movies! It looks like a "turd in punchbowl"! I can not believe Mad Magazine has condemned or what. And yet proudly put their name on the show "Stuart", "I-speak-a-no-enlish Chinese lady" and "UPS guy for speed". What's wrong with that? And I love Ron Leibman - it's fox! Wondering why his name was removed from the credit? It was his most entertaining role that I know. Of course, it's not as dense as in the Rae standard. But, in my opinion, this film is right there with National Lampoon's Vacation. If you like movies such as Porky, Fast Times, The Last American Dolls or any of the other films focusing on 80s teenagers, you will love this! Rent it and see what I think!
