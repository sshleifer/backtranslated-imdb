I think everyone must come back at some point. And that's exactly what is embarrassing with Jack Dundee (Robin Williams), who plans to do in "The Best of Times". Yes, the man who laughed with the radio in "Good Morning, Vietnam" is playing football. In this case, they try to play the game that stands on the prestigious high school title. But former teammate Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) does not meet her so easily. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the best movie for every man. But Williams and Russell are actually a very good comedy team. And some names in this movie are likely to give you giggle (at least). Look at it.
