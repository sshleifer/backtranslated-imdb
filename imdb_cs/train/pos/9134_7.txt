"Purple Rain" has never been a critic darling, but it's a cult classic - and it deserves to be. If you're a prince fan that's for you. The main plot is the Prince to see his coarse parents in himself and he falls in love with the girl. Believe it or not, this movie is not just singing and dancing. There are many intense scenes and it is stunning. Sometimes it looks funny, but when it works, it really works. Big hit and miss. <br /> <br /> There is no one in the movie. They are all on one side of the Prince like "The Time" and "Vanity 6". Still adds the magic of the movie. When the Prince is sometimes on the screen, he lights up and it's fun to see him at his top. <br /> <br /> Finally, go and see if you love a prince like me. If you are not a fan, it will make you one.
