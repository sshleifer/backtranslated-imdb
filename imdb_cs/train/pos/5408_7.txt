Of these Pokemon films (which are best for my little ones): Pokemon The first movie, Pokémon 4Ever, Pokémon Heroes, Pokémon 200 and Pokémon: Enta and Unknown, is probably the most environmentally friendly one, probably the most beautiful and quietest . Whether it's good for you or not, "Pokémon 4Ever" still enjoys much. In addition to the above three points Pokemon film includes good humor and good CGI (as well as anime). The time-motivated film is well represented and the team rocket (comic reliefs / bad rubbish) end up with relatively good gags and eventually become more protagonists than sidekicks. <br /> <br /> Defects are, as always, unnecessary violence and action and baddie is quite uninteresting, even more than a few Pokemon baddies movies. <br /> <br /> A strange pokemon is followed by a pokemon by a hunter in the woods. The young boy is trying to save pokemon and it takes him somewhere ... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Ash, Brock and Misty enter a big forest ... Curious? Take a look at the rest ... <br /> <br /> Good for all Pokémon fans and fans of American anime fans, enjoy "Pokémon 4Ever"! :-)
