I have no idea how Texan (director Douglas McGrath) and American actress Gwyneth Paltrow have ever taken it out, but when they saw it again, you'll remember what the first upset about Mrs. Paltrow! I have long since left this woman and I still feel it is rather boring in her Oscar-winning "Shakespeare In Love," but right here she has all the tones - she's perfect like Emma Woodhouse. Maybe she won her Oscar for Shakespeare, but she should be remembered. <br /> <br /> Of course, she is surrounded by great support for cast, including Toni Collette, Greta Scacchi, Juliette Stevenson, and others. ... Jeremy Northam is very tempting to love, even if the script breaks somewhat into his statement of love for Paltrow (in a process that allows all tensions to exhaust their relationship); after a few years Ewan's hair was a bit easier to take than it was in 96, and I personally think that we find today the crack of Alan Cumming. But undoubtedly Sophie Thompson (sister of Emmy Thompsy, daughter of Phyllida) is no doubt Miss Bates; what this version needs is the scene where Emma will reconcile with Miss Bates, for she is the figure whose fate has drawn us. The film is worth watching (again, even) for her performance alone. <br /> <br /> Overall, it has become splendidly aging with spell to save and more than enough hatred to solve the British class system. It's worth renting (because it's unlikely that Paltrow would ever be that good again - but we'll always have Emma).
