First viewing: July 21, 2008 <br /> <br /> Very impressive script and comedic acting and timing of this movie. She has lost no power for 40 years now. Neil Simon shows a great view of human nature and relationships, as well as how to create an original comedy from unusual situations. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau give a great comedy show. Neil Simon was inspired by real events in his own life to write the play from which this film is based. <br /> <br /> One of the best written and performing Hollywood comedies ever! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, only nominated for 2 Academy Awards: "Best Custom Scenario" and "Best Movie Editing". Hollywood rarely commits comedy, no matter how good they are.
