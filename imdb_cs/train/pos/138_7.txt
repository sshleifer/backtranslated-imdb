I do not understand why the other notes focus on McConaughey. He was never a very interesting film actor. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie is writing and joking. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGaw make an unusual comic duo, definitely not a kind of action. Though they can not be said that their characters are well developed, they are no less fun. The version I saw was on HDNET and had subtitles for the Spanish dialogue, so it certainly was not a problem. The use of Spanish gives more authenticity. <br /> <br /> A very underestimated film, judged by an unusually low score by IMDb members, has given it. I thought it was fun and interesting, and it's worth at least 7. Lots of screaming movies with higher scores and big money at the box office are a lot less interesting.
