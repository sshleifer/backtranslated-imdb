Like the Arabian nights, this film plays stories telling stories to feel that there is a conspiracy, plot, and other plot: it opens what appears to be the frame of the blind man who tells the story of his life, the memory that brings us to the blind man, where we find out that about half of the story is coming. (It must be admitted that the other half does not fully meet the promise of the first.) As an Arab night, it tries to impart as many folk motives from the Middle East to one job. Liberated genie, beautiful princess, flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toys, sailing, overcrowded marketplace, bad vision, jewels ... I do not know why it works, but it is. Everything is so beautiful. The sets are beautiful. July Duprez is beautiful. Score Rozsy is especially beautiful. As usual, it is Hungarian; but somehow he could convince himself that he was a Hungarian Persian way.
