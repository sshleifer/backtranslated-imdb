My only tiny interview with the movie I grew up when I knew STAIRWAY TO NEBE is that the beautiful RAYMOND MASSEY is being pushed to the test scene for the last twenty minutes. The test itself, the IMO, is the least interesting part of this fascinating fantasy. David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are marvelously cast as young lovers, but it is ROGER LIVESEY, who gives the most vibrant and trusted performances. French accent MARIUS GORING is delighted (he even gets into the note on Technicolor) as a heavenly messenger sent to receive Niven when his wartime is not threatened by surveillance. Goring has some of the smartest lines and brings them with pleasure. <br /> <br /> When I see TCM for the first time in twenty years tonight, I think it is the supreme example of what was great films for 1946. Technicolor photography, somewhat subdued and dirty, is excellent, and the way it moves into a black and white image for celestial sequences is done with great imagination and efficiency. The opening scene is one that really draws the viewer into fantastic aspects of the story - and Niven's tense conversation with the radio operator Hunter when his plane crashes into the ground unexpectedly leads to an unforgettable romantic encounter. A truly amazing film from the beginning to the end, another triumph Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
