It was in 1988, when I first saw "The Ronnie and Nancy Show" (on Austrian TV). At that time I was already a big fan of Spitting Image (since the Montreux Film Festival won the bronze rose in 1986). Of course, I recorded every show on the tape and watched it over and over - especially "The Ronnie and Nancy Show". I remember the scene when Ronnie stood before the image of Abraham Lincoln (he thought it was a mirror) and he said, "I need a stick." Or he's the most amazing of all when he played with his dog ball - but on the contrary! It's such a pity that Spitting Image seems to fall into oblivion; it was one of the most amazing and intelligent TV shows at all. Compared with other satirical broadcasts, he was definitely the best of all. <br /> <br /> Well, it's been almost 20 years since then and I wish I could see it again. Is it possible to buy it from someone ... somewhere?
