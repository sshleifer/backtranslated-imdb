I saw this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and blew it all out. The structure and performance of the movie was fantastic ... I know it will not, but it really deserves Oscar nod. Cal and Andre were phenomenal as two excited classmates. Yes, the film is very controversial, and I see a lot of people who have a lot of problems with it because it's shooting at school and especially getting to know you with murderers. However, despite its harsh and blunt theme, Zero Day is so worth watching. I look forward to the video, so I can buy it - it's very, very good. A very strong and intense ... shooting sequence leaves you as it is almost too realistic. Their uncertainty, "recordings", student shots and panic are utterly indescribable. I really hope he gets the attention he deserves. It's done in the same format as the Blair Witch Project, a handheld camera that appears as a true home-made documentary film - but God's DANGER better. Very impressive, hats for all involved. If you have a chance, you should really see it.
