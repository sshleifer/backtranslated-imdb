The story of Good Lord MR TOM on paper makes it obvious that we have a large dose of Maudlinian, sick sentiment. But the talented director, Jack Gold, is an expert in touching emotions in the right way and appears instead as a convincing, deep-moving warrior with excellent productions and leading performances. One of the best, if not the best, television films of the 1990s that might have been even more successful if they were released in cinemas. <br /> <br /> Evacuating children to rural towns and villages in World War II was, of course, a common practice, but in the case of a young boy, double importance was due to poor home life in the capital of the United Kingdom. the home front is not exaggerated, and the construction of the film until it is deep, with the misty end, leaves us feeling optimistic despite what has happened before. It's almost (but not quite) a good comparison with the final on it's Wonderful Life (1946) All, Modern Classics.
