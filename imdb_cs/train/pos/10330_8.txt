This is actually a trilogy of three short stories by Somerset Maugham. The first is Verger, which is about 15 minutes long and very pleasant. After 17 years, Albert Foreman is released from work in the Church because he can not read or write. So what does she do? Of course, opens the tobacco trade! The second is Mr. Know-All, which was in fact a story I read in school six years ago and immediately forgot until I heard a familiar introduction. Another 15 minutes, and also very good. The movie worked better than the book for me, but then perhaps it was because I was only last time. <br /> <br /> The third one is almost weak. Almost one hour in length it simply stretches. It's not all that bad, but not as fast and clever as the last one. I watched for the first quarter of an hour and then jumped forward to the last quarter-hour and found it still makes sense, and I really did not miss a thing! <br /> <br /> Overall, I give them 8, 9 and 6 out of 10, respectively.
