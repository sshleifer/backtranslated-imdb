* Possible Spoilers * Although it was done before (and better) in 'Midnight Express' and 'Return to Paradise', Brokedown Palace still chords me. <br /> <br /> Here we have a story of two young girls traveling through Thailand and arrested for allegations of drug trafficking. Was it Alice Clare Danes? Was Darlene Kate Beckinsale? Was he a handsome stranger they met on their journey? Nothing really matters, because this is the story of friendship and trust and the boundaries they can relate to. Throw Bill Pullman as an unenthusiastic lawyer and Jacqueline Kim as his Thai bride (and a better lawyer than he is) and we have a nice little story that holds the audience's attention. Brokedown Palace is nothing special or known for any reason - it's not an original concept, it does not show the sensational violence that leads to the fact that the crowd, which is defective and avant-garde, talks about "ruddy realism" or "hard crazy truths" just a good story with some subtle performances. Bill Pullman is the weakest with his reckless pull and gravel way of speaking - I was pretty bored with nature. Kate Beckinsale, despite being decent, is nothing spectacular. She works well, but it's not really an unforgettable performance. Jacqueline Kim, however, is in good shape, creating a sympathetic and defined figure where there really is not much work. <Br /> <br /> But do not make a mistake - this is the movie Clare Danes. For a long time I've been a fan of her work, and that's no change. She captivates in every scene that appears, and it would not be for her, the movie would probably find herself in a tedious drive. I especially praise her performance in the scene between her and Darle's father. The movie also has a great soundtrack. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
