It must be one of the best serial killer films I've ever seen, and it comes from someone who absolutely loved the Silence of the Lambs. HBO hit the jackpot here. This movie is convincing from the first moment to the last. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many basic themes that it's hard to tell exactly what it's about. He chronicles a ten-year search for Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Stephen Rea performs as an inexperienced forensic expert who is in charge of investigating, and Donald Sutherland gives even more power as his cynical superior and the only person in the Russian government willing to help him. Both of their performances are a fine masterpiece. Rea begins to be naive and reluctant to compromise while Sutherland begins to be disconnected and almost enjoys the situation. After all, Rea becomes more tired and beaten by the system, while Sutherland is more passionate and idealistic. In any other film, I would say that Sutherland's performance is superior to others, but Jeffrey DuMann has also been rivaling him as a serial killer himself. DuMann creates this character that inspires empathy rather than the hatred we think we find - it's a monster, but he does not want to be, and we have the idea that he is just as disgusted with what he does as we are. It is tortured, ashamed, but also evil. If you can take incredibly dark subjects (and that is * very * disturbing) then you should see this movie.
