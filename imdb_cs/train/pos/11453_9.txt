The filmmaker inspired the art of Andy Goldsworthy, his search for the proximity of the country and the water and his sense of proportion - and so gently, so it was breathtaking to film for others. "Rivers and Tides" loves Goldsworthy's work and connects him as a visual concert of time and human presence in the flowing world, a world that conceals his power in a visible place.
