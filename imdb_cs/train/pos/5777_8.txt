The meteor crashes into the crater lake, heat from the impact causes the prehistoric eggs to hatch. Okay, so the conspiracy is just waste. But despite its apparently low budget, this appears to be one of the most exciting and entertaining films that exist. There are also some good moments of humor. In ages filled with so-called "monsters", who are nothing but ridiculous creations or rubber bands in a rubber-dressed suit that are dressed in ornaments and forced to tear (inexpensively), it is refreshing to find out that Plesiosaur in this little jewel is a great Harry Hans-style style. <br /> <br /> A pretty heavy movie to find but worth finding.
