With a simplified story and an engaging hero, it was a horror movie that started everything. John Carpenter brings Halloween night at night when Laurie Strode (her debut debut career) and her malevolent friends are planning a night full of fun - just strolling through the inexorable hero psychopath. <br /> <br /> Michael Myers escaped from a nearby mad aslyum ... with his sister's defeat fifteen years ago, he is now back in Haddonfield, the sleepy Illinois city where his murder took place. As soon as he puts his eyes on Laurie after pulling the pack into the deserted house where he lived, he begins to haunt her, terrorize her, and dress up nightlife for fear of choosing someone on her way to get to her. br /> <br /> Beautiful cinematography and lighting really make this moody scary movie haunted ... with long dark gunshots that constantly feel as if you were being pursued by a maniac serial killer. Myers is hidden until it is fully revealed to an exciting conclusion. Although "Halloween" is certainly outdated, it is not even more subdued. The thought itself is the gossip and this little shock is one of the most famous and unforgettable horror films ever made ... seven sequels have been made, and finally Rob Zombie equally awesome remake and set a new standard for horror that still exists today.
