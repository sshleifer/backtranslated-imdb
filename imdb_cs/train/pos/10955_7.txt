Originally, I recorded Sarah's show with a nice thick fat 8, but a little bit I was struggling with my late humor and a thin 7 is what settled. I'll explain it. You either love Sarah humor, or you will not. If not, I doubt anyone can convince you. You people know who you are and it's perfectly fine, but then you know it too. Moving, the first season gave us fantastic pieces about Sarah, her friends and family, and her efforts to live. One unforgettable episode will be "dragged" by officer Jay, whom she meets for the first time. - "Do you know why I stand here?" he asks. "Because you have all C in high school?" quiz matches. It seemed to be a real question. - That's fun stuff in my book. Sarah can come to you from strange angles. In another episode, her affair with God was very fun. The god, who was tiny and jealous, made a great joke. It's smart, it's a twisted look, but she would show us the truth in humor, and we laughed. Then came the second season. While not yet without some new and inventive comedy, we seem to have slipped somewhat into banal tails and fart of jokes, simply. I have some good laugh, but it seems a lot like a filler, while she and the writers were trying to instigate some original material. Sophomoric and tedious are the feelings I have for episodes lately but I have gutted it for the gemstones I find (turtle) and awaits it to turn it. I was a fan of the routine of her "Jesus is Magic" and I would like to think I understand what she is capable of. Let's get back to it.
