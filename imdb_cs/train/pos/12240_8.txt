If you are such a person looking for a realistic movie or a movie with a strong and believable plot, then this film is NOT for you. No, you will hate it. However, for those who like the sweet, lightly screwball comedy, then you will have a nice time watching this little movie. Tony Randall is working for the IRS and he is investigating a very nice farmer who has never realized the filing of a tax return. Whatever they are trying to convince him about the seriousness of their visit, everyone in the family is thrilled to have a company. They get to him and treat him as a family, and have plans to get him to daughter Debbie Reynolds. This is really the whole conspiracy. The film, however, gets high marks for a fun scenario and decent acting. It's really nice little curiosities from the late 1950s.
