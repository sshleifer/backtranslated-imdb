When my old girl in school got into preschool age, this miniseries appeared every morning at A & E from 8am to 9am. My neighbor and I made an agreement that Jane Eyre would not miss us for a minute, and our children grew to pre-school every morning for a week. Good choice. I forgot how much I loved this movie until I recently released my old copy of VHS. Timothy Dalton is very nice but still perfect as Rochester. A dark, harsh face, supernatural, temperamental temperament, and tenderness were directly from the pages of the book. Although Dalton gave her a little scenery, I could not sit with an adaptation to play Wimpy William Hurt or the ugly Ciaran Hinds. The spell here is that women love Dalton and get into romance. I want to know what happened to Zelah Clarke. She's dead like Jane, quiet, formal, with loud voices, but with a look. The spark in her eyes gives the audience a glimpse of strength and temperamental nature that helped Jane survive the ill-treatment she suffered during her youth. Criticism of its performance as "wooden" is wrong. A servant in the right English household would have maintained that attitude, but he speaks passionately when overcome by emotion. Unlike many other Janes screens, she seems clear enough to be Jane still enough to allow viewers to buy Rochester's attractions to her. Bronte's dialogue is a big part of why a book stays a script keeps much of it intact. Dalton and Clarke capture the interplay between Jane and Rochester in a spirit and silence. Although Jane looks so smooth and sweet as a vanilla pudding, she refuses to be covered with dark, embarrassed Rocheste. The two wires are beautifully played. <br /> <br /> This is the most perfect adaptation of the best romantic novels ever.
