Police Story is an amazing series of pieces for Jackie Chan to show her unique talents and bravery. Some of the stuntmen are the best and the most dangerous among Jackie. The whole fake battle final is probably Jackie's greatest single combat sequence, brutal and less comic, then say Project A or Drunken Master at the end of the fight you can almost feel the pain impact. But unfortunately, the rest of the film does not respect this quality, because it's rather a formal cop thriller with some comic elements. I always prefer JC in films like Project A, where his natural comic talents will come true. In serious terms, some elements of the police story just do not work for me. He said that although it is still there with Jackies the best movies due to incredible stunt work and pure spectacle. As usual with Hong Kong movies, avoid English dubbed DVD versions, as it is really horrible to keep the headlines. <br /> <br /> Great stunts, OK movie, a good starting point if you have not seen the JC movie before and well worth the watch for a fan of 7/10 movie
