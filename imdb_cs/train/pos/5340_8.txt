Clara Lago is a beautiful title character, essentially a film about a Spanish / American girl who moved to Spain with her mother during the Spanish Civil War. It turned out that her mother would return home to die, and she stayed with her grandfather. She also makes friends and experiences a lot in a short while. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) is first harassment, then approaching. The film is beautifully shot, most often bathed in soft colors. Carol longs for the father who is the pilot in the war, and you can feel the love he has for him. While war itself is captured by the back seat in this film, it surrounds the lives of the character. I think you will like it. Take a look at Clara Lago, who does a great job like Carol. She is definitely one to watch.
