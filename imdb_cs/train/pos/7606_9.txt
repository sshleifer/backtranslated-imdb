The first Lost series began bang ... literally and slowly declined. This could cause some viewers to turn off, and people who started watching half the way would be either bored or simply confused. <br /> <br /> I love the people of the new world Lost so they can easily watch from the beginning and get out of those slower episodes. The whole meeting is excellent, but why does 5 series have been scheduled ... Why ??? All this means that they will not respond for at least 4 years, oh well, I will watch if it keeps the tension and the dialogue will be running.
