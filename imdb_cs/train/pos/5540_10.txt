At first, it seems like this movie is so bad that I first saw it for the first time. It was like a bad dream. Kozmick√Ω vrt. But I gave him a second chance, then another and more etc. Finally, I became addicted to this film, due to his dream, slow pace, beautiful natural ensembles, enchanted with mild autumnal light, and especially a musical score of 70's of progressive rock and absolute wonderful folk songs actor / singer / songwriter Derek Lamb (Troubadour). You should notice the pieces of hazel wood, silver trout, and the lady who disappeared in the air ... heard in the middle and near the end of the movie. There are some hidden scenes at the beginning. to allow us to appreciate the natural charms of Elizabeth Suzuki. If this film were made by some directors such as Bergman, Lars Von Triers or Jean-Luc Goddard, critics would roll on the floor, they were a masterpiece of the universe. Personally, I think this movie is a million times better than any other Fellini cinematographic sh! @ T! Definitely not for the demanding.
