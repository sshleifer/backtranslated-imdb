I came to see this movie with my brother and his girlfriend. The place was packed and we all laughed so easy it was missing lines. I knew it looked good, but it was much more fun than I thought it would be. I liked Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, they looked really weird, like normal people if it makes sense. I'm going from films that show that teenagers are like people who behave like cookies like "jock" or "geek" or "cheerleader" ... etc. Both characters were unique but still very human and normal enough, to apply to them. I will recommend this movie to all my friends and are very eager to be on DVD, go see this movie with your friends who can laugh at the most fun parts of your life! I plan to see it again in the theater, and I do not see things more than once at times.
