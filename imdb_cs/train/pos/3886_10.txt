Eddie Izzard is a genius with constant humor. I want to listen all day. His unique approach to life is completely logical. His understanding of the discovery (like Heimlich Maneuver) is creative. Eddie Izzard captures the heart of what we think. I do not know when I laughed so hard on someone who was silenced.
