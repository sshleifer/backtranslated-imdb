This film is a perfect picture of Nutcracker; the dance is amazing, the scenery in the background was excellent and I loved it that the swarming horse. Oh, and costumes ... He loved Marzipan very much, the tutu was adorable. Special effects have been very well done (eg Tree, bed, etc.) And I enjoyed the rats. I love how they make it spooky, but cute and tenacious. I mean, except for the king. <br /> <br /> If you are a thoroughly male person, you will not enjoy it, but it is a very good film that is suitable for all ages - just not all levels of testosterone. But I have a few complaints. First, why did they have to give Sugar Plum Fairy to these scary socks? Hardly it would mean if his butt was naked! And secondly ... why did Culkin's PINK suit on EARTH?
