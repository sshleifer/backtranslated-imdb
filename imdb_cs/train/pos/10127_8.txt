That was the beginning of all! We admit it's not the best friend, but this was the pilot who's on the show, let's not forget it and it's not bad. We introduced the gang and Central Perk, where our story begins. Even from this first episode we get a sign of Ross-Rachel's relationship that comes in the next ten years when Ross says, "I just want to get married again," and Rachel storms her wedding dress ... probably not as intentional as the writers they tried to make the Monika-Joey relationship, but now they look good enough to look back. Something else .. in this episode, Rachel is introduced to Chandler as if they never met, but in later episodes called "Flashbacks," this is at odds with how they met on three previous occasions. Still, it's a great start to a great show. This episode may not be the usual Friends, as we are accustomed to them, with the occupancy still a bit inexperienced, but in the next few episodes we will see why it turned out what it was! Be careful, the first season is a blast!
