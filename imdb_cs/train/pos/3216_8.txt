Stoic and laconic soldier Sergeant Todd (gentle and trusted power of somewhat reliable Kurt Russell) gets to a remote distant planet after being considered obsolete by the ruthless and arrogant Colonel Mekum (who played deliciously on Jason Isaac's slender grip). Todd and his comrades replaced the new advanced breed of genetically modified fighters. Todd joins the peaceful communities of devotees devotees and must defend this community when new soldiers arrive for field training. Director Paul W.S. Anderson, working from David Webba Peoples' smart and provocative screenplay, portrays the cold vision of a malicious, cold and harsh possible near future, maintaining a fast pace and a hard, shrill tone. Besides, Anderson takes good care of the moments of humanity (Todd's struggle to get in touch with his previously suppressed feelings, he's really crazy) and breaks up the scene with upsetting action with an agonizing gusto. Russell gives a powerful and impressive almost pantomimic portrayal of Todd; he transmits a lot of emotions without saying much and instead most of his actions through his physical movements and facial expressions. Bang-up supporting Jason Scott Lee as a brutal rival of Caine 607, Connie Nielson as sympathetic Sandra, Sean Pertwee as kind Mace, Jared and Taylor Thorne as Mute Little Boy Nathan, Gary Busey as Crusty Expert Veteran Captain Church, Michael Chiklis as Merry Johnny Pig and Brenda Wehle as meaningful Mayor Hawkins. Even better, this film is a profound and significant statement of spiritual costs to be a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual power over physical strength. David Tattersall's polished cinematography, Joe McNeely's revitalizing orchestral score and top-notch special effects further enhance the overall sterling quality of this exciting sci-fi / action hybrid tour.
