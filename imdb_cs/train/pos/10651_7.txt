Some movies should simply not be reworked. That's one of them. It's not a bad movie in itself. But it does not capture the taste and fear of the film of the same title in 1963. Liam Neeson was as good as ever, and most of them play except Owen Wilson, who just did not bring a true sense of Luke's character. But the main mistake in this version is that he avoided too far from the story of Shirley Jackson in his attempts to be grandiose and lost some excitement from an older movie in the off store for snazzier special effects. Again I will say that it is not a bad film itself. But in the older version you will enjoy the friction of terror much more.
