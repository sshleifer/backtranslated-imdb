I just read a summary description and it's the worst I've ever read. This incredibly does not match this unbelievable movie. Take a look at "Turner Classic Movies" as an example of a good summary. Anyway, it was one of my favorite films as a little kid. My sister and I could not wait until every April when we could see it at T.V. It's one of the best horse films of that time. It's one of those great classics that the whole family can watch. Romance is pure and cute. The story line is interesting and the songs are great. Such movies are no longer doing. Good acting and not over the top. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are at their best, along with many other great actors.
