For the first time I saw the thief as a child that makes me almost as old as Jinn. Any child would be, I was excited about the imagination, inventiveness and energy of the film. A few years later, I realized how many satire and joke scripts I missed at the first glance. I have never used the opportunity to watch it over several years. In addition to production scenarios, the genre is beyond the genre. This is Korda, the narrator at his best. When you see Thief as a child, you know you had a great time. When you see thieves as adults, you know that you saw a masterpiece. It is timeless as a story that treats it. Amazing work. <br /> <br /> Thomas McCarthy
