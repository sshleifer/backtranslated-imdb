Did you hear the story of reluctant heroes who were hired by the king to kill the dragon? Oh, huh? Was it located in a world that consisted of small islands floating above the clouds and making the heroes dangerous jumps from one island to another on their journey? Was the water upstairs and the remnants of the big cities were floating on the horizon? I did not think so. <br /> <br /> I was unhappy with this movie and I'm really glad I did it! It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Like Pixar, it's a piece of computer animated art that could only be possible in today's world. Animators have invested the idea into almost everything that appears on the screen, and this attention to detail is stunning (this is a scene where the mushrooms in the foreground glow green smoke, while characters going negligibly in the background are one of my favorites). Monsters are also fully conscious and amazing to watch in action. <br /> <br /> Although the plot may not be entirely unique, the movie has enough spell to make sure you watch. Our protagonists are sympathetic and interesting to ensure that the audience lags behind an almost impossible effort to reach the end of the world and destroy a dragon that could otherwise absorb everything on its way. Of course, Hector is the character most of whom falls in love. A small blue creature with a crazy smile and a tendency to speak ridiculously and English, Hector provides comic relief as Jar Jar Binks could only dream of. In summary, I would recommend watching The Dragon Hunters if you have an opportunity. Take a look at incredible animation, eager battles and glimpses of a world that is not unlike any other thing you've seen on a movie or TV screen. At least it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half - no matter if you are nine or twenty-nine (which I am actually)!
