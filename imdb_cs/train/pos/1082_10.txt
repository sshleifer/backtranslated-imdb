Mr. Blandings builds his dream house can be the best film Frank Capra / Preston Sturges movie nor did a man ever do! If you love the Bringing Child, Philadelphia Story, a thin man, I was a male bride of war or it's a wonderful life - movies made with joke, taste, and occasional tongue firmly crooked on your face, look at this. Life after the Second World War is simply and idyllically drawn. Grant is at the absolute pinnacle of his form when he plays an urban mouse that dared to live in a lifetime. Loy is adorable as his wife. The cast of supportive characters is compared with the fact that you can not take it with you and contain the premature bit of future Tarzan Lex Barker. Artistic direction and editing are above par. <br /> <br /> The film never cares about the low rental numbers that could be counted by numbers in the later adaptation of The Money Pit.
