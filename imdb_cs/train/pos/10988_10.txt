Do not read anything about this movie (especially anything that could contain spoilers). Just watch this amazing movie without knowing it - and you'll have a really great experience. If you want to see an intelligent, twisted tale: Go, you get a DVD and you will not really be disappointed. "Cypher" is not really a science fiction movie, a more psycho thriller has settled in a globalized business environment. This is a business secret about how big companies spy research departments each other and the methods they use. The actors do great performance and the overall visual style of the film provides perfect coolness. Cypher is much deeper and more complex - which includes a story and end - also a lot more satisfying than other movies Vincenzo Natali "Cube" and "Nothing". Actually, it's one of the best films I've ever seen (and this is something you really do not say about every fifth good movie). Sorry, we can not tell you more about this movie without risking harming your experience. Just give him a chance. ;-)
