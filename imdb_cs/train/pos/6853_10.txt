Dressed to Kill (1980) is a mysterious horror movie by Brian De Palma and it really works. The atmosphere is here. The atmosphere that makes you afraid. And it's not like a horror film to do. All actors are in the right places. Michael Caine is perfect as Dr. Robert Elliott, who is shrinking with a little secret. Angie Dickinson as Kate Miller, a sexually frustrated, mature woman is terrible. Keith Gordon as her son Peter is brilliant. Nancy Allen as Liz Blake calling girl is fantastic. Dennis Franz makes his typical detective role. Her Marino detective is one of the most colorful in this movie. There are plenty of scary scenes in this movie. The elevator scene is one of them. a comparison of this and psycho by Alfred Hitchcock (1960). There are some similarities between these two films. These films may cause sleep.
