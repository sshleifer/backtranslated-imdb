I was disappointed, if not surprised, by the lack of appreciation of this film. Again, Billy Zane proves he is more than a Hollywood pretty boy in a silent performance combining a spastic heap with a staggered pathos. Calling this silent movie is inaccurate because there is plenty of music and sound. It has a manic pace and is full of goofy ingenuity that Ed Wood is finally getting valued. Look at the cast statement and realize that everyone is shining. No one is there just to show his face. I believe they are all in the movie to show their appreciation of Wood and to make a wide and physical kind of acting that has not been seen today. <br /> <br /> But today, reviewers are trying to figure out what's going on to become a hit much more than show any aesthetic film awards. And IWUETDID has no distinct target audience. It was mostly made of love for Wood's writing. Even after his death, the fashionable social parasites sent him another serious blow and got rid of the classical world. This is a very entertaining and truly experimental film that really deserves to live on at least DVD.
