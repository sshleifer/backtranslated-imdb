What an amazing episode for this fine series. It's perfection on television. The story takes place in 1968 and is beautifully shot in black and white, almost in the movie noir with deep shadows and sharper images. This is the story of two men who fall in love, but I do not want to spoil it. It is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in America in the 1960s. He wrote the excellent Tom Pettit and directed the great Jeannot Szwarc, walking through their lives, their love for themselves and their tragedy. Because of such a sensitive problem, this episode is far more stunning. Our emotions are just as torn and fringed as characters. When I played the wonderful Dylan berry: "Oh, but I was a lot older, I'm younger now than I," as Byrds sang. This is far more than ten and all the way to the stars. Beautiful.
