I loved all the Cream work, even though there is such a small and rare catalog of work that would take refuge. Even if they go for twenty minutes with some of their songs (spoon and toad outside the fire wheels are the best examples) still rock socks away more than half of any given rock law work today. This power on the stage gel got one of the most anticipated rock choirs that took place last year with their Royal Albert Hall concerts. They could get older, just like their fans, but the energy is still there, with a large set of classic blues songs as well as their own. Issuing the White Room, Badge, Politics, Spoon, The Sun of Your Love, Nobody seems to miss. Clapton's solos have a formation he sometimes does not have on stage with his solo band. Ginger Baker, he said enough. Jack Bruce is so powerful that his vocals still have the power that Clapton could never get himself. If you want to see the best performances you would like to see last year (well, some could see them), it's all on this DVD with great special features.
