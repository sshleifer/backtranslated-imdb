I'm a big fan of cinema and I've seen this movie because I've heard how interesting it was. I can honestly say that it was really very interesting. The two main actors are amazing, the movie is never boring, and the concept behind it (though it's probably inspired by Columbine's killing and homeland murderers) is really interesting. There are certain weaknesses, such as the last 20 minutes, that really make worse realism, which manifests in the first hour or so, and it really does not make sense at all. The nervous camera may sometimes be distraction, but in the cinema believe it is given. But I still think the movie is very good and director Ben Coccio deserves some credit.
