Dick Tracy was originally a comic book created in 1931 by Chester Gould. He's a clean suit detective watching the crew of villains, from all types of visually original characters like Flattop to The Blank to Big Boy Caprice. (These villains became so popular in the 1940s that Warner Bros. made their own recording in categories like Daffy Duck). Tracy's comics were known for his liberal use of weapons and state-of-the-art technological advances, especially the wristwatch communicator), which gained a great part of the screen in this excellent film. The music was greatly done by Danny Elfman, and Madonna's original songs were interesting, but they were not the best place for her career. It's weird, because when you look at the movie and you see exciting moments, the movie feels like Batman because of Elfman's unforgettable sound to his pieces. I love the heavily speaking boy, Pacino behaves like the Big Boy Caprice (and the beast!), Madonna is angry, and cinematography and direction are impeccable. This film has been professionally created and includes many great actors who were previously known as great actors (Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Mandy Patinkin, Catherine O'Hara, Dick Van Dyke). The film was directed by Beatty himself, which was interesting. It's almost like Beatty saw himself as Tracy in past life, or something, because he really fits part. I had to give this film 8/10 for everything she brought to the cinema she had overlooked (for some reason). There was a lot of misunderstanding about the IMDb movie's rating, and I still do not understand why. The characters were completely original and lively, as well as the set style, wardrobe, lighting and everything in this movie. Go buy it today. You will not regret.
