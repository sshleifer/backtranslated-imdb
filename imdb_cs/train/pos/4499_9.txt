This stunning story of intergenerational love, jealousy and vengeance was even more enjoyable when he saw on DVDs years after broadcasting PBS, with a sharper picture and sharper sound. My only reservation is that the plot has a few impressive moments and that some of Manchester's stronger accents are sometimes difficult. Fortunately, it even lacks a word and does not kill fun: primary actors are ideally occupied. Robson Green brings an enigmatic smile, a lively excitement, and the athletic body of his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly behind his boss's wife in a hospital where he is just starting to work. Francesca Annis is one of the most remarkable 50-ish women you can imagine; her acting compete for her beauty. (The love of the scene between the two demonstrates better than the words, how little age difference they matter!) Each of the supporting characters is sharply drawn and superbly rendered. The mixture of miserable dialogue and passionate excess makes this wonderful miniseries. As Russell Baker says in his introduction, you do not have to be morally upgraded by looking at "ruthlessness" - but you'll have a lot of fun. (The sequel, part of the DVD box set, provides a wild but satisfying 2-hour revelation. You will not want to miss if you've enjoyed what you've come to.)
