My comment is limited generally to the first season of 1959-60. This great series was one of the first to be color television and had a big influence on the Americans' belief that they had to buy color television, which was about $ 800 in 1959, which is now more than $ 3,000. How many of us would pay so much for the privilege of watching a screened cathode screen on a 17-inch screen? I was eleven when the series started, and I watched her from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Watch it now, 50 years later, a few things come up. First of all, many stories include Comstock Lode and Silver Fleck, which dates back to 1859. For 1859, weapons and clothing are for the most part not authentic. (Losses are left out of the discussion.) This is basically nitpick. And it would be impossible for Ben to come to the Lake Tahoe area in 1839 and to get a 100-square-mile ranch over the next twenty years. The pioneers still tried to solve the Sierra Nevada problem in 1847, and Gold Rush did not even begin two years later. Indians are not played by Indian actors. John Ford used Indian actors in the 1920s. Producers Bonanza could easily do so thirty years later. This is the main nitpick for me. <br /> <br /> There are other problems with the time line. In Season 1, Mark Twain appears and is shown as a middle-aged man. Mark Twain was 24 years old in 1859. Stories also declined between 1859-1860 (before the Civil War) and what was more appropriate for the timeframe of 1880. There are problems with continuity, again and again. <br /> <br /> It's rather extraordinary that there is so much killing in the first season. Over time, killing has fallen. Many of the episodes suffer from a socio-liberal tendency, which would be hard to believe given the timetable, but to give writers a credit for predicting seismic shifts in the nation's attitudes beginning in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> When it all said, acting is good, and in recent years I have come to the conclusion that Adam's character was rendered better than any other. I do not think Pernell Roberts has ever won the merits he deserved. Season 1 also strengthens the fact that Dan Blocker (Hoss) was a good actor. Many stories radiate real historical events. Guest stars were interesting. It was a great family fun and the series is doing very well with any measure.
