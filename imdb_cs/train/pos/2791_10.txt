This is one of my favorite movies and I would recommend it to everyone. My favorite list of movies (mental list, mind) is only films such as Lord of the Rings, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home. the main character of Jess. At the beginning of the movie is a shy girl with a little weird background, which has far more friends who are boys than girls. It will really hit you into her life. I certainly can not break any actress acting or anybody else in the movie. Football was interesting if I looked at someone like me who did not know the rules. The film is never boring. Romance is really cute and I did not make it too hard! One thing that really did was an Indian factor. Jess's parents are Indians, and throughout the film there are many color Indian conventions that provide a very interesting cultural view and everything else. The Indian people are also cheerful! In essence, it's about the coming of age about how you choose the way you want and fight for it. <br /> <br /> You know, good comedies make this film my favorite movie genre. They are fun, refreshing and making you feel good! ^ _ ~
