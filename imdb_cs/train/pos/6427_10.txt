If you like fun ... and just want to relax and enjoy ... Miyan Chote Miyan is one of the movies you can watch. Amitabh started quite well ... but Govinda who steals the show from his hands ... amazing timing and good delivery of dialogue ..... is inspired by Bad Boys ... but Indian Masala is doing it. .. people think it could be confusing and stupid ... but the fact that David Dhavan is driving and Govinda is acting ... should not ask any questions .... other recommended films in the same genre (David Dhavan / Govinda combo) ... are Shola Aur Shabnam, Aankhen, Raja Babu, Saajan Chale Sasural, Deewana Mastana, Collie No. 1, Jodi No. 1, Hero No. 1, Haseen Manjayegi, Ek Aur Ek Gyarah.
