As someone else said, it's a good movie. It has beautiful scenery and Lucian's amazing voice! I've seen this movie many times and I've seen it again this afternoon. I forgot how much I miss Pavarotti's singing Nessuna Dorma and I need to get off the CD! It's a great movie only when you are taken to entertainment and consciousness in the afternoon. Eddie Albert is big as an agent and a bit over the top, but all the agents are just that. The Italian landscape is amazing, but nothing at the top of the balloon for perfect outlook. If you need Olivier's acting, this movie is not for you. If you want just a bit of fantasy and great music, check out this movie. Just enjoy!
