Me, like many fans of horror, I was forced to feed the same banal big budget in Hollywood and MTV High School Slasher in the last 20 years. Here is finally an original horror genre that ticks all the right fields. <br /> <br /> You want a hot actress, you want vampires, you want cool weapons, you want cool cars and you want blood, a lot of shovel - that's it. With superb fighting choreography and supportive role from Hammer Horror, Queen Stephanie Beacham is screaming, it's really fantastic things. <br /> <br /> Although it's a low budget, by choosing to use 35mm stock and adding CG-quality effects to the mix, director James Eaves has created something that's much bigger. <br /> <br />
