This film strengthens my opinion on Errol Flynn. While Flynn, of course, is best known for his savoir-faire and sprezzatura (throwing a few European expressions!), This film gives him the opportunity to shoot (albeit only slightly) as an actor, while playing a dirty social mountaineer with great ego and a sense of nerve equalizes. Support for the cast is excellent; everyone seems to be well-chosen for their roles. The story is moving fast, and although it is not too deep (perhaps, intentionally, the opportunity to provide a social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during this time), it certainly enjoys and satisfies itself. From what I know about Jim Corbett, the story is also faithful to history. I also really liked the great picture in 1880 in San Francisco. Overall, there's little he does not like about this movie ... it's worth watching for him.
