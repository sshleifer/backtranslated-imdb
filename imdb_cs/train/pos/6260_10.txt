It was provoking soul! I am Iranian and I live in the 21st century, I did not know that such great tribes live in such conditions at the time of their grandfather! You see that today or even 1925 on one side of the world lady or child could have everything for him or her clean and on demand, but 80 years ago, people were leaning on their lives to visit some other grass. It is really interesting that these Persians carry these difficulties in finding pastures for their sheep, but they lose many sheep on their way. I praise the Americans who accompanied this tribe were as hard as Bakhtiari.
