It's the only movie I've seen on the prince, but it does not matter. And I thought it was great when I was singing a boy when I was wrong. That's probably his best performance. Music is great. That's why he won Oscar for the best music in the movie (or something) in 1984. Now he's got Oscar and Grammy under his belt. Though the curse gets into the way with a movie (just make sure there are no little kids or in the room). There is not much to say without revealing the plot. You should really go out and get this movie your collection is not complete unless you have this movie in it. What else can I say except that I go and get this movie now!
