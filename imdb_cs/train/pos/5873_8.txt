It would be a classic fire if they chose ALBERT ANYBODY ELSE for John Abraham. This guy is a terrible actor. Whether it's comedy, drama, dwarfs, etc. It smells. It seemed that Priyadarshan had ever realized it, and he'd let him jump like a monkey to make a solo-scene a bit funny. It is the only noticeable disadvantage (there are a few more unpleasant tid-bits) of a completely cheerful film otherwise. The best comedy that took place in Bollywood from Hunga, IMO. Just like Hungama, it's a sitcom that takes place on the shoulder of a brilliant screenplay and, of course, Akshay Kumar. This is probably his best performance so far. It's better for the best comic shoe for every job. If he's always been good in a comedy, but he's taking a different level here. Body language, facial expressions, and just the way it supplies each line. It's a brilliant performance. The cotton theater has been walnut all along, and I do not think I've ever seen such an atmosphere for the Bollywood film here in the US. Garam Masala does not have one "leading" heroine. She plays 3 incredibly hot and beautiful girls that I thought did a pretty good job. Certainly all the debtors are. Paresh Rawal is as solid as usual, although his routine is exhausted after a while. Rajpal Yadav is his typical unpleasant self (dirty of his over-top-act in each movie). Rimi Sen has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth the deco. I think it's FUNNIER than No Entry, and it says a lot. It could be even better if they chose someone who would be a little more competent than John Abraham. <br /> <br /> 8/10
