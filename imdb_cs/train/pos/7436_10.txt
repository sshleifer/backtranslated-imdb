This filmed presentation of "Rime of the Old Sailor" is the most beautiful and intriguing rendition of Coleridge's wonderful poem. Amazing cinematography, coupled with a collection of two centuries of effort to illustrate an epic poem from 1798 by world-renowned artists and the wonderful story of Michael Redgrave, is well worth seeing this excellent visual work. <br /> <br /> At the age of television, this work is an invaluable tool for young students, as well as adults, to explore and learn the value of great poetry. To my best of my knowledge, this kind of work is really rare; this is regrettable. As a student of world literature and as a former college professor and academic adviser, I feel that other great epic poems such as Coleridge's "Rime of the Old Sailor" should be translated. Although he is not a film critic, but a passionate reader of classical literature, I like to recommend this delicate production without any reservations.
