German private television is poorly known for copying Dutch and ?? naturally? American formats. Well, in the case of Edel & Starck, xeroxing just went to basics: Screwball. <br /> <br /> You can not build a screwball comedy? Do not look at Edel & Starck. Seriously. If you expect more lawyer-like drama from law and order or something, come somewhere else. (Or look at Law & Order because it's really great what's going on, but I'm going to turn.) E & S is funny, often focuses on thought-provoking themes, funny, romantic, funny, entertaining and funny. > Frankly, I'm absolutely horrified that writers have not been getting better offers since the final of the series. And my cynical nature must be adapted: to private German television productions. German inhabitants will understand what I am talking about. Briefly: Watch this. I do not have the most important English synchronization, but hey, it's worth studying in German, just to watch them for four seasons. Pseudo-happy end inclusive.
