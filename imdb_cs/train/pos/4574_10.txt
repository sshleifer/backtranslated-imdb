Let me say at first that I have Cerebral Palsy and I expected the film to adapt the leadership. I let the theater totally convinced that they were playing an actor who had roles in the cerebral parse, even though I knew it was not. The performances were generally excellent, with a special nod to Brenda Fricker and Hugh O'Conner (I think that's his name) as a young Christy Brown. Christy is talented, crazy, arrogant, sometimes vulgar and cunning - in other words, human. This film, along with Gaby: The Right Story and Documentary by King Gimp, are excellent images of life with CP. Not a complete portrait, but examples of people with disabilities as human beings. Most recommended.
