Anyone interested in popular music and not familiar with British musical trends in the late 1970s should be sure to watch Breaking Glass at least once. The film about a young woman trying to reach her mark in the musical world perfectly captures times, from clear sexism, harsh economic times, social shakes to shifts in pop culture from fearsome punk to scary specks and demanding futurism / new romanticism. The music and fashion styles that are being created every day in Britain in the late 1970s are still appearing and recycled (nothing really new since 1980). It was a brilliant time and Breaking Glass both tells a very personal story and explores the cultural landscape, and that's both extremely good.
