This is a document I happened to encounter on the British Channel More4, and I must say that I thought it was extremely interesting and thoughtful. I will also search for the book that was the source of this document. Basically it is the theory of prof. Jared Diamond about why some parts of the provincial society thrived and others did not. The argument he put forward was new to me and he argued that the richness of the right crops and the right animals that are capable of domestication is certainly convincing. As for the document itself, it's well shot and well-off, not with many reclaimed scenes that spoil a lot of modern documentary. Diamond also helps by not being condescending, which is the fault of many intellectuals when trying to get a message by bridge. People have claimed that his theory is Marxist, but I do not buy it and I see it as a sociological geologist. It was also refreshing to hear the theory of the development of a non-religion-based society. Highly recommended tracking.
