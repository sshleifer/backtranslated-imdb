First of all, I would like to say that even though I know my share of star wars, I'm not a fanatic. I do not know how many chromosomes the Wamp Rat or the extended TK427 family have. what i know is this: Star Wars, all movies (less with episode 2 though), captured something magical. it's hard to say what button Lucas found and courageously pushed, but it works. Star Wars is more than a movie. it's an idea. How can you ask? I'll explain. star wars touch the most common stereotypes, good and bad. it does so so clearly, so deeply that virtually anyone can understand from any environment. Episode VI very well closes the epic struggle between the son and his used and manipulated father, but also with the addition of ancestors reveals an even more impressed story. it's Darth Vader at the front, and the audience realizes it's a story about Anakin, not just Luke. but before 1 to 3 years it was amazing depth. it was as if the capsule had dropped from the sky into Lucas's wedge-shaped section and detailed the historical description of the galaxy far, far away. Star Wars is definitely a little far above the norm and I have to admit whenever I saw them, especially this one, I feel very small. I feel that I have been relocated to a world where good and evil are so well defined. I feel tinged when I see them, the feeling that something that touches me more than any physical thing could ever hope.
