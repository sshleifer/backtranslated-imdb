I was almost 10 out of 10. However, there are some confusing parts, as well as sections that are miss-leading, which hurt the flow / continuity of the film. The story line is great and well composed; You will surely want to watch quietly to fully understand it. The characters are complicated, just like the story line, we expect to get enough information to stop scratching our head, it's a movie where everything is finally explained. The animation is great and the combination of femme fatal and film noir results in a great movie that resembles something else I've seen in animation. It's a black-and-white film and its dark darkness in several scenes, so it's worth watching it on good T.V or plasma. The figures of voices save this film in English, but it would be more convincing if there were any French accents that would point out that his story of Paris, I liked it more in French with English subtitles. One of its worth is worth buying on DVD or BlueRay if they have! And personally, if you like this movie, you can also enjoy it; Crazy life and spirit in Shell 2 Innocence, it's just a personal design.
