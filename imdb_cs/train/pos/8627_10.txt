My God ! Buttgerit's masterpiece is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Closer to the films of Peter Greenaway and Jean-Luc Godard, this film is really disturbing, but not annoying as Necromantic. All small stories have a profound philosophical interest, and direction is totally inventive, despite the lack of money (see sketch of the "bridge"). Highly recommended!
