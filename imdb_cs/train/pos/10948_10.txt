After the sitcom script is so hopelessly easy that her character acts both in context and without context, the rest of the occupied population is a type of experimentalism that could actually be used by the sitcoms. Supporting characters put the show in a situation situation that provides a contextual counterpoint to an unfair person, Sarah, who, in addition to general insensitivity, does not have any specific recurring features on the basis of which behavioral expectations should be based, thus less characterizing than canvas, each episode, if not a scene. Sarah's ability to see everything from an outside perspective allows her to parody aspects of social behavior that are fine enough to not usually appear. Every time they talk, it's like a self-contained 5 second skit. It overestimates a lot, demonstrates a myriad of smiles or a change of vocal loop, but never fails with one thought long enough to feel comfortable and create expectations that will be satisfied. It can be the most creative, original and experimental television program ever.
