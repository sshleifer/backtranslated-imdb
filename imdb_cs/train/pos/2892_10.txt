Cinderella .... <br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie for about five years when I last saw it. The spell remains. There is something that definitely contains the feeling of the story, the songs are fun and the secondary character is all please. The villains in the form of nurses are perfectly evil and shameful. Then there is the most beautiful of all Disney, mice producing clothes and you know the rest well. Summing up four Disney princess movies are all great, but it is a charming magic experience, watch and enjoy yourself. Oh, of course, Cinderella is wonderful as a main character in the movie. If you think Disney movies can actually lose their charm. With Elene Wood and another movie having such a feeling you just can not help but a smile <br /> <br /> He says the morale of this story is that dreams will come true. Of course, in the real world, some believe the others are hoper. She's even more magical in this movie when her rainbow smiles. <br /> <br /> And of course, the rest is ... Cinderella
