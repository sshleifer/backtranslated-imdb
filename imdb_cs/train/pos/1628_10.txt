This is not the bar any of the most funny movie I've ever seen. Beginning with the four offenders sent by his father to the Military Academy in Vienna, there is a tone that continues throughout this film of the goofball and does not take a moment. <br /> <br /> It's hard to describe this movie; the humorous elements are so blurry and brilliantly surprised that at first glance it seems to be nothing more than a silly 80th teen comedy of lust. But it's much more than that! Fresh from the minds of MAD Magazine Up Academy magazine brings a formula and style that I have never seen duplicated any of the "funniest" offers that came out of Hollywood from the past. Basically, the film is full of infantile material that could guess that the writers were 14 years old. Watch this movie if you love "immature". Classical. *****
