These childhood memories ... when things were new, and we were filled with curiosity about the world around us; how did we take the first initial steps in the long journey we call life. One of the first memories I've been since childhood is the animated Galaxy Express 999 program about a young boy named Tetsuro who continues to ride a train around the galaxy hoping to get a mechanical body to avenge his nonsensical death in the hands of mechanical hunters who gathered in trophies. Along with Tetsour on his way is Maetel, a woman of gorgeous golden beauty that reminds him of the mother he lost all these years ... <br /> <br /> Back in the early 1980s as a boy who attended kindergarten and Early Years of Seoul Primary School in South Korea was "Galaxy Express 999" a phenomenally popular animation program imported from Japan that inspired young boys who were tuned to dream of the countless adventures in their often stormy and exciting journey to life waited for No. The memories of tuning into this animated program on weekdays between 8:00 and 9:00 pm ... <br /> <br /> It was some wonderful memories that you never had ... <br /> <br /> When I have moved to America, and despite the fact that I have lasted more than two decades, I have sometimes wondered what time and place, in a country distant thousands of miles from America, the vast ocean of this children's program, a boy named Tetsuro, companion Maetel, mysterious train conductor and space train Galaxy Express 999. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Last summer, when I was in Korea, I could watch a copy of the original " Galaxy Express 999 "(1979) on DVD and brought a lot of nostalgic, heartfelt memories. "Galaxy Express 999" remains as charming as you first discovered it all these years, opening up those nostalgic memories of new discoveries, an important springboard for young boys who have tuned in and set out on their journey of manhood. /> <br /> Here are wonderful memories. "Goodbye, Maetel. Goodbye, Galaxy Express 999 ... <br /> <br /> Goodbye to childhood." <br /> <br />
