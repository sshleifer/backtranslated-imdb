JACKNIFE is a great adaptation of Stephen Metcalfe's "Strange Snow," a sensationally directed by David Hugh Jones, exploring the often forgotten effect of the battle of veterans who are permanently damaged by the horrific cruelties of the war. He is particularly eager to return to this 1989 film when we look at soldiers returning from the Iraq war and the brutal treatment they receive in our veterans' hospitals. Three friends went to Vietnam Soldiers together and only two returned alive: the problem is that while both men suffered in combat, the only David Flannigan College (Ed Harris) is so seriously damaged by post-traumatic stress syndrome that it "exists" in a drunken vacuum her very simple teacher, Sister Martha (Kathy Baker). As David Worsens His Boyfriend Joseph 'Jacknife' Megessey (Robert De Niro) returns to the city in an attempt to help his friend. During the events, Jacknife initially helps Martha and finally two days - he has to visit Prom Martha - and the drunken drunken David breaks down, destroys the remains of the school, and frightens the inhabitants of the city and the students. Jacknife gives Dave a moment of vitality in Vietnam when he loses his friend, and leads David to a point where he can begin his recovery. And a long-suffering Martha finds that her needs also have a tendency for Jacknife. All three actors have great performances: Ed Harris offers one of his most fully performed roles, while De Niro and Baker maintain high standards of their careers. Many people should help revive this but forgotten movie, because it is a fragile reminder of the damage our wars bring to men who struggle with them and the families that they receive after the battle. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
