This is a great movie - especially when compared to the occasional seriousness of today's filmmakers. The film, which combines sex, gender relations, politics and art so easily, is so rare today. While the turbulent optimism of the 1960s can not be recaptured, I think we can at least learn lessons from the smooth energy and magic of the film. I do not know what those who have labeled the "boring" are watching - packed in so much that they never leave the same movie for more than 15 minutes at a time.
