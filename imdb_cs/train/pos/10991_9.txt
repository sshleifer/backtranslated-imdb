Cypher is a movie that's worth seeing because it's not a sci-fi movie. The artistic approach is painted by dark scenes and a certain macro view of what is happening. Looking at a detailed camera is the way the director keeps the drawing illusive. The sci-fi aspect of the film is secondary to the plot of the film. The technology used in the film is not very impressive, but the director uses the props well. <br /> <br /> The character's evolution is deliberately shallow. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to dive into the world of espionage. He's in the audience to find out his mysterious nature and it's a mystery that keeps an audience up to the very end.
