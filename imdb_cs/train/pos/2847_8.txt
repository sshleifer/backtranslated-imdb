As is well known, anthology films are not much like the American viewer (I think they prefer one standard fence line). New York, I Love You, is the second phase of a series of anthology films dealing with cities and people who live and love them. The first was "Paris, J'Taime" that I really enjoyed. The film was composed of several segments, each written and / or directed by another director (most of them French, but there is a very entertaining segment directed by Joel & Ethan Coen). Like Paris, it is also an anthology directed by several directors (Fatih Akin, Mira Nair, Natalie Portman, Shakher Kapur, etc.), as well as "Paris" with New Yorkers and why they love living. Their actor is Natalie Portman, Shia LaBeouf, Christina Ricci, Orlando Bloom, Ethan Hawki, and experienced veterans like James Caan, Cloris Leachman, Eli Wallach and Julie Christie. Some of the stories are actually flying and others are not. (Although I assume it will depend on individual taste - we will not destroy anyone else by discovering which of them worked for me and which you did not do). The word is that Shanghai, China (from Rome, Italy, Berlin, Germany or Athens, Greece) will be the next addition. He speaks mainly English but has bits of Yiddish and Russian with English subtitles. Rated by the MPAA "R" for strong language and sexual content
