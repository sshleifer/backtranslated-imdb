Outstanding comedy starring Marian Davies (with friendly William Haines). Young Peggy arrives in Hollywood looking for a star. The performance Cameo introduces "All Stars in MGM Heavens" to the famous Stage of Commissioners and many historical films for scholars. Pic also captures the famous Davies famous, poorly sarcastic pretending of the top stars of today (her Swanson beaut!). "Peggy" even catches up when he meets the famous star Marian Davies on tennis appears and commented: "Oh, I do not like her!" <br /> <br /> My print was perfect. Story, direction, effecting authentic charm and the necessity of all silent afficinados.
