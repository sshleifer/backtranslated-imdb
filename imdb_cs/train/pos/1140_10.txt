I've been a fan of this movie for years and years. Since Teri Hatchers moved to the foreground, I had to take the film out of the shelf and look at it. Why did people not see how great this film was in 1991? Sally Field and Kevin Kline are out of the box. Though I have never seen workshop holes in the day, this movie will kill me every time I look at it. The actor is enormous for comedy and writing is so clever. I strongly recommend that you follow this if you have not done so. You get to Elizabeth Shue, Whoope Goldberg, Teri Hatcher and Carrie Fisher ... to name a few ... everyone is giving a wonderful performance.
