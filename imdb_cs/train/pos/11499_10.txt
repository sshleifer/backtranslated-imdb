Since it was just a toddler when I first broadcast this show, I just picked up a DVD set recently and I wish there were more episodes. This show was the 70's television series "X-Files" poplular 90. But with a little more comic / light heart. But do not make me wrong, some of these episodes are full of horror themes, many of which have pretty nice drawings (of course left to fantasy - that of television from the early 1970s). <br /> <br /> Some land where it is a little stupid as well as acting, but it is magic and attraction to this series. Whether you like dramas of mysterious crimes, comedy or sci-fi / horror themes, this series has brought it all together. Each episode appeared in about 50 minutes (1 hour with ads) and 50 minutes went fast so I always leave more. Great classical show that is underestimated in my book!
