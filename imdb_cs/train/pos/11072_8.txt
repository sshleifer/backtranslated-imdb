that's all very simple. Jake goes to jail and spends five years with a horse and chess masters. they focus on their history of loss and failure and the complete misery of living for their belief in their handling of small tricks and control of the rules of small fraudsters. they decide to give Jake freedom: from innermost fears, from what he believes to be himself. they take him for a trip, where he has embarked on all fear, pride, all hope - to be born as the true master of his will. It's a clever movie about the way of enlightenment, the endless gambling, and the games we play and do in ourselves. 10/10, no doubt.
