Teenager Eddie spends her life in bullying and humiliated because of her obsession with heavy metal music. One day he finds out that his hero Sammy Curr has died, probably burning a device he wanted to stop his music. But Eddie has the last record, never to go, and when he plays it, he begins to receive messages that tell him how to deal with his torturers. Prior to Sam, he revealed that he intended to return to life at the local Halloween party to exact revenge on the city that once laughed at him. <br /> <br /> Full of humor and jokes, this is a very fun movie. Sammy himself is the original villain of horror, playing the obsession with "the evil of rock music" of the 1980s. It's worth seeing.
