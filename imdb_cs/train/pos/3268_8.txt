A charming romantic comedy. The story is a little complicated - I tried to summarize it three times and I can not. Just say it's worth seeing. The movie is fun, beautiful - the plot is totally unrealistic, but it works. Everyone in the movie is so nice and everything looks so great - it creates a sweet, romantic feeling in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Actor is great - Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepherd are in peak form and enjoy every second. Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are all right, but fine. If you are crazy for good, sweet sentimental movies (like me), catch this. Downey also looks great in underwear! Extra bonuses - the title song sung by Johnny Mathis and another great song "After All" sung by Cher and Peter Cetera.
