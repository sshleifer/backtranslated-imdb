Overall, I was quite impressed by the pilot. The initial first fifteen minutes was unsettling because they felt the creators were trying to create the science-fiction version of The OC, but this fear is removed when a terrorist incident occurs, and from there the show goes into the themes and situations I see very rarely in television . <br /> <br /> The BSG dealt with topics such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death, and terrorism, but it was mostly subtext, where the viewer could think or ignore if they so choose. Here, on the other hand, these items are focused on the show and I personally found myself evoking such works as Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix as reference points for watching and surprise by how well the topics were discussed. I think that if you are a fan of the two that I have just mentioned, or of other films / TV shows that deal with the topics mentioned in the text, I think you will find at least something. the starting point to explain how the situation we know in BSG has occurred, I believe she was very interested in it. I especially liked how he explained to them where Cylon's belief in one God came from, and the creation of Caprice had enough advanced and contemporary technology that fits into the future, but was not entirely strange as spectators. The only real weakness I noticed was the relationship between Greystone's parents and the actress playing "Lacy Rand." While I love Eric Stoltz and Paul Malcomson individually, they seemed to have their scenes without chemistry, at this point they could just develop their characters, but that's something I think needs work. I also found that Magda Apanowicz is unconvincing in her role. Again, it could be up to the experience and time to develop, but throughout her episode, her acting appeared forced and not entirely confident. Based on the pilot, I look forward to the future and hopefully touches the size BSG once did.
