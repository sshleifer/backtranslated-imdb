This is one of my favorite times. It's so simple and sweet - it's definitely a romantic comedy. I love a movie full of good quotes and it has ... one of my favorites is when Albert Einstein tells Ed Walters, "Do you think I think?" And Ed says, "Now what's the chance!" In my opinion, the movie is wonderful, if you can watch it again and again and get it so much fun, and you can! I also really enjoyed the way Walter M. introduced Einstein. I think all the characters fit together really well and the story goes well. It's so many times I smiled directly with the movie and quoted my favorite line when I look at it! I would recommend this film to anyone who has a heart and now boasts a romantic comedy!
