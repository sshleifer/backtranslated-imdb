A well-stocked summary of a real event! Well, in fact, I was not there, but I think it was. I think there are two typically American attitudes in the film: "Communistophobia" and parallels with Adolf Hitler. These should be obvious to most independent observers. In any case, Boothe does a great job, as are many other well-known actors. The last twenty minutes of the movie is unbearable - and I think so! Anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal. (That's why it's so terrible - it all happened and it probably looked like this). But did the last scene on the station actually take place?
