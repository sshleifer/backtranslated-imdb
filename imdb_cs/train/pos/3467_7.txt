I'm still wondering why I was watching this movie. Even before I saw this movie, I practically did not know about beatings. I did not even know all the names! All I knew was that they had a lot of fans, they had some albums that some people say are the biggest ones ever, they say goodbye, John married Yoko Ono and John was murdered. VH1 is not even my favorite music station, MTV is. Still, for some reason, I decided to look at her and did not expect too much. I was surprised that I liked it! The dialogue was written and handled very well on the occasion of a slight accent. This is very important because talking to John and Paul is almost a whole movie, even though they are out to explore other possibilities and to watch you. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn give a good overall. The end was also very clever. I enjoyed the film getting enthusiastic about the performance of SNL, and then you choke your head and realize that it would be better if they just let go, and eventually it ended in a good knowledge. My favorite moment is probably the scene on the roof. Overall, I recommend this movie to almost everyone. It's a very good way to satisfy your curiosity what might have happened when Paul appeared on the threshold of John Paul's six years. Which is probably the main reason why I was looking at this film, satisfied my curiosity about who really is biting and what happened after the break.
