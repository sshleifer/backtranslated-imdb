Bill and Ted's fake journey is perhaps the best movie I've ever watched. Although acting and scenery, etc., it is poor who cares about it. The storyline is great and the jokes and words that come are excellent, the thoughts are also great. I recommend someone to see this classic. The best part is of course when they "melvin" death, I cracked for 10 minutes and missed another part of the film. It is much better than the first, which was great too. Perhaps the most entertaining film of all time !!!!! I think the best parts of the movie are, though, when Bill and Ted yell great and play guitar solos, it was funny. Rock on Bill, Ted and Eddie Van Halen will release the third movie!
