In 1994, I had a really long holiday around 4 July - something like 17 days in a row, with two weeks of paid vacation, weekends and vacation itself. I stayed in town at the time, hanging a lot in my parents' house. <br /> <br /> I did not have a TV in my apartment, so I watched parenting parents. I just finished tracking the X file segment when a program called Personal FX appeared. I was immediately involved. I have always been fascinated with the objects in our house that came from family houses of parents and inheritance from relatives' property and have often been interested in their history, value, etc. After my long holiday, I went to my house for my lunch to catch Personal FX. I remember one episode during which co-host Claire Carter announced that the apartment in New York, in which the series was filmed, was reconstructed and once said that the renovation was complete, that Personl FX would return to the air. <br /> <br /> Never do it! Personal FX was the first - and best - collector's show. And she's gone out of the air! Almost fifteen years later, I'm still in pain. Path, FX.
