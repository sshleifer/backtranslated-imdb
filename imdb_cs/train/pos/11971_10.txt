I think the comments on the show that are cheese are a little exaggerated. When one comes to watch a TV show, what does she care for? He is delighted to watch the show if he is not a critic or a person who analyzes the story. But most of us are not like this and watch shows to relax and enjoy. FULL HOUSE is the perfect show to watch after a tough day in the office / school. It makes laughter and it's not just humor. Yes, the Tanner family is a perfect family, a perfectly hypothetical family. If such a family existed in the real world, it would be a model example for us. But it's a television show, not a real family, and there's nothing wrong with showing a hypothetical family on TV. The very fact that the show could run for so long shows us that people enjoyed observation, regardless of later remarks. Another good point about the show is that any person at any age would not only enjoy watching it but took back a message that is childish. These Jesse interviews with Michelle are extremely eager if we do not think of them as children. <br /> <br /> Overall, when I look at every show of a full house, there is satisfaction in your heart, present after many other performances.
