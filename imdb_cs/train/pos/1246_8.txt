The assumption may seem stupid, but given that Murphy's character does not take it seriously, it helps to calm the audience into this combination of mysticism and modern hard birth conceived child abductions. Outstanding cast, especially Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis, and Murphy are at the top of their 80th top comedy / action. There is also some great F / X, a very unreal dream and a relatively original conspiracy. Often overlooked in Pantheon Murphy, but this is worth a look.
