I could no longer agree with the comments of Nomad 7 and I A HVR. A perfect quiet Sunday movie. Humor is gentle (exactly the "slapstick", as one misleading commentator noticed). But what always amazes me is how often I wanted to go back to this film over and over again. Originally, I copied this film on VHS roughly 12 years ago when it was premiered on one of these random weekend previews of Pay Cable (HBO maybe?). He had never heard of it before. I do not know why it was not well marketed. ??? When the DVDs were released in bulk, it was one of the first films I replaced. Great combination of cast and writing. Plus, the back drop of the wilderness in Montana does not hurt either (beautiful). It's probably not a kind of comedy for everyone, but what is it? If Adam Sandler takes you to your alley, it's probably not your cup of tea. This movie needs your attention. Humor is mostly in dialogue. I believe my next impression is probably my 12th place. But I still know that when they get into scenes like the one where the bonuses of police cars are blowing, I'll lose it (Ed O'Neill's face is EXCLUSIVE!). Recommended 110%.
