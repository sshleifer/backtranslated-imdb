I totally disagree. I thought it was a great movie for the children's wells of the gilligans and the promise showed that the barely-known dana plato.it was disneylike and you can hardly be considered as a senseless fluff. It was not a scary effect and I did not it is. I would lose it. But it was an unusual way of doing it. It means the children's characters were great and I did not know what I was waiting for at the end. conspiracy also had much more to do with these kids than you say the fact that these kids are expert fishermen is very central to the land especially initially.it also helps them out of jam at the end.it also has plus not to be too long.i think that watch in less than 95 minutes
