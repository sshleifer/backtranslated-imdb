William H. Macy is in his most sympathetic and convincing here as a hit-man and loving father who wants to step out of a family business without the rage of her devious parenting. He goes through a lot of the same territory as Soprano TV in the mid-life crisis of the crime scene (here he is also a shrink), but it is still worth watching, thanks to a tense Brommel direction (I look forward to what this guy is doing) , a great screenplay, and great performances everywhere. Macy is as good as ever. This is probably his best role from "Fargo". Donald Sutherland is in his horror best as a sharp father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly exciting dramatic turn as Macy's wife. Young David Dorfman is excellent as the clear and sensitive son of Macy (many of his lines are ad-libbed and are wonderful). Even Neve Campell (which I usually think is nasty) is convincing as a young woman who suffers Macy's eye. All this is interrupted by moving scores and a sharp pace that has led to predictable but still strong climax and meaningful and touch-related consequences. This film deserves a much wider release because I suspect it would be associated with the audience.
