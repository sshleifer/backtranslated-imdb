I was delighted to finally see Amazing Stories first season on DVD. I forgot what star actors and directors are working on in this series. For the longest time, you've been able to see this remarkable series with VHS 2 or 3 episode collections, or when Sci-Fi has started episodes again. However, when Sci-Fi will host re-runs, they generally stick to the same episodes. In episode one, there were some great episodes like The Mission that did not happen again. Does anyone know exactly how long this series has run? He says that in the years 1985 to 1987 at the top here in IMDb, but I thought it had been running for over two years. If you loved the Twilight Zone, Night Gallery and Outer Limits, you will love this series and you will not be disappointed when shopping.
