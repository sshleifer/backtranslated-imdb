I watched it last night with low expectations. The reason is that I usually do not like "made for television" movies, and I rarely enjoyed cast reunion. But the Los Angeles Times critics liked it, so I gave him a chance. I'm glad I did. It was quite good. Adam West and Burt Ward will meet as themselves. But they definitely acted like their "Batman and Robin". They were in the campsite and not like themselves or this film too seriously. The film begins with them searching for "George Barris" designed by Batmobile that someone stole before it was auctioned for an orphanage home. While looking for a car, they also recall the series they performed together. This is said in flashback. It was good. The actors they received for the younger Burt Ward and Adam West were dead. And for the television movie, he got to the stupidity that related to their actual behavior on the screen and out of the screen. I'll make this 9/10, I really enjoyed it.
