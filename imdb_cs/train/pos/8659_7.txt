That's how the movie reminded me of "Jumping Jack Flash". Do you remember Whoopi Goldberg on the crusher? Whoopi checked recovery? Whoopi as a blind lemon and mimicking Mick Jagger? Great moments captured on the movie for sure, but the movie is a little crazy, right? So I feel like "rich in love". The man hears his wife sing for the first time. Post-coital teenagers talk about the nature of love. Albert Finney drives the ice cream from the bucket, and in another scene he has a beautiful watchful moment of missing wife. Alfreda Woodard adds another colorful character to her acting cloakroom. But here is just a whisper of conspiracy and you can not wait for it to move. Only when ex-Go-Gos Charlotte Caffey is Graces revs a great pop song, the picture wakes up ... and then it's over! This picture is the equivalent of a lazy summer day in the deep South American.
