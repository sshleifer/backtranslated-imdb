Will Smith is one of the best actors of all time. I do not know how he does it. I've been reading books constantly, but if I have a movie with Will Smith, I'll watch. She has a rare gift to fit you into the movie and keep you there. This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I watched it on Saturday, and I still can not get it out of my head. Amazing and sad all at the same time. Thanks again to Will. You have to watch this movie from start to finish and understand every part of the movie. You can not miss something. Make sure you have plenty of Kleenex and your man / woman sitting next to you so you can cuddle. You will have the money you pay to watch it ... do not expect her to come to TV.
