This effort is based on the true story of Jim Morris, a science teacher / baseball teacher who is inspired by his players to try out for professionals and fulfill his lifelong dream of playing in big societies. Dennis Quaid, no sports stranger, plays Morris with the conviction that his work will work, and producers will do credible work that will recreate events in the real world that would lead to Morris's short tent as a cleaning jug for the pitiless Tampa Bay Devil Rays . The first half of the film, which is a group of baseball players in college (all of them looking too old to be in high school), is less effective and probably a little too long. Overall, the film suffers from some issues of stimulation and several other subplots that we might be able to do without. However, it is still quite a film to include an inspirational theme that again proves that baseball is national entertainment due to. CLASS: B-
