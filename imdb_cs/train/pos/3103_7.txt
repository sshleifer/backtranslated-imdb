"Maybe we can arrange a meeting." "Where are you now?" "I'm sitting in my office." "I doubt it." "Why would you doubt that?" "If you were just in your office, we will have this conversation face to face." <br /> <br /> Bourne remains rough and elusive. Only his inhuman resilience leads the film a bit far into fantasy. Conversation is macho, up to the point where there are only gondolas of type Bond type gallows. It's all about action. <br /> <br /> The feeling that something is happening at another level of the world we live in is what the trilogy works so well. The Waterloo scene with the Guardian journalist makes it big. There is no meeting of the worlds - you are in it, or just an unnecessary body. If the shaking camera does not distract too much, enjoy this movie and hope you will continue franchising in some way.
