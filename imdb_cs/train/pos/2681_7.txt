As you probably know, Jess Franco is one prolific fellow. He has produced hundreds of hundreds of films, many of which are crap. Nevertheless, he managed to interwoven with a good quality work amongst all those involved in the assembly line. "Succubus" is not his best work (it is either "The Diabolical Dr. Z" or "Vampyros Lesbos"), but he has many of his trademarks that are for anyone who is interested in diving into his great catalog. It combines erotic (alternating between displaying full frontal nudity and leaving something to be left to imagination) and incredibly immediate. This is a very hateful movie full of great atmosphere. I liked the constant appointment. Despite being incredibly demanding, it is fun to hear all of Franco's influences. Yet there are many users who do not like "Succubus" and I can see where they come from. His leisurely pace, but I can deal with it. Mismatch is more problematic. The scenario was probably going on here, and within five minutes of the movie I had no idea what was going on (and it did not really happen since that time). Those who want a cloth in their style are looking elsewhere. Also, if it's a horror movie, it never gets creepy or even thrilling. I still enjoyed all the psychedelic stupidity that I did not really believe in these serious shortcomings. (7/10)
