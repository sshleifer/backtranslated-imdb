I just saw this movie in Santa Barbara. My friend knew someone working on it, so I thought I'd look at it. I thought it was a really beautiful movie and you can not wait to see it again. the actors were really good and I loved the whole music! it was not much to talk about in the movie, which seems a bit weird - but once I got into it, I thought the story and the acting were really emotional and meaningful and I thought it left a lot of imagination. I want to see the movie again, because there was so much that happened in forgetting a lot of little things, but I know I left the theater thinking about the movie. it was beautifully shot and the whole thing was really unique.
