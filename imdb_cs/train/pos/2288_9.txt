It's so rare to find a literary work reasonably translated to the screen, which I can rate this film higher than it deserves but not much. As a longtime student of Vonnegut's works, I have no hesitation in recommending the film to my readers, at least to those who love him the same way I do. Casting is inspired by: Nolte is underestimated in triumph, confused in defeat, decisive in judgment. Sheryl Lee is kind to the world, but her manipulation with the treacherous Resi and her tragic crescendo will almost forget her beauty. Alan Arkin adds a loving but equally treacherous Soviet spy. You do not feel that you have to read Mother of the Night to appreciate the film; but if you did not read Mother of the Night, you probably want to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Note the shifts from color to black and white and back and do not miss the final symbol of Campbell's loop. Also look at Catherine Kurt Vonnegut at the end of the film. White Crosby's "White Christmas" will never sound the same (I write in mid-December when the song starts a heavy radio play, and it drives me nuts).
