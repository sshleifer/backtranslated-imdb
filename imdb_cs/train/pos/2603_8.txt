Unfortunately, director Amos Guttman died of AIDS-related illnesss about a year after filming this film so we do not know how many other gay movies we could have from him. I found this used DVD, from Cinevista, to Amazon, but none of his other works seems to be available. Hessed Mufla (Amazing Grace) contains complete front male nudity, at least in magazines that turn into a desperate dream. and some drug use. This is the story of two families who have been or have been trying to do it, but mothers, daughters and gay sons have all of their problems that need to be identified. Jonathan (played by Gal Hoyberger) meets with his neighbor Thomas, who, of course, has his own problems. Either the translations are a bit weak, or maybe Guttman kept the conversation scattered expediently, for a bit of a secret. When I look at it, I feel we do not have the whole story, but it's okay. Guess in the cute gay roommate ex-lover Miki (Aki Avni, who went on many projects, mostly Isreali TV) Lots of smoking. Lots of worries about mothers. The big blues song "All Night Long Blues" by an unknown artist; if it is listed in credits, unfortunately it was not translated into English. I like to see that mothers and siblings treat respect for homosexual relationships as any other relationship. But then the United States has always been in this way for years behind other countries. A good way to spend 98 minutes ... I wanted to see even more. He has won awards at several IMDb film and film festivals.
