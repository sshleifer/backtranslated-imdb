Minor Spoilers <br /> <br /> Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) is a successful top model living with lawyer Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) in her apartment. In the past, she tried to suicide twice: for the first time, when she was a teenager, she saw her father cheating on her mother with two women in the house and after she died Michael. She has since abandoned Christ and the Catholic Church. Alison wants to live alone in her apartment, and with the help of Miss Logan's real government agent (Avy Gardner), she finds a beautifully furnished old apartment in Brooklyn Heights for reasonable rent. He sees a strange man in a window on the top floor of the building, and Miss Logan informs that Father Francis Matthew Halloran (John Carradine), a blind priest who lives alone supported by the Catholic Church. Alison moves to his new place and once receives a visitor: her neighbor, Charles Chazen (Burgess Meredith), welcomes her and presents her new neighbors. Then Alison invites her cat to Jezebel's birthday night at night. The next day strange things happen to Alison in his apartment and health. Alison looks for Miss Logan and is informed that she lives alone with the priest in the building. Another investigation shows that all the people he knew in the party were dead criminals. Alison has frightened this situation again while Michael is investigating spooky events. Alison realizes that he lives in the gate of hell. <br /> <br /> Although underestimated in the IMDb User Rating, 'The Sentinel' is one of the best horror movies ever. I have seen this movie at least six times, for the first time in the 1970s, in the cinema. On September 7, 2002, I bought the imported DVD and I saw it again. Yesterday I saw this movie again. Even after so many years, this film is still amazing. A scary and frightened story is frightened even today. Cast is the constellation of stars and starlets. You can see many actors and actresses who have become famous at the beginning of their career. Horror film fans definitely worship "The Sentinel," and I'm one of them. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> The title (Brazil): "The Sentinel of the Damned" <br /> <br /> Obs .: On 2 September 2007 I saw this movie again.
