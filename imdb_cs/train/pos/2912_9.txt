Nowadays we mistake the term "superstar" too easily, but here is one person who really deserves it. <br /> <br /> I was stuck on the show. The song selection was perfect - it included only the songs that I actually wanted to hear and shoot documentaries during the weaker new songs. I loved the band being just five guys on the podium in a very minimalist environment. (With songs of this power you do not need any circus that you would like to have). The footage of the crowd was amazing. How many artists can affect the original Beatles fans (now 50 years old and older), to get young children to jump to the "Can not Buy Me Love" line, and all of them will fall between them? <br /> <br /> When I watched, I also realized that as a result of John Lennon's tragic death, Paul McCartney became instantly imaginative. Paul not only lost John and George (no matter what their final relationships are, it's hard to lose someone with whom you changed the world), but he also lost his wife to Linda, and he never seemed to receive recognition that Lennon's murder had received. I agree that Lennon's murder was terrible, but only now I realized that Paul was forgotten after forgetting. I was very happy to find love again at Heather. As for those who complain about the quality of audio and video, I had no complaints; both were crystal clear on my set. I think these people will complain about DVD quality when another format comes out; they will never be satisfied. <br /> <br /> My only regret did not buy a ticket for this show when I had a chance. Thanks to this video I could enjoy it. When people remember John Lennon, they will first remember their murder and then their music. Now I have a new award for Paul McCartney, because if nothing else, he will first remember his music. And we hope another fool will not change this because the McCartney catalog is pretty good.
