Rock star: INXS was the best musical TV series I've ever watched! They had some of the best rock nylon songs he'd ever written and showed 15 highly talented singers / artists. She also had (in my opinion) the most heart-felt, good feeling, surprise ending in all reality TV. In fact, he brought luck to the winners! During the 13 weeks of this TV competition, the audience learned and met with all the contestants. After 30 episodes, the remaining contestants seemed to be friends rather than just a few foreigners competing against reality shows. And the fact that INXS was and still is one of EVER's biggest rock bands has added to the emotional tension created by this gorgeous reality. If you do not have a recorded series, DVD ROCK STAR: INXS is a great alternative.
