Cusack is doing this best David Niven, though I do not know if anyone else noticed me. When we look at it, its delicately over saturated 'wants to take more seriously than Austin's powers, but it is still a funny' reworking of the undervalued classic comedy. Hillary Duff makes over sexed Britney Spears lap dance version of Mata Bond. Writers build a bit of a return Oedipus, an interesting choice. I never knew how the calming Montel's voice was up to this movie ... I think he found a new call that makes voice over!
