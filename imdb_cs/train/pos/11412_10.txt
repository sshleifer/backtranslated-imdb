Two young girls, Mischa Barton as Frankie and Ingrid Uribe as Hazel play nicely and intelligently, though the conspiracy is rather a section of imagination. Young Hazel running for mayors seems to be out of place to be honest. While acting is done well by all those involved, the film does not tend to miss the real atmosphere of drama. Perhaps we have come to expect a fragile reality in movies, rather like a comparison between Pollyanna and How Green My Valley! It does not matter that each one is good in its own way. <br /> <br /> I admire Joan Plowright, although her role is somewhat subdued. In the middle of road entertainment, which is suitable for younger audiences, and how beautifully it is sometimes exhibited by classical classical music, which is almost rare! I think the film is a welcome change because it reflects quieter, sophisticated values ​​for teen years and no violence for good. A warm family movie that you can enjoy.
