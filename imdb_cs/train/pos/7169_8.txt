The "kids" movie typically has some uncomfortable quality that is too complex and unbearable for someone older than 13 years. But then again, that's before the holes appeared on the scene. Sure, it has the same moments that often make a child's movie the above-mentioned quality, but this film does a good job of abstaining from these conventions. The game was decent, and the uneasy dynamics that Stanley had with some of the other campers was more realistic than what most movies are trying to portray. What I particularly like about this movie was the fact that this movie did not try to break your heart or scream. Emotional power was a bit more natural than most would have imagined, just like Shawshank Redemption in many respects (which Hora also has a similar, redeeming end to it). The only bottom? Hokey looking for lizards. Overall, however, it is 8/10.
