This movie has a lot of raw potential. The script is sharp, the dialogue is (as a rule) excellent (though it can happen when it loses blind voices), the direction and the cinematography are surprisingly good, although some of the experiments just do not work. The main problem is David Duchovny. One geek-boy, always geek-boy; and the sad, simple fact is that he can not play anything other than Fox Mulder. He stands up, tries to be reassuring, presents, tries to be a macho. Eventually, he's just trying too hard. He surprises his character, crosses his boundaries, and he is simply omnipresent to Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie who are in the classroom over him as far as acting skills are concerned. Timothy Hutton was (as always) really good. There was one or two moments when he took over his role, but you could say he was enjoying it. He looked at the part and he became a physical and atmospheric character. Angelina Jolie was also really good. She did not play a big role; in fact, I could use a much stronger ... her character was not well developed, although she was extremely good at her. And the chemistry between her and Hutton was obvious (maybe that's why Uma left him ...); Overall, it was rough on the edges, but a solid effort of good casting and great supporting roles. If David Duchovny did not break his role in pieces, it would be much better. 7/10.
