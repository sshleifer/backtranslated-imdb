This film is the first movie experience for several people in the cast. They are all experienced actors and played in several TV series and games. Sahan Gokbakar is a famous comic in Turkey. It is strange to see him in a thriller while at the peak of his comic career in Turkey. This film is Togan Gokbakar's first long shot and quite a first experience as a director. But they all did a good job. We are glad to see such an enthusiastic young cast. They look very promising for the future of the Turkish film Industry. Doga Rutkay, a long-time darling of Sahan Gokbakara, is also a talented actress, known for her recent play in the number 27 drama series and several TV series.
