This film is an example of the state of erotic films B: poor porn movies without sex. The story in this is not as bad as it goes; it includes a female lawyer who is trying to prove that her mistress is innocent of killing her wife. The rest of the film, however, leaves something that would be desirable. Bad behavior, bad direction, bad looking woman, bad files, bad cinematography, bad sound and bad sex scenes. Film artists should learn the difference between anger and erotic. They do not even have a common sense to Gabriella Hall naked or on a love scene. How stupid?
