Grand Canyon falls into a very rare category: it's a very smart movie, with very clever dialogues and thoughts to eat everywhere from start to finish. I have the impression that it has never happened to be a deserving evaluation (and will never be) because it's a simplicity. This kind of film needs attentive observers. It is a shame that IMDb writes me ten lines because it is not necessary in this particular case. Anyway, to meet this requirement, I will tell you that the weak point of the film if someone is in acting: not that it was bad, but it could have been much better. An exception for Kevin Kline, who was perfect. Go on and look at it.
