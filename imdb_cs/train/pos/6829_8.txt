Gen. Rowlands plays an actress who loses her adherence to reality when she witnesses the death of her fan. She is becoming increasingly frustrated with reality, and as a result her emotional turbulence interferes with her work as an actress. In the sense that he violates all the rules of acting and improvises everything but still captures his audience, he makes the film interesting (if a bit confident) as parallel to Cassavettes' own fight as a director. There are so many thoughts that go around and as a result a little confused (I still think about the relationship between dead fan and Rowlands, among many other things), but the way they are presented in their most powerful form makes them always interesting and thought provoking film. It would be great to have a double account with Mulholland Drive. <br /> <br />
