I really enjoyed it! I would rate 10 if they had "Hassie" and "Little Luke". There was no mention of where they are today or why they did not attend the meeting. They were very popular figures and I think it was a mistake not to give an explanation for their lack of appearance. Anyway, I was glad that TNN made a series again! For years I've been looking for episodes and how happy I'm going to be able to shoot the whole series (maybe I've missed several episodes). Jenny Hanahan
