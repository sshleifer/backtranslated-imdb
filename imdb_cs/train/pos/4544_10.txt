Well, I know I would not like this movie, but I do. From the loving interpretation of Pat Morita from the Japanese stereotype to the uneasy shouting of Jay Lena, I laughed in this film. Until he considered that it was not the best film in the world, it was good for me. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is that Morita talks to her boss in Tokyo with a drink to another.
