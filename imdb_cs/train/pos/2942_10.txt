LOL !!! Crazy was so funny .. I was in tears. Eddie Murphys's impressions are absolutely right. The best impression was James Brown and Mr. T> SO FUNNY !! It's strange how Eddie Murphy was then and how he is now DELIVERED to see, but if you do not like the foul tongue, do not look, but amazing and so fine .. i saw it 6/7 times and always get on each other .. This is Eddie Murphy in his main and you can see where he gained humor and film ideas such as nutty professor of. He makes impressions from his family as well, which is really funny. <br /> <br /> If I was only there ...
