In the areas where they overlap, this gentle film is light years before 2004 Innocence, which gave the impression of a sharp eye and heavy breathing of ugly young girls. The effects are much more realistic and really get into the head of the three protagonists as they intertwine with adolescence full of pitfalls. Three principles, which are unknown to me, provide very certain performances, which is, in fact, such that it can be so natural that it will be difficult for them to reproduce this quality in other films, so I would not be too surprised to hear them again. It would be nice if it could get away from the Art Houses and the Multiplex where there is only an outside chance that she could "talk" with a bubblegum crowd that she was not focused on.
