Could such external production fail its primary goal of adapting Allende's novel correctly? Of course yes. Bill August has managed to create a shallow, shallow film where the basic elements of the South American mentality are simply presented as incidental events, resulting in total inconsistency. I can not believe it was a whole production team that did not understand the book! In this movie, of course technical quality and I think the actors did the best they had, but something is missing. And this was the most important thing.
