I first saw this movie a few years ago, and every time I have an opportunity, I've seen it several times a year. It's on my favorite movie list along with some classics. If someone told you it was stupid or obsolete, ignore them ... this movie is for everyone who has laughter and music. Dance is not as important in this film as in other Astaire films, so comedy and acting experience. Check out this movie, if it is possible, it may be easy, but it is still absolutely fun. So I know that many people hate black and white movies, think old movies can not really be fun, this film should make them change their minds. No one I know can watch this movie without being at least slightly amused. The only problem with the film: Fred Astaire sings without dance. He can be a great executive and capable singer, but it's just not fascinating and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story. Comedy sometimes gets a bit of a clich√©, but threats G burns and G Allen are perfect for a piece and can satisfy anyone looking for easy laughter. Give this movie a chance, even if you do not like old movies, this movie may seem absurd in everyone.
