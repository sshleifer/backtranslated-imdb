I'm a big movie fan, but not for the usual reasons. I think Travolta and Winger played at higher than average rates, I think these sets were representative for location and time, I liked the soundtrack and Charlie Daniels Band. I think the shooting was amazing! Since the indoor scenes were shot in a real club, and Gilley had low ceilings - perhaps 10-12 feet tall, and the smoke that was supposed to simulate "smoke-filled bar" hanged 2-4 meters below the ceiling. The camera managed to get shots of smoke and concentrate on actors, bull, bar, women, dance, low level of light that was in the bar! What performance! Surely there was auxiliary lighting, but to keep the atmosphere of the bar it must have been a flash of light. Ray Villalobos (camera operator) was great! He took several shots that he had no hope of success, and their impact brought the film to reality. Thanks, Ray - Great work!
