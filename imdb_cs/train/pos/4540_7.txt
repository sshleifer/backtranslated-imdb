This movie star Jay Lena as Detroit policeman, Tony Costas and Pat Morita as a policeman in Tokyo sent to Detroit to get a stolen prototype of a car engine. A Japanese man traveled to Detroit, hoping to sell him to an emerging car company run by Derrick Jarryd. Unfortunately, for him, the men who had agreed an agreement killed him and took the prototype. Angry Derek Jarryd is trying to move away from Phillip Madras, who led a man. But Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) has none of this and threatens to force him to continue his partnership. Meanwhile, in the same junkyard where a Japanese man was killed, the same men were also killed by a friend of Tony Costas. Tony's friend was looking at the antique court. Tony is about to find a killer against the command of his superior. Tony is in the robbery, while obviously murder should investigate the case. While Tony is investigating a crime, he will hit a Japanese cop and mistakenly arrest him. Eventually, casework will end. They make a special couple and there are some really fun parts as well as some ridiculous scenes such as Pat Morita jumping and kicking right through the windscreen of moving cars and digging Madras in the head. But in the end, it's a nice comrade movie, at least in my opinion. Jay Leno is not an actor, but he is in a good role and Pat Morita is also good. However, they make for one of the more unlikely Buddy Cop duo in the action movie. If you liked comedic movies, 80 movie films, or you want to see Jay Lena as an actor, I recommend this movie.
