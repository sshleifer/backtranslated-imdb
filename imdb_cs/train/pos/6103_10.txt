I've seen the movie recently during the Boston Film Festival. The movie was very fun and there is something I believe in the world, and black America is ready to see. My comedy, drama, soundtrack is great. It's a good movie. The characters were well-developed and the film had a number of prominent actors such as Wood Harris, Brian J. White (Trois 3, Mr 3000) and Zoe Saldana (Drumline, Pirates of the Caribbean). The film takes a short time on many important topics in today's society, doing it with class and grace. It's not just a story about living in a hospital, but it's a story about people and their personal way to discover who they are or who they are.
