Just like TALK RADIO, BOOTH is actually a bit predictable (TALK RADIO, because we know the truth about what happened when it happened - BOETH, because it is - the genre and the basic set). This is not necessarily the wrong thing in this case. In essence, it means that filmmakers do not end up as they would have, say, the American version of this story. BOOTH moves inexorably towards his (premature) conclusion, but is so beautifully created at all levels that one can enjoy a ride as well as a good road (very picturesque) road. It reminds me of the terrible story of Harlan Ellison, FLOP SWEAT. Claustrophobia is sometimes almost palpable. It's a beautiful long look.
