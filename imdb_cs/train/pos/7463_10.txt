It seems to us that this film polarizes us. You can either love or hate. I like it. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comment (s) you said, you just have to "feel" this. <br /> <br /> Also early in the movie, Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend Monet painted - an impressionist painter. Monet's style is painting in small dabs so the image closer, looks like a mess, but you can tell from a distance what it is. Cruise says painting has a "vanilla sky". I believe this is a help for the viewer. This film is like the impressionist picture. It's an Impressionist shooting! And it's no coincidence that the title of the film is about this painting. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical linear plot. It requires more thinking. There is symbolism and there are scenes that jump and not, you are not always sure what's going on. But in the end everything is explained. <br /> <br /> You will have to concentrate on this movie, but I think people make a concentration mistake too hard on it. Once it's over, you have to think about it. If you try to figure out how it develops, you will be overcome. It just happened ... "to go" with it ... keep an open mind. Do not forget what you see and save the analysis for later. <br /> <br /> I found all the highlights of the highlight and I thought it was incredibly unique, wildly creative and magical. But I will not criticize the intelligence of those of you who do not like it. It requires a certain taste. If you like existential, psychedelic, philosophical, thought-provocative, demanding, spiritual movies, then you will see it. If you prefer something a little lighter then skip it. But if you like what I have described, you will certainly enjoy it.
