There is no doubt that Halloween is by far one of the best movies ever, not only in his genre but also outside. I love movies like a scary atmosphere, like the whole thing that can happen, somehow the situation makes scary to think. Also imagine if you ever have in this situation what you are going to do. This is a movie that I like to watch high, especially around Halloween time. John Carpenter is a very professional directer I love a lot of his other films, but there is no doubt, that his most famous movie is Halloween.Oh movie and if your thoughts about watching Rob Zombie remake don't.It is a clean bullshit and a real Halloween fan would like 1978 John Carpenter version better.Michael Myers is one of the best killers slasher in every movie , and is a well-known one. So with all the means to go see this masterpiece you will really like.
