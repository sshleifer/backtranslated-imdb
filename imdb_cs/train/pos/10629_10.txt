Michigan, Edgar Allen Poe, toaster and pan. . . If you do not mind the genre of a psycho-thriller or a horror film and you have a special place for twisting in your heart, it's a movie for you. The amazingly developed first film, "Hate For a Minute," has everything that brings major hits like "Silence of the Lambs" and classic classics as "an army of darkness." Edits and effects are well done, better than many movies in the genre. Kallio is weaving a complicated story of mockery drawing from both the Bible and Poe's writings. At a time when big budget, big name movies lack substantial substance, independent film resurrected this dying trait. If you love Michigan, a good story or a decent thriller, look at "Hate per Minute".
