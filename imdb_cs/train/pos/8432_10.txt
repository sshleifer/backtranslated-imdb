I did not want to read anything about the film before I happened to watch her last Saturday night. And then, as I watched it, I felt the misery of Lena and Boesman in my bones. I was so enchanted by the acting and tone and shooting, which I listened to only partially in the dialogue. My husband fell asleep soon after we went to bed and I was sleepless under the influence of the movie. I wanted to wake him up, just to say, "If I ever voted for an Oscar nomination, it would be for these two actors." I decided to wait for the next day. Then I read more about the IMDb movie and it was sad that I discovered that Mr. Berry had died before the release of the film and that he probably never saw the latest version of his great masterpiece. I still want to say that his film was a true independent film, his concept and his spirit. The actors praise not only for their great performance, but also for their acceptance of a part without a gloss, without showing, but on the contrary, showing the true image of human depression. Sad, but sad.
