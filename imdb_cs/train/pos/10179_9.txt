De Grot is a very good movie. The big plot comes from the novel by Tim Krabbe, who also adapted this story to the screen. Some really top performers, not just Van HuÃªt, but especially Marcel Hensem, who predominantly performed on TV before the performance of Axel van de Graaf. It seems that the film kicks up like a thriller and creates an excellent mood. Then we begin to get acquainted with Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf, and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very impressive memory structure that contributes to romanticism and dramatic film drama. Ultimately, it will culminate with an emotional end that captures the audience of their throats. Make sure that as far as this film is concerned, you know as little as a conspiracy. You have to look, especially if you liked "Spoorloos" (The Vanishing is the original screen adjustment).
