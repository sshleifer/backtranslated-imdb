on the contrary, to the person mentioned above I felt that this movie was really fun especially in scenes where a lot of mixes. I do not want the story and the story to do to people who have not seen them yet, but I will say that Paresh Rawal does not have a large role, like the past Priyadarshan movies, such as Hera Pheri and Hunga. Paresh Rawal has an awesome role in the small role he gives, John Abraham doing it well, Akshay Kumar has proven he is no less in this film than he did from Waqt and almost all his Andaaz movies. Although the three heroines in this film were on their debut, they did a pretty good job of acting, especially Nargis, which is very good looking and hot. I would say that if you like Hunga or Hera Pheri this movie needs to be watched.
