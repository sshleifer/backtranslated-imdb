Although I was interested in the target audience, I always had a weak spot for YA fiction, so I was naturally interested in Nancy Drew's return to the screen. It's not a bad movie. A central secret involving a long dead actress is set forth in simple simplifying terms with threatening fluctuations for a young deteuth. Nancy and her friends do not take the threats seriously, so young audiences will not be disillusioned. What I really appreciated from the story was that the final results were rather serious and meaningful, and Nancy seemed to understand and grow from experience. <br /> <br /> Emma Roberts is great as Nancy Drew and hope to see her again in the next secret.
