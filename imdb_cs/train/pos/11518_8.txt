You can do a lot with little cash. Blair Witch did it. This movie supports it. It's not just a sitcom in length and complexity. However, because John Cleese is like Sherlock Holmes, he can be cheerful even for a budget he could not afford to become shocking. Highlighting this film is Arthur Lowe as an honest, humble Watson, his dullness and slowness attracts Cleese's rapid temperament. If you've ever encountered a movie, beware of laughter or two.
