In 1933, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler sang and danced their way through three Warner Brothers musicals that offer depressed era viewers a distraction from their woes. Gold excavations from 1933, the 42nd Street and Night Show were housed in the Broadway Theater world with essentially the same theme show they must continue. In addition to Keeler and Powell, the films were introduced by Busby Berkeley's kaleidiscopic choreography, a stop-shop show, and many of the same supportive players. All of them are probably classics of their genre, but I have to admit the clear preference of backlighting due to the energy tempo and James Cagney's leadership. Warren William in the Gold Doughs and Warner Baxter on the 42nd Street are admiringly celebrating themselves as producer concerts - especially Baxter as a burnt Julian Marsh in search of one last box. They both lack Cagney's infectious energy, which perfectly complements the frenetic pace of Broadway musical deployment. It's an absolute storm when it deals with production numbers, ruthless partners, and girlfriend's golden kick. Of course, Cagney itself does not make Footlight a classic. The script cracks with some sharp double entenders delivered by superlative support of casting representing Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee and especially Joan Blondell, who will share everyone in size. Busy Berkeley's dance figures are unreal, suggestive and risky, and they are done just before the Hollywood Code came in 34. Unfortunately, the 1930s and sometimes beyond the boundaries will never see such a rich musical instrument with an accent again. Gentility and morality have made it so.
