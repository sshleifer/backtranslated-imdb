This movie is about an hour of good fun and has really fun moments. I loved the character of Matt and Tiny. They seemed to be the most interesting and funny characters, and certainly the most interesting. Matt is very good (just like his stepmother), and a police woman and a blonde biker provide some welcome eye candy. I must say that I have seen significant similarities between Matt and another Australian actor Eric Bann. My personal favorite part was a brothel scene, she loved it. Overall, I liked the film and got about 8 ratings. However, my sanctions were disappointed. It was the bottom of the hairdresser, rather than the matching string. <br /> <br /> I am, of course, kidding. :)
