Why are bulls this film so low ?! I've seen this movie more than 25 times, I know every movie on this movie. Obviously, I love this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (South Park creators and Team America's new puppet masterpiece) starring Joe Cooper or Coop "Airman" Cooper and Doug Remer or "Sir Swish". They are mainly referred to as Coop and Remer in the film. Just as the movie begins, it reminds us of the hungry, hungry, corrupt world of supernatural sports starts, even going so far as to become "Townsell". I have to quote this part of the film because it's true in some sporting affairs: "And after playing for new England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, one year for Toronto Arganauts plus one season as bigger in Desert Inn I am happy to finally I play in the beautiful city of Miami. "His agent leaned," Minnesota. " Do not forget this important part of the film. So it starts that Coop and Remer are in high school and find that there is nothing when they talk to their old classmates. In addition, they created the BASEketball sport after they were attacked by what were probably the basketball heroes in high school. After the crime is a sport for the year of the year. During this time they managed to get the third team of Squeak team, which is actually the day after they invented the game. As the film follows, we find out that Coop, Remer and Squeak are the only virtual sports heroes. The story follows with witch blackmail, Milwaukee Beers cheerleaders, and humor so absurd to let you cry more. Look at it, it's funny.
