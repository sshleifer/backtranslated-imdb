I just came back from the show of this great science fiction movie. His style is definitely unique and very well done. The film is shot by real actors, but it has been transformed into a black-and-white comic strip that you have never seen before. He goes a step further than Sin City and does it well. It is a successful combination of French comic and film cultures. The story and mood reminisce of Blade Runner, and if you like it, you will surely like this. The story is intelligent, never boring and has some pretty twists. This film is a prerequisite for all films, except for those who do not like science fiction or b & w.
