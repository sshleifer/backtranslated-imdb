This film, though it seems to be based on a 1959 film released by MGM and played by Janet Leigh, is still a great movie. Danny Glover brings George Knox, in one of his best performances, with his short temperament to the battle. As for this film, it's "stacked" how to add Christopher Lloyd (his scenic experience works and shows in his performances on screen, a wonderful actor), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (third rock from the sun), Brenda Fricker and well- Tony Danza (yes, he is good in this film), Matthew McConaughey (stole the show in Dazed and Confused and his role may not be so decisive in this film but he got the exposition), Adrien Brody (what I am Matthew McConaughey, it's the same for Adrien, except Dazed and Confused), some great actors such as Taylor Negron (David), Tony Longo (Messmer), Jay O. Sanders (Ranch Wilder) McDonough (Whitt Bass) and veteran veteran in one of his last performances, Ben Johnson (Hank Murphy, owner of the California Angels), and the rest of the cast does a great job, plus a great story that uplifts a lot of anyone, I do not care what depressions you are depressed. I loved the film as a child, and it brings memories when I look at it today. I need it on DVD. I recommend it to all parents who are looking for something their children have not seen, and everyone else.
