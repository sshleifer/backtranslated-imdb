I saw it in the early 1970s (when I was 16) and despite the slow slow preparation, meetings, riots, etc. Once the desert began, everyone fell into context and I loved them. (It was still very good.) At that time, I was in what looked like a small minority. All critics have focused on the lack of talk and narration. Fortunately, I am no longer in such a minority. <br /> <br /> It simply shows (in somewhat prophetic way) the political fragmentation, riots, confrontation, brutal repression, commercialization and fraud that stand before us. <br /> <br /> I've grown up with this master film and I'm glad.
