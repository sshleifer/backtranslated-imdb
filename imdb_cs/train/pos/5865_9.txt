He saw it in the early 90's on the cable and loved it. I've never seen it until he recently appeared on the cable. It's still a great movie in Vietnam. You are not sure why there is no higher rating. I found everything about this movie compelling. As a vet (not from Vietnam), I can invoke the situation brought by both Harris and De Niro. I can only imagine that this film is now more acute with our situation in Iraq. I wish it was more often offered on the cable to see people. The human toll on our soldiers is not on the battlefield. He brought home for the rest of his life. And this film is one of many that brings the home very hard. Excellent movie.
