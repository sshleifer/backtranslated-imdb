Halfway between San Francisco and the captains of the boldest two biggest parts of Spencer Tracy, this is a very curious film about the war and the effects it has on some people. They gave him stars Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone in the only film they ever made, and Gladys George as a woman who loves them. Tracy and Tone are a few drafts from the First World War, Tone is a weak figure who almost goes over the hills to the boot camp, but Tracy stops him. Tracy still plays for the love blowing, the younger type of Wallace Beer that MGM imagined when they signed him out of Fox. <br /> <br /> In front, Tone gets the opportunity and takes it when he gets to the tower of a church that looks at the German machine gun nest. He learned to shoot now and do Sergeant York. But Alvin C. York never changed the war as Tone did. <br /> <br /> Injured in the fight, Tone recovers in the hospital and Gladys George looks at him. Tracy goes alone to visit his friend and he and George have done something. Later, when Tracy is reported in action, Tone and George marry. Tracy is farewell when she comes back and learns about marriage, but she's sitting in step. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film deals with Ton by applying the war skills he has learned to shop with gangsters. He's a hit man and George really does not know what he's doing for a living. I think you can read the rest. Part of the film that gave me a little trouble is that I can not believe Gladys George could not come. She's a street intelligent girl, much like the one she played in The Roaring Twenties over James Cagney. Speaking of The Twisting, the development of the Humphreya Bogart is similar to Tone, although it was not the central character of the film. In fact, there are elements that have given him the pistols that are found in a taxi driver and Clint Eastwood's The Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> The battle sequences of the First World War are well presented by director Woody Van Dyke. For some reason Leonard Maltin shot this movie, I think it's much better than he did.
