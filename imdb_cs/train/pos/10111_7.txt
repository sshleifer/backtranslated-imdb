The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr. is not a particularly good document. Aesthetically, it is light and cheap looking, the people in it leave on the touch, which makes it very blurred and uncompromising, but it adds to its spell. I say this because it is a documentary about some oddball that created special pictures and surrounded with other people and as such there really is no other way to document the life and career of a man and his crew with futility. There are some flashes of insight into both genius and disrespecting Wood, and the display of both qualities is due to the authenticity of the document. Overall, it's worth seeing for the wood fans and the cinema in general, but do not expect that brilliance. Expect a document created after Wood's own heart.
