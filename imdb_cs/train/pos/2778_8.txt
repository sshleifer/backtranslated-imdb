I saw it with little expectation and absolutely loved it! Bend like Beckham is quite typical of the film about a rather atypical girl. It is the role of Parminder Nagra ("ER") played by Jess, a teenager in England, captured between her traditional Indian family and her love for football (that is football for us North America). And while she is actually much older than her character, she plays the role perfect. This is a film about friendship - specifically Jess's friendship with Jule (Keira Knightley), her teammate, who is also preparing, especially with a mother who wore a purple nail polish and a small arc on her shoes and that Jules wants to be a woman, wears lace lingerie and flirts with boys and is afraid that playing sports means her daughter is a lesbian. Jules and Jess both love the game and have trouble trying to persuade their families to let them go after their dreams. They too, unfortunately, both love the same man - Joe, their coach (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). Love triangle causes some tension in their friendship. In some places, Bend, like Beckham, falls into the clich√©. In other scenes, they have been dragging on for too long, and this movie is likely to benefit from more stringent edits. But it was a refreshing fun movie about growing up, cultural conflict, and love for football. It's about empowering women, persecuting your dreams and supporting your friends. Funny, charming and entertaining, Bend It Like Beckham is a small movie that could ... and did. Excellent. 8/10.
