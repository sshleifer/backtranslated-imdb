Even in the 21st century, the child's yield is dangerous: women have abortions and premature birth. Seventy-five years ago, it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth. This is the topic "Life begins": a look at the department of "heavy cases" in the maternity hospital. Loretta Young plays a leader, a woman brought here from prison (what crime she committed, not a deliberate act) to childbirth; is conflicting about having a baby born after birth. She's in the ward with several other women who share their joys and pains with each other. Although Loretta Young is the leader, the excellent performance, as usual, is Glenda Farrell. Farrell was one of Warner's "B" women in the 1930s, she had quite a few supporting roles, and sometimes she won the lead in B (Farrell played Torchy Blane in several installments of the Torchy B series). , Farrell plays a promising mother who does not want her kids because they will just forgive them. She does everything in her to get in the way of nurses, including alcohol smuggling into the ward (of course during the ban) and drinking like fish - apparently never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome back 30s. Interestingly, unlike most films in the early 1930s, it is not that women are stupid idiots who find themselves in the way of heroic men - the situation is reversed, and the fathers who are waiting are the quivering jelly hills. (Watch for veteran character Frank McHugh as one of the expected fathers.) "Life begins", being an early talkie, treats the subject with a fair dollop melodrama, sure, but it's a pretty charming little movie. Turner Classic shows it, seldom; I only saw it a few days when I read Loretta Young. But it is highly recommended to watch when it will appear.
