It is a wonderful story about the reinforcement of guilt. <br /> <br /> Matiss, on a lonely night walk in Riga (?) Passes a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing. It goes without a word. Only a splash in the water followed by a scream for help causes it to behave. And then too little and too late. The film records his efforts to learn more about this woman. She finds her handkerchief at the local bar trolley. Increasingly and more he connects his life. His "appearance" changes as his obsession grows. He has to do things okay. In an amazingly filmed dialogue with a "bastard of a former friend," Alexei forced him to face the guilt they both felt. Amazing long shots, a distinctive soundtrack that emphasizes guilt, dog barking. Tracks. Beautiful movie noir with a beautiful twist. Good India ends.
