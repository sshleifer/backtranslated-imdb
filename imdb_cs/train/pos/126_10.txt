Zentropa is the most original film I've seen for years. If you like unique thrillers that are influenced by the noir filter, then it's just the right cure for all the Hollywood summer blockbuster, which today clogs theaters. Von Trier's sequel, like Breaking the Waves, has received more recognition, but it's really his best job. It is dazzling without disturbing and offering a perfect combination of tension and dark humor. It's a bad thing he decided that handheld cameras are the wave of the future. It is difficult to say who spoke him away from the style that he exposes, but it is for all the losses that he instead entered his theoretical dogmatic direction.
