Sweet romantic drama / comedy about Stewart and Sullavan who write love letters to each other without one of them knowing who the other is. Of course they work together and can not stand each other. You can estimate the rest. It's beautiful acting all the cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has a humorous, intelligent script and looks absolutely stunning. It's happening in Budapest and filmed in Hollywood, but I believed I was seeing Budapest! Everything looks so perfect and like a dream. Unique movie. Do not miss!
