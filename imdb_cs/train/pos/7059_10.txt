I was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews I've seen on the web. I thought Cinderella 2 (as well as 3) is all very cute and fun to follow - kids and adults ... like me, I'm 22 years old. <br /> <br /> I also consider it a very informative movie, showing lessons about being aware of your heart. I thought he had a great animation and voice casting was very good. also the songs played by Brooke Allison. Since this film was divided into three memories / stories, my favorite of three, is the story where the Jaq Mouse became a man all day, thanks to fairy-tale belief and magic.
