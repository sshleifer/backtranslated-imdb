Monstervision was a show I grew up with. From a late night guest with Penn and Teller on one, only, Joe Bob Briggs. The show kept me on Friday night classes in high schools, and assuming that some of the top memories that would ever come out were no doubt available. <br /> <br /> Sometimes. If you did not stay, you were lost. I know John Bloom and Joe Bob live, but I want them back where they belong ... MONSTERVISION! Question ... did anyone else sit in all four hours "The Swarm"? q :) <br /> <br /> Long live Monstervision!
