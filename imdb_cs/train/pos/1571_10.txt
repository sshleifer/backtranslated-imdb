Not since Spongebob Squarepants saw a big cartoon on TV. The colors are great, the voices can not be better, the characters are so original, great cartoon. I hope Nickolodean continues to develop this cartoon series. I hope the DVD season will come out soon !!! I like cartoons like me and I hope more people will embrace this great cartoon show. It's very hard to find a Season DVD, so if anyone finds a store selling it, let me know. The only Catscratch merchandise available at Nick Shop is a great t-shirt but very expensive! If you like Spongebob; and who does not? you will love Catscratch too!
