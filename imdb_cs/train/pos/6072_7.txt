Branagh and Fishburne bring great performances in this version of Shakespeare's classic. Branagh plays Iago better than I saw the figure playing in the movie or on the stage. Some might say that this film is overstated Iago-centric, but I disagree. Fishburne, ironically the first black Othello in the history of the film, delivers powerful performance. Fishburne has always been a good actor, but this show as the Moor of Venice can be one of his best. <br /> <br /> One problem I have with this movie is simply to read a number of important scenes. The Desdemon character is given much less depth than it has in the game. This movie could not be added at all. One of the worst cuts made by Branagh in this film was the reading of an interview between Iago and Desdemona at the beginning of the second act. This part of the game shows Desdemona does not have to be an innocent child, which is shown as in this movie. There have been a number of subtractions that hurt the integrity of this film. <br /> <br /> However, if you did not read the game or you saw the movie version of Othella earlier, I recommend this movie. The story, cut or not, is still incredibly fascinating. Playing, as mentioned above, is very good. If some important scenes were added and the Desdemona character was favored a little further, it would be a great movie. At present it is an admirable version of the original. I give him a marginal recommendation.
