Colman's performance is supported by a great script. Gargantuan studios in Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s were able to copy some German expressionist film elements and incorporate them into Hollywood films. very good use of shadows and lights and silhouettes. I really liked the scene where Colman turns off the light in the closet near the start of the movie and begins to recite Othello while his face becomes dark and evil instantly. the viewer sees the text and drama of Shakespeare as he holds Tony, and he continues his journey of destruction. I also enjoyed the dramatic scene of death in the game when she becomes overwhelmed with emotion and accidentally strangles his costar a little too hard for her to carry. her statement "Stop me hurting me" is cool and thrilling. you just do not know if she jumps to the top and kills her anytime. cat and mouse searched the murderer and nicely added 2 / 3rds movie paths to add some faster pacing and join the narrating story element of the film. Master's work by George Cukor. He is like a skilled director. Excellent movie. It's a shame they do not do as if ...
