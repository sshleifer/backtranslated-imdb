After seeing this movie, I feel a little bit more about the US. David Lynch is synonymous with the value of shock and strange due to peculiarity, and these elements are actually missing from The Straight Story. But it's in the light that Lynch had not seen before. We start with a simple family that lives in a tranquil life but ends up with a series of absurdly interesting characters with depth in life that can not be seen from their performances. Especially the bar scene with two veterans of the Second World War that discussed the events fifty years ago and how it still affected their present lives and emotions. If you are looking for Wild at Heart or Dune, do not look here. But if you're looking for real people with real stories, it's the movie for you.
