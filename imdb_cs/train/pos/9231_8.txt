FLAVIA THEERETIC is a strange entry into the Nunploit genre - the same part of the sleaze, feminist journey and "history" as we follow Flavia to her strange trip. <br /> <br /> Get started with Flavius ​​in the monastery. . She is not very happy because she does not believe all the male "rules" and the machoism of the world around her, and escapes from the monastery to her Jewish friend Abraham. Both are eventually captured and Flavia is brought back to the monastery, where he joins another "unbelieving" nun while accelerating the invasion of Muslims. Flavia hangs with Muslims who take over the monastery and get "busy" with nuns in a strange scene. Ultimately, Muslims and Flavia are punished as a traitor of Christianity in another extremely brutal scene ... This has to a large extent all the things that I would like to see in the 70s - a good gore, including nipple removal, nice legs, some decent nudity - including the required full queue and a decent story. I will say that it has been stretched at several points, but it is not enough to really bore it. I would definitely recommend that this is to harvest / 70 is exploiting the fans ... 8/10
