I love this movie. It was one of my favorite films. The action never stops. The whole movie was very successful. The end is really good. Ontop that the action is full, they even have a surprise that there for you. When I saw what the film was on the internet, I was a bit confident if I wanted to see this movie, but it makes sense to be such a big fan of Luke Perry that I decided to give him a chance. I'm glad I gave him a chance because it was a very good movie. It was very original. Who thinks this movie will come from me. The game was great. Luke Perry did a great job again. I give this movie the highest rating.
