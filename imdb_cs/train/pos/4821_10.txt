One of those beautifully intense films that attract us so much, ends very soon! Then they stayed on the screen like, "No, no!" Lol. Good performances all around! She plays amazingly amazingly with Emily Blunt! I knew he would provide a solid, convincing performance that captures the young Victoria kingdom, temperament and vulnerability throughout the movie. Production is also exceptional: style, fabric and sensitivity. A remarkable glimpse at a remarkable time in the history of Britian revealed through the very personal and relevant biography of the school age princess until her reign as Queen, later married to Prince Albert before he finished the birth of the first of nine children. It has a well written script and flawless edits. Rupert's friend, because the young Prince Albert tried to earn the young Queen's attention rather than make her love than Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) was interested in. Just as suffering was the relationship between adolescents Victoria and her mother, which was sometimes anger, just like her mother and King William (who also did not like her mother). Actresses and scenes were breathtaking, highly emotional. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone who cares about the historical and political situation that existed at that time, and really everyone who loves the surprising romance story
