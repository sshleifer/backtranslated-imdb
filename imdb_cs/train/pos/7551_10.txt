The best animated movie ever shot. This film explores not only the huge world of modern animation with absolutely stunning effects but also the branches of the human mind, soul and philosophy. The story presents a family of cats where she dies in a big sister, a younger brother sees it and saves her body, but when she wakes up she will be left without a soul. So, two sibling cats set out on the way to find them. I have joined this path to many things. The history of the world, the Bible, the life cycle, and every time I watch it, I discover more and more hidden topics and metaphors. If you are not so physiologically, you will still admire it. Animation is an excellent and creative scenes to connect you to the screen. For example, the ocean froze in time, God eats soup from the earth, the strange and slightly SNM narrative of Hansel and Gretel. Finally, Cat Soup is absolute treatment for everyone. <br /> <br /> PS - Not for children, including free violence.
