Diagnosis Murder was shown most of the BBC1 afternoon because I watched her when I was bad at school 10 years ago - I know I really should not like it, I would not like the "Murder she wrote" but I'm totally dependent on both and even DVD box-sets .... OK I know it's sad Dick Van Dyke bears a show while he stars like Dr. Mark Sloan and a Doctor at a community hospital in the LA community who is also an advisor to LAPD - his son Steve (the real life of his son Barry van Dyke - Dick) is a policeman who needs help from his father in many suspected deaths. <br /> <br /> Duration is Dr.Amanda Bentley (Victoria Bentley), resident general community pathologist, and for the first couple of seasons you played Scott Baia, who played Dr. Jack Stewart, who rose and left the series in 1995 hoped to go for bigger and better things ... he would stay where he was, did nothing that might seem ... and his only theater appearance for many years was in Baby Geniuses 2: Superbabies .... Oh Dear !!! <br /> <br /> While Dr.Jack Stewart was replaced by younger Dr. Jesse Travis played by Charlie Schlatter, who entered Baio shoes quite comfortably. <br /> <br /> The series is very unlikely, but what is Whodunit not? (Murder wrote - wherever Jessica goes, somebody ends up dead or underestimated father of Dowling's mystery about the murder that solves priests with the nun) The series was much lighter until 1997, supporting the cast that included crazy hospital manager Norman Brig, who played Michael Tucci, along with Nolo & Mark Dolores secretary, played Delores Hall. After 1997, these characters were no longer included, and the series became a harsher issue with a larger budget, some episodes involving much more action, one episode being thrown out of the hospital. It was a family show for Van Dyke because, like Dick's son Barry, you also had Dick's daughter and all his grandchildren look in different episodes. <br /> <br /> As the series continued, it was a bit silly, one episode I remember Dick van Dike playing his whole family, which was a bit extraordinary, but the whole "Murder Diagnosis" really good TV show, she had many good stars for the guests. Since this show ended in 2001, Dick & Barry has re-emerged in the TV Series "MURDER 101" produced by The Hallmark Channel, pretty much the same way and still enjoyable. Dick, who is now in the mid-eighties, does not seem to change a lot and seems to be working until the end. TV SHOW **** OUT *** **
