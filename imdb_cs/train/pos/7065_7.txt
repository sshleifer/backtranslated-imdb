A cute film about three living nurses from Switzerland who want their parents back together (it seems that Mom still wears a flashlight for my father) - and so they go to New York City to stop their father from marriage blonde goldenopter, which he calls "precious." Father did not see his daughters in ten years, but it seems incredible, and she thinks she's amazing, and yet it seems that Precious leads the life that predominantly controls her angry mother (Alice Brady) wants her daughter he married a rich man. The nurses will get the idea of ​​moving Precious into a drunken Hungarian count and cheating two women who look at gold to think he is one of the richest men in Europe. But the case of mistaken identity causes girls to think that Earl is a beautiful Ray Milland who meets with her because of Sister Kay. "The film is fun, lightweight." Barbara reads as Kay finds sweet and nice, Ray Milland looks oh so young and handsome here (though, unfortunately, little is given to it), Alice Brady is pretty good as a bout mother - it's Deanna Durbin, charming and cute as the button that plays the youngest sister Penny, who basically steals the show. With absolutely beautiful vocals she sings a few songs throughout the movie, although I really like to see them posing even more. the movie is a little stupid, but I found the movie fun and fun.
