As part of our vocabulary of the late 1950s, we knew Ponderos, Little Joe, Hoss, Ben Cartwright, etc. for the great show "Bonanza." It was Saturday night and they were all stuck to a television set. It was a real show showing family values. Maybe it was a week's crisis, but it was a strong family atmosphere that stretched all together. Lorne Greene was dominant as a family patriarch. His words showed wisdom. Often we were interested in the fact that Ben Cartwright, the widow, had to be the best of the spouse of this poor wife who died. He had great sons. Of course, we were all interested in why Pernell Roberts left the show. The show was a golden day and Roberts moved away a lot of money when he left. His career never left because he was connected as the son of Cartwright. He had to try to return to the show. He definitely lost his bonanza when he fell out.
