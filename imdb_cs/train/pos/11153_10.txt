Cheerful but naive, great Joe Buck leaves his home in Big Spring in Texas and defends himself in the Great Apple in search of women and big bucks. In NYC, JB meets frustration and "Ratso" Rizzo, a perverse but hearty painter. Somehow this disparate couple can survive each other, which in turn helps both to cope with the drunken, sometimes brutal, urban America, on its way to the horrific end. Both funny and depressing, our "Midnight Cowboy" goes into the belief of cyclonic cultural change and confirms to the audience of 1969 that they were dragged away from the innocence of the 1950s and that Dorothy and Toto fell into the 1960s Aquarius. <br /> <br /> The direction of the film is masterful; casting is perfect; acting is an upper notch; the script is sharp and subtle; cinematography deals; and music extends all the above. She deserves the best 1969 Oscar and I voted her one of the best films of this cyclone decade.
