The break point in the movie "Matador" appears about half the movie when Danny, a helpless man from Denver, sits on the balcony of his hotel in Mexico City and enjoys quietly. Someone knocks on the door and when he knows Julian, a paid killer, refuses to answer. But really? Richard Shephard, director of Matador, portrays Julian Noble, who has no repayable quality. In fact, we've seen him in action, doing what he does best. When Julian meets Danny at the Camino Real bar in Mexico City, he spins the beans and tells his new friend what he really does for life. Danny, who came to sell his program to Mexican society, but seems to compete for local clothing that seems to be in front of getting a contract. Danny is a naive person who falls for the prey of charisma and charm that scared the smarter Julian. Only after some time, on a cold winter night, the murderer will appear at Danny's door and ask his friend to return him a favor and accompany him on a trip to Tucson. It is at this point that the secret that brings them together is revealed in an unexpected way. Pierce Brosnan, who is acting against the guy, has a huge contribution to his disrespectful Julian Noble. You just have to watch the hotel lobby in his Speedo and the shoes give the impression of his character. Greg Kinnear, on the other hand, plays an equal part of this odd couple. I hope Davis will appear in just a few scenes that weep for why he did not last longer. Philip Baker Hall appears as a connection between Julian and his tasks. Richard Shephard directs in the style of working with his own material. The musical score is Rolfe Kent and David Tattersala's sharp cinema improves everything.
