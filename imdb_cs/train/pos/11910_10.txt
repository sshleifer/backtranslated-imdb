This gorgeous little thriller opens with Trevor Howard in his Jag cabriolet and ends in Liverpool port. It's all excitement and escape because the ex-spy has to re-start its career as much as it gets some serious R & R cataloging motorcycles (like the British?). Trevor Howard and Jean Simmons from London to Newcastle-upon-Tyne to Liverpool (via Ullswater) - were just thrown out of MI5 or something, and you guessed it's on the run is wrongly charged with murder. There are nautical docks, hooves of the Lake District, sheep, rural pubs, lost copper, waterfalls, lots of amateur bikers, roofs and lots of Chinaman (do not ask) and that's all very Hitchcock and Hannayesque ... <br /> <br /> .. and a terrible example of British noir ...
