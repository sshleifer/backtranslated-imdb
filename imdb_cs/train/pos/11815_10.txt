At the time I write, I see from more than 15,000 votes that it has a rating of 5.8. There is something wrong with this image. I personally give it 10. I can see 7 on the lowest or possible 8, if it was rated by people who see this movie for what it really is. It's a movie based on the comic book hero. This movie won more than its prize. He won 3 Oscars. Another 5 victories and 26 nominations .... right there tells me it's better than 5.8. Some great acting from some very good actors, some great special effects and, in my opinion, it will be if it is not a classic for the coming years. If you are looking for pure entertainment, do not forget to check out Dick Tracy. Definitely a movie that you can watch more than a few times. Al Pacino is great as Big Boy Caprice.
