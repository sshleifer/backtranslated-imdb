This is one of the best movies I have seen for years! I'm not a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but it's great like Emma Woodhouse. Alan Cumming is great because Reverand Elton and sister Emma Thompson, Sophie, are hysterical like Miss Bates. And look at the beautiful Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley; what a gentleman! Who said you needed sex and violence in the movie to do it well, Emma had never seen it. I think that's what separates it from many others - it's classical. If you are looking for a movie that you can watch with the whole family or look for romance for yourself, look no further. Emma is the movie. Beautiful surroundings, beautiful costumes and excellent cast (I mentioned the wonderful Jeremy Northam?), Emma is the perfect ten!
