Since I can remember and I'm only 18, I'm a mother, and I've been and still looking at older movies, because I think in the long run they're much more rewarding (but hey, I like movies that we are bad today I just do not have as much as I love movies in the 1940s and 1950s, but I have to say the moment when I started to watch the movie that stuck my eyes to the TV, of course my favorite character was the grandmother Lucile Watson played. Betty Davis and her family have been portrayed ... The children ... do not look like kids in the slightest but there's a good reason you've had to hide and run most of your life and see the terrible things the children have seen in those days to destroy their innocence. So people say "I oooo I hated how the kids were doing ... blah blah blah" read between the lines and know they saw things the kids could not see. I know now that many people are upset that it's an Oscar and Bogie did not do it, but hey they both do a great job, so I think it could go the same way. But the performance of Lukas was so great that I dropped to tears until the end of the film. I loved this film so much and I recommend it to everyone! :-D
