I really remembered seeing this when I was three years old, then my parents randomly uploaded all but a few seconds, with some other cartoon character. Then I was about 8 or 9 years old when I discovered it again, and since I was better able to understand things, I thought it was a good movie. Fast Forward Just a few weeks ago (June 2006) when I discovered it again thanks to some internet articles / video clips and it's just not the same movie. I'm sure it's still good with the kids, but for us 20-30 pieces, it's definitely a "Cult Status" written around the world. It is a shame that the original production has gone through a painful process; if Fox had given him enough time, it would probably be more public today. Perhaps if they were to do it with a completely different story and star star, that might be, but it is up to Fox to decide. Here I went, I know. I still think it's a great movie, but it could be better than great.
