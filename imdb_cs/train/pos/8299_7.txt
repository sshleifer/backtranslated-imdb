When scientist and family Matt Winslow (Robert Urich) finally accepts an invitation to work with Micro-Digitech Corporation in a space suit project, he moves with his beloved wife Patricia (Joanna Cassidy) and their son Robby (Barret Oliver) and daughter of Chris (Soleil Moon Frye ) into a huge modern house in the corporation. They meet their boyfriend Tom Peterson (Joe Regalbuto) and his family totally adapted to the new lifestyle, and Tom invites Winslow's family to the Steaming Springs Country Club. Tom is trying to convince him that Matt tells him that every member of the club has a meteorological rise in Micro-Digit, but Matt is not tempted by this offer. Later, she will meet Jessica Jones (Susan Lucci), who will spin Patricia and persuade her to join the club. Matt feels a change in the behavior of his family and decides to investigate the club and find a bad secret about Jessica and his members. In the eighties, when I saw the "Invitation to Hell", I liked this film, which is partly reminiscent of "The Stepford Wives," with people changing their behavior in the suburban section. I just saw it today, and I found a great metaphorical report against large corporations when people literally sell their souls to the devil to go to places and earn higher salaries. I'm not sure if the author wanted to give this interpretation a story, but I believe it will fit perfectly. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Convite Para o Inferno" ("Invitation to Hell")
