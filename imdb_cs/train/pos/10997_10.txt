WOW. One of the best movies I've ever seen EVER - EVER. <br /> <br /> Absolutely Loved It! I was stuck to the screen before I started my introductory credits. It's a Sci-Fi thriller - and the edge of your seat Whodunnit. Incredibly. <br /> <br /> I wish it never ended. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is an attacker. Everyone could play. Actor actor, Jeremy Northram, was a perfect predatory guy. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, who loved war games, sneakers and track down. <br /> <br /> Incredible! <br /> <br /> 8-22-06.
