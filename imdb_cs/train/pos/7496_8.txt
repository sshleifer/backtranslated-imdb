<br /> <br /> I'm having trouble commenting on other reviewers for the simple reason that it's MYSTERY FILM, not supernatural! It is not the only film that has a seemingly "supernatural" explanation ("vampires"), but it turns out to be very unique. Other films that come to mind are Edgar Wallace's Before Dawn and Mark of the Vampire. The film makes WONDERFUL work to create a very "spooky atmosphere" like DRACULA when Renfield meets Counter on his staircase Castle, or MARK OF THE VAMPIRE when two people look over the castle ruins window and see the corpse playing the organ while Luna descends with the wings! VERY SUPERREAL! <br /> <br /> If you like (often silent ) atmospheric touch, this film is MUST! Norm Vogel
