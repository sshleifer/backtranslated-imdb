The Internet database lists this as a TV show. And yes, it was a series on MTV that appeared on the Oddities program, after "The Head" and before "Aeon Flux", if I remember correctly. The version I watched this time was the VHS tape with all the episodes that hide together in the movie without unpleasant credit between them or have to wait a week in the next fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> You have a story of Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone. Maxx is a superhero or bum, Julie Social Worker or Queen of the Leopards, Sarah girl who should listen less The Smiths and Mr. Gone a guy who does not seem to be holding his head. And then there's another strange creature ... I'm using "or" with Maxx and Julia because part of the fun is trying to find out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams. Perhaps they are real or dreams. Maybe one of the characters does not exist. Perhaps there is only one and dreams about others. You will have to wait and find out. <br /> <br /> Comics came out before the show and it was one of my favorites. The artwork was magnificent and the story was original - unlike anything you find in Superman or Batman. It will bend your mind, and has strong adult subtexts without being obscene or insulting. And the show used essentially the same precise artwork (only now moving) and the same story ... ensuring that the beauty that is actually in the comic book is faithfully reproduced. It was the best show that appeared on "Oddities", hands down. If you like a comic book of darker nature or you need a good trip of mind, it's a sample you can see. It's "Donnie Darko" before it's been such a thing. The most interesting thing is that it never happened to another movie or television, but I do not say disappointment. Because it's simple, it sealed it in gold and let it get rid of the blemishes caused by subsequent failures.
