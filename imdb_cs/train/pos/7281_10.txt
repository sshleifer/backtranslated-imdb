For the first time, I saw this movie at a local station on Sunday afternoon horror performance back in 1969 or 1970. Uncut. I was just a little boy at the time, but I loved him and he was not that afraid. I thought it was so cool and very original. When I was thinking, I am still surprised that it was shown during the day when the TV was not uncut in those years. I've been looking for this movie ever since, I've seen it over and over, and I've always loved it. One would think John Waters would adore this movie. It must be not only a haunting film, but one of the most exuberant, most strenuous films ever made. And, surprisingly, you have not heard of it, like having a cult, for a movie like "Blood Feast" or "The Hills Have Eyes" that you have gained over the years. It has culture, but in my opinion it really should become a classic cult. As far as I know, it came out a bit before the Blood Feast, which is probably one of the first real "gore" films. In fact, this film contains the elements of Hershell Gordon Lewis And a little Russ Meyer tossed into a good scale. Anyway, I recommend it to anyone who likes the horror, petting, black and white horror films of the early 1960s (I think the date at the end of 1960).
