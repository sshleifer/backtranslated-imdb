My personal feeling is that you can not divorce from his political / historical backgrounds, as is the case with many US reviewers. It's not about adolescence on Main Street in the US. It is growing in Yugoslavia when it was split between East and West. Just as boys are torn between Ester and everyone else, Esther is torn between "Tovarish Joe" and boys. There is shame in certain situations that are lost to audiences that have never been in Tito. I feel the movie is undervalued and it's bad that we lost the director. Such films make freedom more important. It's not just "another East European approach to the age of the film" ... it's a sensitive display of teenagers who walk on a fine line that could eventually lead to real freedom.
