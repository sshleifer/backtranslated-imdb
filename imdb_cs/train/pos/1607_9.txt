As somebody else said, every scene in this movie is a gem. Most movies are lucky to have one scene that is perfect, but director Jewison has always struck home. Occupation gained a great script and, moreover, Dick Hyman's music settings for opera and other music have become perfect. It's hard to imagine how they maintain the exact mood that's going on after a long film production. Comedy is soft (mostly) and camera work reflects every little emotional plot of narration. Cher is such a natural comedy, Vincent Gardenia (who I know mostly through his role as Frank Lorenzo in All in the Family, Until I've seen him in this and then out of Broadway in the 1980s) deserves a much larger star than ever before and Aiello's unfortunate defeats are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to getting into this huge cast. Has anyone written about this movie by Jewison? <br /> <br /> I would like to read it. It's hard to find out why the average rating in IMDb is so low ...
