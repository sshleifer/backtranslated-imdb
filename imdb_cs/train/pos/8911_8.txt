I've seen The Blob several times, and it's one of the better low-budget alien invasions of films from the 1950s. A strange meteor landed near a small town, and the older man is investigating. A peculiar substance like jelly joins one of his arms and a young couple who saw that the meteoric plot arrives in time and takes him to a local doctor where the old man is completely absorbed by the meat. The doctor and his nurse are other victims and the masses are increasing. When these incidents are reported to the police, they do not trust the young couple and blame them for doing everything. Eventually, he believes them when a huge mass mask appears in the town hall and everyone goes out into the streets and screams. Then he joins the inn with a young couple and others inside. Blob stops by spraying the load with fire extinguishers and freezes, which is its weakness. It is then transported to the frozen waste in the Arctic and disposed of there. But it's just frozen, not dead ... This film has a typical setting for its season: a teenager and a small town. Blob has a great melodic rock composition at the beginning and the film is atmospheric throughout. Continue, beware! Blob followed in 1972 and remake came in 1988, but it's the best of The Blob. Cast is led by Steve McQueen (The Great Escape) and is a movie that made him a star and Aneta Corsaut plays his girlfriend. I'm not familiar with any of the other stars. <br /> <br /> Blob is a must for all sci-fi fans. Fantastic. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 stars of 5.
