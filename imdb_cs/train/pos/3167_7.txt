It is one of the films that explore the cultural clash of Eastern people in Western cultures. <br /> <br /> Loving Tokyo's time is a sad film about the inability to attract opposites due to great cultural differences. Ken, a rock n'roll fanatic, married Kyoto, a Japanese girl, to stay in the United States when her visa expires. Marriage is expected to be only temporary, that is, until Kyoto regains legal status. But Ken, who seems to be lost in all relationships, likes Kyoto very much and tries to solve things. This, though his friend calls for the Kyoto to be dumped and to get rid of all the obligations to the girls, is bad for rock n 'roll, besides inspiring a song about how broken heart and all that. But Kyoto comes from a strict traditional Japanese education and does not expect her to be married to Ken for so long. Not only is he at home and wants to return to Japan. It's sad that it's finally someone Ken thinks he can love and be with, and all except one that thinks he found someone who would feel like that girl does not expect to be that long . It's not like she does not like Ken, it's just that she's used to life. He says, "I can not tell him how I feel in English, and Ken can not tell me how he feels in Japanese." It's a rather sad love story with a murderous 80s techno-nintendo soundtrack. I picked up Loving on Tokyo Time because he reminded me of one of my 80s favorite Tokyo Pop movies. And for those of you who love love in Tokyo time, look for Tokyo Pop (a New York singer goes to Japan and joins the Japanese cover band), except that it's a happy ending movie. <br /> <br />
