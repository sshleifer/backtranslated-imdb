I thought it was a great movie for children aged 6-12. A little poor, but the story is uplifting fresh. It proves that the adolescent's dreams can actually be fulfilled. I think it's a great story for every kid who feels down, or he feels like trying to juggle too many things between them. Very "cute" movie. Bravo.
