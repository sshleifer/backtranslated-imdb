Sure, history in this movie was "Hollywoodized" - but it is by no means the only piece of history transcribed for the masses. Lafitte stood up against the Americans because he considered himself a Frenchman and therefore hated the British, not because of the feeling of patriotism for the nation that had taken over New Orleans shortly; broke his agreement and returned to smuggling, which made his voyage to Galveston; he was rather a petty criminal and a villain than a hero or a joker. But who cares? It's a very funny film - and face-to-face, we all wanted Jean to be more like a gay girl than a governor's daughter. Brynner again rises above average writing to gain fascinating performance.
