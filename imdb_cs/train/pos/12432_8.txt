I expected it to be the same kind of lock as Modesta Blaise's previous movie, so I left it for so long, but I was very pleasantly surprised. stupid weapons and car / boat chases, it was a pretty thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl becomes as hard as a nail because nothing is overestimated or excessively rationalized. It is likely that the budget constraint has actually helped: less time and effort was spent on finding increasingly stupid ways to pretend that men are dying for stunt games and is more committed to watching the movie. Hell, the biggest gun battle takes place outside of the screen - and the scene where it is heard is even better for this background noise, which increases the tension - who wins? Who dies? Alexandra Staden may not be as beautiful as Monica Vitti, but she is not, and she certainly has every class and fire that is needed to make her character - and the shape of her face, her hair and her high, slender body could be lifted directly from the graphics of the comic strips. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau was the perfect choice for Blaise's bad guy. that he made the characters interesting and entertaining to observe - even sympathetic (and I doubt I would think I would have taken many brutal, psychopathic murderers as drinking friends). I can not think of one of the "former waiters" in Hollywood who could go into this role. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Blaise baddies are always dying (they're not spoilers!) That's a really good thing, because all the girls who would spend their time to get rid of such a disgustingly nice and interesting piece are now they can pragmatically deal with our common Joes.
