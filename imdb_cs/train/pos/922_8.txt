At least half an hour a week. I'm not interested in anything about large 3 networks (ABC / CBS / NBC) in years. All lions are interesting, although Larry can sometimes bother. I really like the action figures of the Middle Earth that they bring with Hunter. Most other characters are also interesting. Sights of Siegfried and Roy are occasionally fun. Animation is top-notch and definitely the best CG that was made on a weekly TV show. Usually, when they find big names to play at the show, they try to hide a bad script or characters. But this is not entirely true in this show, though: There are several characters that were weak and improved by voice acting, but overall the characters stand in their own right. <br /> <br /> This is definitely 16 or more. There is nothing that most of the children would have heard before, and most of the jokes would probably just lie across the head. He's certainly not as rude and nervous as South Park, but he's bringing the same "Bash." One example is that he makes fun both Dick Cheney and Barbara Streisand in one episode. <br /> <br /> Father of Pride and other Dreamworks productions like Shrek also feel like the spiritual successors Animaniacs, Pinky and Brain and Freakazoid. It's the same kind of humor he has grown up. Maybe it's not as funny as Spielberg's classic television series, but it's still good. I hope this season will finish well and will be renewed for future seasons. Otherwise, I may never find a reason to watch the big 3 again.
