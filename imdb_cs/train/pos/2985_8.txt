The aim of this film, one of the oldest and best international colorful editions of the film opera, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And he did it admirably. The general public should not sit for the love story of two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if they played a typical 300 pounds over 40 tenors and soprano with voice equipment to properly sing the famous music. This results in the visual representation of beautiful directors (young Loren, pretty Della Marra and Mrs. Maxwell), who make the story much more believable, giving those who are not familiar with history or music a greater chance of being beautiful arias that would otherwise not be. A totally charming introduction to one of Verdi's great songs. I remember seeing myself when I was in high school, and I certainly woke up my interest in the opera, a form I was not familiar with at the time. I still consider this film to be a love and I highly recommend to those who can appreciate great music accompanied by a better than average visual. Luciano Della Marra was exceptional as Radames, and unfortunately he did not appear in any other movie for the audience.
