Indignation is a pretty good movie! Robert Culp was very good in the movie and was perfect for this part! It's hard to believe it's true, but what can you do? When I watched this, I thought why she had to do all that stuff. It's not right, but they learned their lesson when they were picking a bad man! Anyway, if you've ever seen this movie on TV, watch it because it's good!
