Paul (Jason Lee) is a subordinate who happens to be engaged to type A by a princess named Karen (Selma Blair). He chooses clothes and daily schedule. At his party, Pavel took a bit of a drink and eventually ended up with a pretty dancer called Becky (Julia Stiles) back to his kicks. "Nothing Happened", they say, but the duo wakes up on the same bed. Suddenly Karen phones. He is on his way to Paul's apartment. Paul will understand that Becky pulls out of the place, even though her lower pants remain. But there is even more fun. At a family dinner in Karen's parents, Paul went back to Becky and discovered that he was Karen's cousin. Talk about what explains what to do! But instead, Paul decides to pretend to be a stomach problem and hides himself in the bathroom. Will Karen ever find out that Becky spent the night at Paul's house? And what are the consequences? I apologize for the critics of the movies as such. They should definitely brighten because this film is fresh and fun. Of course it will not hurt Lee is a perfect humorous man, Stiles is a charming beauty or that Blair is natural as a pretty but anal fianc√©e. The rest of the cast, including James Brolin and Juliet Haggerty, is also quite nice. The movie looks great, just like the costumes and the California environment. Best of all, the script is imaginative and inspired and creates great ridicule for the audience. In short, if you want to scare the proverbial funnybones, get this movie tonight. It does not have to be an Oscar material, but it's sure to turn the bad day into a good one.
