I would be evaluating a series of perfect 10 for an excellent and consistently high quality story and character development if it was not for the last episode of season 10! <br /> <br /> The final episode of the 10th year of "Unbound," where (surely it would seem) that Asgard was murdered in a very gloomy, unconvincing and very insurmountable way, left me incredulous! <br /> <br /> From the extremely hurrying end of the series, it's obvious that many arc stories were originally scheduled for at least another season. I think these stories quickly accelerated to build the Stargate SG-1 franchise for two upcoming moves right on DVD! If Asgard does not return to the future SG-1 movie (with a very good explanation of "seeming" extinction), I think fans have been cheated by a bad clearance of free ends! The bad end of the otherwise brilliant science fiction series.
