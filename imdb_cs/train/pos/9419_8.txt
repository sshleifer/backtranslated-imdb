This Alec Guinness starrer is a very good fun political satire of the corporate industry and a light eccentric study of character. <br /> <br /> Pacing is a little slow for comedy and none of them are really war-on-floor funny types except the possible sound effects for experiments. But she has fun moments and is very skillful in her realization. Segments of large explosions are probably the most important. <br /> <br /> The individual procedures are pretty droll, very much like I ALL RIGHT JACK; especially a female socialist with a light romantic mood on Guinness's character. Political machinations really carry the story. Ernest Thesigner is very remarkable as heavy. I do not think this works just as well as LADYKILLERS, SCIENTIFIC HARDS AND CROWNS; but the light comedy Ealing is better than nothing.
