This film shows life in northern Cameroon from the point of view of France's young French girl Dalens, whose father is an official of the colonial (French) government and whose family is one of the few white families in the neighborhood. This gives a sense of how life was for both the colonists and the natives with whom they have come together. It is a sense that is consistent with the next film I saw about Africa in a similar period of time (Nirgendwo in Africa (2001)), but I have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is. It's not just an impression - things happen in the movie - but the plot is underestimated. The viewer is allowed to draw his own conclusions rather than the filmmakers being forced to do so, although the framing of the story as a glimpse of the visit of a woman in Southwest Cameroon as an adult provides a certain perspective.
