Using an old story collection is a challenge for the production team to see how this classic character can be updated and interesting enough to capture a new audience while remembering its former audience. In my opinion, their mission has been completed. It must be seen for small children, for teens, for teens and for parents. OK is a couple of creepy moments that are solved in a short order, but parents with little children should sit tight, the film moves to better things. I'm going with those obvious reviewers of users who point out that Emma Roberts provides us with a positive model for young women, not even about her. Nancy balances her femininity with the professional skills that help her. Here he likes a lot, laughs, does not prepare too seriously, is a real secret that can be solved (one you can imagine as a bonus and nature of nature). Nancy Drew is, in my opinion, even suited.
