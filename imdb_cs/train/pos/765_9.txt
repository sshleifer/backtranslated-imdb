I think that when "Beat Street" became a nationwide model, "Flashdance" came at the same time. The problem with "Flashdance" is that there was only one break dance scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet. That was one of the reasons why "Beat Street" was better. The only film that could compete with "Beat Street" appears to be "Footloose," because both films focused on how people used dance to express their supreme feelings. Dance scenes at "Beat Street" come just before the environment and at the end of the movie. And I loved them all. Almost all the tricks appeared in the pit scenes: jackhammer, flare, head turning, suicide, crazy legs, lethal, front flip, figure four - almost everything. /> <br /> Like The Warriors, "Beat Street" has violence linked to gang life in the hip hop world ... but much less violently than the former. The only major battle scenario in "Beat Street" was when graffiti artist Ramon (who cut short in the movie as "Ramo") is being pursued by a rival gang member on New York City subway stations ..... to fight each other on the third rails and both die of electricity on this rails. Though this chase scene ended tragically, it would be better if they died in this way than to explode blood from a gang shot. Most of the gangs in the movie were graffiti related to hip-hop culture and rap music. There was a lot of rap music in the movie because hip-hop members used rap music as a departure from the negative aspects of gang life. Even the dance song of the movie that closed the film curtain was not only a tribute to hip-hop culture - it was also a homage to Ramon's death. , during a dance scene called "Tango, Tango," I assume that the female drummer in the jam orchestra led by actress Rae Dawn Chong was Sheila E., who appeared in a portrait.
