The American in Paris is a Gene Kelly show. Watch Gene sing, act and dance in Paris in many situations. Some purely majestic, other pure corn. One can imagine what Kelly was doing when he shot this film just a year before Singin In The Rain. He is definitely one of the greatest giants. It is interesting to look at the parallels between these two films, especially in Kelly's characters, the only major difference is that one is located in Paris and the other in LA. Some said that actress Leslie Caron was less than pure. Maybe Cyd Charisse, who was originally assigned to this role, could do better, but Caron is very credible in this role and is acting with Kelly. Oscar Levant's short role in this film gave him what he needed, someone who did not look like Gene Kelly. Fulfilling a role as a person is not an easy task, yet the Levant did it with a class like any other lead. Song and dance routines are all perfection. Even the excessive ballet at the end of the film makes him a better film than without him. When they saw that there was really little time on the screen to make such a loving relationship plausible, Minnelli used this sequence to make it look like you were spending four hours with them. Ingenious! <br /> <br /> I have to rate this movie with Singin because it is very similar to a story and a song. Singin would barely get a nod for Debbie Reynolds uplifting performance. <br /> <br /> Full recommendation. <br /> <br /> 8/10 stars.
