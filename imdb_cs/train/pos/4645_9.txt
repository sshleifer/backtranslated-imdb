This movie is very interesting. I've seen it twice and it seems Glover has hit the nail on his head by saying he wants to achieve it. I can relate to the horror that the filmmaker clearly expresses against the current ruthless corruption that is a storm in every media center, and things that we as a culture can not "think" about corporate media control. The indignation that Glover expresses through "outrageous" elements in films is clear in his visceral aggression and beautiful in his poetic power. I'm glad to see this movie and it's even clearer that Glover is something interesting with the second part of what the trilogy will be. It's alright! EVERYTHING IS ALRIGHT. See also this. People who reject this film as "hopeless" or "demanding" really miss a boat. These are intelligent movies. If you can see him with his live show he shows up with his books, he is also very upset. The way you get into his thinking is really something. You will have experience!
