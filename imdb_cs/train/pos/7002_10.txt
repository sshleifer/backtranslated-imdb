Will Smith once again brings in a movie about a man with mass of the world on his shoulders and his crusade to rightly scream to touch even the toughest hearts! Writer Grant Nieporte and Italian director Gabriele Muccino gather and create a masterpiece that I highly recommend to buy and maintain in my collection of movies because you will never get tired of watching / watching this movie! I have the Supreme Respect for Will Smith because he is not just a great actor, but one can say he has a real love for people and life, which undoubtedly made him perfect for the character (IRS agent Ben Thomas) he played in this film. You've found yourself feeling pain and anger, frustration over his love for Emily played by Rosario Dawson, who by the way was Fantastic as usual. I began to fall in love with the fact that their characters fell in love. Woody Harrelson also stars in this Top Notch movie. I think it's very difficult to write this review without giving away key points ... All I can say is, Watch it and when you make sure you have nothing to interrupt, pull the phone out of the hook, sit down and get ready to start trying to unveil the mysterious life and the past of IRS Ben Thomson ... Thank you Will Smith for another great movie !!!
