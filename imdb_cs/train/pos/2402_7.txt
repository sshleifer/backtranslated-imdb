The main reason to see this movie is Warren William, who is in prime shape as the shyster campaign manager. He is electric, he is constantly looking for ways to deceive the public and defeat the enemy in the midst of the greatest disasters. William is a great actor - I feel he never got to. Bette Davis as his girlfriend also shines in a signed role. Personally, I discovered that Guy Kibbee is not quite right as a candidate candidate William and others are trying to find in public. He looked more like an empty canvas than a man. I'd rather have a real figure rather than a headache. The story itself is unlikely, stupid and clich√©. But Warren William and Bette Davis are worth watching.
