I was a bit small for you, but I had to see it. There is some excellent music that many people mentioned, but no one seems to notice the very rare appearance of "Angel," which is mostly ignored, but a rather popular musical outfit. He wears the white clothes in the trademark, sifting through "20th Century Tickets," and everyone seems to be trying to penetrate the camera's field of view. The Gregg Giuffria keypad remains highlighted and never seems to hit the collision! Cherie Currie (former Runaways singer) begins here with a short but remarkable acting career and is quite memorable next to Jodie Foster and the rest. (Their topless 3-D scenes in "Parazite," and her UFO observation, "wavelength" all kept us for a while). <br /> <br /> It is not a masterpiece, but it retains a piece of its period so that everyone can look and wonder.
