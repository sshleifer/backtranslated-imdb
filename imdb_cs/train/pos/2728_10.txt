Simply one of the best! The adaptation of Roman Truman Capote's novel of novel literature by Richard Brooks is a truly artistic achievement. Stunning black and white cinematography (which was to win Oscar), Quincy Jones' spooky score, and the great performance of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as special murderers. This film was an Oscar in the 0-for-4 category and was not nominated for the best shot, while Doolittle was. Go find out! <br /> <br /> Although you are familiar with Clutter's family as well as with the book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and the pain-staking process of tracking these guys down. John Forsythe is also impressive as Alvin Dewey. There are no defects in this one. 10 out of 10. Best Performance = Scott Wilson with R. Blake in second place. Highly recommended!
