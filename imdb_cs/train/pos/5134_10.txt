This short was nominated for Oscar and I wish he won! Essentially jam movies among very talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, music is incredible! Hollywood quite often embraces Jazz (especially animation, believe it or not), but it is a rare sight of the improvised jam movie. It has been added to the preservation list and deservedly. TCM regularly performs and triggers it every March for his "31-Day Oscars" tribute. From the center on the buzzer, the swing, nothing but pure and the shot is so smooth, the net was moving. Most fixed and highly recommended !!!
