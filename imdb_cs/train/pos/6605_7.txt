2054. Paris is a drawing of Escher with people and vehicles that pass through several levels, in a clear honor to Fritz Lang's metropolis. Paris is both ultramodern and decays. And when the survey was launched, a young medical researcher kidnapped just after leaving her sister in an inconspicuous nightclub. The harsh police captain is investigating. Clear black and white, with gloomy corridors, shadow aisles and one-time illumination that are characteristic of the toughest noir films, are unavoidable to compare with Sin City. But the story owes more to Masamune Shirow and William Gibson than Frank Miller, as high-tech tracking, almost invisible masks and ruthless super-corporations are just as part of landscape as weapons and cars. The film never creates the atmosphere of Gibson's cyberpunk, which is loaded with mysteries, with technically challenging edge characters who meet industrial types from corporations that seem to have their own Ministry of Fear, but the viewer certainly has a sense that the future Paris is no utopia and future science is less than benevolent. And as the police procedural boundaries unfold, we get into the darker corners of each ambition under the glossy veneer of a cultured PR image by Avalon. The motion capture process used here creates a view somewhere between the B & W comic book and the next generation rotoscopic device and is either charming or distracting depending on your taste. Yet there is a great visual sense here and the future Paris is filled with tiny details, so the picture has a unique look that is again Spartan and Baroque. It's worth a look.
