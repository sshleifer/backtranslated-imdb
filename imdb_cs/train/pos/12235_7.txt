"The Incredible Melting Man" is a fantastic gross, spooky and energetic Z-type production that every self-realizing cam-horror freak just needs to see for himself! The ideal way to describe this low-budget gem is as an infallious copy of "The Quatermass Xperiment" Hammer ... just a thousand times dirtier! Astronaut Steve West is the only one who has survived a disastrous space mission but is carrying a terrible disease that makes it radioactive and ... causes it to melt! In shock, seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve jumped out of the hospital, left a trail of sticky pus, and fell from the body behind him. Doctor Ted Nelson urgently finds him because Steve has also become sick with an insatiable taste for the human body. The premise may sound totally stupid, but this movie is incredibly fun and contains great makeup effects from Rika Baker's hand. The melting face of the face looks like a rotting pizza and heavy breathing makes it sound like Darth Vader! Another great advantage is that the script William Sachs does not waste time on boring scientific explanations or emotional expressions. Reflection begins immediately and lasts until the last moment of the film. Just enjoy this stupid horror gem and try to turn off your brain activity as much as possible, because if you start thinking about the many stupidity in the script, you will miss all the fun!
