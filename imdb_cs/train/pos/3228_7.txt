David Webb Peoples meets Paul Anderson ... if it sounds weird, then you're right, because that's it. People are familiar with their scenarios with the moral consequences of what is right and wrong, the value of life, etc. Bladerunner, Unforgiven, and in all his scenarios, these things have been dealt with. <br /> <br /> The first successful film by Paul Anderson was a violent thriller. No wonder all of his other movies are so! And here is a violent thriller with moral consequences! <br /> <br /> The Peoples' scenario is pretty obvious in the first half of the movie. Soldiers have been practicing since birth, learning to kill, and never having a normal life. They are replaced by better, genetically modified soldiers and Todd, one of the original soldiers, is left on the planet and left dead. There they have to deal with a group of refugees, some want others to hate it and there's an interesting drama. But then ... <br /> <br /> ... The missiles begin to fly as new soldiers move to the planet for military exercises and try to kill all people. There is a great, violent and loud action, and the folk style becomes Anderson's action fest. It is hard to believe that this scenario was originally written in this way, but the final product is better than I expected. Fun, somewhat, though certainly not too much, thoughtful and exciting once the action starts. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated: lots of violence
