I say that no matter how hard I try, I will never find a better movie version of "Othella". If you love Kenneth Branagh's masterpiece masterpieces, "Much Get Rich" (1993) and "Hamlet" (1996) as well as I'm sure you will also find Oliver Parker's "Othello" irresistible. Laurence Fishburne has worked in various wonderful roles throughout her career. It was absolutely amazing at "Boys in the Hood" (1991) - I always considered his entertaining role as Furious Styles for his very great success. It was, of course, the way I saw it. He plays the role of Othello and is probably the most demanding of his entire career, but he does a great, fantastic job. Ir√®ne Jacob is absolutely fascinating Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh is simply phenomenal in the most fascinating role of the story being crooked, manipulating villain Iago. The awesome "Othello" is part of the absolute elite of Shakespeare's brilliant works. It deals with his favorite themes: curvature, envy, scam and jealousy. This film adaptation is certainly one of the best movies I've ever seen, based on William Shakespeare's plays.
