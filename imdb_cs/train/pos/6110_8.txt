Like "My Sassy Girl," this film is based on a true story from the Internet, but that's where the similarity ends. The story is generally about this rebellious guy named Kwon Sang Woo, who is still trying to finish a high school whose parents hire a teacher named Su-Wan (Kim Ha Neul), a woman who comes from a poor environment but becomes the same age as he. Add some obstacles, martial arts (criminals are always after Ji-Hoon for revenge), the scornful, crazy girl who is after him, his tendency to exhaust lessons and you can generally guess the whole story. Did I mention that it was a romantic comedy? This film has some good fighting scenes, great visual humor, and a lot of courage, thanks to good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo, which bring a lot of energy to the story. Romantic elements also work for this reason. And I have to say that I would like to have a friend more like Kim Ha Nuel than the girl from "My Sassy Girl" (at least personally). She has some daring, but it's rather a cute, sweet and good-hearted way. The characters are mostly enjoyable (so it could be said that it has fewer hills on the climb than "My Sassy Girl" - the obstacle that worked for this movie) and the film is quite smart and interesting most of the way. The story of the species converges, although about two-thirds of the way (where it runs on a familiar, standard fare where nothing really is interesting), but near the end it again rises a bit. Overall, it's a fun, cute movie. 8/10
