I love this movie. It is well written and acting and has good cinematography. The story combines action, humor, mystique and tenderness with great assemblies and beautiful excursions. Take a look, buy it, show it to your friends. Acting is good and Murphy is doing a great job showing a reluctant / unlikely hero. I liked all the characters and found them interesting and well-developed with dynamic interactions. I cared for what happened to these people, and while the outcome was quite predictable (good guys win, a wonderfully attractive girl and a holy child saves lives - who can not see it?), Yet it was happy for me to end up well worked. Thank God that this dignity of the film has never been destroyed with a miserable sequel. Grab a little popcorn, cuddle on the couch and watch this fun, happy and fun movie.
