As a filmmaker, I had to buy a film poster for this film, which I must have been the best when I finally saw it. There's nothing more attractive on your wall than a 27x41-inch picture of a melting man. However, nothing more than your video recorder is nothing more than an hour and a half long image of the melting man. Initially, I thought this movie was pure waste, but then I realized it had some features that made me laugh. The character of Doctor Ted Nelson must be the most friend-ever person ever brought to the big screen. His dialogue is so spectacular that it's incredible! ("It's incredible! It seems that it's getting stronger when it melts!) And could anyone tell me how the hell they know how much time Steve left before he's completely torn and exactly what their plan is" to help him? If this movie was to scare your audience, I think it missed his call.
