I'm not great at writing reviews, so I'll just guess my opinions ... <br /> <br /> I first liked this series. Adventure, action, comedy, drama ... I thought it was all great. Anderson, Tapping, Shanks, Judge, Davis ... I loved them all. Davis seemed to be the fifth most important person in the cast. It's not a big deal. But when his character (General Hammond) left at the end of the seventh season and the Anderson character (Colonel O'Neill) moved from the field to the office, the quality of the series suddenly fell from the cliff. I do not know if it was because Hammond was more important than I realized or what, but for some reason, after the seventh season the series changed to ****. The first seven seasons, although they were amazing. The Stargate movie seemed to me average for the first time I saw it, but it turned out that although it was not the original intention, the brilliant setting for the show. I recommend that you first watch the movie, then watch the first season of the TV series, then watch the movie again (you'll have another thanks a second time, believe me) and then you look at the rest of the TV series. The last three series are not as good as the first seven, but that does not mean they are not good. It simply means that it's a disappointment if you get spoiled in the first seven seasons. After completing this series, make sure you watch that is reflected in Stargate: Atlantis. He is a dignified successor to this brilliant series. EDIT on 7-18-08: I just discovered that Don S. Davis died a few weeks ago. It's a big loss.
