I've heard good things in this movie. I came out of being neither incredible nor disappointed. Simon Pegg plays a childish figure similar to other films. There and there a few laughs - nothing so funny. Probably my favorite parts of the movie are when they dance on the club scene. I have to try it out the next time I find myself in the club. A few stars here and there, including: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, the girl from X-Files and Jeff Bridges. I was quite fun when I saw Thandie Newton appear on the scene. She of course was in the previous movie with Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run. I see it as a quarrel, either enjoy it to a large extent or find it rather boring. Maybe I add that Kirsten Dunst is adorable in this movie. : 3
