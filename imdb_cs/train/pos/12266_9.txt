Imagine that I was preparing this big cultural event on Swedish TV last night, and that was just because my girlfriend insisted on keeping the television (to make it easier for her to sleep) That I came across it but he obviously forgot about it and enjoyed the "early night" ...). Anyway - surely it must be a rather unusual idea - to base the documentary on the interview with the sound more than 30 years ago. But with animated and other documentary film it adds to a really good and convincing portrait of one of the most important literary artists of the 20th century - Georges Remy aka Hergé. <br /> <br /> I'm sure to read my Tintin albums with a different look when you saw this movie, making it easier to link variations of style and content to different periods in Hergé's life (and I can tell you that I will soon have a couple, which I do not have). Of course, my perception of the album has changed for over 25 years, which I have already read, as well as my opinion of what albums my favorite is but adds (at least) one more dimension.
