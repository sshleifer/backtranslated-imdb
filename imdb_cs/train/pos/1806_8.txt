I wish the children were still filming; dark and deep. There was (get it) the evolution of the character (and Charlie is the embodiment of the dynamic character), conspiracy development, excellent animation, emotional engagement and a rational, relatable, and consistent theme. If not for a handful of singing and dancing routines, you would never think it was a kid's movie and that's why I gave her such a high rating. This movie is a great movie, let alone a children's film. Which brings me to my second point: this must be the darkest "children" movie I've seen long ago, this comes from the age of 22. I would be shocked to see a child under the age of 8 who would not be completely frightened during much of the second half and some of the first half of the film and it all ends with one of the saddest endings (but "Jurassic Bark" for those of you who are fans of "Futurama"), and that's what makes this movie so good. Just because the movie evokes the emotions that we normally do not feel, and we assume that they are bad, the film itself is not bad; in fact it means that it has succeeded. Good funny movies make us laugh; Good horror films are about to make us afraid; good sad movies should be sad. My point is that good movies should be MOVING you, not just having fun; this movie has moved me. <br /> <br /> This film is incredibly violent in accordance with today's children's film standards and contains an object that may not be suitable for some children according to current standards. Parents, I think it's the first one. Usually I'm not talking about such things, but I saw it yesterday, and it was even a surprise to me.
