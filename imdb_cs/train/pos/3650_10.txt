Sometimes Lady Luck smiles at me. I originally shot - and copied - VHS video tape of this wonderful TV show. I was broken by my heart when I realized what I had done since I could not get his copy elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I recently signed up for a digital cable and when searching for upcoming movies, the surprise was the scheduled broadcast of the movie. This time, I made a copy of the DVD, so I have no chance to repeat my mistake. Finally, after eight years, I looked again and it was as exciting and tense as I saw it for the first time. There is a little prelude to this story that my first contact with "Pandora's Clock" came with a live reading of a book on public radio. I just got tired at the station on the way home for lunch, and from the first installment I was addicted. Every day I waited expecting to read another chapter. When I learned a few months later that the book would be televised as a movie, I made sure a plan for this event. <br /> <br /> First, I would like to say that the film was very true to the book, unlike what another reviewer said. This in itself is a rare success for television shows. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I agree with others about casting. I could not imagine a better choice for Captain Holland than Richard Dean Anderson. Literally, the film could crash and burn without proper cast for this crucial role. Anderson has never been better and it's a shame we have not seen more about him yet. In fact, all the cast members did a great job. My only complaint about the film - and the book - was the interference of a "terrorist conspiracy" to get rid of a private corporate airplane air-to-air missile and have a pilot stub and shoot down a hit airplane. Basically, we're talking less than 36 hours to organize and implement a plan like this and people, which is totally unrealistic to all the players involved. Also unrealistic was how few aircraft were affected by having the first one, then two of its engines were blown away. This beef was aside, I enjoyed the tension of the building and it was found out that it is very plausible how the reactions of foreign governments were depicted in the movie, just like ours. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this movie, do it by all means.
