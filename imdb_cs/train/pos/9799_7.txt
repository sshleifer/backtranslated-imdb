Pleasant animated movie Batman. Unmatched with "Return of the Joker" or "Mask Phantasm" but still solid. I liked the way you kept the film that you were arguing about who the Batwoman was. It was a pretty twist. Nice action sequences. I've always been convinced that Batman cartoons are better than any pious sequel to Batman's action movie sequel. The trend continues here. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10
