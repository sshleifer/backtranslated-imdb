"Ah Ritchie made another dive movie with Statham," he thought, averaging a fan and expecting another Snatch / Lock Stock; he waited maybe a couple of time shifts, but no one too heavy for "me and the guys" to swallow after a few beers. <br /> <br /> Be careful, you need to watch this movie. No cups of tea, no more dietetic coca from the counter, no "constantly running" screams when you crash into the fridge - watch the movie! No laughs than the ones you can do for a lot of violence (and if it's your sailing boat, that's it), but a sharp solid direction, excellent dialogue and great performances. <br /> <br /> My favorite - The Big Pussy by The Sopranos, always a reliable hood.
