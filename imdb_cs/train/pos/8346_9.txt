I just watched I Q. tonight and I forgot how much I love this movie. It is amazingly fun and leaves the feeling that everything is right with the world. I like allusions to Mozart all the time since I started with "Einstein" playing "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" on the violin to him buzzing Eine Kleine Nachtmusik during IQ testing by Ed Walters. I love the fact that the woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career, especially the unique situation for the 1950s when the film is set. (I myself was a teacher, but stayed home to resurrect my children, so please do not think I'm a brave female libber.) It's amazing how an "just oily monkey" is important and good as Catherine's fiancee , research on clinical behavior. My message is that we are not what we are doing, but who we are is much more defined - no sign. There are so many small gag and disposable inserts that are almost thrown out if you do not look and do not listen. <br /> <br /> I did a few things in a movie that is not listed on the goofs page. In the scene where Ed Walters has to talk to the symposium, there are 3 instruments (protractor, ruler, etc.) that hangs to the right of the chalk strip. In the next video from the camera, it's only 2. In the snapshot of our video, he portrays Tony Shaloub's character as Bob Watters, not Bob Rosetti, as he introduces himself in the movie and is featured on Imdbu. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. In some estimates, it can be a little fuzzy, but it has far more stuff than many give it up. Not just what is gathered here. Watch it and enjoy it!
