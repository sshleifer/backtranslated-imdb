I do not make 10 stars easily. The film really impresses me and The Bourne Ultimatum is far behind. Next, this trilogy merged so nicely that I believe it's one of the biggest film trilogies of our time. Although all three films could not differ from Ludlum's novels, they still stand as a strong landmark in cinematographic success. Bourne Ultimatum made me cry that the series was complete, but I could not even try to stop smiling for hours. From the moment the initial title appeared, I knew the ride. Paul Greengrass did it again. Everything we love from Bourne's previous films is here again: action, dialogue and, of course, unsettled camera. But it was never a problem for me. I think it contributes to tension. <br /> <br /> I'm returning to the fact that this movie appeared several times before it was released on DVD, simply because it's brilliant. It is a totally satisfactory conclusion and should be a test of time as a fantastic film and a completely unforgettable trilogy.
