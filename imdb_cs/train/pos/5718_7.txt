I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I first bought the tickets and then checked the IMDb reviews. I'm afraid I see a bad movie. Well, I enjoyed watching the movie. Some parts that were terribly frightening were pretty humorous, almost like the Buffy Vampire Slayer. I do not see it as a bad movie. It's not even a great movie. Just a little good horror movie. It does not rely on special effects but about camera angles, gaming, music. In my opinion, acting was all right. Sarah did a very good job, absolutely convincing. Other actors are certainly not bad, I like Yoko. The sets are nice (and I do not care that the files are exactly those that were used in the Japanese original). <br /> <br /> Scary moments were often predictable. But not always. I saw a lot of horror and did not expect to be afraid now, but it happened at least twice. Nice. The film had some pretty scenes that were almost original, such as trash trails, simple special effects for spirits, boy's eyes, a cat that made noisy sounds, wailing from a dead boy and his mother. Do not go if you want to see Sarah in another episode of Buffy, because she's very different from Buffy's job, much more serious. Do not go unless you want to see only the films that collect Oscar nominations. It's a good horror movie, plenty of tension. I gave her 7.
