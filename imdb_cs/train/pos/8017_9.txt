Mummers: Jim Henson as Kermit, Rowlf, Dr.Teeth Chef, Waldorf, Ernie and others. <br /> <br /> Richard Hunt as Scooter, Janice, Statler, and Beaker. <br /> <br /> Frank Oz as Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, Animal, Bert, Cookie Monster and Sam Eagle. <br /> <br /> Jerry Nelson as Camilla, Floyd Pepper, Lew Zealand, Crazy Harry and Pops. <br /> <br /> Dave Goelz as Gonzo, Zoot, Beuregard and Bunsen Hunnydew. <br /> <br /> Steve Whittemire as Rizzo Rat and more. <br /> <br /> Another great Muppet Flick. This time, Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy, Scooter, Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem, Gonzo, and Camilla are chickens outside school and play in a music movie that is trying to get to Broadway. After a major failure in the production that they produce, they all divide and leave separately. I love characters and portraits. The song in the movie is "Together Again", "Look at me, here I am", "Say Goodbye," "And I Will Always Love You", "Rat Jazz" and "". Frank Oz directs this movie great and all actors do a great job that acts like Muppets, they are real. Do you see that! 91 minutes. Rated G. Reviewed: A.
