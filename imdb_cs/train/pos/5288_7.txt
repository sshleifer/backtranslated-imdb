This fun cartoon Bugs Bunny sees the return of the unnamed Marvin Martian and his helper K-9 green dog. This time instead of trying to destroy the Earth, Marvin is on a mission on earth, capturing the earthly creature and taking it back to Mars. Of course, the beast he chooses is Bugs Bunny. First, Bugs thinks Marvin and K-9 are a trick or healing, but they realize it's not right when Marvin expands dramatically to the rag Bug with the beam. Errors try to avoid the situation in several ways, including Marvin's conviction that the K-9 is planning a rebellion. Eventually it is captured by a pool that pulled the Acme jacket. Amazingly, Acme works as an advertisement, and Bug is forced to use his wits to get the K-9 to release him, the tables are soon turned around and two disgruntled martians are connected and the Bugs are trying to fly their plate back on Earth. <br /> <br /> I really liked it, although the end is a bit weak compared to the rest of the story. Marvin's voice has changed slightly, and he's emotional when he's angry, but he did not make me like a cartoon.
