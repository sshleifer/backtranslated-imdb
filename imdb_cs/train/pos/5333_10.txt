How did it not become a cult film I do not know. I think it was unfortunately overlooked as a really brilliant comedy! "" Runaway Car "is trying to take off as a fast thriller, but with the quality of acting (good god is bad) storyline, practical aspects of demonic car hold and evacuation scene for kids, there is nothing you can really do but laugh. And the film is funny, I laughed from start to finish, I took a breath and almost choked out , it's funny at some points, when the kid was transported from the roof window in a helicopter holder with a robot pilot who managed to keep a constant speed identical to the car and a perfectly flat flight surface that meant the hook did not break the car roof into pieces, I was laughing hysterically, but when the baby began to swing in the air, she nearly hit the bridge and almost tangled in a tree, tears running over my face. the black cop was a guy who played Jesus in the film Madonna's "Like a Prayer." It seems that gets everywhere.
