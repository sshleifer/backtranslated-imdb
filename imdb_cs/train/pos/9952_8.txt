Before watching this movie, I thought that this movie would be great as Flashpoint, because before I watched this movie Flashpoint was the last movie Jenny Jameson and Brad Armstrong I had watched before. As for sex scenes, I was disappointed, I thought Dreamquest's sexual scenes would be great as Flashpoint sex scenes, but I was disappointed. Aside from the Asian Carrera sexual scene, no sexual scene in this movie will make me feel (you know what I mean). Great Jenna Jameson does not do such sexual scenes as she is capable of. Felecia and Stephanie Swift Both of these dear girls disappoint me as well as in sexual scenes. Although it's an adult film, but when you miss sex scenes, this movie is very good. As far as standard standards for adult films are concerned, this film has definitely increased the standards for adult films. Story, acting, direction, sets, makeup, and other technical stuff of this movie are really great. The actors of this film performed really good acting, all of them took great place. Dreamquest is definitely raised bar quality adult films.
