A gorgeously erotic chateau gothic horror that will be loved by Hammer House of Horror fans around the world. It seems to be an interesting shot of "Beauty and the Beast". It's definitely worth the look and surprisingly good acting, taking into account the genre and the era. Corsets, castles, rowing horses, furious fur monsters in the woods, evidence that nobody has a Brazilian in the 1970s, and more body fluids than you could shake, what more would you like? <br /> <br /> I definitely managed to brighten my Sunday afternoon!
