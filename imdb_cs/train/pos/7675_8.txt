After watching the movie last night, I had the feeling of hopelessness facing organizations trying to cope with the problem that portrays the film. The rate of prostitution appears to be so great that it is hard to see how it can be suppressed in Cambodia without major government changes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, with reviews. <br /> <br /> It's an unfortunate movie with an inconvenient central relationship, it's a very impressive movie, and I'd even go so far as to be nice. The film was well tuned for the performance and performance of Thuy Nguyen was excellent. I also felt Ron Livingston played a very hard part. It would be nice to have a little more information about why Patrick feels he has to help Holly, but maybe that's why he's simple explains the character of Chris Penn. I will not explain it here - look at the movie. It is a good film that is accompanied by thoughts and is obviously good intentions. I hope it will get a wide enough version to reach a decent audience size and gain further support for the K-11 project.
