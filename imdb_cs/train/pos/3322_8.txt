If you want to look at something that's for her and her, it's the movie you choose. I'm a skirt for rom com, but my husband is not always so interested (what a guy !!!). Anyway, I managed to watch him because I told him it was a sport, and you know what he loves! Drew Barrymore is very funny and her front man (I'm sorry but can remember his name) is just as good. When I watched the movie, it was called "The Perfect Match," but I think the title was changed to the UK because it is based on the Fever Pitch book and a movie about the football with that name has already been made (the same movie, but the British version - phew! ) <br /> <br /> Anyway, all the reviews here will tell you more details if you need them to buy girls, take it from me, get your mumbles / friend in front of the TV on Saturday night and both you laugh and cry together. The real gem.
