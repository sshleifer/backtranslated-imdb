Somehow I came to see this movie when it came out and discovered it only last week thanks to a friend's recommendation. I can honestly say that I do not remember another intimate dramatic film that makes so many things so good. Writing is sharp, realistic, nuanced, and even restrained. Cinematography and editing are underestimated but inspired, allowing visual narratives to testify in amazing details and framing of images, capturing loneliness and alienation in most unforgettable ways. Also, acting is amazing, all characters are painfully real and vulnerable in the most impressive ways the movie can offer. They reveal their innermost weaknesses unprotected, brutal vulnerability. Real triumph for Roger Michel and Hanif Kureishi and the rest of the team. He has to see the serious lovers of the film.
