I'm not a big fan of Tim Matheson, but I have to admit that I liked this movie. It was dark and a little worrying, some scenes were a bit nervous, I do not know that he classified this film a bit of SF and a little horror slash thriller. I saw it at about 2:00 am or so on my local channel there was nothing else so I decided to watch .If you have not seen this film id recommending it its really so bad, the characters are pretty interesting but not really explored their full potential that could make this movie even better.I do not know if this movie went to the cinema, as if it was made for television or went straight to the video, if it's on DVD, it fits into my type of movie and has a small piece of the X-FILES story that's connected to it. Government corporations or shifty corporations are involved in predatory shadow negotiations. Overall good movie.
