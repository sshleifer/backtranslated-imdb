I really enjoyed this movie. I was fifteen when this movie appeared and I could concentrate on it. It will be a movie that I would show my children to let them know, their feelings are normal. It's funny to see how we could be so determined about things at such a young age ... he knew we'd get back ... over and over ... Big movie !!!!
