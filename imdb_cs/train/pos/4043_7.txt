Live Alive is a very fun SCI-FI movie from Japan. I recorded a bunch of disappointed film geeks who loved Versus's debut film debut film or his third Azumi film. I hear they are a bloody film with swords and zombies and all kinds of adventures. I honestly went to a video shop to get Versus, but I'm fine with Alive. If you are looking for a start to the end of a wall on the action wall then Alive is not your choice. There are plenty of actions, but it comes as a paycheck for an hour of characterized building. Personally, I think this is well done and worth it. Of course, some of the plot are stupid as with many SCI-FI action films and I think subtitles using the term foreign object could be replaced by a parasite for a bigger effect. This movie is brutal when it must be so weak of heart does not have to pay. <br /> <br /> They kept the budget down by largely limiting all the actions to one underground building (taking a dice sign), but the film does not suffer. Another bonus for this film is intense Gothic imagery that is made with a great artistic touch during many flashes and dreams. <br /> <br /> Rent!
