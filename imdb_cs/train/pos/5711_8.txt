Le Million has created Rene Clair, one of the great directors and great pioneers of cinematography, a light comedy that is a pioneering and technically brilliant film for all of his light that has clearly influenced other filmmakers such as the Brothers Marx, Lubitsch, and Mamoulian. The plot, the humorous tale of a poor artist who wins a huge lottery jackpot, but has to furiously search for a missing ticket across the city, is basically just a device that supports a number of wonderfully funny comic scenes reminiscent of the dream world of directorial imagination. One of the most impressive things about this film is that although it is located in the middle of Paris and contains nothing really impossible, it achieves a permanent and entangled fabulous / fantastic atmosphere in which it seems quite natural that people sing as much as they speak or that the pain of the stolen jacket should be in the form of a football game. Another unforgettable feature is that Le Million contains what may be the most entertaining opera movie ever shot on the movie (O such a blonde soprano! "Laughing, ha! Ha!") Joy is casting: Clair has gathered a group of amazing , sharply different characters of the actors, each illustrating the deadly satirical precision of the bourgeois French "type," so the film looks like a set of Daumier's prints. The animation takes a bit of time to get in motion and I discovered those characters that are not as emotional as they can be in a light comedy (as in many Lubitsch films). For these reasons, I refrained from providing the highest rating. But these tiny cavities should not draw on enthusiastic advice. If you saw that? By all means. We highly recommend that you want classic and influential cinematographic work or just a fun comedy.
