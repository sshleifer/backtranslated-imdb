First of all, I must begin to say that I am a huge Nightmare fan on Elm Street. I think it's the biggest horror series ever. For me, Freddy boogeyman! Of course, Freddy's dead man, who had tried the last chapter, is a strange movie. It does not have the same atmosphere as previous films. Freddy has a lot of time on the screen. Some believe it makes it less scary, which I agree. And that's exactly the point in my opinion. This movie exists so we can know Freddy a bit better who he is, who he was, how he became a man who pursues our dreams. For some people it's a bad thing, it's better to never know, because it's more scary to know why evil is evil. Obviously, these people will not love the Halloween remake of Rob Zombie. To truly enjoy this, you have to see things differently. This is not a weird guy who is hiding in the bushes of your dream waiting for you to scare you from hell. That was the first one and it was amazing. Over the years, Freddy has killed more and more people and has never been rid of him. Now is the time to learn about the nature of this evil, about the psychological aspects of Freddy's terror. Besides the story of Freddy's past, I really liked the atmosphere of the film. No children in Springwood, just crazy adults. Nightmare scenes are all great. The soundtrack is amazing, especially the introductory song called "I'm Awake Now" played by Goo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, The Final Nightmare is a horror masterpiece, and I can not believe it is so underestimated. Maybe it's misunderstood or I have another taste! All fans of Freddy should watch. It has a lot of creepy moments, as well as fun moments and lots of adventures! Prepare for something else and you may not be disappointed.
