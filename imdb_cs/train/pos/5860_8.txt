A nice game that offers fun and easy play and a fair playable ability. Staying true to the comic book and providing a low learning curve gives this game something that is not seen in most action tapes today. Used narratives and animated scenes (though lengthy animations are replaced by a presentation in the Nintendo 64 version) take full advantage of the platform's capabilities.
