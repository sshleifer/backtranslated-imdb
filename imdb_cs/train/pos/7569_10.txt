At that time, in our culture, where reality is exposed as a narrative, there is an exaggerated fiction, as we know it on a small and large screen, "In addition" is a film that exposes real life moments that feel more sincere, fresh and innovative than presentation I've seen it before. Conventional spoon feeding conventions do not exist in this movie, and the content audience lets sit and watch how these real-life moments on the screen run down. While watching the movie and even after meditation, it is hard to believe that these amazing performances, where they are actually performances. Every moment with a great cast of actors felt like the truth that was exposed in everyday life. Even so, "In addition" does not feel like a documentary or reality TV, but instead goes into its own category with unique cinematography and direction. I look forward to following this new category of stories to continue with other films by directors Jennifer Shainin and Randy Walker. <br /> <br /> This movie has to be seen.
