The challenge of ancient movies like this is that you see a real moving picture of life more than 100 years ago. Here is a lot of people who leave the factory, all of them are now dead and none of them even remotely realize the scope of the invention that precedes. I was shocked to read one reviewer who suggested this movie boring as a home video today, and at least one other mistakenly identified him as the first film ever to be shot (it was the first movie made at 16 frames per second, rather than then-normal 46 frames per second). <br /> <br /> Sure, everybody you see is a lot of people going out of the building and walking in front of the camera on their way home from work, but that's the curiosity for dozens of reasons that it was the first movie they made the Lumi√©re brothers, who have probably more strongly influenced the development of cinematography than any other individual or group of people in history.
