The last (I believe) films The Guys with Hal Roach, it's also the last real funny movie they did before going to the 20th century fox that so exploited their talents so great. Though there are weak moments - business with a "lung tester" is a bit ah ... exaggerated (but it is worthwhile to see "Dr." Jimmy Finlayson) - but overall this flick is a good overview of what the boys brought to screen. Richard Cramer has appeared in other L & H films, and is terribly threatened as a convicted Nick Granger. A scene where boys have to eat their own synthetic food ("It looks good, smells good, and probably tastes good. Eat it.") It's one of my favorite moments in the work. Stan & Ollie will always be nice companions in the lives of their millions of devoted fans.
