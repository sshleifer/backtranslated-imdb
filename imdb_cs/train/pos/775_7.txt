It's a weird, yet impressive story, about love. Personally, in real life, I have never done such a twist-off story. But I can imagine he is there. It's a story that promises to be "ill". But when I look at it, I did not get this feeling of "sickness" that I would certainly have about the rules of society. It's something beautiful in this movie ... something impressive ... that I can not object to using any moral or social rules. The film focuses mainly on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You can see how this relationship begins, develops, and finally ends. You feel the moment when this love blooms, the first whisper, it touches. You feel connected. And no moment, even if it's immoral. You even hope it will not break in the end ... it can not break ... it's not right. You feel the pain that you finally break at the end ... <br /> <br /> But I also have to add a negative turn to this comment ... I do not know if the story is not so kind * pointed * to feel that these relationships they are sick only in form, but not in content. You do not have a whole story but just fragments. When the film was launched, the relationship between Kiki and Sandu was already in place. So, no opinion on the nature of the relationship. You feel only the tension between them ... the struggle between the need for love and the desire to overcome this relationship. I think this series of Kiki to Sandu says everything: "I want to stop ... and if you love me, you will do what I ask you." This movie is likely to raise some questions about what love is and what is moral ... and where is the gap between them. I do not know if the idea of ​​this film is "love conquers all ... even social and moral standards" or "love is beautiful ... no matter how or where". But, in my opinion, this film is already successful for the simple reason that you are thinking ...
