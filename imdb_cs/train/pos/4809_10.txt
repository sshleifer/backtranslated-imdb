With all the recent films that deal with the British monarchy, is it really time for another? Answer: HELP! Young Victoria is another contribution to the UK movie film wave. In this case, she deals with the early life of Princess Victoria and the events leading her to the crowning of her queen of all England, as well as her romance and eventual wedding to Prince Albert. The film also deals with the stormy lives and careers of the English Queen and Prince, as well as several other events that appear (political turbulence, etc.). Emily Blunt plays in her youth a vibrant Victoria, while Rupert Friend is her beloved and best friend, Prince Albert. The rest of the cast is rounded off with Miranda Richardson, like Dutchess in Kent and always welcome on screen, Jim Broadbent as King William, as well as casting others on the canvas. Jean Marc Vallee (Los Angeles Love) directed by Julian Fellowes (Vanity Fair, Gosford Park, Separate Lies). Absolutely, I avoided the visual view of the film (by cameraman Hagen Bogdansker), which made each picture painterly (with the help of designer Patrice Vermette) and some narrow adaptation (Jill Bilcock & Matt Garner). What I also appreciated in Fellowes's script is to use chess games as a metaphor for some of the film's political motifs (the characters in the movie move similar to the pieces on the chessboard). These are smart, well-written, directed, filmed, edited and active entertainment (and enlightenment) that make a good evening at the cinema. PG MPAA rated for several scenes of sensuality, short violence (a bit bloody, though not too cruel), a rough blast of the tongue and some on the smoking screen
