I do not remember the fact that I noticed the day before, probably the title was so ordinary that it also led me. It is a well-established Western market with an interesting, terrifying story that accompanies it by spoiling from good to impending. Robert Mitchum moves into a wide open city, looks for his wife and reports of his daughter. remains for some time as a landscape painter. As usual, good traders have mixed emotions - they want to get rid of bad people, but as a business they bring. Still, the liberalization of beverage laws and gambling and the promotion of the industry, but pretending to deny the sad effects they can have on ordinary people. What is fascinating about this movie is Mitchum's cynically intensive picture when it comes to clearing the baddies, and urban people believe that his violent methods are the only ones. Favorite bit: The sudden disappearance of 2 baddies in the Red Dog salon. The burning of the main lounge was fortunately limited, but it was an effective way to fight the spread of poison. Overall, a very good film with a single flaw that tends to be a little hokey - not so good for Do-Gooders who would prefer the whole life of dealing with Evil rather than ending it.
