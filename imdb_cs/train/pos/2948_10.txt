It should be against a law that should not experience this extremely entertaining show with Eddie Murphy. I have never seen anything like this. <br /> <br /> Murphy continues for nearly 70 minutes about youngsters, pussies, goats and insaultsch so many famous people including their own "family". Among the people who earn him murphy are: Elvis, Mr.T, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Vandross and James Brown. I really did not really regret in my life. I mean, if you do not know who Mr. T is, but he's still mixing Murphy as Mr. T, it's something. At the time I saw the show, I could not remember who was Mr. T. but he still laughed. Now I know who it is and it is much more fun. Because Eddie does - he can make such impressions so good that it does not matter who the hell he is doing, it's still cheerful. And we learn that Murphy is actually a very good singer. Please watch it ..
