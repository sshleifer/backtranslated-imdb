Probably Bigas Luna's biggest success will achieve a delicate balance between splinter, eroticism and surrealism for her. Tasty Mathilda May, who spent most of Tobe Hooper's "Lifeforce" in buff, is the subject of young pre-teen lion Biel Duran. He can not get May's breasts out of his mind and wants so bad to feed and feed his mother's breasts. His effort for May is a movie. Like in Luna's products like "Lulu" and "Jamon! Jamon!", The Director brings a somewhat humiliated sexual sensibility to his strange but beautiful story. Ordinary suspects are offended, but those who have open minds will enjoy this luscious erotic poem on their female breasts. Jos√© Luis Alcaine's pictures are wonderful and Nicole Piovani's score is sweet and rich. Excellent cinematographic candy with wonderful anarchic sensitivity, which the Spanish do so naturally.
