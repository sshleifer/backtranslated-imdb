Firstly, I will make my assessment of the whole series; ******* 7 out of ten stars. I took three of the downhill slopes that this series suffered after John Amos left. Do not get me wrong that it was hard to beat the episodes later, but only after Esther Rolle left for the season and came back. In February 1974, premiered for a really great sit-com (with dramatic stimuli) of CBS. It was first a television show about an African-American family living in Chicago in the 1970s. Created by Norman Lear as a reflection of "Maude", he again hit the right chord with the audience. <br /> <br /> I have not seen a sitcom from this show that speaks directly about family battles in city centers. (Well, in 1994, Fox was "South Central" but was not restored.) John Amos as James Evans Sr. was the ultimate father for this family and acted like every father. his family together and his children should embark on bad paths in life. Esther Rolle was a beautiful and unthinkable mother who was on the same page as her husband when she came to their children's upbringing. Ralph Carter as a young Michael, but very bright young man for his age but stuck in a school system that does not meet his academic needs. His name is the same as the founder of the show Mike Evans, who was Lionel Jefferson on "The Jeffersons." (Mike Evans died in December 2006) <br /> <br /> Thelma is a young girl aged 16 or 17 and has to deal with the danger of being a young woman in the streets of the ghetto. Jimmie Walker as J.J. Evans Jr. is a typical young sage-cracking, jiving kind of a young man who does not really have enough life. <br /> <br /> Simply put, all my favorite episodes are with John Amos, except Penny Gordon / Janet Jackson's story line. After the demise of James Evans' character, the show lost its stability and the audience left. Esther Rolle went all year and did not want to play the second violin on JJ's smart-aleck "Dyno-mite's!" <br /> <br /> She returned to the next season after she got the guarantee that the writer would even be things. Florida neighbor Wilona Woods was a divorced woman who eventually received an abused little girl Penny Gordon (played by 10-year-old Janet Jackson). Penny's abusive mother played Totie Fields, mother Kim Fields. In August 1979, the show ended and everyone left projects for a better life. Artist JJ sold the idea of ​​a comic book company, Michael left university campus. <br /> <br /> Wilona & Penny, Thelma & soccer player Keith + Florida all moved to the same building in Uptown Chicago. The most realistic end, but it did not matter at the time.
