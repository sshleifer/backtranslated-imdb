I think this is perhaps the most funny movie I've ever seen. Robert Harling's script is almost perfect, just look at the "quotes" section; on the second idea, just borrow a DVD because it's a delivery that really makes the lines sing. Sally Field gives comic, over top-performance, as you've never seen her anywhere, and Kevin Kline is hopelessly cheerful. Robert Downey, Jr. is typically great and in a very small role, Kathy Najimy is uncomfortable as an annoyed customer. I've never been a fan of Elisabeth Shue, but it's great like a real man surrounded by a bunch of cartoon characters on the "The Sun Also Sets" - the fact that I feel like shaking you is Hemingway in his grave. Either that or he really laughed. <br /> <br /> Five stars. Funny, funny, funny.
