"There is nothing in room 237. But you also have no work," so stay out, do you understand? <br /> <br /> There has never been such a performance of psychological horror as the film achieves. This is the highest rated horror film of all and so correctly. Jack Nicholson is a great actor and this is one of the greatest shows in the cinema. It's about a family that moves through the winter to an isolated and deserted hotel for 5 months. Then Father (Jack) becomes almost obsessed with the horrors of the hotel. <br /> <br /> Kubrick's direction is nothing short, then perfect. Tense shots, painful music, mystical news, and a confused plot make this film the best horror movie ever made. Throughout the film, there is always talk of danger, death and horror. Red is used in every scene. Is the red intentionally inserted by Kubrick? Of course! <br /> <br /> This is definitely Kubrick's classic and that's one third of his films that I gave 10/10. He is a perfectionist in his direction and can be seen in all his films. He likes to disturb his viewers in all his films. I'm going to talk about this movie for the next few months. It has infinite depth. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is the cornerstone of horror and tension. Masterpiece of terror 10/10
