The final chapter in the Hanzo Razor trilogy provides a closing cap for this fun series of samuraploitace. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumuru in Yasuz Masumur's chair, but the style is quite the same, perhaps because Shintaro Katsu serves as a producer, in addition to antihero titles. <br /> <br /> Hanzo reveals the female spirit that protects the treasure hiding on the bottom of the lake. Of course, Hanzo is Hanzo, he is not postponed by being a ghost, so he continues to rape ... and listen to it using the now-known revolving networking device. The story goes through a series of blind monks who also doubled as offenders, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives, and the necessary hook and slash. Hanz's senior officer, Onishi and his two employees, provide typical comic notes and, in general, it is usual. <br /> <br /> Significantly less complicated and easier to follow than the first (which is all around and a bit of mess), less stylish, dramatic and bloody than the other (probably the best in the Hanzo series), but still fun and useful of its own merit. Complete with training sequences of trademarks, compulsory rape, sword and mystery Hanzo is called upon to investigate, it will eventually satisfy fans.
