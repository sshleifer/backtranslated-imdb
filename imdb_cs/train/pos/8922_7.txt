The only notable thing about this film is that it was Steve McQueen's first major role. <br /> <br /> McQueen's talent is undeveloped and raw, but refreshing honest in this sci-fi horror movie. Steve turns out to be an anti-establishment, a hot car loving actor who will become the polished icon of the film industry just five years after. McQueen later said he hated this movie and that "it was a blob". But everyone has to start somewhere and The Blob is cute, fresh and innocent. We all want to stay that way. <br /> <br /> The plot is a fast and yet predictable, still fun hour. And it's really fun to see Steve McQueen before he became King Kool (and Anita Corsaut before she became girlfriend Andy Taylor). A close friend sent me a DVD back and it's a valuable addition to my movie collection Steve McQueen.
