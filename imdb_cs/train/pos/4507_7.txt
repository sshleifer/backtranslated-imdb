I was really amazed at how much a movie older than 60 would be amazed. It's almost two hours, there are absolutely no stars, there are subtitles, but it's still interesting and exciting to watch. What I was most interested in was the realism of the film. You could almost feel the cold of ice, because you could see that there were real storms. This is a relief in the world of CGI as it is today. I wondered how much it had to be for Van Dyke. Somewhere I read that it took 17 months to film it. And who wants to talk about the "Titanic"? It's a great movie with a big message, and I encourage the future director to see how great and realistic the movies can be if they are only focused on realism instead of visual effects.
