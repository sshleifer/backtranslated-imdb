This movie is amazing on so many levels ... and none of them is a level that should be amazing. <br /> <br /> Just remember this: When you watch Shauna the dead and the other latest zombie movies ... either good or bad ... This is the formula they use. This is what makes zombie movies so great. And what makes it better than great is the story behind the movie. A simple web search will give you everything you need to know. <br /> <br /> Overall, it will not stay. There is never any sense why you think "Come on, go on with it" ... it moves quickly and the horns are nice. This is a sporty, small Italian number of zombie flicks. <br /> <br /> So terrible, it's wonderful! If your tongue spends a lot of time on your face ... rent, buy, love it. As a great trivia note: If you are looking at DVD, you will notice that sound effects under the music score appear on the menu screen ... Well ... that's because this music was raised directly from the trailer ... which is probably the only working press of this music that still exists, which is long enough for the loop.
