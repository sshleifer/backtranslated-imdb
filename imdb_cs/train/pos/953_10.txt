Far richer textures and characters than classics from the 1930s and 1950s. George C. Scott was born as Scrooge just as he was born as Patton. Mr. Scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century. It seemed Scrooge as he played Mr. Scott jumps out of the screen. Scott like Scrooge brought a richer, more robust, but deeply moving Scrooge screen to his screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the deadliest man in London in the 18th century. Scott seemed to have brought Scrooge to a more personal, comprehensible and at the same time very conflicting level; his role played with the great authority that Scott always brought to the screen: yet his usual military voice would sometimes be brought to the whisper almost like a soliloquy while he would praise a Christmas holiday in one breath but reveal his own human fragility in his next line . He could portray the sour and crisp Scrooge and the incomprehensible, sympathetic Scrooge in the same scene. Really remarkable performance of the enormous general.
