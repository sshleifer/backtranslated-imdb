This military swashbuckler, founded in 1939, based fairly freely on the unforgettable poem by Rudyard Kipling and his novel "The Three Soldiers," is characterized in the 1980s as a first-class entertainment for the British Imperial Army in India. Cary Grant delivers more punches with his knuckles than all his films together. In Far India, this six-degree yarn is engaged in the explosion of three malicious British sergeants and their indigenous Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe), who face the bloodthirsty cult of murderous Indians called Thuggee. Sergeant Archibald Cutter (Sergeant MacChesney) and Sergeant Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. of The Dawn Patrol) Alpha Men Who Want to Become History Because Ballantine she wants to marry Emma Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and get her tea. It goes without saying that Cutter and MacChesney are drumming different schemes to derail Ballentino's plans. When their superiors order them back into action with Sgt. Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coote of "The Sheik Steps Out"), Cutter and MacChesney Higginbotham do not have to accompany them and Ballantine has to replace him. Half of the entertainment here follows the directors who try to overcome each other without hating. Director George Stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in great style and scope when our heroes confused with the Thuggees army. Lenser Joseph H. August received an Oscar nomination for outstanding black and white cinematography.
