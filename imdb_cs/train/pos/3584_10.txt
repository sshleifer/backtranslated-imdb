My name is Heather and I am the girl whose story was based on this film. I would like to thank all of you who have seen this movie and enjoyed it. as rough and harsh as some of the things described in this film, was not too close to describing how bad things really are. not to mention the influence of everything on my mother and my little sister. thank you for the great comments they all have, I really appreciate them <br /> <br /> Hello everyone! <br /> <br /> This is Heather's mom. It is hard to believe that he spent so many years following the filming of this film. It is even harder to believe that people have watched her a year ago. For all of you who have undergone the same or similar situation, you know there are people in cyberspace who will fully understand how you feel. Our thoughts and prayers are with each of you.
