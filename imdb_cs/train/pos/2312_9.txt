A young man called the Court is loved by everyone. His painful bloody death brings everyone closer. There are more symbols and cues in the movie. Whether predictable or not, and regardless of church beliefs, it is a moving story full of grace and sensuality. One thing, someone mentioned that his fate was so fast that it did not seem plausible. But the elements for this are set gently. Notice what his mother says about taking her lunch to the field. Notice how to hold the steering wheel and gloves. He is sweaty and runs a dangerous device. To date, tractors are very dangerous.
