While it is widely acknowledged that terrible symmetry has been heavily influenced by the Kolcak episode, which are, are, will be, whether it is doing the tearing or the homage is a most controversial point. As a huge fan of both series, he professes a second faith, although he does not have to do much less charity. James Whitmore was courageous to take on the task of managing such a tough episode, invisible elephants, and gorilla suits look like a recipe for disaster, but it pulls him out of style, that's an absolute jewel. Lance Guest does a great job of making a credible figure from Kyle Lang, and Jack Rader threatens with a threat like Ed Meecham. Forget about the dubious originality of Fearful Symmetry and enjoy it as a deeply satisfying set of X.
