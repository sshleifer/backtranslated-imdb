It's not an artistic movie, it's mainly fun. <br /> <br /> Lots of beautiful people, t & a and events. I found it very funny. It's not to be intellectually stimulating, it's a fun movie that can be watched! Jesse and Chace are also funny, which is just a sauce. Definitely worth the rent. <br /> <br /> So, in summary, I would recommend that you check it out for a little fun on Friday night with boys or even with your girl (if she likes seeing other girls)! <br /> <br /> The villains are also good. Vinnie, Corey Large, Hatian of Heroes. Very annoying villains.
