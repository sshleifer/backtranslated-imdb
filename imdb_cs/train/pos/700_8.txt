The Insomniac Nightmare was an incredibly interesting, well-worked film. I loved the way he throws you into the main person's subconscious without disturbing the viewer ... acting was top-honest, watching Dominik Monaghan read the phonebook! - but everyone else, especially the young girl, was great. I was also very impressed with the appearance of the film. Usually, the "independent films" are grainy, the I-shot-to-on-my-video camera looks at them, but this director knows what he is doing. Lighting, cinematography ... quality work. I look forward to the full-length work by Tessa Nanavati!
