it's by far one of the most beautiful portraits of a person I've ever seen on the screen. Andy Goldsworthy is a kind of man who is extinct. he sees the country and nature with such admiration and respect that he is primitive in a good sense. his purity, sincerity, and kindness breathe clearly when you observe him how he works in such simplifying but full lives of current artworks. I was amazed at how patiently he had created his pieces and how patiently he accepted their end. sometimes prematurely, but his Scottish sense of humor covers his disappointment. the movie shoots them elegantly and has the same flow as Goldsworthy's art. combines nature and art at least as it is in itself. Fred Frith's score is so organic that it combines everything without disturbing its naturalistic sound. this is a great piece of work in every aspect. he has no age limit.
