Good. As you can see, it's one of my favorite, if not favorite, movies. This is a drama that is totally cheerful. The main character is a trader who is stuck in the "same thing, another day" mentality. She sees a woman who looks melancholy from a dance studio window on her train every day, wondering about her and deciding to learn more about her. He decides to enter the dance class only to find out that he is not an instructor. From there, she joins four other dancers and learns to dance and learns about the mysterious woman. <br /> <br /> There is no dependent sex (or any) sex, as a small group of people learn how to create and develop friendship. The film was built with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez and the new one, while attraction is nowhere as pleasing as the original. The film in America has never been great because it was not eligible for the Oscars because it was broadcast on television in Japan (films can not be released on television or disqualified for Oscar nominations). She has received many awards for best film, actor, director, etc. in Japan for her Oscar Awards.
