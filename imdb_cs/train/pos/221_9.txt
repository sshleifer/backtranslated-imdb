I remember that I had originally seen this movie at Radio City Music Hall when it came out. I did not understand humor at the time, but this movie can make me laugh out loud. With serious respect for George Burns (RIP), Walter Matthau really deserved the Oscar for this film. His performance is amazing - given that he was 20 years younger than his character, Willie Clark. His manners are first-class. ("Do you know what kind of songs he wrote? Sh * t!" And when you speak to the Spanish speaking at the reception: "No! No! No enchilada!") Absolutely cheerful! <br /> <br /> Kudos Richard Benjamin, who played a straight man on Matthau. I just wish it was on DVD, because my VHS record is a little old. <br /> <br /> There's no interest in seeing a remake with Woody Allen, because he can not match the original.
