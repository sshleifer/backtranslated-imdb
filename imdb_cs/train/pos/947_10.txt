and perhaps closest to the Dickens storyline. Although I was hard to follow young Ebenezer (who is the idea that they were long hair, they could do better!), Scott does an incredible job like Scrooge. His delivery of some parts from Dickens finally brought me to life. Edward Woodward is everything we expect from us and another of the Gift of Christmas. I found G.C. Scrooge's Scott is far more credible than the current version of Patrick Stewart. Scene Christmas morning when Scrooge realizes he has not "missed" it, it's enough to convince one that Scott knows how to deal with surprise. It is phenomenal. Almost the entire cast is incredible. Tiny Tim in this version of Christmas Carolina is a little hard to look at, almost too sweet. Still music and landscape make it have to be watching every holiday. Enjoy!
