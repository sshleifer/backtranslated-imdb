I saw the first movie on my way from Paris to Newark on Air France in August 1996. I believe the film itself is really a masterpiece. It's the kind of movie people should do. I still think Daniel Auteuil is one of the prettiest actors around. In this French film, he plays a divorced father and trader who has lost his longing for life until he arrives at a Down syndrome who lives in an institution with other patients with Down syndrome. Actor, including an actor who actually has Down's syndrome, creates an incredible friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men. Daniel's life and our changes will forever change into a person with Down syndrome. He realizes that life is not just work and not play but for the living and loving, and that's all that life should be like. The end is a little stupid, but I still think it's one of my favorite movies. Just bring the tear to your eye.
