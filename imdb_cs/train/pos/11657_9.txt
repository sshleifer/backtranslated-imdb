Nominated the surprise of this year's best animated Oscar series. It is the Irish film heart, but co-produced by Belgium and Brazil, with, I guess animators working in all three countries. The product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory. The figure of the character is a bit like the Persepolis French animated film a few years back with very simple characters with dense, black outlines. This movie is not black and white. Oh no. What makes this movie great is its use of color, just some of the most outrageous and surprising use of the colors I've ever seen. The general design of images is also much geometric, with characters that are essentially rectangles or ovals. Much of the movie can be spent by playing a circle - the main aspect of the visual design is a circle in the center of the image. All these geometric designs have a purpose - the story is about a young boy who learns to be an artist working on illuminated manuscripts (The Book of Kells is a truly lit Bible, the art of the film is based on drawings in it). The story of the film is not particularly deep, but it's a pretty good fantasy story. Brendan is a young boy in Kells, a city surrounded by huge walls, built by his uncle so that the Vikings do not arise. The newcomer to Kells, Brother Aiden, inspired Brendan to do so. He also inspired him to do things like leaving Kells and exploring the nearby forest in which the nymph lives. Bruno Coulais provides fantastic scores, almost as good as what Coraline did, which I think is the best of the year.
