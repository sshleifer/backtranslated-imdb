<br /> <br /> The old man works as a nurse in a psychiatric hospital to get close to his wife who is patient there and tries to get her out. This is certainly one of the most forgotten masterpieces of the quiet era and peculiarities in the history of Japanese film. The long thought was lost, the press was found in the 1970s and a musical soundtrack added to it that perfectly fits the paintings. It may have influenced the Cabinet of Dr. Caligary (director Kinugasa claimed she had never seen a German film). However, it overcomes in style and in its more convincing (and cooler) depiction of the inner mental state of prisoners in asylum. To achieve this, the film uses every single film technique available at the time: multiple exposure and subjective view of the focus, inclined camera angles, fast and slow motion, expressionist lighting and redundancy. It's also a very complicated movie to follow because it has no subtitles. The film opens with the assembly of rain cuts that hit the windows of the hospital, winding trees and thunder. Anxious weather metaphors the mental state of patients and introduces one of them: a former dancer. The combination of sounds created by rain, wind and thunder serves as a music that encourages a dancer to get into a frantic, almost hypnotic dance. The next sequence, which concerns the same patient who participated in another freeride dance, is followed by other prisoners. More dancer's exposure is the patient's view and his confused view of the world. These are just two examples of this amazing film that tries to represent the patients' subconscious and a view of a "healthy" world. <br /> <br /> In three words, you MUST MORE.
