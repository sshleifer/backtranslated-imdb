You play as B.J. Blazkowicze, an American secret agent of a hard-fought soldier who is sent to expose the Nazi secret and reverse the tide of World War II. This means that we avoid the Nazi dungeon and suppress Hitler's war machine and even the Fuhrer himself. This is quite possibly the most influential game of your time. That's because it literally inspired an obsession. Many matches at that time existed, and today even more, but everybody gets so much of a real rescue. That's one of them. Just like before Tetris and the newer GTA III in 2002. Yes, Doom is better in almost all respects, but shots heard around the world that led to one of the tallest tidal waves were fired by B.J. Blazkowiczem. The space sailor, Duke Nukem, Max Payne, Serious Sam, John Mullins, JC Denton, agent 47, Gordon Freeman, and legions of others owe their existence to ID boys. Whether directly or in most cases indirectly but still doing so. Even with its old looks, very old graphics, super simple gameplay (this is really a game, the game now borders on "level" experience) and very rectangular levels, the range of all six episodes provides a lot of fun, especially discovering those secrets with treasure <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> rated PC-13 for "deep bloodshed." However, it's exceptionally tame compared to what today's games have.
