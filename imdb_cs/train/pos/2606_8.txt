Maybe some people think this movie is slow. It is precisely this "slow burning" that allows him to deeply affect the viewer. Just like the amazing first scene: we can hear the voices first; then we can see the characters; Finally, the camera slowly turns back and forth, and we see another figure, a young man who just sits there, probably does not even listen to the conversation, or at least is not really caring. The fact that this young man will play a major role shows the strategy of the film: it allows the character to develop and be determined by the surrounding environments surrounding him without having to mark the points more than necessary. People go and go, they enter and leave their lives. Although most of the film follows (and most supporting characters are only seen in its close neighborhood, defined according to the relationship with it), we are convinced that we are objective, so gentle is the director's touch.
