This 2004 Oscar nominee is a very short black and white film in Spanish. The young woman goes to the caf√©, gets coffee and notices some musicians sitting quietly with the instruments. All patrons are still, like dummies. But one guy is pretty cheerful and writes about what's going on at 7:35 am. There is one surprising moment after the second to the end, which is quite surprising. People, the place, everything looks quite ordinary. And as a musical piece "Bolero," the thing remains built until the climax. Thanks to its structure, theme, movement and joke, it's an 8-minute masterpiece.
