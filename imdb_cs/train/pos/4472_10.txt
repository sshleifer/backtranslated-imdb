From the very beginning you can see that "Anchors Aweigh" is a great comedy. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra are doing such a funny team! The songs they sing together are pure entertainment. Kathryn Grayson is beautiful and really sweet. Dean Stockwell is the most beautiful child actor I've never seen. If you love the piano, you will be amazed by Jos√© Iturbi. This movie was the first to combine animation with real actors, and it made a great start in an unforgettable dance number. Undoubtedly one of Kelly's most entertaining films.
