Giallo fans are looking for this rare movie. It is well written and full of all the usual low lifetimes that these films inhabit. I do not want to give anything, so I did not say anything about the conspiracy. The whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere and you do not know what to expect or who you suspect. We recommend! The only place I've seen to get this movie in English is 15 dollars from the European trash cinema.
