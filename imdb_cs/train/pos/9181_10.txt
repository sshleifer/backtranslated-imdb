I did not know what Jane Eyre was before I saw the miniseries. I have read and watched many classics earlier and believed that most classics are boring, exaggerated and overrated stories with reasonably interesting drawings at best. This miniseries Jane Eyre have completely changed my concepts. Zelah Clarke is a wonderful actress and gives a wonderful view of Jane Eyre. Her accent is magnificent, and her silent but solid nature is exactly adapted to the character of the young ruler. Timothy Dalton is an amazing Rochester. His passion and energy in the movie forced me to believe he was born to play the angry Master Thornfield Hall. I could not sleep all night after watching the miniseries. Land is both scary and inspirational. The characters are masterfully made and the story is incredible. This is the best version of Jane Eyre that ever appeared on the film. I read a book later and was amazed at how closely this miniseries followed Charlotte Bronte's written work. Jane Eyre is now my favorite movie and book. If you want to see a masterpiece that changes your life, check out the BBC version of Jane Eyre from 1983.
