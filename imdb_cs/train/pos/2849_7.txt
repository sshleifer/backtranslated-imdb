I can not say that this film is disappointing because I read some reviews before playing and did not do as well as I thought it would have. The bar was not so high, so the fact that my expectations were met does not say much. Good: City of New York. If you live in a city like me, you will recognize some places and understand that the city is to be more than just a set-up, rather one of the main characters. There are really gentle moments, humorous conversations, and the left and right conspiracies that keep things interesting. Bad: The first thing I thought after leaving the theater was that I wanted more, but not in the positive "let them want more" fashion. Of course, good scenes / scenes outweigh the bad ones, but there are plenty of sketches that fall into the 'between' category, too much in fact, which will ultimately bring the film. Also, the diversity of New York, although suggesting that although many distant bastions of the city and mentioned in an interview throughout the film, it is never actually realized or analyzed to make the city justice. For example, many of the skits involve well doing middle-aged white. I mean, the city is home to many of the demographics listed, but to come, Paris Je'taime's conspiracy and character diversity makes New York City look like Lancaster, PA, or somewhere really white. It's just a disappointment when I see that the city does not change that heritage. <br /> <br /> But even after I said, I would recommend giving New York, I love you look. Who knows, maybe you do not agree with my opinion and maybe you will not. You never know until you see it yourself. This review is not intended to discourage anyone from watching this movie because every view of art varies. I'm just giving you a very vague head to expect.
