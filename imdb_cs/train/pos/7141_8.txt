Since Siskel's death and Ebert's absence, the show has been left in the incompetent hands of Richard Roeper. The film critic is not a critic of the film, it just criticizes everything he does not like in person, that is, movies with country music echo because "I do not like country music!" and children's films get the standard "You do not see it now, wait for it to come out on DVD and lend it to your children!" The rising might be an idiot shaman, but in some other area. Weekly guests are more comfortable at the Ebert Hotel, but who wants to choose daisies in the middle of a cow's heel? All that has been said is the only show in the city, and it's worth watching. As for Roger Ebert, if Stephen Hawking can talk, you can! It's your thought and thoughts why we wanted. Do all that is necessary to get the usurper from his own declared throne.
