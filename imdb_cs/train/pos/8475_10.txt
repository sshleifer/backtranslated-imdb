This is a fantastic movie for children based on Boggy Creek Legend, though I do not know why they call it a return to Boggy Creek as if it were a sequel. This film has nothing to do with documentary film and its fantasies with children. Dawn Wells plays as the mother of three children who have lost themselves in Boggy Creek swamp with two other men and the monster comes to help them. Yes, it is very silly and the plot is furious, but this kind of film is ideal for the 8-12 year group that it focuses on. It's a harmless G-rated child fare and at least you do not have to worry about leaving your children alone as they watch it. Strictly for sets of 8-12 years, older children are bored and think it's lame.
