Not only was this movie better than all last season H: LOTS. But it was better than any movie I've ever seen for TV! When I look at the "Top 250," I'll see that it was just one small movie: How Grinch Stole Christmas. I think it's time to raise this group to 2. I admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this but I did not mind it. I just loved being able to rejoin the Baltimore Homicide Squad!
