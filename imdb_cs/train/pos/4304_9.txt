I remember seeing this movie when I was about 7 years old; and at the time shocked me. I've seen a violent film before, but I've never seen a movie with the consequences and reality of violence. This film not only shows but also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. What this movie did and the crash did not do was to be true. Crash tried to show how racism is bad (and Crash actually had built-in anti-Asian bias) and came out of a morally better position. The Grand Canyon has come to terms with such a rough and real view that it really ends up at a higher level than the crash. Especially when comparing endings. The end of the crash is this seemingly neat little end that links everything together. While the Grand Canyon just ends up in a quiet place where you know that nothing will change much in character's life, but that's because life just goes on, there's no suitable ending. No matter how good ... you are bad. There is no end of the chapter that could start another.
