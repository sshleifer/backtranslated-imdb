Writing words <br /> <br /> What you see is what you get. Not really! What makes the brave and brilliant Madhur Bhandarkar is to destroy the myth associated with glam and glitterati that stains the pages of our newspapers and whose lives (the reader's habits) follow with such a manic desire that can only be explained by our inner voyeurist lane. <br /> <br /> The phenomenon of page 3 is equally woeful and mysterious. How exactly she gained such control over the printed word, and when she began to interfere with the first page, is the subject of further debate. Bhandarkar is cleverly avoiding. He is only interested in the mechanisms of this grotesque existence. And it divides the various elements of this way of life. Like Robert Altman (although I compare Bhandarkar with Altman's genius), Bhandarkar uses countless characters for another motif. Whether it's Party 3, who wants to become an NRI, defending, a new rich, an upcoming model, a social politician or an erotic novelist; all characters are represented by the lens and each has a distinctive sketch character, even though their parts may be miniature. And the film refers to it. <br /> <br /> Sen Sharma plays Madhavi Sharma, a young and talented journalist who goes to page 3 for Nation Today. Initially satisfied with the work, he soon begins to see the ugliness of this chin, which is covered with his fake and cosmetic frustration. But Bhandarkar resists the temptation to make this subject into a film of moral police and avoid concentration on one character alone. The film is not just about Madhavi, but also about Deepak Suri (Boman Irani) - Madhavi's editor who passively accepts his role as the bigger machine Anjali Thapar (Soni Razdan) - the social nitrogen that suffocates from social pollution, Abhijeet (Rehan Engineer ) - a homosexual make-up artist and Madhavi's roommate Pearl (Sandhya Mridul) - an agitated airman and Gayatri (Tara Sharma) - aspirational actress. It seems impossible to adapt so many characters (and more) in one story, but full of credit to Nina Aror and Manoj Tyagi for writing a script. Dialogues of Sanjeeva Datta and Bhandarkar were written with great attention to detail. <br /> <br /> Any story, no matter how good, may come with a lack of real performance. Fortunately, they "push" with actors and not stars. Konkona goes through its authorial support. Ditto Boman. Sandhya Mridul gets the best written part, but she almost exaggerated. Atul Kulkarni is unnecessarily forgotten. Sometimes the director seems too keen to incorporate as much as possible (pedophilia, homosexuality, etc.). But the contexts in which they are used do not make them look fast. <br /> <br /> Finally, Bhandarkar's attempt satisfies our voyeurism, but one step further. He takes us inside the photographs and reveals to us the terrible reality of this sect of mankind, who seems to live in a different and distant world. They are the same people who have devoted themselves to the New Year's Eve, while a few hundred kilometers from their fellow citizens have been destroyed by natural vigor! Clever writing, skillfully crafted songs, capable performances, and a true sense of sincerity are what this film is worth despite the lack of finesse and poor production values. "Page 3" is an optimal way to enter the new year of cinemas. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> *** Excellent <br /> <br /> January 29, 2005
