I noticed that a lot of people who posted a post on "Kerching!" the album seems to hate this show, which I really find surprising. I think this is one of the best shows of British children. It's a shame that ends, because it's very fun (if it's a bit sweet) and has great characters. The main character is a bit like Del Boy, though he is much smarter. With his two best friends, he tried to make his million million pounds by launching an online store and adopting the pseudonym "Rudeboy." His friends are Seymour (who likes to cook) and Danny (which is a simple sense and comic character). During the show some characters were left and new ones came, but it was always fun and improving.
