This is an unbelievable return from the director of director Tsui Hark. It's one of the few movies he deserves to come face to face with Steven Chow's Shaolin Soccer. From the moment the movie was launched, there were brilliant backdrops at each edge, which were in a beautiful style. If you are a sci-fi or Chinese martial art "geek", you will love the excess of many 3D effects and realistic computer-generated weapons. There comes a great performance (as always) from Ekin Cheung, who plays "Sky King". He connects with Louis Koo (Red), who was very impressed by his flexible "wing", which diverted incoming attacks. The combat movement of these actors was perfect. Not only is the action great but has a rather complicated story. Many critics of this film complain about the lack of a story / theme, or just "stuck in random fragments of fragments" and even describe it as "The Legend of Poo". However, the viewer can not rely on watching Dragon Ballz and other similar Manga cats to understand this movie. Others who are famarialy with "Wu Xia" films will have a better name. With due respect. there may be one weakness that could be anticipated. The blow that was delivered by the enemy to the last combat scene could have been much more important and most importantly done. Despite all this, he must see.
