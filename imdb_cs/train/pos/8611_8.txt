I enjoyed watching this movie very much. I stretched him when watching to see me later. Actually, I enjoyed the second view more because I was able to absorb more clever dialogue between Natalia and Adam, the two main characters. I thought the way this story evolved was very thoughtful. I wondered how Natalie would work with her daughter's friends, at first she thought she was going to rush a lot of hostility, but as soon as she started working more pleasantly, I had to see how this visit would develop. I was not disappointed. Gradually the secret that Sarah kept from her mother began to reveal a daughter that was not so perfect, it was a faulty human being like most of us who wanted freedom from a dominant mother who thought she knew her daughter but unfortunately you have to learn in a very painful way, which sometimes really loves someone you have to give him the freedom. The audiences who got stuck with this movie have been very eager to see Diane Keaton (who is always great, even in some of her less well-received films - I think the city and the country). The final scene of Diane Keaton's home is worth waiting and reveals that anyone who loves other human beings must learn that we have to live our own lives, we love others, but we do not own them, and in the end we have to let go. It's a tough lesson, but it's worth considering here and there. Thank you CBS for this broadcast, it was worth a long wait.
