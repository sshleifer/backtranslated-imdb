Director Douglas Sirk once said that there is a very short distance between high art and waste, and rubbish that contains fools is closer to art thanks to this quality. This statement defines his cinema as a perfect, very unique work that includes classic scenic adaptations, adventure and war films, Westerns and, of course, its famous melodramas. <br /> <br /> Sirk melodies were, as it means, dramas with music. Music sets the tone for its master style and every tinge of his brush (Sirk was also a painter) leaves a strong image on the screen. But it is not life, but its representation, imitation of life. Sirk never tried to show reality, on the contrary. None of his generation's directors better used all of the technical equipment provided by Hollywood (most notably Technicolor) to distinguish the artist from the real thing. Remember that its golden period coincided with the time when Hollywood films focused on social drama (Blackboard Jungle, Rebel Without Cause). Sirk always knew the cinema was supposed to be something else. </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < to count the amount of mirrors and images displayed on the screen. One is finally giving up. <br /> <br /> That's why we're in a hall full of mirrors, where there's no difference between the real and the fake copy. No one can say that Hadley are real people. Such a city is not real, even with those transient oil pumps all over the place. So in this area is influenced by acting, decora is fake, the trick is visible. Everything is dialed out of the border (sexual connotation Dorothy Malone with an oil tower, for example). Sirk criticized and simultaneously theorized. <br /> <br /> `Angels are the director's thoughts; illumination is his philosophy. "In the letter of the wind, we follow the fall of the traditional way of life both in a geometric way and in light and shadows: the House of Hadleys with different levels connected by a spiral staircase works in a strictly metaphorical way. As the tragedy progresses from light daylight to shadowy night, Sirkova's photography becomes an extension of the inner state of his characters, as well as the colors of the clothes he wears.This drama is incorporated into every element in the service of the director's order. bent the standard material that was assigned to his style and purpose, written in the wind is a good example, it would not work in any other hand, and another director who used similar strategies was Frank Tashlin, who was the 50th comedy the same as Sirk for their melodrama, their movies are full of amerias commercials, TVs, jukeboxes, washing machines, sports cars, vacuum cleaners - depicting its emptiness and decay. I mean, their films are different from their current audience. The game was played on both sides, so it was a camp. Now we consider them "cult" or "bizarre" because we are no longer those viewers. That's why Todd Haynes's homage "Far from Heaven" becomes a pastime because nowadays he reproduces Sirko's work as though nothing happened between them. Then Sirk rotates exactly to the image hanging in the art gallery Julianne Moore and the gardener discuss in the above film. Sirk understood the melodrama elements perfectly. There were always still characters (Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall here), against whom he could compose a series of split. His equilibrium through opposites is remarkable, and it is not surprising that we will root rooted figures because they are the ones Sirk is also interested in. When Robert Stack flew a plane and "attempts" Lauren Bacall with all his worldly chambers underneath (obvious faint echoes), we are as strangely fascinated with him as we do when the girl nymphomanian little sister painfully evokes his past Mitch by the river. <br /> <br /> In the universe Sirk studios often posed "happy endings" have no negative impact. In fact, it worked great. Sirk liked the Greek tragedy and considered the happy end of Deux ex machine of his day. The final scene of the courtroom is so good and one must also remember that the whole movie is narrated in memories, so from the very beginning we know that the tragedy will fall over Hadley's conflict. <br /> <br /> There were many similarities between the lettering on the wind and the cry of the baptism. I totally agree, and I'm sure the parallel is not accidental. Both share the theme of an old powerful father who tried to keep his realm and protect his family. The temperamental son portrayed by Robert Stak has an amazing physical resemblance to Sonny Corleone in Jimmy Caan. The activity of fighting with a nurse's friend is symmetrical. Or the son in which the old one trusts is also common in both films, as both families bear the names of their city. Even details as a gateway that gives access to property and the surrounding area of ​​the house covered by the leaves suggest that Coppola had been written in the wind when setting up his championship. Since both films deal with the Power theme: gaining power, manipulating and inheriting it (even Kyle Hadley's sterility, an event that speeds up confusion, the problem is easily linked to the central theme of Power, in this case, the weakness in sexual power). The second great film, dealing with power and using American life as its representation, is Citizen Kane. First of all, we should not think about the similarities between Welles and Sirk's films, but there are many, from the beginning of the gas business as the origin of family assets to the fact that Mitch Wayne (Charles Hudson) as Charles Foster Kane was accepted by a teacher who had his own father alive. Amazingly, the same actor (Harry Shannon) performs both Wayne and Kane's fathers. This detail can not be a coincidence. Written on the wind is a masterpiece in every aspect, in design and vision, in style and technique, the culmination in the career of this wonderful director. Some say it's his best movie. In my opinion, "great obsession," "everything that heaven allows," "it's always tomorrow," and "imitation of life" are just as good. And for those who gave Sirka on the level of Dallas or Dinasty, I do not want a happy ending.
