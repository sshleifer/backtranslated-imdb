I thought Mr. Dreyfuss was perfect for his role as actor and dictator. His star, Mr. Julia, played his role as perfect. It was interesting to see how reluctant Richard Dreyfuss replaced the dictator against his will. But with this process, time and confidence have fallen. Since everything is happening for some reason in my life, I believe he was forced to replace the dictator because he was to stay there for the whole year he did. I guess he stayed because he had to see how good his life was compared to the poverty that Parador witnessed. I think he took too many things in his life and he needed to get serious control of reality by staying in that country for as long as he did. But ......... .. anyhow ........... that's why I gave this movie 7 out of 10.
