I saw "Ice Age" in the cinema and I loved the movie. Despite the fact that "Ice Age" has many shortcomings and scientific mistakes, such as people, sabers, dinosaurs and mammoths who live at the same time, and even where the story goes (looks like North America, for example), we can (if you are not very strong!) <br /> <br /> The planet enters the ICE AGE and many animals migrate to the south where it is warmer. Sid is a silly sloth that is left behind by his own family, who can no longer endure it. As he walks along the way, he meets Manfred, or as Manny says as a moody mammoth who does not care about extinction or immigration and goes north. Afraid of being caught easily, Sid decides to follow Manfred, and in the middle of his journey they have found a human mother with the child. Mother dies, but Manfred and Sid decide to take him and return the child to the people. Diego, one of the templates, decides to follow and help them go to the camp of the human camp. What Manfred and Sid do not know is that Diego comes from a saber clan who hates people and wants to kill a child, and pretends to betray both of them to become a sage. ◀ What happens transmite←σίουтo nějo HellSpyládoξο: Tα БайЛ Νοεμβρίου, prostatek,
