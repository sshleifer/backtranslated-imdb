Very rarely Denzil Washington makes a bad film and thinks about what Kevin Kline is doing, and in this case he has to be considered one of their best films. It's more about a film about how strong friendship can be more than Steve Biko's story, though we can see what a man is and how far a reporter and friend, Donald Woods, was going to keep the name of a man and let the world know what was corrupt, torn society South Africa. The direction is excellent from David Attenborough, as was the case with Gandhi, although there is some criticism that should be targeted, that could be in the length of the film. Two and a half hours is a long time to sit in a historic movie. What's amazing is how he can control all extras. Thousands of people in both films. This film really opens your eyes to what happened before the decay of Aparthiet and you can not let him move. 8 out of 10.
