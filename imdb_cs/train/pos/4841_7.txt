In the colonies, we are not all familiar with Arthur Askey, so I almost missed this film (which he had recently seen on TCM) due to negative comments on his performance in "Ghost Train" - which I expected to be thoroughly annoying. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised when I heard it. The physical aspects of Askey's comedy and his timing on the delivery of the line indicate what you would get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen were children. There is no comparison with Bud Abbott or another common comic that appears in films of this genre. One can also feel the thread connecting Askey with the British comedy 30 years later; at least it is clear from the American point of view that he has more to do with Monty Python than all his counterparts. Regarding the rest of the movie - the more movies you've seen, the more likely it will be the guess at the end, but it's still quite fun and atmospheric, and it's worth waiting for its next look.
