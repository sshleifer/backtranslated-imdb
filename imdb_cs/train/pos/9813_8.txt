This episode introduced Holodeck into the world of TNG. Jarada has to be contacted and a precise greeting must be delivered or it would be very insulting. Tired Picard decides to go to Holodeck and begins an amazing adventure. The settings are excellent and almost cinematic. Unfortunately, the Jarada probe sent shortly thereafter will damage the holodeck and all safety devices will cease to work. Picard and now guests have to overcome the mobsters of the American gangs and return to the Jarade meeting. Picard greets Jarad correctly, and a new day begins between humanity and Jarada. This jewel of the first episode of the season has set a holodeck for many interesting and unusual adventures to be there
