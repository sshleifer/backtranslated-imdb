Perfect cast for several personal drama. Simon is dead, but somehow resurrected from the outside. What he saw was depicted as blank spots that were orchestral to the great score of the German avant-garde composer Werner Henze. Simon is haunted by his death, pleased with the support of the death he saw on the other side. His girlfriend is trying to keep him alive, but he can not, he decides to follow him after his death. Very sensitive and moving, deeply psychological, but a little slow and somewhat boring.
