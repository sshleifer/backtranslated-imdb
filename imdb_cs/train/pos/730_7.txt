I like the movie I remembered that was a very well done scene in which Riff Randell (played by PJ Soles) is lying in bed, and for the first time she will introduce Ramones to her room with her song "I Want You Around "... very very cool stuff. It was fun, energetic, strange and cold. Yes, I admit that the end is overhead and far attracted ... but it does not matter because it's fun, it's a very funny movie. It's sex, pot and rock n Rocll forever <br /> <br /> I read that the cheap trick was a group that originally had to play in this .. But I do not know whether it's true or not
