I love Sabrina! Her one of my favorite shows !! My favorite episodes are; in which Libby turns to a geek, the first episode, a true love episode, and most of the others in the first series. I think the episodes at school were not as good as you did in high school, but they were better than the last series that was terrible. Valerie was a good figure because she was more rounded than Jenny, but Jenny was in some great episodes. Hilda and Zelda were amazing and there seemed to be no explanation of where they went! Libby was also a good figure. I never liked Morgan or Roxy, they just were not as good as her other friends.
