Brokedown Palace is the story of two of the best friends, Alice and Darlene, who go on a spontaneous trip to Thailand and end up in jail after being caught with drugs in their luggage. In this way, the film had the potential to turn into a serious and moving film, such as "Return to Paradise," but instead the film decided to focus little on the girl's situation and more on their friendship. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both excel in their performances and the film is more about the interplay between them - suspicion, jealousy, questioning and testing their friendship, and eventually the victims who are doing in the name of friendship. This film decides not to be deeply immersed in politics or even in the hardness of prison life (which is a bit shiny) and focuses more on these friendship issues. and some parts that did not seem plausible or realistic. We did not feel the real fear or hopelessness of their situation as we could have. And we get only a little feeling outside the prison wall, where Bill Pullman plays an allegedly dirty lawyer who really turns out to have a golden heart. In short, this would seem to be a much darker film than it was. <br /> <br /> But overall I enjoyed it. The acting was good, the soundtrack was perfect and the plot had enough twists and turns to stay interesting. Worth seeing.
