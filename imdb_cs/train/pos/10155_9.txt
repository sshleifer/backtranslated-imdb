I can not understand negative comments about this movie. Yes, it is a typical romance with the boy who meets the girl, but it happens with such taste and shine that time is just flying. Henstridge (how to talk about winning the gen-pool lottery!) Is it as magnetic and tempting as ever before (who says the golden age of the cinema is dead?) And Vartan holds his own. <br /> <br /> two wires; the movie is the most alive when sharing a scene - a lot! It's so good that you find yourself willing to gather them ... <br /> <br /> Ignore negative comments - if you feel a little blue, look at this movement, you will feel much better. If you are already happy then you will be euphoric. <br /> <br /> (PS: I am 33, a man from Great Britain and a hopeless romantic still looking for his princess ...)
