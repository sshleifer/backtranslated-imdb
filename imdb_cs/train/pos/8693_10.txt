I was quite young when it came out in the US but I shot it from television and watched it again and again until I realized it. Until today, I still catch myself when I quote it. The exhibition itself was cheerful and had many well-known characters, from Frank Sinatra, to Sylvester Stallone, to T. Voices were great and sounding the same as the figures they displayed. The puppets were also well done, though a little scary. I was surprised to find out recently that it was written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor of Red Dwarf, which is a show I like very much. Just like another person wrote in a comment earlier, I was also robbed of this great "friend" show, which he borrowed and never returned. I would definitely want this show to be a sufficient demand that would require the release of a DVD, but I do not think that enough people have heard about it. Well, maybe I'll try e-bay ...
