While I'm not a fan of musicals, I loved Fred Astair and Ginger Rogers because they are just fun. Sure, they can be a little formal, but even if you know what's going on, they're still very nice to watch. However, despite that, I was a little disappointed in this trip. Part of it was because this movie does not have the great support you saw in TOP HAT or DANCE. Without Edward Everett Horton or Eric Blore, the film seems to be a bit inadequate - especially in the entertainment department. The silly prints of these supporting actors gave the other movies a spell that you simply do not get with FOLLOW THE FLEET. In addition, unlike the usual character Astaire plays, this is more sad - as his fat head repeatedly brings Rogers problems. And as a result, it's much harder to love or you want to see them together at the end of the movie. Moreover, even though Irving Berlin is the music, the songs do not seem unforgettable. In fact, none of the songs were so exceptional and I can not remember them even though I just saw the movie. While this is still a cute and useful film, it lacks the spark and charm of some of their other films. Good, but far from great.
