I'm only 11 years old, but I found Full House when I was about five, and I kept looking until I was seven. Then I grew old and realized that Full House could wait and that I had "more important" things. It was also the fact that my younger brother, who had been faithful to me for two years, had begun to think he was "girlish". <br /> <br /> Then I realized that every fifth afternoon was five, it was 23 years old and I became addicted to it again. The whole house laughed and wept. I realized how nice it would be if our world was like the world of Full House plus mummy. I heard people say Full House is shabby and unbelievable. But look at the big picture: three girls whose mother was killed by a drunken driver. Nurses fight and fear their feelings. The three men who live with girls can sometimes get into trouble. What is still real? <br /> <br /> If something happens, it will lift me when I'm down and bring me even higher when I thought I was at the point of total happiness. I screamed like hyena at the show and got a huge obsession over Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course, Hilary Duff took the place, but they were literally the cutest kids I've ever seen, they're great actresses, and they seem to be very nice people.)
