Time is a future, and for many it does not realize that day is now. In this last film of legendary actor Edward G. Robinson, "Solent Green" becomes a classic landmark. Many movie fans and ecologists believe this is our last story. The film is taken from the novel called "Make a Peace, Make Space", but the one who works has been changed to "Solent Green". The story concerns Earth as it evolves into the future when world environmental problems are nothing but disastrous. The planet's natural resources have been exhausted and basic food has been truncated to simple staples. They come in different colors, such as Solent Yellow, Solent Red and now Solent Green. But there are those who know the "real" ingredient in Solent Green, collecting for their own fault and fearing divine retribution. The first is the dining director William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton). After his death, a secret police detective called Robert Thorn (Charleston Heston) is looking for the truth for his apparent suicide. Though corruption goes to the top, it begins with Simson's bodyguard, Tad Fielding (Chuck Connors) and Security Director Donnovan (Roy Jenson), who focuses on Thorn Factory Waste Removal. Thorn's boss, Lieutenant Hatcher (Brock Peters), believes his suspicions, but warns him of those "Higher and Hot" who want to close the case, but Thorn will not risk his "Job" for an easy way out. What Thorn discovers, it marks him as death, but as a film, the last warning is waiting. ****
