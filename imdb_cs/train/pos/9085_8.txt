I see a lot of really negative contributions from people who wrote in August, although the film was not released in the US at least until mid-September. Perhaps they are the unfortunate people who live in South Korea who saw her soon. I'm in the US and I saw it today. I thought the special effects were superior, better than a trailer. The story was not Western, but I think we're all accustomed to it from many other films. It was not difficult to follow him at all. The management effects were weak, but the other people were pretty good. There was humor. I rated it at the age of 8 because I watched well why I went.
