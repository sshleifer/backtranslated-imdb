******** Spoilers - Careful ********* <br /> <br /> What can I say? I'm interested in Urban Cowboy. I love it and I've seen it countless times - and every time I find out something new about it. <br /> <br /> I think one of the things I like is that Urban Cowboy is about working class, not wealthy people who live in LA or New York. Well, except Pam. <br /> <br /> Travolta plays Bud, a small town in Texas that moves to Houston to work on oil fields. And just as Travolta actually played in good dramatic films such as Saturday Night Fever instead of playing stereotypical bad guys / good guys in big budget movies. It's a really good movie - a competition for mechanical bull riding and two-stage dances can be stupid, but you have to enjoy it for what it is. <br /> <br /> Bud will meet Sissy (played by Debra Winger with slutty brilliance) - and soon they are married and live in their dream trailer. But their relationship becomes a real battle for sex. Bud wants to be a real cowboy. Sissy wants to be a real cowboy. But in modern times, the roles of men are not so clear. Where can Bud prove he's a real man? At night, he can work with dangerous work and at night drive a mechanical bull - he can be a "city cowboy." But Sissy wants to drive his pick-up truck and wants to drive a mechanical bull. So where does Bud leave it? As Sissy claims to be independence, he lies on a bull rider and flirts with a former and prison rodeo star - a true bull rider - Wes (played by an amazingly greedy Scott Glenn). Bud is threatened and Bud and Sissy say goodbye. Sissy is hiding with Wes who abuses her. Future will continue, Bud becomes a toy of Pam, a rich girl whose dad is in the oil and everything that it means. Sissy comes to the trailer to clean her - Pam does not do that. He writes a letter to Bud, but Pam is torn apart and takes note of Sissy's housework. <br /> <br /> Bud's uncle Bob dies tragically at work, lightening bets and causing an explosion. Bud and Sissy have a chance of reconciliation, but they are too stubborn. Later, the mechanical bull race is at Gilley's and you know Bud will win. Pam realizes that Bud does not like her, but Sissy - she did for her. Wes is trying to heal Gilley, but you do not know that the city cowboy, Bud, saves the day and win back the woman he loves. Of course, you can ask why Bud and Sissy go to Gilleys every night and "live like the pigs." It may have contributed to their bad marriage. Or why Bud did not stay with Pam - she was not so bad and had money. Or why they had to kill Uncle Bob. Or why Bud and Sissy had such stupid friends as Marshall and Jessie, who always tried to break: Marshall says to Buda: "Sissy is driving the bull better than you!" But part of Urban Cowboy's fun is a bit of fun - and it's not Bonnie Raitt on the stage!
