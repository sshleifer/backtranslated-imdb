If a show deserves 10 in the last ten years, it's a precious gem. It allows us to escape back to the time when things were easier and fun. Heart full of heart and laughing, this show will keep you in thirty years of difference. The furniture was ugly, the clothes were varied, and the drugs were tolerable. The hair was feathered, the music was accompanied by roller-skates, and according to Merle Haggard's words, "The joint was a bad place to be". Go back to the greatest time in American history. Fall in love with the characters and feel the good essence of a small town where people were nicer. This classic is on TV as well as "Full House". Do not miss it and always remember that you "crumble your groove!"
