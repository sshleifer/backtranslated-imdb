In the old blank tape sound ad, was the "Is this real or is it Memorex?" The same thing can be said about the events in this episode - compilation and remix "The Cage", the first Star Trek pilot. Mr. Spock skillfully caused the ship to reach the forbidden planet Talos IV to return Captain Christopher Pike, his first captain, who was burned and paralyzed. Why is it finagling? Because Talos IV has some contact at all, he calls for death. Why it is, it is never explained - it bothered me enormously - but if nothing else, it adds to the story. After taking the ship to Talos IV, Mr. Spock turns to Dr. McCoy's (the oldest officer's gift, Captain Kirk was out of the ship) was arrested and said, "The charge is a rebellion, Dr I never received a command to take over the ship." This is followed by a martial trial in which - thanks to the Talosians - apparent paralysis) that Captain Pike had come to Talos IV even at the risk of Mr Spock's death. Illusions created by the Talosans, background music and the whole story are fantastic. And Meg Wyllie as Keeper (Talosian Head) is amazing. Call me a sexist, but I never thought I had a woman in this role, but she was perfect! Talosians, who have given up almost all physical activity and almost rely entirely on the power of illusion, are also unisex; you can not really tell if they are men or women and it really does not matter. This episode, more than just everyone else in the series, brings me hope and pray that there are other worlds and that there are civilizations that are so much more advanced! What a delightful thing if it was so! This is one of my favorite episodes, and no matter how many times I've seen them (even on a video), it never touches me. Meg Wyllie looks like a stranger and I do not mean it is infallible.
