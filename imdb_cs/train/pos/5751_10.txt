What can I say about this movie? I've seen it a couple of times since I was the first time around 6. I saw the English version and it's very good. It's a great movie for all ages but it's more for kids. I love childhood humor and I appreciate it. If you have not seen them, you should rent a copy, you will not be disappointed!
