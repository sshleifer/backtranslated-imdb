"GEORGE LOPEZ," in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I have not seen every episode, but I still enjoy it. There are many episodes that I enjoyed. One of them was where Amy (Sandra Bullock) entered the moving machine. If you want to know why, you have to see it yourself. Before I wrap it, I would like to say that everyone has always been good, the design was magnificent, the costumes were well designed, and the writing was always very strong. Finally, although new episodes can be seen at the moment, I strongly recommend that you catch them only if they are completely discharged from the air.
