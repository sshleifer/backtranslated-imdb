While reading the remarks I left for this show, I could not even notice that a large percentage of the reviewers either did not actually see any episodes of the show, whether they were traveling all the way or freely. The thing about Kerching! is that it's a kids show, FOR CHILDREN, of course, if your elders will look like cheese, forced and probably stupid. I even found one person who says the sets are stupid, but I remember the eight-year-old man wondering why Taj had ice forms on the wall and wondered if my parents would leave a sticker on my (did not). Yeah, that may be unpleasant, acting might be better and some of the characters do really strange things with their hair, but as a children's show, I rate 10/10. Compared to the things that are vacuuming today, well, just let me say that I wish it was re-broadcast. DVD release, anyone?
