It's rare, now to find a romantic comedy that is not incredibly disgusting in short films (such as Great Greek Wedding, Me, Myself & Irene). There were only a few unnecessarily witty jokes in this movie, nothing unimaginably unfortunate. Everywhere, it was a cute movie with nice characters. I thought the end was a little awkward. They feel they should end up in the world series to actually bang into the goal. Negotiations were a bit desirable but adjusted at the pace of the story. If I knew it was a film from the Farrelly brothers, I would have assumed that it would be a stomach that would change a piece of waste and did not see it, but it seems that they too are capable of making a good movie. Good for them, I hope they'll lift their heads for the rest of the way and start making good movies all the time.
