Probably I doubled my knowledge of Iran when I saw Secret Ballot (2001). Now, about four times more (I doubt I learned a lot from the Not Without My Dairy series (1991)). Offside is a great budget of the Iranian comedy about a girls group (work individually) to take part in a decisive soccer match for their country's World Cup venue. Women are not allowed to attend soccer matches, so the national armed forces have been mobilized to save all women trying to enter. Some (Teens?) Girls try to crash party dressing as boys, but they are caught. The film is mostly located on this bracket, where girls are held by soldiers and waiting for some unspecified punishment (though a girl who dressed as a soldier claims to be a badge to be executed!) <br /> <br / > The film examines the absurdity of the situation. Thinking that prevents women from soccer matches comes to the point that it is too horrible experience for fairer sex - a philosophy that is not unknown in the West less than 100 years ago. This farce appears in the head when the girl has to go to the bathroom, so a soldier accompanied by her requests to cover her eyes, so she can not see graffiti. The conflict does not only concern the battles of gender: at some point friction occurs between the stronger population and the urban girls. Fortunately, this film was not so culturally esoteric that comedy was lost to this neighbor and cultural cousin of the Great Satan. You have to be in the mood, but no one should avoid this movie because they think they will not get it.
