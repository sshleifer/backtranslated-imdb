My favourite movie! I've seen a lot of movies, but this is all! Excellent acting, wonderful story. You will be like a "normal" caregiver to begin to love George. Although he is an actor, he is also a very and very nice person. And the most important thing about maba: you learn to respect and look different than people with Down Syndrome.
