The greatest surprise in this film was actress Daryl Hannah. Rather than play the stereotypical blonde role he usually does, he plays a smart, intelligent, cheerful figure. She does not play a huge role, but she does a great job in which Lois Harlan performs as a woman who was tired, although she was accustomed to covering herself because of her boss's insubordination.
