I saw it at the Mill Valley Film Festival. It's hard to believe that it's Miss Blom's directorial debut, it's a beautiful performance and playing. The big character cast could come from Anna Tyler's novel, that means they are layered with story and potential future, there are no fake notes, surprising bursts of humor in the middle of itself caused by anxiety and very real, non-land-breaking dilemmas. If you've seen "The Best of Youth," you'll know how well the drawings are built with little moments, even when the story moves alive. I really hope it will develop in the US. I live in a relatively sophisticated film market, but we rarely get Swedish movies of any kind.
