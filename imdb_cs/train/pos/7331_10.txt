At the time of magic, barbarians and demons have been over the Devil tyrant named Nekhron and his mother, Queen Juliana, who lives in the icy area and wants to conquer the area of ​​fire that King Jerol ruled, but when his beautiful daughter, Princess Teegra, was kidnapped, Nekhron is a goons named Larn must protect her and have to defeat Nekhron from taking over the world and the kingdom by using the vengeful name Darkwolf. Nicely done and excellent underrated animated fantasy epic that (rotoscoping) is the second best Ralph Bakshi movie, "American Pop", number one, and "Heavy Traffic" is third and "Wizards" is the fourth. It's definitely better than his "Cool World" or "Lord of the Rings", the artwork is designed by the famous artist Frank Farzett and the animation is good in color and there is also a hottie for boys. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to fans of fantasy and animation everywhere, especially a new limited edition 2-disc DVD from Blue Underground. <br /> <br /> We also recommend: "Black Boiler", "The Dark Crystal", "Conan Barbar", "Wizard of Oz", "Rock & Rule", "Wizards", "Heavy Metal", "Starchaser : Legend of Orinus, Fantastic Planet, Princess Mononoke (1978), "The Sword in the Stone", "Excalibur", "Army of Darkness", "Krull", "Konan The Destroyer", "Willow" Dragonheart " "King Arthur", "Hobbit", "The Return of the King (1980)", "Conquest", "American Pop", "Jason and The Argonauts", "The Clash of the Titans", "The Secret of NIMH" Dragons, Hercules (Disney), Legend, Chronicles of Narnia, Harry Potter, and the Goblet of Fire.
