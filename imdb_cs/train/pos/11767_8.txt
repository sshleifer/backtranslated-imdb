What a good movie! Made Men is a great action movie with lots of twists and turns. James Belushi is very good as a former kid who stole 12 million from the boss who must fear the gangsters, his wife's hillbillies and local sheriff (Timothy Dalton). You will not be disappointed, jump aboard and enjoy your ride. 8 out of 10
