Some of the guys who watch movies and complain about them for a living are forgetting something: DVD menu system. I'm telling people that I was looking at the main screen to repeat this about 35 times. It was amazing. A cinematic tapestry of cascading shine, which made me hear from where it was, which was just the beginning. Many times the amount and Bam! I was addicted. Over and over again. And finally. <br /> <br /> "Doot de doot, de doo de dodedo." And that's just a soundtrack! <br /> <br /> I was put in bed and coiled with my Vaio. The rain is on a flat roof and today it is soft soft. The cat is comfortable and my ankle that passes through me is resting. I jumped to the DVD. I was fascinating. Overnight. "doot de doot, de doo de dodedo." <br /> <br /> Blob. Look at that. Steve Queen, two cops and one girl in a dress. Two inches up!
