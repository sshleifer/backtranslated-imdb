I found it still crazy to be amazingly entertaining, not just to those of us who had experienced the terrible era of the late 1960s, early 70s. My 15-year-old daughter always follows me when I get a DVD (do not worry, it's only three times) and she loves it too. It's a really loving, sad and cheerful nod to the era and every actor with his perfection will hit perfection. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy, and I'm glad that his similar turn in "Love actually" brought him more attention. Bruce Robinson was unbelievable as Brian, bringing real life to what could have been the cartoon of a disrupted drug rocker stereotype. It was interesting to see that Robinson became a writer for himself. I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first story I saw a movie I found on Billy Connolly. (he lived at that time) and told him it was one of my five favorite films of all time. He invited me to sit with him in the dining yard and talk about him for a while. We even talked about the idea of ​​an American-oriented remake before wisely rejecting it. Why a mess with the original? My only problem with "Still Crazy" is that it was not very popular in theaters and too many people missed a wonderful experience.
