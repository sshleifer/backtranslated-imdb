I'm 14, so you probably think I've never heard of George Burns or Walter Matthau or something like that. The boy is wrong. I heard that George Burns was in this film and he was awarded an academic prize for him. I've been a fan of George Burns since I was ten years old. I saw the movie Oh, God recently and loved it. This was also very amazing. George Burns did a great job. So did Walter Matthau (it's the first time I've ever seen him). And although they had really small roles, Phyllis Diller and Steve Allen did a good job. That strange they were filming would be amazing if it was really done. Let me tell you, if you are a fan of George Burns or Walter Matthau, you should see this movie right now!
