On the outskirts of São Paulo, the very deep secrecy of the dysfunctional and hypocritical family Teodoro (Giulio Lopes), Claudia (Leona Cavalli) and teenager Soninha (Sílvia Lourenço) have a very low secret. Religious Teodoro is a really hit-man, hired to kill people in the neighborhood of his friend Waldomiro (Ailton Graça). She has a mistress, a very devoted wife, Terezin (Martha Meola), and wants to regenerate her and go with her. Cláudia has a young lover, Júlio (Ismael de Araújo), who supplies his father's butcher's meat. Soninha is a regular sixteen-year-old teenager from the periphery who has an active sex life, smokes grass and loves heavy metal. When Julius is killed and castrated in his neighborhood, the lives of family members are changing. <br /> <br /> "Contra Todos" is a great low budget Brazilian movie that portrays life on the outskirts of a large Brazilian city. The story is very real, it uses the usual elements of the poor areas of the big Brazilian cities (drug dealers, men, fanatic religious evangelical people, hopeless teenagers, etc.). It has lots of points and a surprising end, and characters have excellent performances that act very natural and make the story completely believable. The camera follows the characters and gives the film a great momentum. In DVD themes, director Roberto Moreira explains that his script contained no rows, only a description of the situation, and was only partially unveiled just a week before the start of the shootout. Actors have workshops in the workshops and use a lot of improvisation, which is the reason for such a natural action. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Contra Todos" ("Against All")
