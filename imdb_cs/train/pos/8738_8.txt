Bugs Life is a great movie that is not only for children but also for adults. The story is based on an ant colony and their struggle against the evil Grasshoppers who return each year and steal their food (Mirror Magnifiscent seven). There is some wonderful computer animation and the voices are also great. You will be glad! 8 out of 10
