Ok movie about Downs syndrome. Mother has twins, one is very sick, the other is good but has falls. Mother does not think he can resurrect him, so he gives it to people who have 15 children 11 who have crashes! my mother does not like it and she thinks she should be with her family (I also agree) to take her to court and the family breaks and grandparents lose, never tells if my mother and daughter makeup? I think this movie is good, but the plot is known, it's still good and has a few unintentional laughs!
