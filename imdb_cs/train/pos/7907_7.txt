I could not agree with the evaluation that was given to this film, and I believe it is a demonstration of how the short-term majority of viewers are all over the world. Really ... Do you forget that the cinema was some art before some monsters tried to make fun? This movie is not fun, at least not the easy fun you get on movies such as Titanic or Gladiator. It has style, it is different, it is shocking ... That is why most of you hated it so much: because it does not try to be pleasant. It's just a story, I remember very much, but after all, it's a weird story. It's not a great story or great cinema, but I think it's worth the 7-star rating for the courage of both the author and the director to make a story that is not pleased with the audience, selling billions of copies and making even bigger riches. This film is for me a film of a European art film created in the US, and everyone who plays it deserves respect. Whether it's for courage or for a unique sense of humor.
