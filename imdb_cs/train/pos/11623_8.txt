(You'll know what I mean after seeing the red eye ...) <br /> <br /> Overall, Red Eye was better than expected thriller. It slowly begins and slowly moves. But at the time it's over, it's a bum! <br /> <br /> It's hard to define exactly what this thriller does as ... exciting as I found it. Besides, she just said that the director did a lot of work that brought you to what would otherwise be a conspiracy. I tended to forget that I was watching the movie. That sounds a lot. <br /> <br /> I think the other factors are the "closeness" of the victim and the bad guy ... and that in the meantime you really start to relate to the victim. Rate 8 out of 10, more like 7.5 ... but it's pretty good!
