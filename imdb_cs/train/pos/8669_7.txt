Unlike some local commentators, you will not show class war and do not mind when you see the lives of other people who are fairly successful, extroverted, bohemian (gas) and not horribly angry at parties and get into all sorts of problems because it's not a bad movie, closer to European cinema, rather than imitation of the usual slippery American crap ... I believe the minimal sound design and the cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than a bad film, It will prevent it, the film is no worse as a result, and it brings attention to the cast , some of them are really good (Kate Hardie - she thinks it's her name because sarcastic drunk is spot-on), except for David Baddiel, who should never be found in serious matters! It's light and we are not in this country but if you do not have any real party buddies than you could do worse than sitting and watching this.
