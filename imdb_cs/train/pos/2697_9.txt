Nothing Revolutionary; just an immaculately elegant, limited cinema. GARDE AND VUE is almost exclusively located at a police station, and especially in one of the investigating rooms, but director Claude Miller (who has created the wonderful film TOMTO SWEET SICKNESS among others) intercalates alternate views of the exterior tables as a minimalistic scenography setting. Miller's restraint, especially early on, is breathtaking, and his excellent handling of the mission-en-scene's in-the-interior interior makes a keen eye. Lino Ventura is as good as usual, and he is quick to legitimize the character of clich√© on paper: a laconic, stubborn detective killed in the world. Ventura lives so credible, although the script allows us little access to its internal processing; the film ends when it appears to be forced to face its failure for the first time. Michel Serrault equals the task as a suspect child killer, thinking flick. The exchanges between these two are more-often-than-not-pregnant tensions and the aura constantly metamorphosing playing field for the battle of wit. Serrault's figure is again pious and chaste and wise; then later .... "The GARDE A VUE report, if one was looking for one, is condemning the police methodology and the type of pressures that make the policeman too excited, closing cases at the expense of justice if necessary. Most of its length, though the film shines like nothing but an example of turning a potentially soporific set-bound scenario into a thrilling drama in the highest cinematographic economy. <br /> <br />
