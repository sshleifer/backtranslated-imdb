When I first saw this movie, in 1958 in London, I was disguised. I've never seen such a movie. He had a strange, hypnotic effect quite different from the films I'd seen before and left a lasting impact. I believe Odile Versios and Marina Vlady are sisters, if not twins. This interaction is certainly amazing in its power to affect the viewer. <br /> <br /> If it was converted to DVD - in Region 2 format - and in the original French language I would like to hear about it and where to buy it.
