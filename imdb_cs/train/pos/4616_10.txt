The title of this film is taken from a party called "Seven Minutes in Heaven". The game was popular among my husband's friends when he was in junior high school in Brooklyn, NY, and describes it as something like "Spin-the-Bottle", "Lifesaver Relay" and other preteen kissing games. By the rules, the boy's name is drawn, and the girl and the pick are ordered to get into the dark wardrobe together and stay there for seven minutes. Meanwhile, there would be speculation among the party's guests as to whether or not they have the nerves of holding their hands, hugging and / or kissing each other in the privacy of the cabinet. At the end of seven minutes the leading game said, "Time is up" or knock on the door of the cabinet and the couple emerges from the cabinet. After being asked by other guests, the couple would have to admit what they did during their "Seven Minutes in Heaven". Then other pairs would be chosen to enter the cabinet until all the guests were attending. The pair who signed up for the most would be the winners of the game. Such games served as social "breakers" for children and youth, but they may be embarrassing and intimidating to shy people. The film won this title because it deals with the first experiences of teens with crushing and romantic love.
