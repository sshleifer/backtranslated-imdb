_Les Acteurs_ is an absurd story by Jean-Pierre Marielle, who desperately waits for a cup of hot water, a plot of plot against the actors, a story of aging actors whose career is slower than the former but stunning contributions of French actors and their cinemas. Supported by a strong reflection on cinema and acting (fourth wall, hidden cameras, playing or not to play), the story of this film, in which most of the famous actors play their own roles (not allowed to live in front of the camera - the movie is not a voyeur) is quite vague and follows the actors in a series of episodes that make the movie fun. When Andr√© Dussolier leaves the film and leaves Josiane Balasko to play her role (a great actress, he's terribly serious, especially when he plays Dussolier's roles) while the actors are running on the street, asking for autographs, and gossiping is happening, we recognize the passion of other scenes , in which everyone (or others) played. <br /> <br /> In fact, for those who do not know the actors (most of them at least 50 years old) do not know the French cinema, this film is less interested because most of the links will be missing but will still offer a good track reflection on aging, about acting, about public life ...
