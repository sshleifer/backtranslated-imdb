Series 2 has a great start! I do not think you should watch series 1 to realize what's going on, but like every series it's nice to feel some sense of the characters and take care of what's going to happen to them. And this show thinks like this! It seems that these 4 30-something women lead charming and exciting lives, but the assumption is credible and realistic. So the twists and turns that come from their love and sexual life are exciting to watch, but you also know that these are problems that happen to real women as well. It's about the decisions we make as women, and how we are sometimes guided by certain paths in our lives rather than consciously making such decisions!
