"Cut" is a full-fledged spoof of the genre of slasher and mainly achieves what to do. Most standard slasher clays are there; old scary house, woods, anonymous indestructible serial killer, gore buckets and of course a couple interrupted by a killer while they have sex (that's barely a spoiler). <br /> <br /> The set - it's simple in itself: the movie shuffle went on to finish the unfinished Slasher "masterpiece", unfinished due to the murders of several actors. It's also neat - okay, wrong - with Kylie Minogue in the first reel. They are linked by one of those who survived the original film played by Molly Ringwald who completely steals the film because it gets all the best lines. The rest of the cast is fine, particularly beautiful Jessica Napier, who plays her straight while the quarrel and gore erupt around her. There are plenty of red herrings and fake exciting moments, and there's very little time trying to figure out who's a killer because the movie moves at such a fast pace. It also has a suitable low budget, including some clumsy adjustments that are probably deliberate. Good soundtrack too. If this is a problem with this movie, it's a matter of whether it's a broadcast or a poem of the slasher genre. Probably a little bit of both.
