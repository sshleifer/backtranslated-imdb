The biggest games of Kasparov or Fischer may be a mess for a complete newcomer. That's a great movie. There is no special agency on the land. That's a clue! This is a private plot built as a private enterprise. This is a self-destructive and self-organized plot. In conclusion, the script described the perfect professional plot: private, self-organized, self-destructive, with no trace at the end. Behind the plot can be someone: an intelligent "director" with some money. All can only be done by delegation. The "Director" must be a starter. If a normal viewer does not see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the movie, the actual plot is less likely to appear. All actors perform well, with special attention to Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney.
