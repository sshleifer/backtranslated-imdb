CITY HALL is a little mixed bag. Part of the vintage NYC political life and part moralizing story. Al Pacino, Dukakis-esque Boss with presidential dreams, often gives an idle or subdued performance. There are several times when it chews the landscape and in the case of CITY HALL it is the place where it shines. John Cusack gives a subdued and generally flawless performance without getting into the cartoon of the new Orleans dialect or moving into the melodrama during the movies of the climax. Danny Aiello as a political chief is also very good. I like showtunes, too. The main problem with CITY HALL, and it's a good movie in many ways, is the general feeling of lack of momentum. It is more a documentary than a film. We see the action or we follow the story from a separate perspective and naturally the viewer does not join. When the viewer does not engage to a certain extent, they become apathetic towards the characters and ultimately the plot. It tends to be alienated and what should be the hateful detail that published the final came as "Hmmm ... uh ... okay." They say that you can not fight the town hall as you run the clutch on the tread. Still, it still can not stop you thinking what might be if you tighten the screenplay and movement of the movie.
