Being an otaku from Robotech, I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite animes of all time. Because of when it was made, the animation is of excellent quality. There are no loops and sequences in which art reduces quality. Although the last episode is in black and white, it does not release the film's attention. Although it was described as "sappy," it should be borne in mind that women do not respond in the same way as men. Given that the main character is a woman, it should be clear that she does not necessarily resort to "macho-man" tactics to gain respect for her peers. Seiryuu for Noriko also plays Akane in Ranma 1/2. Noriko is just as three-dimensional as a cartoon; her personality captures the essence of a lively girl who seems to be totally powerless at first, but eventually succeeds in the will of her will. The only complaint I have is that the mache looked a bit like a teddy bear. Even Gunbuster uses relatively dubious "Homing Laser" and "Buster Shield" (which is nothing more than having the machine wrap a huge velvet cloak around in the true Dracula style). I doubt the scene should be funny, but it broke me. Overall, I would throw Gunbuster in the first 20 anime of all time.
