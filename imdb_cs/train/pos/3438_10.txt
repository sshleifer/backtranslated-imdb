The film was very exceptional despite the NC-17 rating and disturbing scenes. In fact, such things happen, and that's why this movie shows a lot of it. Everything starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in an excellent performance), whose recently attended college has everything for her. He meets Jared (Chad Faust in an amazing performance) at a frat party that turns out to be a real gentleman and sweet. She invites her to dinner. They look at the stars from the bridge and end up in their apartment. They talk and take her to the cellar when they become flirtatious. He's trying to end it, but he raped her. This incident scratched her. She goes to the club to meet the barman / DJ Adrian (Marcus Patrick plays great), who sees he's drunk and helps before he goes far. They become friends. He also makes drugs, and Maya is also using it. In other words, it introduces it to another world. She starts going to school and works as TA (teacher) and portrays Jared as one of the students. While the students take Midterm, Jared will catch cheating. Jared tries to quench the Maya, but she still decides to invite him to his place. Will history repeat itself? Or Will Maya surprise Jared? You're watching the movie. Outstanding A. Rosario Dawson shows a role with focus and endurance. Chad Faust does not like being a bully, but he does a terrific job like Jared. Marcus Patrick is a very great man who saves the Maya and brings her to the new world. This film deserves awards.
