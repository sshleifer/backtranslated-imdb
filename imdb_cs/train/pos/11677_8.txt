I loved the Long Bike and I did not even realize I was in Dakar until I saw it in the local supermarket field. I bought it and after a bit "hmm it will be so good" the first episode I decided it was. Charlie Boorman was as good as other crew members. It's great to see him again with Ewan. It was a lot of swearing, but it did not bother me. As for the fact that we are not talking about the package. This has more to do with the stupid excerpt from the BBFC classification certificate. They should give it only 15 for the tongue itself. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended series, I want more!
