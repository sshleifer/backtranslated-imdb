I work with children from 0? 6 years and everyone loves Doodlebops. Doodlebops are energetic, lively and appealing. Once they start to sing, 'We're Doodlebops We're Doodlebops We're Doodlebops Oh yeah Come and join the fun because we laughed and sing all day' It's almost impossible to join them Doodlebops brings the audience into the world of colors and fun. is an adventure, Doodlebops is not trying to change the world with news reports all they do is have fun while solving the problems of everyday life that a small child Doodlebops is a refreshing, highly effective alternative to regular television programs for children.
