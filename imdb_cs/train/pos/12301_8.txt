It's a bit crazy, but I shot the TCM from both the German version of "Anna Christie" MGM and the English ... but first I noticed it because I heard that many people think it's better than the English version. Without seeing the other, I can not compare them, but it is also an excellent early talk with straightforward Garbo performance. She looks very beautiful in this movie, her face shining everywhere, especially when cameraman William Daniels gets his beautiful close up. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the film differs from regular things MGM at that time looks very similar to the French or German expressionist films of the 1930s, it was directed by the great French director Monsieur Jacques Feyder, who in 1929 director Garbo in the " The Kiss ". <br /> <br /> Theo Shall is excellent and gives an absolutely credible performance like a nice Anna, a hard, tough, sailor who is just a small person in the body of a man. Also, Hans Junkermann gives very gentle performance, like Anna Alcoholic Father and Salka Viertel as well as a good heart old cheap flood. In all the pretty experience, because it's the only film you could listen to Garbo speaking in a foreign language ... "because all the other movies she did in Sweden or Germany were during the Silent Era.
