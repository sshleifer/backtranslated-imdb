This film deals with one of the most feared geriatric illnesses between today's aging. As a person who has met a number of families facing Alzheimer's or who are in the development phase, I suggest that every health care provider recommend this film to every family facing the trauma of the disease. The film is mainly designed to talk to the patient's family and get into the very heart of the fight. Casting is an excellent and dramatic display is exceptional thanks to a very large conspiracy.
