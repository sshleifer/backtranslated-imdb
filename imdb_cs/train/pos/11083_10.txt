Glacier Fox is one of the most beautiful and wonderfully photographed films about the wilderness ever shot. The film takes care of every member of this group of foxes, from the blind to the most powerful - their adventures are sometimes cheerful and also tragic. Set against hostile nature, the heart of the audience is warm for family members. Musical scores and lyrics tell a story that tells you about the story of what's happening in general. <br /> <br /> One remains one of the greatest birds of prey, but we have no doubt that foxes are able to live and not just survive the limits of human efforts.
