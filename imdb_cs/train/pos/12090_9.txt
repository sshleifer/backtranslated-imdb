I saw this movie when I was 10 or 11 years old, alone in the parental basement on Saturday night. It was shown at the "Chiller Theater," which is a period of fear that I have been religiously watching as a young man. Now I've seen many old horror films thanks to the Chiller Theater, but nobody has ever seen me as "Danse Macabre", aka "Castle of Blood." I am 51 years old and just last year I was so lucky to find a relatively recent and quality DVD release of this beautiful supernatural classics who thought I would never see it. I've been watching her for four more times, and it seems I did not get tired of it. It's just like scary movies like this one. Scary catacombs and tombs surrounded by fog simply do not work as well as in the black and white back of the day. By the way, this has Edgar Allen Poe and Barbara Steele, deliciously shady mysterious castle ensembles, fierce spirits that renew their deaths ... and a badly ironic ending. IMO, this one is right there with Robert Wisch "The Haunting", "Innocents" (with Deborah Kerr), and the newer "Others".
