Thank God it was not based on a true story because it's a story. Ordinary contemptuous characters, whose corruption does not know the boundaries, before the devil is a fascinating excursion into perversion that would be ridiculous (and sometimes, even - or perhaps because of - an unhappily tragic current of human dysfunction in the whole range) it was not done with such a magnificent, with their stars. The excellent Kelly Masterson scenario and excellent direction to anyone other than Sidney Lumet will not hurt anyone. The main dysfunction is of a family nature, with two mainly thwarted brothers (brilliant portraits by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) have decided to get rid of their own parents' jewelery, an attempt that is pathetically disproved. The story is narrated with time shifts (which are shown on the screen, for example: "Charlie: two days before the robbery" so nobody should be confused); some people said they did not like this device, but I thought it worked perfectly and added to the bullying of the whole matter, given that the two brothers who are in doubt barely play with full decks - you can not do it a decent poker hand to save your life. Throw in these extra cheese tidbits: one of the brothers is an addict, married to Gina (Marisa Tomei, also excellent) who has a relationship with another brother, throws into some monumental sibling rivalry, along with saying that the drug addict hates his father (insulting performance by Albert Finney), which apparently caused him severe pain in the past, and you have a Shakespeare / Greek tragedy on your hands. Proceed with caution.
