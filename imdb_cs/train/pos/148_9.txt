Like his earlier film "In a Glass Cage," Agust√≠ Villarong achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more visually refined than his predecessor. This is one of the most visually completed and scary images anyone could see. The increased drama, intensity, and undertone of violence threatens melodramatic or false, but they never get to it. In this way, it draws almost impossible performance: to be so above-average and yet so painfully restrained, to be so charged and yet underestimated, and even the explosions of the explosives are virtuoso feasts of the eye. Unabashed, gorgeous and very tense ... this movie is just great!
