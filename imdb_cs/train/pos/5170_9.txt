I chased this film when it came out on a videotape and really enjoyed it. I had the opportunity to buy it on DVD a few weeks ago and watched it several times since then. I would have to agree with the others when they said that Indian Summer is a nostalgic film. When I look at it, I wish I could be 10-14 again. I think that's why we love the film to some extent. We all want to be able to live our lives again as children with wisdom / adult knowledge. Would not it be nice to have all your friends / parents again young? You do not have to worry about your job, be a parent, etc. ... ??? I know I want to jump to De Lorean and come back in time. While I liked the movie and became my favorite movie in the camp, even though Meatballs and Bill Murray are. I wish they could make the Indian summer version.
