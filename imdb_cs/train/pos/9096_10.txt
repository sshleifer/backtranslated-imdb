Adorable! In October, I saw indigenous imports to Philly with children. We all liked it so much that we had seen them for the second time with our parents. I have not heard them yet how he's been interested for years! It was the first time I remember seeing a movie that my parents and my children could have. It's really cute and we can not wait for it to come out on DVD. It has to create other movies, such as home import. It's refreshing to go to a movie that can enjoy three diverse generations (and not be embarrassed). I did not see any movie as cute as the Greek wedding "My Big Fat" appeared. I loved Mindy Sterling as a mother. She was also in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also in this and is cheerful. I remember him from WKRP.
