This film surprised me, had good lines and laughs, + a continuous action packed action with many weapons and explosions. This film surprisingly had many good twists and turns. The conspiracy is totally beyond what others may think, keeping my interest all the time until the end. Finally; it's a great way to make movie action movies.
