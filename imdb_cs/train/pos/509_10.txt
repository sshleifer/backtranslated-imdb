"Broken Bow" takes us back where everything started. Set 150 years in our future and 100 years before Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. This installment of "Star Trek" franchises is, in my opinion, the first series since "TOS" got a sense of wonder, danger and excitement from "Going Where No Man Gone Before". Scott Bakula is perfectly occupied as Jonathan Archer, the first captain of the first "Star Ship Enterprise". He and the whole genre really show true respect to the Star Trek link. John Billingsley is brilliant as an alien Dr. Phlox and Jolene Blalock are absolutely kind as an enticing but logical scientific officer, Vulcan T'Pol. Broken Bow is, in my opinion, the best episode of a trek, and I believe Gene Roddenberry would certainly be proud.
