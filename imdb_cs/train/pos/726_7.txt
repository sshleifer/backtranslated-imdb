Vince Lombardi High School has a new director - Evil Togar (Mary Woronov). He intends to ban rock and roll music together. She has a head with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles), who loves Ramones. Also, the head of the school football team (Vincent van Patten) seems to have no girlfriend - she is not sure that Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) falls in love with her. An instant midnight movie. This was mentioned in the general release and almost instantly bombed - but as of midnight the movie was a huge hit and played throughout the 1980s. I remember attending more than just the few when I was in college - it was like a party! People were singing along with the songs, laughing at each joke, and generally having fun. When I saw it as an adult, I can not imagine why I loved it so much. The script is juvenile and full of groaners that I could not believe I heard. Characters change randomly and the movie jumps all over the place. What saves it is some real funny lines and a wonderful performance by Soles and Woronov (who really likes herself). They are also full of energy and playing their WAY roles over the top (as they should). As for Ramon ... I was never a fan. I like the title melody, but the rest of the songs have never captured me. If you are a fan of Ramones, you can give him a higher rating. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING !!!! This is mostly for children (PG rated) who are likely to be stupid but entertaining. Especially I think they will like the end when a high school will be dropped! SPOILER END !!!! <br /> <br /> So, if you're in the mood for a stupid movie at midnight since the eighties, you might like it. Otherwise, stay on. I give it 7.
