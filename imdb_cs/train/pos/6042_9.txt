She was out of the movies for rent, I picked up Freebird. During the first third of the movie, I tried to find out if the rest would be lost. Fortunately, it really warmed up and I loved the film so much. In the second half of the movie, I smiled and laughed all the time. Fortunately, even though there were CGI pieces, they were neither exaggerated nor predominant. But I would have to say - all actors have heavy European accents, so be warned if you have difficulty understanding voices or their cultural humor. <br /> <br /> I really loved the film and I have to order a copy for my own collection.
