Tour deformation! OK, the kid who plays Oliver is a bit too nice! Beginning with great cinematography, colors, costumes and the most impressive performances, it's a movie that you have to see. I have seen some adaptations of this great novel, but this is above all and its musical training! It's a master Fagan, never leaving his character making a song. You never know if you like it or not, the same feeling I got into the book. In other versions, you hate it from start to finish. Bill Sykes .... When you read a book, it's serious and so is in this movie. Oliver Reed was a master. His wife managed this masterpiece. I went and saw his latest film, Gladiator based on his many fine performances, not to see headliners. Music is good for times and mood. Who buys this beautiful movie? You should!
