WE CONTAIN SPOILERS! I saw an ad on the video. Then my sister discovered that we had a book so I read it. I rented the video the same day I finished the book. it was very remembered as the book was. The cast was brilliant. Tara Fitzgerald was excellent because Helen and Rupert Graves were hateful as Arthur. Costumes, music and settings are beautifully beautiful. <br /> <br /> WARNING YOU CAN READ MORE IF YOU HAVEN`T HOOK IT <br /> <br /> On the bottom there are some sexual scenes that have been added and some violence.This is why the video is Rated 15. There are a few other things that were wished in. After the first part, I felt the accuracy dropped. While the book is better than this, I'm glad to see her and recommend it to people who read the book, are Bronte fans or as costume dramas (I'm All 3!) As long as she goes through the sex scene. The book is somewhat unated. Anne Brontes' books seem to be that of a widely read or well known as Jane Erye or Wuthering Heights, who got to television and film several times. Another thing. When I read the book, I was surprised at how much religion was in it, but here it was all about! <br /> <br /> 7 \ 10
