As a long fan of Red Sox I had to watch the movie. It was great! While the 2004 Red Sox miraculous season is no longer a bit of live footage, there were great shots of some of my favorite Red Sox players. While the movie is definitely a cat, it has enough baseball footage from the amazing return of Red Sox in 2004 to become one of my top 10 films of all time. I especially enjoyed the Red Sox fans who were part of Ben's baseball family. The scene in which Ben meets with his friends on the day of design to find out who will have some place to play is cheerful! You have to find out if you are looking for a healthy movie that you will watch with your husband, date or other important ... especially if you are a baseball fan ... and especially if you are a Red Sox fan!
