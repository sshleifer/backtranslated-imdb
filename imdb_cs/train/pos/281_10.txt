This game was really great and quite challenging. It has a great, spooky storyline and graphics are also very good. I recommend this game to all fans of Horror and it is very good to start from the beginning to the end. The only problem with this game is that I like more weapons, but that's just me. <br /> <br /> A great game for fans of RPG and Shoot'em'up. <br /> <br />
