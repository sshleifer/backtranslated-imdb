A piece of fine art. Possible masterpiece. Undoubtedly a special story about the ambiguity of existence. A Kafka-style story about the impossibility of victory or survival in an eternal strange world. Life is only an adaptation exercise in this film. Lesson on the boundaries and original sin, the weakness of innocence, and the mistakes of his paths. Leopold Kessle is another Joseph K. Images of Trial and the same ambiguous woman. And Europe is a symbol of a basic crisis that has many aspects, such as chimeric wars or a trouble-free search for truth / essence / golden age. The metaphor or parable, the film is a history of disappointed development. War, peace, trade, or lie are only details of gelatin. Hypocrisy is a mask. Love - conventions. The only method of sacrificing to hope to understand the painful reality.
