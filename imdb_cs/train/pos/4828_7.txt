Rupert Friend gives a performance like Prince Albert, who raises "The Young Victoria" to unexpected levels. He is great. As we know, Queen Victoria fell into a dark, deep depression after the death of Prince Albert and looked at Ruper Friend's eyes, which I understood. The film does not lead us to death, but to an incident that could well live his life. The act of love. I believed it, or I should say it is. I believed what he considered real. Nothing and no one is approaching the delight and depth of the characterization of Friend. Emily Blunt is good, but after a while I did not believe it was Victoria. No real sense of the season. Perhaps it was not her fault, but her prince deserved the crown.
