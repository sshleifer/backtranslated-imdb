"Such a long journey" is a well-created film, a good shot and a show of good performances. However, the story is such a sublime subplot and special character that it will become a Jack of all parcels and a master of none. The western audience is likely to find the esoteric proportions of the rather obscure Parsee culture to get in 1.7 hours. Recommended for those interested in India.
