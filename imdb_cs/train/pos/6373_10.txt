Atlantis was much better than I expected. In some respects, it had a better story than other older films. Although this film sometimes demanded such attention. It was a great movie for all ages. I noticed that some younger audiences are waiting for comedy, but for adventure. I think everyone is tired of endless parody of extreme parodies. Many of these children saw nothing but parody. After a short time everyone looked very intense and watched Atlantis.
