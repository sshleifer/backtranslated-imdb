It was the best movie I've ever seen about Bulimia. It has hit exactly what bulimia really is and how it is not always about being thin and diet. It has turned out how people with bulimia tend to think about things like their outlook on life, friends and yourself. The best line and part that really shows what a problem with Bulimia is when Beth says, "It's not about you!" This line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem. It turned out that people with bulimia do not have this problem because of what they have to do with someone else. It only has to do with them and with them. It turns out that it is time to talk about a person with this problem, instead of being alerted. It turned out that at that moment Beth had to call for attention and at that time she needed her mother's attention.
