I really liked the 1960s. It's not from this generation (I'm waiting for the 1980s) it was interesting to see a unique four-hour capsule for that time. One of the main issues in the film was the lack of balance the film was in the family view. According to the promos I saw for the film at NBC, the story was basically two families struggling with problems in the 1960s America. Now I may have forgotten something, but I think we learned more about the white family than about the African-American family. I really think the 60s used music to describe the scenes better than any dialogue that could come out of the mouth of the actors (they are all very talented.) It is very visible at the end of the first part (about two hours) of the mini-series. <br /> <br /> A very good movie!
