Being half-blind I do not recommend discussing Portuguese films to be half-blind (or half-distrustful). Not that I often do it. But this movie was such a wave of adrenaline! Yes, that is true - it was mostly true in terms of history - but it did not make any strikes to avoid the usual Portuguese film territory: things like using real places in the middle of a busy Lisbon and recruiting a real crowd stand in front of a real crowd almost 30 years ago. And God did it right! Well, summarize: very emotional if you've been through it, but you'll see minor improvements that could be made just the same as the conspiracy they were. If you look at it at random, you are in a good historical perspective, just out of recent history and a little more thoughtful than usual. Even according to European standards yes.
