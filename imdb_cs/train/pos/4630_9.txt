This is the second Eytan Fox movie I've seen. Fantastic actor, Lior Ashkenazi, who played in Walk on Water, also has a small role in this film. But the real stars are young Israelis living together in a small apartment - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer) and Yelli (Alon Friedman); and the Palestinian who joins them - Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid). There is a certain thing about Friends / Sex in the City that happens (mostly a homosexual), and everyone wants the war to end in order to continue their lives in peace. But that's rub. No matter how many posters you have or how much rave you have in peace, the war will not end. Many have been trying to bring both sides to the table over the years, but they want to take it for whatever reason. There are many on the Israeli side, both here and here in the US, who just want and will not consider peace. There are many people on the Palestinian side who would obviously be out of work if peace ever came. No one is interested in ending this war and the children suffer. <br /> <br /> This is always in mind when you look at this fun and engaging film. He will not stay away. You know that something tragic happens and of course it will be. Since feelings on both sides are powerful and vengeful as a motivator, tragedy is always happening, and that's what makes this adult version of friends / sex in the city. There is no superficiality. It's real life, and it was a beautiful thing.
