It's not the best romantic comedy he ever did, but it's definitely pretty and observable. It's an old-fashioned way and it works well. Cybill Shepherd as Corinne is not bad in her role as a woman who can not overcome her husband's death. She has sexy maturity. But I can not say to Ryan O'Neal much like Philip because he is at best unsubstantiated. It may be adequate in this role, but it is not good enough. <br /> <br /> But I feel that some of the characters, especially Alex and Miranda, are not written with a deep enough idea. We do not know anything about them, because a few minutes after they appear, the story gets worse and the writers do not tell us what exactly is going on. But the problem has been rescued because Mary Stuart Masterson has a fresh sweetness to brighten her, and Robert Downey Jr. is so charming that it melts the screen. Even his smile is infectious. And so it happens that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for the deja vu and flashback scenarios. <br /> <br /> This movie is lightweight and easy and if you like it, why do not you try it. <br /> <br />
