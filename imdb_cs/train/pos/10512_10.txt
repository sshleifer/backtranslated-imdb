First of all, this VHS movie before I just had to buy DVDs, it's my favorite films of all time. I've read a book, but I really think the movie is much better. I loved Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma and Jeremy Northam because Mr. Knightley was excellent. It was great! <br /> <br /> It's a movie of 10/10! <br /> <br />
