When I first saw this movie, I thought it was a typical "love of your neighbor" problem .... The more the movie happens, the more I get involved. Efficiency is wonderful from both actors, the direction was great, the story unusual. I heard my eyes for the first time in my life for the movie. The real must have in every serious videotape. 11 of 10
