At first, I was not sure if I was watching a documentary, a propaganda film or a dramatic presentation. I think that due to the time of production it was a mixture of all three. <br /> <br /> It is true that the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable. But you had the feeling that interesting scenes will continue in the movie. We were able to witness what seemed to be a realistic training regime and equipment. Where this film was brought together for me was closer to the end. The scenes had realism (at least as I perceived it) that I had not met before. You could take action and introduce the thoughts of young fighters. It has been mixed with the usual problems of displaying successful Japanese soldiers at a time when you might think that true Japanese actors will be somewhat rare. The film is excellent as a source of American thinking in 1943 as a war conducted with Japan. Interestingly, a soccer player in Japan was also interested in the help the US has provided to Japan in recent years.
