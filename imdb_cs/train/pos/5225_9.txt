I think this movie is a very entertaining film and one of the best films of "National Lampoon's" has a very catchy spoof title that basically summarizes what the whole movie is about ... Men in White !!!! The story is a spoof of many movies, including Will Smith, as you could guess, 'Men In Black'. I do not end but has a very good ending, it's very funny (Leslie Nielsen style humor) from start to finish, especially a bit from the beginning, when you're on the street collecting waste bins (garbage bins). They also have nice garbage bins in the scene (a garbage truck). The game is not excellent, in fact it's not very good, but that's what makes the movie funny, it's comedy, relax !! I love the storyline, partly because it's so far, and partly because it's interesting to see how subtle (or un-delicate) tears all other movies. I am a great fan of movies that do not have serious spoofs, but I'm also a fan of real things. With these movies, it's hard to decide what's better, the movie is overturned (as mentioned earlier in this review) or the real movie it is, but also when you're spoofing comedies, it's even harder, but it's doing it successfully. Two men of garbage are so entertaining, reminding me of a UK sketch show called "Little Britain". This film is essential for your collection and is one of the best, most entertaining, funniest, best stories of National Lampoon.
