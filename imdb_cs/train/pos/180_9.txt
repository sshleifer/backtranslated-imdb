When Gundam0079 became a movie trilogy that most of us were familiar with, it was a lot of the fact that it was pure action and nothing more. This OVA is a little different. Although it's only half a dozen episodes, it's not a lot of action but emotional stuff. The two main action sequences in this, in my opinion, are enough to satisfy me. After seeing so many gundam, movie and OVA series, I was totally ready for a civil-esquire movie. This movie made it great. What this film stands out for is that both sides of the war have good and bad people. The Zeons appear to be rather human rather than original films, depicted as the second rise of the Nazis' evil. Most people who do not like the anime I was forced to watch this movie (lol) liked it. So I would recommend a lot of people just for an anti-war story. If you are a fan of Gundam and you do not see it, you should not read it; you should watch him.
