It is simply a classic movie where human voices coming from animals are really what they are thinking about. I do not know if my video copy is missing the scene, but it never shows how the dogs got out of the pit. It also shows an instinct for animal survival and the ability to monitor animals. People in the same position and helicopters would be out. Once the original movie improves with a remake because the voice commentary for the first has been removed. Only the use of animals can work in a film of this kind because the use of people would have to tell the story by turning into murder, which shows that animals are after all more interesting than humans
