It's always a pleasant surprise when television movies show up as fun as Little Richard. This is a very attentive film about the story Rock and Roller, Little Richard played an actor named Leon, which I have never seen before but doing a very good job. Like most TV films, it's a bit more distorted than if it happened for Cinema, which is a shame because I'm sure there's a lot we could see about Little Richard, which was controversial. Instead, we see a lot of religious waste, the only thing that blurs the film and eventually spoils a very promising career. Overall, this movie is good and playing is above average for a television movie. 7 out of 10.
