I just watched the documentary film "Fog City Mavericks" in the Starz cable TV. This is undoubtedly one of the most enjoyable experiences! It chronicles artists from the San Francisco Bay area and the creative talent that is responsible for some of the best movies ever made. Besides famous artists, he also includes segments with Irvin Kershner, Caleb Deschanel, and Pixar Animation Studios. I hope it will be released on DVD - it's the necessity of any collection of cinema history and brilliant filmmaking. If you are even wondering about movies and the people who make them, you will not be disappointed.
