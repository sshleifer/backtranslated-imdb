This is a comedy of morality, so sometimes a gentle touch of bitterness appears, but lightness softens all the sarcasm and irony until your heart suddenly stops and changes everything. <br /> <br /> This movie, amazingly written and directed, is a jewel that shines brilliantly, with the beautiful effect of everyone. Jean-Louis Trintignant is exceptional as usual, and Romy Schneider is a pearl, perfect and shining, which must not be missed. Great movie!
