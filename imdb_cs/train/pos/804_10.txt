No, there is another! Because every Star Wars fan had to have an opinion on I, II, and III, and because this view was distorted because we lacked the atmosphere and characters of the original trilogy, I will give good points to the "Return of the Jedi" and several corresponding bad points of the predecessor. Of course I loved music, special effects, two droids, but it was too much discussed elsewhere. What we get in the original trilogy and in this particular film: - Strong ecological interest - Anti-militaristic positions - Fascinating view of Jedi Order and Force - Cute Creatures - Harrison Ford's Smile - Murderous Scene: Near the end where Vader looks at his son and the emperor. The lethal bolt flash bounced on his black helmet. And when he seized and betrayed his lord to save Luke, he risked his own life! Oh, boy! What is wrong with the INMHO prequel: - The whole element of the "human factor" that was the original occupation capable of moving forward is somehow missing - The power seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults than wisdom - Too many Jedi at a time and too many screen - The lack of experience of several actors too often threatens the consistency of the plot <br /> <br /> By the way, if you enjoy the theory of Forces as explained by Obi Web (Obi Wen, I mean) and Yoda, then you should read several books about Buddhism and the forms they took in ancient Japan. Star Wars, IMHO lies primarily in the continuing spiritual heritage from the master to his disciple, from father to son, though with difficulty. "De mon âme à ton ton" (from my soul to you), as Bejard wrote to the late Zen master T. Deshimar.
