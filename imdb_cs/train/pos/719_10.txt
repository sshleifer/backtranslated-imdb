Although this film is at best cheesiness, it is perfectly drawn. This film, undoubtedly, must be considered a modern classic. These are basically two kinds of movies I like - deep-flick movies (feline flicks, if necessary, blaming my wife for it) and soulless comedies where I can sit and relax. This film is a perfect example of that. <br /> <br /> My friend went to the film shortly after the release. Because he was somewhat shallow, he told me: "You have to see this movie, it's just your type of movie." When I offended myself, I began to watch. I know Ramona mentioned a million times, but when you really see them, I said, "Hey, it's The Ramones." My friend replied, "I do not know it was a real band." I had my moment of glory. This film, though a little later, is a must for fans of Ramones - or for someone else.
