While not as wild and as outside as some of the later Takashi Miike films, it's a very good crime drama. <br /> <br /> A basic story is the story of a cop of a Japanese cop with Chinese parents who are trying to take off the upcoming Chinese gangster. More complicated is that his younger brother acts as a lawyer for the villain and his gang. The film is in fact much more complicated than with a few complications that are interesting and divert things from the central narrative. His complications and loss of travel for about an hour into a movie that makes him less than a great movie. (It's a very good movie) It's definitely worth seeing, especially if you do not mean any furious pace. /> <br /> The word warning, violence when it happens is explosive and ugly. There are also semi-graphical depictions of gay sex. If this is not your cup of tea, be careful. <br /> <br /> 7 or 8 of 10.
