"My baby, my sister, a dream of how sweet everyone would look <br /> <br /> We were in such a nice country to live together <br /> <br /> And there love slow and long <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Elizabeth Von Arnim, "Enachanted April" can be described in one sentence? this is in the early twenties, when four London women, four foreigners, decided to rent a castle in Italy in April. It's a good description, but it will not prepare you for the fact that "Enchanted April" - the final movie "Good Feeling" is the perfection of your genre. Beautiful and sunny, gentle and peaceful, kind and magical, like a sun beam on your face in the spring when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of quiet happiness and forever appreciate them. This is the movie that really influenced my life. I saw it during the difficult times when I was lost, unhappy and very lonely when I had to deal with sad and tragic events and deal with some false truth about myself. It helped me regain my optimism and hoped something could change and everything was possible. Then I promised that no matter how I would avoid suffering and self-esteem and I would appreciate every minute of my life - with joy and sorrow ... I promised to go to Italy and later that year I did it and I was not alone . Charming, charming and hearty, "Enchanted April" is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love. This little movie is the highest quality diamond.
