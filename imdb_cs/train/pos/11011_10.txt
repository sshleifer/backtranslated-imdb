Chief banker for RKO Radio, Bombardier stars Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott as trainers at bomber pilot school. O'Brien and Scott are arguing about teaching methods while their students are attracted to Anna Shirley's affection. O'Brien's methods are very good during the bombing of Tokyo. Scott and his crew are captured and tortured by the Japanese, but the fatally wounded Scott can light a gas car and provide a perfect target for his bombs. Stylistically, Bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic war films, moments of gentle horror (Eddie Alberta's death), alternating with scenes of the absurd melodrama of "Yellow Danger" (the Japanese literally gritted their teeth when they tortured helpless Americans). Although it can not help, but far from it today, Bombardier remains an amusing propaganda effort (the movie is sometimes mistakenly portrayed as Robert Ryan's debut, which has actually appeared in front of the cameras since 1940. <br /> <br /> Everyone who is interested To get a copy of this movie, contact me at: iamaseal2@yahoo.com
