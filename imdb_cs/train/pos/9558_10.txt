So I'm considered big enough in the anime scene, with very few exhibitions and I just will not watch. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this show to anyone. <br /> <br /> Quite possibly most of the original series to date, it has just about everything I could ask for. The side story we are talking about about unconditional love we will not accept, about a very glamorous comedy and a well-composed vocal cast (Japanese and American translation). <br /> <br /> Not for that terribly entertaining aspect, it would be just another anime. More or less, as I noticed, "I love it or I hate it", very few people I saw introduced to this series end up with this desire. <br /> <br /> The original kernel with all you could ask for in the afternoon, you bet on this series. I'm ready to make sure you like it.
