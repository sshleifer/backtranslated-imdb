He watched it as a later television film last night purely by accident. Blud for the movie said something that the mother left with her daughter and goes on a romantic journey, as I tune in there is a carpenter hard at work in a new winter garden - Daniel Craig played no less - so the conspiracy was instantly obvious. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the mother of the same name is a carpenter of love interest is also a friend of the daughter, so there is a problem cooking and not too many surprises. But I was captured by Anna Reid's fascinating performance and I was addicted. The direction allows her enough space to look into the mirrors and adjust the scarves as it emanates mourning. Sexual scenes were fascinating and taboo. Should not the old female bodies remain covered? Not here, and we were treated with an excellent awakening in maternal sexuality. Even more surprising are the drawings she made (SPOILER!) Once she found that her daughter suspected something was going on. Cathryn Bradshaw as my daughter did not convince me like the other cast, but it could be me. With its waves of locks that preceded it, I was still waiting to see Julia Sawahl, whose more intense face would, in my view, better adapt to confrontations. Bradshaw has a happy cheerful face that has carried the anger that appears when the movie continues. The end is weak. If love for Mother, when leaving in shame, they are so indifferent, maybe we might see some detailed shots of those who have said goodbye and seen something of their individual reasons. Whatever she does is a recently abandoned widow who has gone to the lonely home she shared with her husband for 30 years, and I find that the lack of sympathy is violent. For a movie so full of emotion (and being warned it's like opening a champagne, you'll never get the lid back) the end is a cold contradiction.
