Peter O'Toole is a loving approach to roles, where the lines that speak, are good, and offer a chance to go into a drunken pit. Beautiful Susannah York provides a good foil for the dramatic presence of O'Toole. The film mentions incest - without a single explicit scene - but is capable of entertaining the viewer in his rough social commentary. Though it is not the main film of any counting, it will be remembered for its entertaining performances. <br /> <br /> Even York, signing the papers at the end, is a delight that looks quietly radiating the tragedy. Maybe the weakness here is Thompson's quiet direction. But the movie floats for actors and scripts. I have seen the film twice for 20 years - on both occasions it was called "brotherly love". "Country Dance" is a somewhat fake and inappropriate title for this film, whether it was released as such.
