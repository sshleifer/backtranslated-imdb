The Reunion class is a very subdued comedy. It is 1982 and class 1972 Lizzie Bordena High returns to a ten-year gathering, among them the usual stereotypes, pieces, babe, fat boy and nerd etc. But the former students are for a bumpy night, one of their classmates is Walter Baloer, class wimp , who was in the afternoon school exposed to comedy the rest of the class and has since been in a mental home, Walter escapes and now plans to avenge his humiliation. <br /> <br /> Despite the dark assumption, it's really just a justification for a lot of fun gag and sets. To say there is much more, the movie would be spoiled, but if you enjoyed the Naked Gun & Airplane films, you will be happy and what is the next movie Chuck Berry offers? A great comedy that deserves a wider audience.
