Throughout Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy Craze, Paramount Pictures has really dropped the ball into the recovery of Anthony Quinn's director Cecile B. DeMille under the supervision of the film and got it on DVD and Blu Ray with all the extras. I know that Paramount Pictures Execs are blind as bats and they do not know that they have a really good pirate movie in their vault about a real pirate who actually lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, which would have helped Crescent City once again known for his pirate connection. When the Execs program at Paramount finally gets into the program and releases this movie in digital format, I'll be a happy camper. Paramount Pictures is up to you to get out of your duff and restore this movie!
