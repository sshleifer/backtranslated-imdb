OK Clara Bow of the 1927 film, a reflection from Rain, with Bow playing half of the Hawaiian wild daughter of a local pineapple king, who falls in love with a withdrawn English engineer - Clive Brook. Bow battles with a local widow (Arlette Marchal), but both women have a great surprise when his wife appears (Patricia Dupont). The Pregnant Wife is ready for divorce until she finds she can be on the brink of property. Bow is settling faster. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Note: The IMDb credit list is bad. Film credits (from a DVD that I have) include a list of Patricia Dupont as playing Mrs. Haldane - not Margaret Truax, as shown on IMDb.
