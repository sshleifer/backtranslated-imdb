I make ten out of ten, it's one of the best movies ever. Absolutely broken, stunned and stunned by the whole picture, the amazing playing of Jason Statham, Ray Liotta and the entire crew, an amazing conspiracy ... Just look at yourself and break the courage to admit - touched your soul because it's weird but there are all the answers that you've ever been looking for ... Best, mr. Ritchie! MORE BEST. Those who are looking for simple figurines and skirts still scream are disappointed. But in today's Hollywood there are plenty of shallow movies, you can not remember the next day you saw it. On the contrary, the revolver is unique, I could not expect that it would be possible to portray such a bright and brilliant picture of itself, of anyone who should follow it. Absolutely insurmountable, stunning, dazzling ... One can get to know this, I have no doubt about that. In fact, no words can express their admiration ... I'm still wondering how it was possible to make such a film after years of the cruel Hollywood garbage we've been watching. Thank you wholeheartedly, it's just the best.
