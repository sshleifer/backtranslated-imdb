I have to say that higher learning is one of the first three films I've ever watched. He has an excellent cast and an equally great director. Singleton shows how life can be at university. There are 3 major stories, skinheads, African Americans and gays. I was interested in all the stories, but the one I felt most was the story of Kristen and fighting her feelings about another girl. The end was great. After seeing the film 25 times plus, still crying. I would give this movie 11, but I have to settle on 10/10.
