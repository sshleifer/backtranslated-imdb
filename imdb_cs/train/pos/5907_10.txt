This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. My parents come from rural India and to some extent have seen the life of villagers. People are really poor and have financial and social problems. <br /> <br /> The film reflects exactly the same. Full credit to the director and actors. They did a great job. I'm just wondering how movies like Lagaan and Paheli can go to Oscar and not Doghi. I do not understand the criteria on which the films are selected. There are money that make a difference or have some big names in the film, the difference. <br /> <br /> I hope to see other movies like this one in the future.
