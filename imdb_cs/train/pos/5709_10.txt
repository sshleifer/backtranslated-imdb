Made in 1931, this foreign film should be seen and used more often. <br /> <br /> We will open in a quiet small French village that scans the roofs of sleeping citizens. Then we hear something that sounds like a party. In investigating the upheaval, two neighboring men are told of the story of two men, allegedly friends, who chose two numbers for the lottery. Our star image has its number and his friend. When he asks his friend, he will share half the dough, if his ticket is a winning number, his friend immediately says no. In fact, H.E. double hockey no! it's the way he behaves. <br /> <br /> So when our man finds out that he has a winning ticket and that he has been lost, he is frantic without his own mistakes. They are all behind and are looking for this ticket, something like the precursor of the "Big race". Although all this is a memory, I was in the knots all the time and was so upset over every little thing in this all-for-me show-me-the-money cash-in-the-bank movie. Watch Le Million today!
