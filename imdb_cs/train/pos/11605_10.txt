The biggest reason I should have seen this movie was that star Susan Swift, an excellent and too undervalued actress. Time magazine journals usually do not care about a movie about witchcraft, but this movie was fascinating and scary. He did not blame for blatant special effects, and he did not focus too much on the time the spectator would lose and confuse. It was a really creative film that was simple and focused on the great acting of all.
