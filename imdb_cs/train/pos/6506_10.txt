Amazingly brilliant. Powerful and evocative. The most convincing documentary about the war. It is a tone that is marked by the contrast to the often emerging attitudes to the Second World War that the media exhibit. Rather than shouting the horror of the war, Sir Laurence Olivier's silent voice allows him to recall the true images of the war: corpses everywhere, explosions, frightened citizens and soldiers, broken men, indifferent politicians, mistakes that cost thousands of lives, suffering of innocents. Most of all, it is the home that mankind is capable of when all the normal rules of "politeness" are removed. There is something distinctly Hobbesian about a man in the true state of nature, he returns to more animal form capable of crimes that will still shock and fascinate for 60 years. Maybe the successive series called "Century in War" for the twentieth century was really a century of horror. I feel that it is an extremely ironic irony that it was an event that caused 50 million people to die to create such a convincing and excellent series like this.
