but just as fun and casual! Love it or hate it, but do not expect sophisticated conspiracy or nail biting cliffhanger. Think of it as Seinfeld, but without subsequent and repeated performances of ugly characters (well ... so far, I feel like I will develop popular as the season goes on). "Comfort" is not for humor - it's like to enjoy it with the least amount of effort from your brain. Which is why this show includes everything I need in the program when I get home from work tonight: a shallow conversation in the background with the right amount of "cute" characters I have to experience when I finally look up the computer to see, what I miss. <br /> <br /> Funnier than most of today's sitcoms is quieter than NASCAR night. Just the right mix of dead air and returns. She can not wait for another.
