I watched this movie on DVD a couple of times, the first time I watched for the second half of an hour and then went back to the first hour. an amazing fun movie, thank God for kiera knightley, refreshing and giving us a true look at the difficult life of Queen Victoria and the difficult choices she had to make. There's nothing wrong with the movie, no bad language, or something of a sexual nature that would offend family watching. She could invite the children to explore a bit about the queen victoria itself and perhaps even lesser known figures such as Conroy and Lord Melbourne
