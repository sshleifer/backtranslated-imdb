This film is nothing but a dark, gravel masterpiece. Maybe I'm biased because the apartheid period is the area I've always felt. But I'd say it's upstairs with Cry Freedom and Cry The Belveded Country. Unfortunately, I have never heard of this movie until a few days. Inside is one of the most underestimated films of all time, probably because it was a small film company that I have never heard of. Eric Stoltz, one of my favorite actors, is credible and dramatic, Nigel Hawthorne plays his fascinating role well. Do not look for humor in this movie, there is no one. It's real, wild and rough to the last, and sensitive to say I'll bring a box of tissues. But movies as big as you are interested in, why is it that the biggest movies are often never heard?
