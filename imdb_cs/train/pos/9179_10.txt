This is the best version (so far) you will see and the most true work of Bronte. Dalton is a little hard to imagine as Rochester, which Jane Eyre said "not handsome." But his acting overcomes it and Zela Clark, like herself, is also complete and believable by Jane Eyre. This production is a long watch, but it is worth it. Nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script, and if you want the first true "romance" in literature, it's a way of seeing it. I own every copy of this movie and read and read the original again. Shooting may seem a bit dated, but it will never be that way.
