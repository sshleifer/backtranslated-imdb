I was impressed with the name, so during a small bout of insomnia (driven by my curiosity ...) I stayed and watched it. Then I checked my TV records and watched it again! There is one very obvious realization that happened to me when I saw this film - despite politics, traditions, culture, etc. There are practically the same teenagers everywhere. The figures of Belgrade children could have been transported, for example, somewhere in the American Midwest in the same time period, and linguistic differences aside, would be impossible to distinguish from all the local teenagers of that time. They have certainly manifested the same growing pain and concern, politics aside: Music, sex, movie idols, music, drinking, sports, music ... In fact, the same things that occupied my time growing up in the 1970s of Southern California. <br /> <br /> It was a hot story, but the joy of youth is very pleasant. Characters, especially young actors, were also quite credible. I will not say that it is Yugoslav 'American graffiti', but I will say that it fits into other 50-year films.
