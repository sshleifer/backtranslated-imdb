A story about four teenage girls growing up in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) is the most inclined stack - but she wants to get out of her house where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad boys and is beaten up by her father. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has over-average parents. Deirde (Kandice Strohov√°) thinks she is more mature than others. <br /> <br /> It's nothing new of what we've seen a lot of time before - but it has one big difference - it's accurate. I graduated from high school in 1980 (when I first saw the film) and I was surprised how realistic she was. They got the dialogue, the clothes and the attitudes perfectly right. Even the main song of the movie ("On Radio" by Donny Summer) was a big hit before it came out. This movie touched me harder than any other teenage film of the time because I could understand and relate to the characters. I knew girls in high school who were just like that! The film is (of course) dated but captures the time we will never see again. The game is good in every way when Foster performs the best. The relationship between her and Kellerman (which was excellent) was realistic and well done. Even Scott Baio (who plays a small role as a friend of a girl) more or less realistically played a teenage boy. <br /> <br /> A very good movie - a major view if you have grown in 1980. The film has a well-deserved R mark (lots of drug use and swearing) but should be seen by all teens. I give it 8.
