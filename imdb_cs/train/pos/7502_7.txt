Although I did not feel anything about Lance's character, I felt his wife would do much better with someone else. It could have been a much stronger film if they spent more time developing the character, maybe with Lance - I'd like it better. But I have to fully agree with DoyleLuver when they said "And quoting Glenn Quinn's character Ben:" I'm a star here, it's true that I'm talented! "" If you look at the movie, just watch it, even if it's in the background ... just his facial expressions, everything in your eyes, you know for sure what Ben is motivating exactly how he feels about the comments, even if it's a quick look behind the back of the character. A great actress in a fair film.
