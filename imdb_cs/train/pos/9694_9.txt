I was fascinated by this desire and funny film, not to mention surprise. I was also surprised to discover that Paulie's voice was done by Jay Mohr. The performance was so finely nuanced, neither turned to schmaltz nor was it too hard under the New Jersey swagger that I thought it must be some old old for, not the young Lord Mohr. It's a very impressive performance and it's delightful to see that his talents are taken seriously into a number of special Indian movies.
