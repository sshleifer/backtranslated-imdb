The story of the first television series "Columbo" is simple: one half of the successful secret-writing team is off with the other, the invisible mafia group frames, is blackmailed by an admirer, escapes with an admirer and is cheated by the Stupid Columbo. It is said to be one of the most entertaining in the history of the show, which benefits from the work of late Jack Cassidy and the stars of Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> stars: Cassidy and Barbara Colby. Two of them share a couple of scenes together, and it's terrible that they both die tragically during the decade of shooting, Cassidy in a home fire, and Colby in the hands of the invaders that have emerged for more than three decades. <br /> <br /> Now the two deaths are true MYSTERIES!
