Excellent. Clear and true representation of groundbreaking ranch life on the western plains, with an emphasis on the role and place of a woman. Moving film, merciful and based on real people and their real experience. Low budget, independent film; he never made any money. It's certainly not a romantic, unrealistic version of Hollywood's pioneering life.
