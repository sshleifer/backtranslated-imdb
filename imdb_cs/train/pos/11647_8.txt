I can give you four reasons why I can see this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Four best filmmakers in contemporary Mexican cinematography. <br /> <br /> 2. Four good stories related to the big schema. <br /> <br /> 3. Surprisingly good cast. <br /> <br /> 4. Bitter reflection on the biggest problems in this country (and many others). <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Alejandro Gamboa opens this film with a good story in a comedy mood, a body that practices extortion against ordinary people and still awaits its efforts. <br /> <br /> Then Antonio Serrano gets into the second piece with a more dramatic story of the legacy of Italian neorealism with the anecdote of "Peter and the Wolf". In the third story, which seems to be more independent of this series, also in the context, Carlos Carrera tells us the story that a person is in the wrong place at the wrong time. But after the recent lynching with Tlahuac and the tradition of this terrible affair in the Mexican state, this story could not be updated. And finally, Fernando Sariñan returns to the dark humor of the "grand finale," in which he gathers most characters from past sequences in one of the better comedy tracks ever shot. When he introduced the medieval scene from one of the previous films "Todo el poder", Sariñana gives the final lesson of the subject. And by the way, give us a scene that steals the film with Anno Ciochetti, who makes a short striptease. Once the movie ends, you get a hot-thirst feeling that you looked at a good movie (and maybe enjoyed it) with a very painful theme. They say that in Mexico people laugh at their own shame and it is the best example. This film is a testimony of how the Mexicans learned to live in the midst of crime (and may have received it), between two fires: Criminals and so-called corrupt authorities. Even this film is a godly wish, because almost all good people have been the victims of crime, and they are not threatened. If you have an attack without scratches, you are lucky. Do not lose the opportunity to see this movie so far, it is recommended. <br /> <br /> And it's a beautiful life in Mexico ...
