We have never seen this film, based on the funny novel by Nicholas Katzenbach, and considering the first-class cast for production, we decided to look. Just Cause, without being a terrible movie, suffers too much freedoms with the original material that Jeb Stuart has failed in his treatment. Arne Glimcher. <br /> <br /> The first thing we think when a young black man gets to the local precinct for questioning is police brutality. After all, Sheriff Tanne Brown and Police Officer Wilcox show no mercy when they beat Bobby Earl, who is accused of killing a young white girl. We feel horrified by what the prisoners are doing to the prisoner. <br /> <br /> Then the scene changes. Evangeline, grandmother Bobby Earl, is sent north to ask an important Harvard professor, a retired lawyer, a young man wants Paul Armstrong to defend him. The old woman is convincing enough to see Armstrong look at the case. He is also convinced of the young man's innocence. Things are not exactly what we thought they were. When Blair Sullivan, the man who works in the same facility as Bobby Earl, tells how he is related to the murder of a young girl and changes the dynamics of the case. The way it plays in the movie serves to confuse the viewer and avert Armstrong from coming to the truth. This thriller is enjoyable by Sean Connery, who plays Armstrong. Laurence Fishburne, an intense actor, makes an impression that the sheriff, who, if we see, is guilty of abusing his prisoner. Ed Harris has a great opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors. Blair Underwood, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and young Scarlett Johansson are seen in supporting roles. The film, or its mistakes, will not disappoint.
