It's one movie that will take time if you get off your head when you see it. Dialogs are almost perfect, which can be expected because it has been adapted from the game. Actors simply give the best, the story is simple and appealing. 88 minutes of pure bliss! Yvan Attal is totally trustworthy in her role, Sandrine Kiberlain is still a beautiful blond girl (but not so stupid) who gives her eyes the same ears, Jean-Paul Rouve is an excellent example of being so, and Marina Fois is a stupid friend, who is always ready for the smallest. Thumbs up to Bernard Rapp and co-workers for editing this great game and all the best for future productions! I wish it was more in today's production. If you like it, you'll probably like "Un air de famille" and "Cuisine et dependances". Both were written and played by Bacri / Jaoui.
