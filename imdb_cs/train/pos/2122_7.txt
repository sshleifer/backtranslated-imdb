On the day of the big studio system, the most suitable castings were made. Good old American James Stewart, who appeared as a Hungarian in the Shop around the corner. If I shot the film, part of Kralik would be perfect for Charles Boyer. His accent mixed with all the other European accents would be nothing. Stewart had the same problem in Mortal Storm with Margaret Sullavan. Margaret Sullavan was his most prominent foreman on the screen, making four movies with her. But it's just one where neither of them died. Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward recognized Stewart again on the day he was a fighting player in New York. In fact, Sullavan's husband Stewart was a good friend of Henry Fonda at that time. I think only Clark Gable was able to make up his mind that he was American in the occupation of non-American Americans in Mutiny on Bounty. Stewart in Mortal Storm was German, but all other players were Americans, so nothing showed up. <br /> <br /> But if you can accept Stewart before you see a fine film by Ernest Lubitsch. The plot is quite simple, a man and a woman working in a business building in Budapest will not get in person. However, they seem to have correspondence with some anonymous admirers who show themselves to each other. Also, employer Frank Morgan suspects Stewart wrongly that he was treating his wife. <br /> <br /> Although they are the best and Frank Morgan is leaving his usual prolific self, the two best-performing players are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut. Bressart has my favorite moments in the movie when he leaves after Morgan starts asking people for opinions. He makes himself very rare. And Joseph Schildkraut, who is always good, is just as great as an ordinary little worm that is always fond of Frank Morgan. You really hate such people, I know so many people like real-life Schildkraut who are in the office 24 hours a day. It is sad that a lot of time is worthwhile.
