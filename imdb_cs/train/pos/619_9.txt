I assumed that this movie would be decent and maybe even a clich√©, but I was totally wrong! Charlie Cox (I've never heard of him yet) played an incredibly good manager; he was so serious and romantic, me and my friend, who saw that the film was quite in love with him. Claire Danes, whom I liked earlier (loved her in Romeo and Juliet), made me even more enjoyable. Her acting was fantastic, I did not even know she was American. The chrome between her and Charlie Cox was exceptionally good, the casting was quite perfect. Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer were as well cast; DeNiro like the gay pirate ... invaluable, invaluable. So I laughed in one scene where Septimus comes to the ship ... Oh, my god, wow. Pfeiffer played a decent villain, I liked her as a mother in Hairspray. But she had the right amount of melodrama and snide comments throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was fun (but not slap-stick at all!), romantic, special effects were not common, but when they were, they were great; Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole's cameras were also well located. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies like the Princess Bride or even the Lord of the Rings. I've kept my interest all my time and I'm going to buy a DVD when it comes out!
