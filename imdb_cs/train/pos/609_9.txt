A very nice, very imaginative and film fairy tale that is everywhere, Stardust tells the story of a young man living outside the fantasy world who came in to get some fallen stars to find the star live, young and beautiful. The kingdom whose king is about to die said that the king would launch a competition for several of his sons to see who could get the ruby ​​first for the king, while the trio of witches wants to cut and use the star to keep them young. These three conspiratorial threads are intricately hiding all over the painting with mixing with a good actress, a brilliant special effect and also a firm mood and humor. Stardust is a funny movie and has some fun shows like Claire Danes as a star (I could have seen her for a while) with Michelle Pfeiffer (I could look at her full of magical powers even longer) by playing a terrible witch Robert Deniro who played pirated air pirate to perfection. Charlie Cox as the leader of Tristan is welcoming and trustworthy, and we get a very good job from a group of guys who play sons to be kings who constantly and consistently try to kill each other. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng and Ruppert Everett play their role well in both life and death (he also loved the whole thread). Peter O'Toole plays the dying killer dad and looks at the laughing man Ricky Gervais, who laughed me more than anything else in the short film five minutes (nice legs). But the real strength in the film is the novel Neil Gaiman and the script from his creative and fertile mind. Stardust creates his own mythology and his own world and works.
