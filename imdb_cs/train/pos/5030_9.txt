Something surprised me about this movie - it was really original. It was not such an old recycled cake that comes out of Hollywood every month. I saw this video on the video because I did not even know it before I saw it in my local video store. If you see this movie available - rent it - it will not regret it. The conclusion develops and the end of the twist is excellent. <br /> <br />
