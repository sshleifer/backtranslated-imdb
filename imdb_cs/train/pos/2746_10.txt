Imagine that in the cold night you will unplug the lights in a remote farmhouse and then you go to bed. No need to lock the door. The only sound is the wind that whistles through the trees. Sometime after midnight there is a car with light altitudes along the driveway. A moment later, the intruder places a flashlight into your darkened living room. <br /> <br /> What makes this picture so frightening is the setting: a distant farm ... at night. Based on the best-selling Truman Capote book and B & W's comparable to the best 1940 films, "In Cold Blood" is a terrifying story, especially in this first law, because the plot takes place mostly at night and on rain, roads. It's something of a nightmare. But it is no dream. The events really happened in 1959. Two men with delusional puzzles killed the entire Kansas family and were looking for cash that did not exist. Director Richard Brooks used real places where real-life events took place, even on the farmhouse ... and its inside! It comes from an unforgettable and scary movie. Both leading actors are very similar to two real-life killers. Robert Blake is more than convincing like Perry Smith, short and staggered with a lot of legs that dreams of finding the buried treasure of Cortez. Scott Wilson is almost as good as Dick Hickock, a hungry speaker of an artist with an all-American smile. After their killing, the duo leads to Mexico. In fact, it's happening, so they're coming back to the US, stealing cars, stopping, and generally miserable when they're moving from place to place. But it's a crazy life, and both wizards soon reject their actions. The last twenty minutes of the movie is glamorous as the rain falls, the rope stiffens, and all we hear is heart pain. Even with his somewhat secular environment "In Cold Blood" stages in riveting detail a real life story, which still hypnotizes, almost half a century later. This setting does. Do you think people in rural Kansas still keep the door unlocked ... at night?
