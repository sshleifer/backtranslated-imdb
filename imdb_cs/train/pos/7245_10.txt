This is the only feature film about the world of the bridge. I found the first ten minutes a bit slow but after that the film is perfectly perfect for describing the professional players of the bridge and the way they live. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are very fun. I do not think a player who is not a bridge would get the magic of this movie. <br /> <br /> Some dresses are really beautiful, it's a shame that the movie is in black and white - I can only imagine what they look like in color. The way the media is displayed is totally cheerful. There is no way Earth would ever be such a bridge. <br /> <br /> Watch it as soon as possible and tell your friends.
