"Shore Leave" is usually the average adventure of Star Trek. But with the episode, nothing happened. I simply think that this is not the best show of what to offer to fans. It's fun, nothing more. However, I am glad that the TV show of this type has enough good reason to stop from serious intergalactic conflicts. In this episode, Kirk decides to give his crew some time and the landing party is transferred to a planet that looks like a perfect holiday spot. As usual, the planet is not as calm as it seems. There are some action and tense moments, but most of the story is played with laughter. Good, but insignificant.
