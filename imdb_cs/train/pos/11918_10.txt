"Angels in the Outfield" was originally a 1951 movie by Ted Turner's library; Disney passed it in 1994, this time with California Angels (now Los Angeles Angels) as a team (Disney's actually this and Anaheim Mighty Ducks Hockey Team, also good word use, what?). <br /> <br /> This film was about a few orphaned children who wanted a family. The man promised the boys family only when the Angels had won the flag. So once called God about this. The boy who prayed could see help on the way (and only the boy); For example, when the first angel came down, the player hit the ball so hard that he did not just beat the broken battle, so the ball too !!!!! For much of the season after the star stars of 1994, the Angels were at the top of AL West (whose home team is Rangers and still is). However, they lost the game because the boy was in court instead of the White Sox / Angels game (at that time there was no central division in baseball and therefore Chicago was in the West) and no angels were there to help. This created a new rule: no angels can help in the championship game. But wait! In the final championship, Angels won !!!!! It was a miracle! What I liked about this movie: It's a good movie. I think I prayed every night in recent years when I asked for help with the school and so on; now look at me! My work was good !!!!! For one, it shows that if you believe, God can send your angels down to help you with all the difficulties you can have in life. And second, it's a family baseball movie that's always exciting. It's also an old Disney movie; I saw it recently on the new Disney Channel (fleche !!!!!). "Angels in the Outfield" will change your life forever once you see it !!!! ! <br /> <br />
