This is undoubtedly one of the most funny movies ever made. Amitabh as country bumpkin, Arjun Singh, is cheerful. The best thing is laughter never stops. The plot is the same-old, same-old story where the baby is separated from the mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - with a happy ending. There are villains (Randjit) and there are brothers (Sashi Kapoor) and there are vixens (Parveen Babhi) and there are lovers (Smita Patil) and there is a blind brother and grandfather tossed in on a good scale. But this movie is about Amitabha and that's all you remembered. Amitabh comes to the city to become a decent life, and his dialogue and his manners are merry. Later in the movie he will change to Angry Young Man, whom he is known for, but humor remains. Among the rare parts include his walking, speaking and speaking English, the song (gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his father. <br /> <br /> Overall, I blended around the movie. If you want 3 hours of fun with Amitab in his absolute best - that's it. It's easy to give 10/10.
