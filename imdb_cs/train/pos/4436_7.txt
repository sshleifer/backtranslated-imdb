Tattooed Stranger was another of those rare B-movies that BBC2 screened for Christmas / New Year 2005-2006. Also see Live Lives and Brighton Strangler. In this man, a dog in Central Park goes to a deserted car and finds a dead woman inside. She was shot dead and the police tried to identify her only as a tattoo as the lead. After being identified, a killer appears and is finally shot in a shootout. Most of this film was shot in and around New York City so we could look at some parts of the city. We usually do not see, especially at the back streets. <br /> <br /> Mostly unknown are in the cast and John Miles gets top-level billing. <br /> <br /> Tattooed Stranger is worth looking for. Excellent but somewhat dark. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars of 5.
