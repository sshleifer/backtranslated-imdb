The true story of a lot of drug fans is robbing a notorious drug dealer, jewelry, weapons, and money. Some would say that this is a tragic story of America in the 1980s, when a high degree and a free sixties hit drugs and AIDS. Frankly, they are just ordinary people who have no goal in life sitting around the high and deciding to fend off a ruthless man. What is the second part of their plan? Once they have their stuff ... they will sit and get up again. Great plan. Even if you do not know the story, there is no tension or surprise in this movie. The fact that Cox is trying to build some folk heroes from these characters, with party scenes and assembling their prey, is weak and insulting. The story was better with direct access. As it is, it's just a sad story of small drug dealers who are killed by big drug dealers. A bigger story, more than one, is John Holmes. It is also the center of this story. This movie was supposed to be about him, his life. It was the one in the amazing landscape, with the wonders that want to disappear. Although not official, Boogie Nights is a better version of Holmes' life. It is not entirely material, but it is much more fun.
