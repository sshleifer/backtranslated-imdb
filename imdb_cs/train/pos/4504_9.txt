Here I thought "Nanook from the North" was the last word in archaic semi-doc 'eskimo' films. How bad! As an inflated sea kayaker, I stayed for up to 330 hours to watch that I hope to see some hand-made leather boats. The film did not disappoint me. Every kayak student should look here. (Note to other colleagues: they seem to use Norton Sound kayaks with one-point blades). The film, however, went beyond this narrow interest. Even though they were there, as others have noticed some small back-shot-fake-bits, the film has so much heart that they are just a little anger. It was (from the point of view of this very amateur anthropologist) probably the right time to film this film. At the beginning of the 1930s: the "talkies" are so new that they (including Louie B. Mayer!) Really allowed the Inuit to speak in their own language. And it's still so much that happened, despite the melodrama that was inspired, authentic. They're really dirty the polar bear, the whale and the caribou. The thirty-sixth version of this film would be so sophisticated with "stars," Technicolor, and so on, to make it worse. Seventies version? Not exactly. A very good companion to this excellent film is "The White Shadows in the South Seas" (1928). The geographically mirror image of "Eskimo" also deals with the inexorable and profound disturbance of Western culture / technology to unsuspecting people.
