BEFORE THE DEPARTURE TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE DEAD, you are promising, creating a simple robbery that is done badly, from different perspectives (in the RASHOMON style). Around the hour mark, Sidney Lumet transforms this film into something that is far more than the sum of its parts; eventually going into a multi-layered family drama and exploring the whole area of ​​human emotions / relationships, as the story comes to its cool climax. As in the case of Lumet, it is possible to perform a cast of stellar cast, without any indication of excessive behavior or exaggeration. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his best roles, is the complex, mysterious and interesting nature and often dwarves of Ethan Hawke, who plays his brother Hanka. This does not mean that Hawke is not bad; in fact, is quite adequate, in a disturbing role that suits his style. Marisa Tomei is excellent for her relatively short look (the fact she is wearing her body). The character of Albert Finney (Andy and Hank's father) is the most interesting and in my opinion deserves a bit more time on the screen. Amy Ryan also performs his work accordingly. <br /> <br /> BEFORE DEVILS KNOWS THAT HIS DEBIT is not an extraordinary movie but proves that Lumet is still at the top of his game on the (apparent) twilight of a famous career. Many of its features and trademarks appear here, not least the use of its characters. A filled-in killer script (no glossary), intelligent dialogue and stepping, and a decent score, BEFORE DEVIL, WHICH YOU KNOW TO BE DECK, is a must. A truly underestimated gem. 8/10. 3 Stars (out of 4). Just enter my Top 250 at 248. Highly recommended.
