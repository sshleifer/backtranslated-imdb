This film attracts you out of the way because it attracts attention by recognizing that this story starts with a cliché? funeral. <br /> <br /> In other hands than Judi I would not give him 8, because this material is done over and over again: Great assembly of one famous, please select team, army platoon, theater group, singers, band . But this movie never relies on cheap sentimentalization, and if you think it goes, it will go in another direction. These are the flowers sent by admirer Judi. <br /> <br /> Band members are an interesting group and ride over clichés. One is in prison, one found religion, one is alkie, and one sank into dementia. But Joie de Vivre, re-discovered by Judy, bewildered by the interest of her granddaughter, brings us and transforms us into the sometimes simplifying nature of the conspiracy. The actor is the one who has the talent, Leslie Caron, the incomparable jazzist Cleo Laine with amazing high notes, Joan Sims's latest performance, Joe's brace, cute as a flirtatious Ian Holm with a ball and Olympia Dukakis as a divorced divorced wife living in the Scottish Highlands of Ghillie and her whiskey, the final scene is a standard Hollywoodland prize, the decisive children of the stars transformed into fun loving supporters, the old lovers reunited, the young men rose in the music of the old timers. Life should be so simple. But I would follow it again and want, with my own granddaughter. Because in the right hands sometimes they just love the old clichés. 8 out of 10.
