Despite being told from a British perspective, it is the best DVD DVD of the Second World War. Featuring in a spendable (as a war as a war) episode, Laurence Olivier's deep voice combines a number of eyewitnesses who were forced to live the events of this terrible time. He is eager to wait for his DVD appearance in the United States. Europeans had the opportunity to release on DVD earlier this year.
