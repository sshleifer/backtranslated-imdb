Part of The Grinch was made for Jim Carrey and I was extremely impressed by his performance. He was not a great fan, I was terrible but pleasantly surprised by the result. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who was the cutest little girl I've seen on the screen for a long time and she has shown maturity for her years in her acting skills. He even even attracted me to tears! I have never read a book by Dr. Seussa, so I did not know what to expect, the humor was pretty dark. Overall, I liked the movie (except songs!) And would recommend it especially for family viewing.
