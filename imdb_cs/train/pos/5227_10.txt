"The Men in White" is sure to be one of the funniest, if not the most entertaining, comedic films I've ever watched! (and I've watched a lot!) It's about two apostates who become "men in white" and then stop the invasion of the universe. It's also a parody of many classic movies, such as "Men in Black", "Star Wars" or "Dr. Strangelove". Anyone who says this movie is dirty has something to do with it. There are lots of funny gags and jokes, and you might actually hurt your mouth when you laugh too (that's what happened to me!). If you can watch this movie on TV, watch it now - you will not regret it!
