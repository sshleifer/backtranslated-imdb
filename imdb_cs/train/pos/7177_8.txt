I was so entertaining in this perfect document, and I expected this to be good when the pipeline (my local video chain) came out, and it was worth it. I like a good documentary / interesting song, but this is definitely sincere, sincere and nostalgic if you want to look back on teenage life. The child's imagination is fascinating and a great story begins there. Rent it or buy it if you like good, humorous and all around a fun document. Mr. Stein and the company have certainly come a long way from the neighborhood of videocameric productions of bankers and gays who make gay people from one perspective. Everyone seems to be quite successful in those respectable fields, and it was good to know that they are all still good friends. The DVD has several additional trailers for other good documentary films and includes a number of Darren's most prolific productions including Crazy News.
