It's your standard 30-year-old music comedy, with the big plus that it offers some 30 well-known actors in small fun friends. <br /> <br /> It's not a story of power and the movie is basically all about its entertainment and no-worries the overall kind of atmosphere, with Hal Roach's hall of comedy about it. Appereantly it's "Cinderella Story", but I certainly did not mean that while watching the movie. The story is very much confused in narration stories, which has many different characters and also many small portraits when the main characters hit the Hollywood studios. <br /> <br /> Of course the top of the movie is when Laurel & Hardy look and show some of their routines. It's like watching a movie and getting free Laurel & Hardy. Also Laurel and Hardy regular Walter Long appears in the routine and James Finlayson (without the mustache this time) as the short director. It is certainly true that all portraits and subplots are scattered from the main line of plot and character, but in this case it is no problem, because it is much more fun and more interesting than watching the main line of the fence and shallow typical main character. The film is certainly no worse than any other genre of the same time period, although the rating would suggest something else. <br /> <br /> 7/10
