An interesting way of behaving like people so often that we are sometimes blinded by the desire to achieve perfection, in order to sometimes destroy the basics of what we are trying to achieve. It also deals with the question of how we ignore those of us who are not so open, and can escape great opportunities. Comedy Injection also makes film watching a pleasant experience. It must be seen for anyone interested in a reflective but comical look at life. I look forward to your next product. I hope you will continue to provide us with quality entertainment. Excellent work ...... Joanne
