I've been trying to find out about this series for ages! Thank you, IMDb! I saw it as a child, and I could never get it out of my mind. As a 6-year-old, of course, I was especially hit by a blueprint episode that was totally cool (I talked about so much that my older brother gave me cyclops from a plastic cave piece that I still remember) And what I also remember was an atmosphere that was unusual from the beginning - mysterious, austere and extremely authentic. When I read the original many years later, I experienced the same feeling. It's very hard to capture - and probably impossible in Hollywood. Every "Odyssey" I've seen since then has been extremely weak. The characters in this series looked real, real people - ancient Greek people - and not some Hollywood stars in costumes. This is a true masterpiece! But - Why is not it known? And why not available on VHS or DVD? I'd love to see it again!
