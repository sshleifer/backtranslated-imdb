If the thought of Arthur Askey is going to trick your worries, do not worry, you can still watch and love The Ghost Train as well as the equally stunning Back Room Boy, it's a movie that's just too damn good to be sinked with a single performance, and the leader of the actor. Personally, I like Askey, perhaps because I'm going to his world, rather than exaggeratingly expecting to come into my own, a mistake that too many people do. The Ghost Train is so intense that you could not imagine it without being amazed in the deep, dark world in which it transports you, it's somewhat somewhat somewhat inexpensive that gleeful flagship waves have been during the desperate early 1940s and it's a movie I imagined that only a few people ever watched once. The cast is exceptionally good, maybe Linden Travers is a little dense, but behind the lonely train station during the war, she barely played nutter and did not look out. The sad crawl of beautiful Carole Lynne at the beginning of this year interrupted the last link we had with this incredible film, and now it's really in the past but patiently waiting to print the game.
