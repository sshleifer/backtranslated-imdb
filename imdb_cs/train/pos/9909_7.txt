Serious comedy. Ross Hunter's film version of the French game "Les Joies de la Famille" (later Americanized as a "very wealthy woman") is plush, well-filled, sometimes fun ... and unfortunately timeless. The rich widow in California, who seems to empty her money, is the narrator of her two greedy, greedy daughters, both of whom fear that Mommy Rosie will spend her inheritance unnecessarily. The whole vital question - but the aging - the woman who was sent to rest against her will and later had to learn through a hearing is a tiny material for comedy (and to his credit, director David Lowell Rich does not overcome the image with indecent gags or obvious sentiment). Some of the humor are a bit broad and do not work, but Rosalind Russell understands the gravity of his own script, and never gets a fake note. Sandra Dee is also good as Rosalind's granddaughter, and James Farentino is very charming as a young lawyer. The film has so much information about the importance of our elderly people and the ways in which they decide to spend the rest of the time with the theme of "Rosie!" Almost loses in a hurry to a happy ending. The image lets you smile - and at the same time, she is interested in how many older ladies have never been so happy. *** z ****
