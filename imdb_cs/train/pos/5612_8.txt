In Paris, the shy and uncertain bureaucrat Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) rented an old flat without a suicide suicide by the previous Egyptologist Simone Choule (Dominique Poulange). Inconvenient concierge (Shelley Winters) and hard Mr. Zy (Melvyn Douglas) set strict rules of conduct and Trekovsky feels that his neighbors are going. Meanwhile, Simone visits the hospital and is in touch with his girlfriend Stella (Isabelle Adjani). After Simone's death, Trekovsky feels obsessed and believes that his landlord and neighbors plot a plan that makes him suicide. <br /> <br /> The strange "Le Locataire" is a disturbing and creepy story of paranoia and deception. The story and process of madness and loss of the identity of the lonely Trelkovsky slowly develop into nightmare in the dreadful place of his apartment, and what is really happening is utterly unpredictable. The performances are amazing and Isabelle Adjani is extraordinarily beautiful. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "About Inquilino" ("Ten Tenant")
