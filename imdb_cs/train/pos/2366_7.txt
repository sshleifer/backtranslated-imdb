This movie (with another name "Martial Law 3" for some reason) first introduced me to Jeff Wincott. And it was a great introduction. Although I have never heard of him before, he seemed to be a great warrior. The action scenes in this movie are great! Many of them are by the way. Recruitment at the Peacekeepers headquarters is particularly good. There's something about a single guy who's crazy about a bunch of people, which is really fun. And for the rest of the cast: Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for a villain. This role is good for her (but no others). Matthias Hues has also done a good job, as always. He is a great fighter and macho-like character, and was a good opponent for Wincott in this film.
