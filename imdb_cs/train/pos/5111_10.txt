Does anybody know what kind of John T collector he was driving? It looks like Ford in the mid-seventies. This movie is my favorite and my wife. It was the first unforgettable movie we saw as a married couple. Lift is interesting because it is similar to the first car I have ride and recently I found another. I would like to renew the pickup to resemble the movie. Also the music was amazing and the acting was great. Where and what is the lady who portrayed John's aunt? John also had a piece on the scene in the tower when he almost fell? Also, what Mustang did Debra W in this show. It looked like a model of the 1960s. Thanks,
