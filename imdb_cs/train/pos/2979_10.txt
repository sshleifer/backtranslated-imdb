There's really not much to say about this movie ... it's rough but fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> When the game becomes a huge success, along with the billionaire's help, they create a professional baseball league where everyone gets the same pay and no team can change cities. Coop & Remer team, Milwaukee Beers is the only team in the way of major changes to the rules that Dallas Felons (Vaughn) wants to set up. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Although I'm not a big fan of Southpark, Parker and Stone are doing pretty good work in their first real movie. <br /> <br /> There are so many fun moments in this movie that you can not name them all. They will never really leave, and they do not try to put a bit of a cruel drama to make it serious. <br /> <br /> And my favorite aspect of this movie: Soundtrack. That's great. I especially like "Take Me" and "Beer" Reel Big Fish. Very underestimated. <br /> <br /> A rough, but extremely fun movie. 10/10 <br /> <br /> James "Black Wolf" Johnston
