My friend and I liked this movie very much. The viewer is expelled from modern life to old Japan and at the same time is exposed to very topical themes. Characters are realistic and detailed; has an unpredictable ending and a story that is very refreshing. The story is made up of mini-plots in the life of several geisha living together in a poor urban neighborhood. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in realistic romance or living in old Japan. <br /> <br />
