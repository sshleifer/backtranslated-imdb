Yes, I'll say before I comment, this movie is incredibly underestimated. Sharon Stone is great in her role as Catherine Trammell, as well as Morrissey as Dr. Glass An analyst is sent to evaluate it after the death of a sports star. Glass is attracted to the seductive play Trammel uses to manipulate his mind. The game was good (except Thewlis) Stone really has talent with this role. It is neat, naughty and seductive and does not look older than she in the first. It really did me (like in a casino). Morrisey was also good. He showed a lot of vowellibility in the role he needed. But Thewlis was lame. He destroyed his character and he was all the way. He really sucked. Overall, this movie is not as good as the first, but Stone is a swing. Just ignore Thewlis.
