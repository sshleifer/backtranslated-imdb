It was "The Night HE Came Home", warned posters for John Carpenter's career making horror classics. He meets a small American town with medieval Halloween around serial killer Michael Myers who tries to trace his sister Laurie Strode and in this process eliminates all his friends rather brutally ... leaving poor Laurie to fight against the seemingly indestructible Michael. This plot scenario inspired countless horror knock-offs in the 1980s and 90s and continues today as well as the badly-received remake of 2007. The difference between them, and that's just that "Halloween" is the best. Made from a very modest, tense budget ... Halloween changed the face of horror in 1978 and spawned the genre of "sexually promiscuous adolescents who became a knife / ax / chainsaw / controlling psycho."
