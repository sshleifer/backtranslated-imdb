I've read a lot of reviews about this movie and I have to say, "What's wrong with you?!?!" It was a great movie! I thought this movie was excellent from the beginning to the end and the story was very good. I am convinced that people who did not like this movie did not pay too much attention to the film. There are a number of very important scenes that if you do not pay attention, you will be confused and the following scenes may not make sense. I urgently urge everyone who did not like to look at it again and look at itself to really pay attention. The story gave me quite a sense, and as I said, it was very good. Each scene in the movie has a point and everything fits into the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> All the actors have done a fantastic job! Sean Connery was very good in his role as always. Laurence Fishburne was great as Tanne Brown, who played a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw was also nice and looks fantastic. Blair Underwood was a pleasant surprise, I did not expect him to be great, but he did a great job. Ed Harris was a real jewel in the movie. He plays a really sick man and really makes you see how his character is disturbed. Watch his eyes in his scenes, just great! Also, the very young Scarlett Johansson (as Kate) is one of her first roles ... it's not a bad place to start. Excellent cast in this movie! I would strongly recommend this film to anyone who likes one of the cast members or just like thrillers. It's a great movie and should be seen. Do not listen to the opinions of all other people, check out the film and come to your conclusions. I hope you will see a movie and I hope you will like me as well. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
