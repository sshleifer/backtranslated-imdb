Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have the least heard - basically the same principles as the second and fourth, and has nothing revolutionary about it. But it's still great - the fiery duke of Wellington and the fat crazy doctor Johnson (the writer of the first English vocabulary) make this series the way they count. In this series, there are even more fun, one-time films that bring humor in this line, in lesser-known times - in historically accurate and entertaining episodes. Blackadder's third trip is not the most famous and best known of the lot, but Rowan Atkinson's role as a stupid princess's valet is fun and effective, and Hugh Laurie is the best in this series. Very good! 9/10
