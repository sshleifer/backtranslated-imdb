I have never seen such incredible acting work in the movie as I did when I saw that Daniel Day-Lewis plays Christy Brown in my left leg. In fact, outside the scene, his role was not over. He played the role of Christy Brown, or at least as he himself, by filming the film and needed surgery because of the damage his superior work had done on his back. For me, it is remarkable, and through all the pain he has stood to play this role, I believe it is most likely that he has managed to get as many Oscars as possible. He was so masterful in this difficult part that I think no one could do better or with greater consequences than he did. Although I can not say that this is the biggest film of all time, I can say that playing this unthinkable role and then continuing to play until it has not even been done is undoubtedly the biggest leg I have ever seen the actor do. Probably someone also cares.
