A matter of life and death that you can really say that it would properly administer the genius and beauty of this film. Powell and Pressburger's visual imagination do not know any boundaries, each picture is filled with fantastically daring compositions. The switches between the courageous colors of the "real world" and the bright black and white sky are subtle and show us visually how much more lively life is. The final court scene is also fantastic because the judge and the jury descend the stairs to heaven to lead the court over Peter (David Niven). <br /> <br /> All the performances are in place (Roger Livesey's standout), and the romantic energy of the movie is beautiful, it was never a romantic movie than this one (if I liked it, I saw it). The matter of life and death is all about the power of love and the importance of life. And Jack Cardiff's cinematography is the reason why the movie itself watches Kim Kim's face shining, making her even more beautiful, how brilliant she can make simple things like a table tennis game exciting. And the sound design is also perfect; the way the sound dampens in life points was the decisive one a long time ago. This is a true classic that can restore faith in cinematography, underestimated at the initial release and today's audience, but one of my favorite favorite movies, which is why I give 10/10 this film - beautiful.
