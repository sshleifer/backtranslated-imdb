The more I look at Nicholas Cage, the more I respect him as an actor. Watching this movie now (in 2005) I can see that it does not really match the genre of films that came out in the early 1990s. I do not think it can be considered a movie noir, but it's sometimes quite dark, mainly due to the lighting and special personality of the characters. Typical performances from each of the three major actors who all worked well in their roles. But I thought the characters of Hopper and Boyle remained undeveloped, for it was sometimes difficult to understand what they were doing and why they did. Hopper loves him or hates him as a kid. The conspiracy is really good, and although I found some parts to be unrealistic, there were parts where I had to hand them over to the headmaster (that is, when he first saw the sheriff). Overall, this film is definitely worth watching. *** 1/2
