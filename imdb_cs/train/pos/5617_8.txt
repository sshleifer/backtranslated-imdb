After his classic film Chinatown, Roman Polanski, he returned to the themes that gave him his greatest hits in the 1960s with this horrifying psychological horror, which, like Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby, deals with paranoia and claustrophobia caused by residential life. > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The emphasis on the side walls and distant points of disappearance is greater than ever, and even in a small number of external scenes the sky is rarely seen. But the tenant is not only spatially limited, but also in the intensity with which he focuses on his protagonist. Trelkovsky, played by Polanski himself is not just in every scene, there is practically every shot. When the screen more often than the camera does not become a Trelkovsky look. Of course, almost everywhere he seems to see his own reflection and looks at him in the mirror. I can not think of any film that is more about internalization and loneliness of one character. Some psychological thrillers, such as M or Peeping Tom, manipulate us to focus on the mentally ill protagonist. Others, such as Psycho, will try to make a thorough scientific analysis of their mental state. Does the tenant not fit into any of these categories? simply immerses us completely in Trelkovsky's experience without asking us to actually understand or appreciate what is happening in his head. We feel his paranoia and obsession, even if we are constantly revealed to us that they are irrational. Polanski was also a master of the slowly-evolving horror film. Often in their horrors, there is ambiguity about whether something is really wrong, but it is one of the most effective in a terrifying audience. Why? Just because they are so slowly developing and investing so much time into carefully set situations that the viewer immerses in paranoia. A lot later, the horror of Polanski, the Ninth Gate is a little mess, but at least he can achieve that creepy feeling of fear. That's a rare chance to see Polanski's main role. His talent in front of the camera was just as good as he was behind him, and he is perfectly perfect like the thin Trelkovsky. Another extraordinary performance is that Shelley Winters as anything was often overlooked as a gatehouse. In fact, it's more of a star cast, though many famous faces look out of place in this strange, Gothic European film. Also, sadly many French actors in supporting roles are blackmailed in English. <br /> <br /> The tenant is better and less demanding than repulsion, but he lacks the tension and character that gives birth to Rosemary's Baby so fascinating and entertaining. The tenant is good, without major shortcomings, and Polanski was really in the top form of a director, but he is not one of his most fascinating works.
