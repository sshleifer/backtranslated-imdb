I think this movie is absolutely beautiful. And I do not mean just breathtaking scenery. These are two unhappy English housewives who have decided to rent an Italian castle to relax from their happy home life. Finally, four women rented the site together, all with different personalities and different reasons why they were there. In this magically beautiful place everyone will find the peace they desire, and interestingly, that peace comes from internal reflections and resolutions, rather than without. I also find it amazing because of relationships that develop with kindness and understanding. The actor is happy to watch alone. I especially love the characters of Lottie (Josie Lawrence) and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker).
