I'm not at all funny about horror films and I'm willing to look at any of them. That does not mean I'm willing to watch many of them, or that they will not have criticism for them. This movie is scary and is very well done. In fact, I think this movie would have a great double account with a 9th session. I should specify before I get to my comments that I tracked it myself. I started watching her before bedtime and I got about 15 minutes before I realized it was too effective, so I saved the rest in the morning. Even when he watched him in bright daylight, it was still scary. However, I can not guarantee how effective it would be when watching in a larger group. After the death of their daughter, the couple moved to a remote cabin as a means of trying to come up with this death. Let me acknowledge this death - that's one of those rare movies that do not bother about the death of a child. This is more important because it both sets the tone as well as explains much of the acting that penetrates the movie. The couple are not doing well. The wife gives up herself and her husband does what she can and tries to get her back. While some of the comments were complaining about their actions - one specified that they behave more like a father and daughter than a husband and wife, and that is legitimate. She is trying to give her more direction. It is a role that some people sometimes accept. There are a variety of fears in the film and most of them are relatively non-violent, although in some ways they are grotesque. The story itself feels very straightforward for most of the film and is coming to an end. While the turn is not absurd, it is certainly not what you expected from the way things went. Moody, atmospheric and very well done for something that seemed to be filmed on the video.
