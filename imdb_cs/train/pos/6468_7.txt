This is a pretty good movie ... yes some parts are chrome and exceptionally suitable and the film really does not justify the big cast (AB, SD, Tanuja). However, an actor who really caught me was Kay Kay Menon (not to be confused with the singer KK). In the scene where he first saw Amitabha's figure, I thought the guy who is just staring at the AB stays constantly and does not say a word, and still looks strong, he's a good actor. In fact, Sarkar had succeeded again, along with AB for the second time. This guy should get more roles, he's great. If you've read any other reviews here on IMDb, you already know, and I agree that Akshay Khanny's entry to Pakistan was too easy. And the little love angle she shared with "what her face" was utterly useless. But he's a pretty good actor (as seen in DCH), Sunjay Dutt is always watching, always. and AB ... what can I say. I do not know if I'm his biggest fan in the world, but I know I can definitely compete for the place. Interesting watch, given that it is Bollywood, though a little inspired by Hollywood oldies like "Big Escape" and "Bridge on the Kwai River".
