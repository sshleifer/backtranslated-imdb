The summer was so full of mass fools and movie returns, not to mention some disappointments of those returns, that I was afraid to find a movie I could sit and enjoy. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to read on the page (there are no spoilers), I'll summarize it here: It's more mature than Ella Enchanted (there are some dubious violent parts, lots of death and a few scenes with a little blood, small children), but they do not try to be too cruel or cross their borders. Think of it as a little more serious, a little magical bride princess and you will be close. <br /> <br /> -------------------------------------------------- ------------------- <br /> <br /> I'm just as unhappy movie viewer as the others ... Maybe once or twice a month if I feel active . I'm also a huge fan of Sci-Fi / Fantasy. I'm bored with repeated story stories and movies with more flash than filling faster than you can count on 10 and this movie is a rough diamond. By the end of August I was pretty tired of the broken expectations of big hits I turned away when I saw Bourne Ultimatum in favor of Stardust. When my hopes of Transformers were deeply seized by fiction, Stardust's previews looked appealing, but I was certainly cautious. Like many others here, I was absolutely surprised. I thought I was seeing another generic fantasy movie, clich√© from here to breakfast. Do not be fooled, it's definitely a fairy tale and really has a witch, a spell and absolutely requires a pause of infidelity ... But the most refreshing thing I found is that it is not based on anything I have seen or read in the last 15 years and is it really is a really good movie. (((Unlike 90% of other films that seem to be reminiscent of thorns on one side, maybe they sign that Hollywood is filled with ideas? This year I could read the book and in two years the film will look like another "Epic fantasy story, like LotR and others," NYT says, and such and such a doubt.) <br /> <br /> Stardust did not have to screw me to my seat due to a blocked hit at every step, nor did I get the hub off because of a hook conspiracy on the hook that threatens to tear the dramatic tension and echo all over the theater in a loud boom I did not even use the immense sounds to draw attention to what's going on on the screen (Transformers, I'm looking at you) It does not try to showcase the latest CGI techniques I did not break my intelligence with blurred dialogues and story lines that are simple enough to think of them in 3rd grade (the boy I hate you). /> <br /> I just watched ... I watched and I developed a refreshing CREATIVE in front of my eyes. Sure, maybe I knew what was going to do most of the movie, but it was forgetting it. Even my heart has concentrated in some parts, but the most important aspect I've noticed is that I left the theater and felt better than when I entered. It's really a gem. After so many summer woods with so many snakes and movies that did not meet my expectations, it was like a cool, sweet cup of tea to shoot all the hard work that I did to sit through the others trying to make the money out of it. <br /> <br /> It's probably not for everyone, but do yourself a favor; If you like fantastic movies that stand by themselves (Princess Bride, Black Boiler, Dark Crystal, etc.), You should really see this movie. This little diamond finds a way to my DVD collection as it hits stores, you can trust me in it. <br /> <br /> Simply.
