Given that the average voice was relatively low, and the fact that the clerk at a video rental shop thought it was "okay," I did not have much to expect when renting this movie. I enjoyed it above. It's a charming movie. He did not have to grow on me, I enjoyed it from the beginning. Mel Brooks gives great performance as the main character, I think somewhat different from his usual personality in his films. <br /> <br /> There are not many jokes left out or something like that, but there are some rather funny scenes, and overall it's a very nice and very easy movie. <br /> <br /> We are highly recommended.
