Xiao Chen Zhi Chun is a great movie not only in the year when he was shot but now. It is an artistic film that is not obsolete in the 21st century. The director kept a good narrative skill, so he made the story so smooth! The film reminds me of my later French new wave movie: Francois Truffaut is "Femme d'a cote", which is on a similar subject.
