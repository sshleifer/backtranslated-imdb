I love this movie, but music at all graduate gatherings is simply stupid. The fateful game took place in 1972. This means that the protagonists graduated in 1972. But almost all the music played on dances etc. came from the 1950s and 1990s. <br /> <br /> When I just visited my 30th high school meeting, I can assure you that the latest music that will be played at the meeting or dance of the former high school people understands the music of their parents. I understand the difficulty of searching for relevant music in the 1970s - we all know what a waste of time it was musically. But it was not completely abandoned, and filmmakers should be more careful. In those dance scenarios, I found that I was very paralyzing my otherwise willing suspension of distrust in the rest of the film. It was a bad director and / or decision maker.
