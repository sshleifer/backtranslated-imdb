Airwolf The Movie, Variant on the original 2-pilot pilot, Although the film is shorter, it contains more footage of Unseen in the two-hour pilot Pilot is much more than the pilot in the film Where the pilot film is normally the same (2 parter combined) But the film is actually different add-ons and shooting here. <br /> <br /> Look, even if you have a season 1 DVD, "Movie" It's still in some stores like virgo, woolworths and similar mixed media stores, although it generally requires ordering, but it saves the need to buy on-line (as many of us still do not believe or believe in online shopping), but if you look around the airwolf at the shops <br /> <br /> Airwolf was really one of the 80 most under rated shows. <br /> <br /> Full size Airwolf is currently being refurbished for the helicopter museum:) Info and unfinished photos are over at http://Airwolf.org Also with Airwolf Mods for Flashpoint and Flight Sim Games Hears is he finally to stay again :)
