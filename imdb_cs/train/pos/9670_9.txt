One of the best movies I've ever seen was an Irish film called Philadelphia, Here I Come. I read the game before I saw the movie and I loved it. It's the story of a young man who is about to leave Ireland to go to America because he can not live in Ireland. This is said from the point of view of a young man (whom the other characters in the movie can see) and another young man who represents his uncensored thoughts and feelings but which other filmmakers can not see. It's a very sad movie, but it's deeply touching, and I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants to think. I like an Irish movie, or almost any film about Ireland, and any movie that has a later Irish actor, Donal McCann, gets my voice in it. I was watching the man chewing gum for 2 hours on the screen, and unfortunately, I have. the pity he lost so young.
