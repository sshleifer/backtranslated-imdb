Just commenting on New Orleans accents ... An older reviewer noted the following: "This movie could have been shot in New York City or in another northern city, because it features characters that speak similarly to" broklynnes "than a possible southern accent that would that part of the country has heard. "There was also another comment on these lines from the English reviewer. <br /> <br /> Many people in New Orleans, in fact, sound "broklynnes". I never found out why. (It's mentioned in "Confederacy of Dunes" by John Kennedy Tooll.) I always appreciate the films that are taking place in New Orleans that contain this detail as it does. Too often, it's just a Hollywood version of a standard Southern accent.
