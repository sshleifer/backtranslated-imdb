The man in the fire was hot. I like the classic story of good vengeance and what better reason to revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent little girl. Writers made a great deal of work in this film by building a relationship between Creasy (Denzel Washington) and Pita (Dakota Fanning) to make the audience understand and really feel what Creature had to save Pitu. It was also good that Creasy was not a type of choir boy who tried to save Pita through "proper" channels, but instead used the tactics of suffering and street sadness. Some may say, "Torture is wrong no matter," and you may be right, but when you see the pain that Creasy is going through because of the loss of Pity and total passion for getting it back, you can not help, with Creasy and attract him, to be even ruthless. There would be no progress if Creasy used diplomacy to deal with various shameful gangsters and criminals, and he knew it. Creasy's journey ended with the return of Pity to her mother and Creasy dying of bad guys in the car. But Creasy's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the film, actually improving it by showing that Creasy was willing to die to get Pitu back. His death was, in fact, noble. Denzel does a great job as well as writers. This film deserves good marks because it was definitely a good movie.
