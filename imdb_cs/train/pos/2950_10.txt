If you have ever been sad that you could not make a movie on DVD, it was probably the "Delirious" you were looking for. How often do you laugh when you look at comedy routines? I was too young when I saw Richard Pryor in his greatest time, and when I was old enough to see Eddie Murphy's "Delirious" and "Raw" (not so funny), I never knew where Eddie gained much of his inspiration. Now that I'm older and saw both Pryor and many Murphy comics, I realize two things: all STEALS from Eddie, while Eddie LOVINGLY PICTURES from Richard. That's a huge difference: Eddie was original, funny, provocative, thoughtful? and more. It was something that was not seen before. It was all we ever needed. In these days is Eddie Murphy dull and old? but once was the King and "Delirious" was the largest castle ever built. It's really one of the funniest routines of all time.
