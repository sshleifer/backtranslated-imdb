Night Listener is probably not one of William's best roles but it is very interesting in a very strange but very different film. I can guarantee you have never seen this kind of movie yet. Some people may not love the slow stimulation of this movie, but I think it's a great addition to the movie. It is definitely one of the best films that came out in 2006. It has an interesting performance in a movie with great content, a dramatic feeling. This is not an americanized movie. This is not a predictable movie. You feel it's a movie that has a mystery that makes it hard to figure out what its outcome might be. This is not an excellent movie that has everything, but hell, it's a damn good and very original movie.
