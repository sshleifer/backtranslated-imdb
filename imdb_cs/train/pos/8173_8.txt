The brilliance of this film is that even an experienced dentist is pretty scary. It is one of the first fears of man. This movie is a nightmare that every child has to go through in the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen gives a surprisingly insignificant performance as a crazy dentist who thinks he's trying to kill people, but he works only on his teeth, so it really is not a job. In a particularly cruel scene we find such actor Earl Boen, who has his teeth completely destroyed by the exercise and what not, which in my opinion is absolutely the worst you can do when you are a dentist killer. It is a typical situation of Brian Yuzna, which is not well written but there is a gore. The conspiracy is dirty, and sometimes it seems to be in place, but hey, it's the killer of dentists, we all thought, but they did it first.
