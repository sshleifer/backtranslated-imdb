It's better to adapt the book than the one with Paltrow (although I liked it). It's not so much that Beckinsale is better - they're both very good - but the script is better. Davies is the master of Austen's adaptation to shoot, and production values ​​here are very good. It's not as shiny as Hollywood treatment, but it's close, and I thought places and costumes really worked better.
