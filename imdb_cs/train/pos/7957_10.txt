Hey guys, I've been watching everywhere I find these two movies and I can not find them anywhere in my area. (I am an Australian). Can you help me and tell me where to buy? In General Home Ward Bound 1 and 2 are the best movies I've ever seen and are good for people of all ages. It was my favorite wen movie, I was 5 years old, and it's still a teenager now. It's a great movie for the whole family. My whole family loves this film except my younger sister because I've been watching her so many times that she's sick. I love this movie and I can not wait to buy it again on DVD. Sally
