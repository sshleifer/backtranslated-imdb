I would not like to call "We're Back! Dinosaur's Story" just a kid's version of Jurassic Park. I found it more interesting than that. Just as in the past, it casts doubt on the certainty of bringing beings from one era to ours. But it really opens my eyes when I see who gave voices: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. In order to paraphrase: "Cheers", Guest "Tonight Show", The most trusted name in the news, known chef, police chief Young Frankenstein Lisa Simpson, one of three Amigos and CNN guy. <br /> <br /> But I think I should not just concentrate on the cast. I thought this movie had something for kids (purely fun) and for adults (natural history). It is true that it is a leak, but a susceptible species. I really want to say that John Goodman, who makes Rex's voice, is the forerunner of his voice work in "Monsters Inc.". Worth seeing.
