Continuing Angels with dirty faces just in the name, The Angels Wash Their Faces suffer somewhat from the usual Dead End Kids shenanigans. In fact, with the presence of Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan, it should be considered a real sequel to Angels With Dirty Faces, at least for the sake of continuity. <br /> <br /> Talking about Ann Sheridan, she is the only true light of this movie. To paraphrase cliches, Ann Sheridan could read the phone book for two hours and buy a DVD! Another virtue of this film is chemistry between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, this aspect of the film keeps too far in the background. For a better example of the Sheridan-Reagan duet I would recommend Juke Girl or Kings Row.
