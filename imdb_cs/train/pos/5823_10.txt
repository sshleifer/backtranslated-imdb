At Micro Phonies, there are the best stoogs. In this short trio, they are working in the recording studio. Eventually, they look at Alice Van Doren (Christine Mcintyre), who sings with the voice of spring. The voice is amazing. Curly in drags is heard Mrs. Bixby (Symona Boniface). Moe is called Curly Senior Cucaracha. The three hundred will end up at a party where Curly dresses. They play records of the spring voices, and everything works well until Moe destroys the record of Curly's head. Eventually they ended up using lucie sexlet until the baritone is recognized and disconnected. Alice Van Doren caught the boy and screamed behind the curtain to help them. Everything is good until the baritone trusts that Curly sings without the help of a phonograph that Alice finds it behind the curtain. The three hundreds are revealed as scams, but Alice's father discovers her daughter's talent and agrees to become a singer. Stoge is thrown out of the room. Excellent.
