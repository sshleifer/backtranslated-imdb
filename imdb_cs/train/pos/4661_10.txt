I can only praise the other reviews here. It's a wonderful film with the honest factor it achieves without crossing the border into sentimental sentimentality. Naturally sweet - without added sugar. One small point: it seems to me that the slight objections raised to Ustinov's character that Pendelton can enter and defeat the security of the system ignores the fact that Pendelton is clearly a genius / savant in this kind of thing. Yes, the film was quite illiterate, but he showed Pendelton that he "is studying computers" in his apartment, and I think the result is that his gifts allowed him to simply catch the whole thing virtually overnight. <br /> <br /> During a few scenes, a few special moments appeared when Gnatpole tried to test Pendelton's knowledge and call his bluff. I'm not sure if we should believe that Pendelton was cleverly exhausted from these situations, or whether he was actually sufficiently informed to pass the tests - that was a bit unclear. Certainly he had to know enough to create fictitious accounts. It is assumed that Wallach and Ustinov relied on their own somewhat vague idea of ​​how computers worked in those days, and in order to understand in detail what they are getting, it is necessary to know what their concepts are. They knew there was something about "procedures" that were important; they thought that "intelligent light" could actually control security, rather than point to its status; they thought the function (dumb) user terminal would strongly affect what could be done on the mainframe itself - although in addition to things like graphics, I do not see it myself. <br /> <br /> Most of the time I think they tried to avoid the subject of real computer operations as much as possible, and they did it better. Allowing them a bit of artistic license, I do not think their efforts had some mistakes that should be useful. <br /> <br />
