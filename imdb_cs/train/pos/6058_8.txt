This is a great documentary about the exciting world of Indy Car racing. Photography is simply superb. The scene was Mario Andretti driving an old racing roadster along New England Street lined with old maples, the leaves blown side by side with the speed of the car, is unbelievable. The film loses its beauty on the small screen, but if you like to watch cars that have gone to the border, you should see this movie.
