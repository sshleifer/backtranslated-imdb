I was not quite sure what to expect with this, except for the single positive reviews I read. It turned out that I had never imagined this movie because she was very close to the "White-haired Bride" in that she was opera and she was fantastic. This passes through a fine line between farce, comedy, and a good story of the old fashioned spirit. It's nothing terrible, it's not a theme, it's really a predominantly love story that deals with a vicious guy who encounters a beautiful spirit who has a lot of trouble with other ghosts. So the main topic is the guy who is trying to save the beautiful spirit. It also takes place in ancient China, with wildly exceptional Kung Fu exhibitions and a trip to hell (more or less). Some demo-stop demons are pretty cool, and visual effects are the best speed all the way. I want to watch this genre of Chinese movies all day long because they are very fun, great visuals and to a great extent languages. And I'm looking forward to watching the first sequel of this movie as well. Highly recommended.
