This film, yet critically acclaimed, has not yet been released in the US, as well as other great "Housekeeping" by Christine Lahti in the same year. However, if you can support regional DVDs (Region 4), this small piece should be in your collection. Several copies of VHS are still available on the Internet. Davis is complemented by a great story, as well as an unforgettable performance from her accompanying cast, especially Claudia Carvan and the late great Adele. Amazingly, or perhaps not, this movie and its stars did not take part in academic classes, just like "Housekeeping," but please both of them - you'll be glad you did!
