I saw Soylent Green in 1973, when he was first released, and maybe eight more times over the years on TV or video. It has always been one of my favorite science fiction films and / or Charlton Heston. Recently at the Egyptian Theater in LA, twelve Charlton Heston films were retrospective. I flew from the state to see six movies in two days. Soylent Green looked great on a large Egyptian screen with a perfect new print. From his initial installation to the home scene to the great end of the movie he was fantastic. Charlton Heston, as a policeman living with a dog, ate a dog world with few natural resources and no understanding of how the world was, and Eddie Robinson as a man who remembers the past are both great. Their chemistry together is amazing. The film looks much better in a large 35mm print. Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen, camera, writing, music and everything works about it. The film is also very strong in its bleak and very possible view of the future. Just think about how the world's population grew that the rainforest had disappeared, that they had run out of resources that had worsened the greenhouse effect since 1973. I'm just wondering why this movie was playing in theaters during these years. His reputation should be better. Speaking of rumors, people often talk as though Charlton Heston was not a great actor. I see him in El-Cide, Soylent Green, The Warlord, Omega Man, Will Penny, and Major Dundee back. I'm convinced he's one of our best actors. Of course, he did about a dozen other great movies, and for those who care, you know what they are. <br /> <br />
