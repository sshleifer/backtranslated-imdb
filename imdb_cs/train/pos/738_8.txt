And it's a great rock'n'roll movie in itself. Regardless of how it evolved (at the point where the disco movie was), it ended up as one of the best films in which kids want to scatter, but the main one stands in the way. Think about rock'n'roll films of the 1950s where the day is rescued when Alan Freed comes to town with Chuck Berry to prove that Rock & Roll Music is really great and safe for kids and Tuesday Weld gets a new sweater for dancing. Proceed back to 1979, repeat the same plot, but go to DA RAMONES, which no one ever realized would become one of the most influential bands of the next quarter (and then for the obligated shot DJ, "The Real" Don Steele). Take all the elements of the film Roger Corman produced comedy-exploitation, with the exception of a two-day schedule, some well-known Corman repertoire players such as Clint Howard, Mary Wournow, and Dick Miller, and you have one of the great stoopic films of the day. One of the few films that use intentional cheese and get along with it. I showed a new DVD to a friend who just remembered seeing his parts through the stoner-induced haze on arrival, and agreed that it was one of the great movies to watch drunks, ladies-to-be and Ramona's great shots.
