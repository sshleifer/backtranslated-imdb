I had a television on white noise and I heard "$ 400 for a fully furnished apartment". So I hit a television room and I expected to see my next 70 years and get even more. Fortunately, I could go back to the top (the DVR buffer) and press the record button to watch it fully (Cinemax uncut and in HD no less!) In addition to some holes in the story and intermittent unlikely dialogue / events it is an effective thriller worthy of your time track. Quite terrifying and progressive at times: Beverly D'Angelo is masturbating in front of Alison Parker, playing impressively Cristina Raines, Parker's stalk, very poisoned, her father expressly representing the trio scene (do not let the kids watch) The film is TOTALY 70 years full of bad clothes (polyester suits and shiny ascots) and decorations, bad hair, overly dense music scores and a well-known film. The cast is great, and on the home page of this movie let's look at the other side. It was a surprise that Christopher Walken, Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum were so young. Sylvia Miles - always amazingly scary! ENJOY!
