this movie is very relaxed, a romantic comedy that is absolutely pleasant. Meg Ryan does a very good job as the brilliant niece Albert Einstein, although he believes in his own abilities. Tim Robbins does the same job as a mechanic who falls in love with her when she comes to her business with her fianc√© after her car gets up. I loved Walter Matthau as one and only Albert Einstein. This movie has only a very nice feeling, while it still retains some seriousness (if possible, it will happen here). <br /> <br /> I personally found this movie very entertaining, especially old scientists - I thought they were great and cheerful! This film seems to have been underestimated. If you have a sad sense of humor, it's the movie for you!
