I loved this episode, but it seemed to me that there should be some quick mention that the secretary would be punished for the fact that she was actually an accomplice. While I like when the Columbo episode has an unpredictable attack like this, its solution should be part of the episode's conclusion along with the revelation of the killer. The rap between Peter Falk Ruth Gordon is invaluable. At one point, Gordon plays a famous writer, making some comment about being enchanted by the famous Lieutenant Columbus, and so furiously hated the real glory of the detective as a criminal. It's one of the best of many great Columbo installments.
