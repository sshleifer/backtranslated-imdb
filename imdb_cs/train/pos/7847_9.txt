Believe it or not, this film (for 1912) is a feature film. Very, very few movies were longer than that, but it certainly is not what makes this strange movie separate from the others! No, it's different that all actors (except one frog) are bugs ... yes, bugs! This simple little home comedy could look like a production with Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder, but instead this Russian production uses mistakes (or I think models that looked like mistakes). Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy have not been discovered yet, and I suppose Linder is busy, so maybe that's why mistakes are being used! With stop-motion, mistakes moved, danced and fought incredibly well - and much more realistic than King Kong 21 years later! <br /> <br /> The film starts with the fact that Mr. Beetle has been creeping for a while. He goes to the dirty club while his wife is supposedly waiting at home. Unfortunately, for Mr Beetle, he is captured by a local film fan at the camera. Moreover, she does not know, but Mrs Beetle is also continuing with a bohemian grasshopper painter. Of course, it's more home comedy than this, but the site is old and very fun for adults and kids alike. Odd, but also very amazing and observable.
