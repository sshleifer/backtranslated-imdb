It's another story that Madhur Bhandarkar says. I'm not sure why this obsession is to show the concepts of baby molecules and Indonesian films, but some of those scenes are really disgusting! What's new? It's a pretty piece made by Bhandarkar, where he portrays the story of the amusement reporter who plays the front lady in the famous movie Mr. & Mrs. Iyer. What makes this movie different is also that it covers the stories of people with whom this reporter communicates with or friends with him, such as actors, colleagues, movie stars, models, wealthy people and more. her newspaper. <br /> <br /> Notable: It's another good performance from Mrs. Iyer. She is likely to learn about this role. She does a selective role but shines in them. She is distinctly de-glamorized and less beautiful in this film. But then entertaining journalists should not overcome the people they cover, are they? Verdict: Madhur came up with another good film that brings social attention very nicely. But this movie loses focus and one is not sure what the director is trying to say. Is it trying to show us the glitz and spell of rich people? or is he trying to show us the life of the news reporter and contrast with the life of the intelligence criminal REAL? Are we trying to tell how the government and the rich people control the press? or trying to illustrate the problems of child abuse and sexual abuse. Other concepts include the unspoken rule that young women have to sleep with directors or stars if they want to get to Bollywood. In addition, he talks about how summer assistants get injured and tired of their job after some time and resort to extreme measures when he marries older people, etc. He also talks about unhappy women and spoiled children in wealthy families. <br /> <br /> It was all right for me .. But maybe it's too complicated for an average filmmaker who just wants to relieve some stress from everyday work
