This animated movie is a masterpiece! Narrative, music, animation and storyline, all remarkable. My girlfriend and I saw it again for the second time and we got a better idea. We invited some friends to see the Spirit with us, and they really liked it. When I asked them to come here, they saw it as a movie about horses, but later they realized it was more than that. I liked Esperanza, Ghost, Rain and Lil Creek, who remind me of Nathan Chasing, who is Smiles Lot in Tances With Wolves. The spirit has profound symbolic meanings and metaphors that I have found to be inspiring and inspiring. I saw a third spirit and I wanted to see it again. I really enjoyed the "Spirit," because his imagination is realistic, dignified and rather stereotypical, unlike the movie "The Way to El Dorado," which was a complete farce because it portrayed Indians in disrespect and stereotyping. But Dreamworks redeemed by creating a great film by the Spirit that I thought was acceptable! I hope they will continue to create animated films like the Spirit, and I would like to see the sequel or spinoffs to the Spirit if done with respect and without the stereotyping of American Indians. I highly recommend it to others who have an open mind to go and pay to see the Spirit: Stallion Cimarron.
