The person who wrote the review "enough with sweating and spitting" has no understanding of what cultural, literary or psychological criticism is. He refuses Zizka's interpretations because he does not seem "in line" with what the director originally intended. So what? The importance of the director (or author's) intention in critical theory is not important. This is known as "willful misconduct" by the author and should be avoided. <br /> <br /> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_fallacy Text or film can be analyzed using a variety of theories, many that do not match each other, as well as completely ignoring the author's intention. This is the most fundamental idea of ​​critical theory. <br /> <br /> Because the person who wrote this wall of text lost a lot of time and effort to insult Zizka. In fact, anyone who studies the theory immediately discredits this guy's opinion (I recommend it to you too) because he is completely out of the question. <br /> <br /> This is said ... If you are interested in Freudian, Laconian, or Kristevian discourses, this movie is a must. It combines these theories with popular film, which is much more tangible and fun than simply reading or thinking about them.
