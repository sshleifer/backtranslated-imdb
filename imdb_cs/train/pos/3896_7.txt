Some people loved the "Aristocrats," and others hated it and often went out in the middle. The reaction to Eddie Izzard is unlikely to be extreme cases - if you can deal with a transvestite comedian (who says he likes girls) and has the vocabulary that gives us, we can say enough use of the word "f" that its program would be one long beep if it was listed on the television network. Many Izzard fans are so devoted to seeing no mistakes in his performances. On the other hand, I thought that this show was smoother sometimes than Iszard's chest, but more often than not fun and in places totally cheerful. He has a way to attach links from routines at the beginning of the show to his later routines. It's not a story. It's not a joke producer. He's not a frenetic fantasist like Robin Williams. He plays with ideas, some of which work, and some of them - for example, the routine with a cable car in San Francisco and Alcatraz - are totally inoperative. But it has a way to elegantly move behind the flop routines and expand those that connect. I gave this performance 7 and I could convince him to raise it to 8. But 10? In any case.
