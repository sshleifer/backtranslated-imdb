This adaptation of Pearl S. Buck is definitely a classic. It's a true Hollywood epic film that has all the great Hollywood movies: Birth, death, happiness, sadness, excitement, despair, and so on. There is only one thing that worries me. I know it was a sign of the time, but none of these two characters are played by Asian actors. Paul Muni was a great actor and is doing an admirable job like Wang Lung, the owner of a farm in China. Luise Rainier plays Olan. It does not even look Chinese! I think she was trying to get this role, but she should have put Anna Wong into the role. I know why they did not, and Mrs Rainier is very good in the movie, but they tried to look "authentic". Stillm is a great movie, especially when reading a book (ten years ago I did it in high school). It has to be seen, just look through the casting. I think you can.
