I thought it was an extremely clever movie. I really enjoyed it and I really could not "ask for more. Actually my own film, because I did not come back to him ... What should I do, but I really want to keep it because of how much I enjoy it. I do not have too many foreign films and this is the first one I now personally love Finnish things, which certainly added how much I liked it But overall, it is worth watching, however, if you are not in the whole trying to understand Finnish or read the subtitle bit, the movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for sure.
