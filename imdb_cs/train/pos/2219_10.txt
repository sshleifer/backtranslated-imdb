This film was a fascinating insight into Creole culture and society, which is known only to a few African Americans. My own two children are the products of a grandmother whose father was a member of the gens de couleur libre and the black skins of a woman whose parents were ex-slaves. He married outside and against his culture and was cut off from his entire family, except for one sister concentrating on her brothers. raising 8 children during the 1929 major depression; to provide family food at any time. Of course she secretly helped the family who feared for her ex-communication. My daughter was fascinated by the film. We made it part of our library.
