You should not take what I have to say lightly. I've seen many, many movies, and I've seen them many times in the press. So when I tell you that this movie has one of the most amusing scenes I've ever seen in the movie, you can listen to me. There are plenty of different views on what makes this silly movie as fun as it is. And to those who just did not get well, I can not blame them too much. The scene I'm talking about comes in about 30 minutes and includes a dead convict who binds to John Candy. Until then, I found the film stupid, mumbled, and started to lose me. When this scene appeared, I laughed and I dug my pants. No movie ever made me. When the project began, Going Berserk was to become a SCTV movie. I remember that it was announced. As time went on, the cast was blanched down by John Candy, Joe Flaherty & Eugene Levy. It also had to be on a universal regime change as it was shot, because when it was released it was shown in nearly zero theaters. When I watched it for the second time, I listened to a theme song (which boasts in fact how inconceivable a plot in the lyrics), I loosened the logic nerve and figured out what was happening. In addition to the aforementioned routine "Going Berserk", he has many other fun scenes that he recommends. This is almost 3 times, but it's much more fun. Director David Steinberg has a sharp timing and had to laugh at all. As for Candy, who is basically in charge here, he was never more entertaining. With all the drawing devices and explanatory scenes thrown by the window, it's totally wild. Flaherty and Levy followed him effortlessly. There is a conspiracy, but it's a plot like "Animal House" has a conspiracy, and yeah, the scenario is uneven and a little slow to start. When you know it, you can well realize the full foolishness in the SCTV style. It's stupid, but it's meaningful and you have to remember it when you see it. You will see it and find out yourself if it has the most fun scene of all time in it.
