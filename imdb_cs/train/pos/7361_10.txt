This film would normally be classified as the worst film production ever. At all. But in my opinion it may be funniest. Scary direction and script make this film invaluable. I bought a movie while I went through a famous DVD at my local pound shop. Me and some friends watched, though rather drunk. Soon it was not a normal movie. Instead, an invaluable monument of what is probably the latest James Cahill movie. At first we were confused and screamed that the DVD player was switched off, but fortunately in our unusual condition no one could be bothered. Instead, we watched the movie exactly. In the end, we soon realized that we found some waste, a dream, something you could laugh a lot, while laughing for all the wrong reasons. Soon we showed all our other friends, and they also agreed that it was not the work of a stunning movie. It was a movie in which you can really moisten. It was a movie that one can enjoy. It was a genius.
