After reading many more reviews of this movie on IMDb, there seems to be a consensus among purists that this film is nothing like the books on which it is based. At this point, I can not comment because I have never read any adventures of protagonists. However, what I can say with certainty is that I think that many of the reviewers have certainly had a sense of humor. Let's be honest here - this movie is just so fun! OK? .. I have to admit that the film is probably not representative of the character (s), but we put it in a clear perspective ... the same people doing this film also have doubts about the fact that the 1960 classic Batman series does not remain faithful the original character of DC comics? Or maybe there is still a riot in the same people that the movie version of Flash Gordon in 1980 was too distant from the original series? What is it, yes, this movie is incredibly camp, but that's exactly its magic! Former Tarzan, Ron Ely plays in this eponymous hero (and carries more than just a similarity to Gary Busey, who boots!) And is backed by a great supportive actor that everyone looks like. Have the ball with their respective roles. Take a look at the very short, but very welcome look of the popular horror film Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> Best scene? Too many people to choose from, but look at the cheerful expressions of the face that the waiter accepted when Savage and his men at the formal occasion make a final faux pas when ordering coke, lemonade and milk! Also often known scene at the end of the film, where Savage solves his nemesis Captain Seas using the various martial arts disciplines that are marked on the screen! ??? Unreservedly! <br /> <br /> Simply put, the film does not really matter and is more fun for it. Great fun from start to finish! (and in a few days you'll be singing John Philipp Sousa songs guaranteed!)
