Deathtrap runs like a game in the movie about who did what to whom, because it is primarily one set. The premise is that the perfect playwright, whose star falls, receives a wonderful handwriting from a former student, and plans to launch his protest and adapt his play to his wife's (loud) protests. Or you think it for the first half of the movie. In a half-hour mark, Deathtrap begins to throw dizziness and surprises, which transform his premise into a head, then right and then in mad spinning, all the time keeping his title fit. It's a great mysterious movie squeezed into a joke. Michael Caine, as an older playwright, plays in this movie - a bit cruel and very dramatic Brit. No surprise here - it does its usual good work. He gets the best line of Deathtrap, who performs perfectly: "What is your definition of success when a gang bangs in a state prison?" <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve, on the other hand, juggles comedy and drama in a surprisingly powerful performance by playing an ambitious (and psychopathic) young playwright. He can also show off his very strong body that he had to keep from Superman movies. Caine and Reeve work together in another movie, one of my favorite comedies - Noises Off. Similarly revolves around the game, although this time Caine is a director and Reeve is an actor. They are joined by comedic veterans Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marilu Henner (Taxi) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers). Together they demonstrate the disasters that hit the bed and crew of the game. On the surface, it looks like the film is mostly a slapstick, but when you watch, it's a lot of fine jokes that require more than one impression. You want this underrated movie available on DVD.
