I'm probably one of Nancy Drew's biggest fans. I read every book three times and I played a lot of Nancy cartoon games. I loved this movie. You have always had fun while you watched it. I went with about ten my friends and they all loved her. Behind us sat three women who seemed to be in their late 1930s and early 1940s, and I asked them how they liked it, they said they loved it! So you see it will be fun for all ages. You have to give him a chance. And he teaches a lesson, just be alone, even though everyone around them is exactly the same. Overall, this step was great. I'll see it for the second time! So please stop it, please. It's a really good movie!
