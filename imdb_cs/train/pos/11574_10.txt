This movie is half documentary ... and it's quite interesting .... This is a good movie ... based on a true story as a bunch of Norwegian sabotages managed to stop heavy water in Rukjan, Norway, and free the rest of heavy water to Germany. This movie is not perfect and it could be a bit better ... the best part of the movie is that some sabotages are playing alone! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the history of World War II and the movie is a movie that's worth seeing!
