Finally! Iranian film not made by Majidi, Kiarostami or Makhmalbafs. This is a non-documentary, fun black comedy with subversive young girls that gently kicks the "system" in the ass. It's all about football and its funny, it's really funny. The director says, "The places are real, the event is real, as well as characters and bonuses, so I deliberately chose not to use professional actors because their presence would be an idea of ​​fakeness." Non-actors will have roots for you if a. Your heart is made of stone b. You are blind. The excellent screenplay of the film calls for patriarchal authority with almost absurd freshness. She was awarded the Grand Prize Jury, Berlin, 2006. Dear reader, it's almost perfect. WHERE, where can I get?
