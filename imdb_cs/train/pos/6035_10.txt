I'm definitely not the target audience for this movie. I am a man of nearly 50 who recently came across the world of independent film. It happened by accident when he discovered the film on TV later in the night. The first two things I noticed were that it was 1) technically amateur and 2) greatly written. When I read an interview with the director in a local paper and said one of his influences was a clerk, I started to be interested. When he said that his main influence was Agent Stations, the movie I saw on the DVD a week ago, I decided I had to go and look at it. The result could be described in the same way as clerks, although both films are not similar to content. Both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome by amazing writing. While Clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life and is afraid to ask hard questions about himself and his situation, Less Like Me is about a man who seemingly forces himself to be constantly busy, is always running the same way, your life with little things so you will never have to deal with the big ones. The themes and ideas of this film are strong and tangible. I can say that when I look at the fact that I have not changed much since I grew up, young men still have the same problems as they always have. The writer dresses up these problems and themes in modern folk language, craftsmanship of stunningly honest figures, and he is completely credible. As for the indie cinema, it may not be perfect from a technical point of view, but from an artistic one, it is very close.
