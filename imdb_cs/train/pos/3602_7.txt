While the story of a rogue who turns to boxing for self-esteem and mastering anger is hardly a new thing, the story is brought back here when the protagonist is a girl instead of a boy. <br /> <br /> Diana has problems at school. You just can not stay away from the fight. At home, her father always gives her. Her brother trains the box in the gym and one day when he picks up, he decides he also wants to train. It would be easy to call this movie "Rocky with girls". But that's not what it's all about. The story really benefits from the fact that the main character is a girl rather than a boy. This way you can solve multiple problems at once. First, the problem is she is not accepted because she is not a girl, and then when she comes to the boxing gym because she is a girl at all. It's also a story about how a purpose can change some of life. How positive things can bring you growth. I do not want it to sound great, because the movie does not seem to be choosy at all, but what I say is true. Michelle Rodriguez is also very good at the lead. It's really a shame that she's been broadcast in a "rough girl" because it's really not what she's involved in "Girlfight". Of course it's a boxer, but rather more sensitive moments that really make her nervous. So maybe it's basically your average story with an unqualified accent, but it's lifted over the crowd Rodriguez, performance. I rate it 7/10.
