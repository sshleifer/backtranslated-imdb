Ashanti is a 70's film (1979). It reminded me of the Wild Goose way (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore on a mission in Africa). It's a very good movie, and I liked it very much. David (Michael Caine) is a doctor who works in Africa and is married to a beautiful Ashanti woman named Anansa (Beverley Johnson) who trained in medicine in America and is also a doctor. While they are doctors, one day they are caught by slave laborers working for an Arab slave trader called Suleiman (perfectly played by Peter Ustinov, of all people). The rest of the movie is David trying to get her back. Michael Caine is a brilliant actor, of course, and plays a character who is very determined and ready to do anything to make his wife back but rather hopeless with a pistol and action. He helped first the Englishmen who fought slave trading, that no one knew it was happening (Rex Harrison!), Then briefly a helicopter pilot (William Holden) and then an Arab called Malik (Kabir Bedi). Malik has scores to settle with Suleiman (it's a very intense, very pilgrimage character), and so they go with David to find him and get back Anans - that's a wonderful scene in which David furiously got on his camels /> <br /> Then there's plenty of adventure. There is also a lot of moral-questioning. The course of the story is, from that moment, a little predictable, and there are several freedoms that are made with rendering to move things faster, but it's pretty well thought out. The question is, that David gets to Anansa before Petr Ostinov gives it to Omar Sharif (yes, of course there is Omar Sharif!)?
