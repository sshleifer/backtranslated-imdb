Someone (or something.) Leaves the jugular marks on the jugular and releases their blood victims until they die. Police detective Karl Brettschneider (Melvyn Douglas, before slipping out of the horror genre of B-film for higher heights) is disturbed who ... or what ... is behind these notorious crimes. The village is overcome by hysteria and Karl depends on a trusted medical genius, Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill, in another acting role of the scientist) to provide some feedback on what could cause the death of innocents. He also fears the safety of his beloved Ruth (beautiful Fay Wray, who stars three stars with Atwill after "Doctor X" and "The Secret of the Wax Museum"), who is Niemann's assistant. <br /> <br /> Dwight Frye steals the film as a stupid village idiot who gathers a bat and bears dementia behavior wherever he goes ... it's easy to understand why he becomes a suspect because local paranoia is on fever. Maude Eburne provides film humor as a very naive (and easily influenced) patient von Niemannova, who believes he has a disease he reads in books near the lab where he works. She is very sensitive, and often von Niemann only humorously and continually imagines her feelings. Lionel Belmore returns another horrified, superstitious BÃ¼rgermeister. Rough, static, but rather fun due to cast. The film is, of course, such a low budget as it comes, but it does not hurt the movie too much, because it is rather well compiled by director Frank R Strayer and his crew. I'm sure the prints on the film have been better days. This is a kind of B-horror item that you would find in a pack of 50 other random cheeses and programmers of poverty. The movie villain ... and his motives for feeding a synthetically produced biological creature ... surely provides another formula for Frankenstein's recipe. Many of them could be disappointed with the final results as the film gets rid of a real supernatural story about the real killer vampire murderer.
