A little slow (something like the Sofia Coppola movie), but still a very captivating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls. The charm of the film lies in its ability to bring back many memories of how it should be their age. Confusion and uncertainties are shown in a very simple way, but so true. Music is perfect and playing is amazing. The camera also works beautifully. I strongly recommend to those who do not enjoy looking at this particular period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires. I would also say that this is a great movie for young people going through this period. This has been a lot of adolescence films, but it really captures the real essence of exploring the adult world of romance and its complexity.
