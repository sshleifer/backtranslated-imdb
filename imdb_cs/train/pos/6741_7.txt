The title sequence shows credits written on the rain-paved walkway as people looked at it; music is provided by someone whistling Alfred Newman "Street Scene." Then we meet Det. Sgt. Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews), who always wanted to be something of an old man, was not: a fellow on the right side of the law. But he's a good guy for him. After several complaints about his harsh people, his boss, Insp. Nicholas Foley (Robert F. Simon) will overthrow him. Foley tells him he's a good man but needs to get his head straight and be more like a Det. (Tommy Scalise, Gary Merrill, in a beautifully slick performance) has an illegal dice game and is looking to scare off the rich Ted Morrison (Harry Von Zell) brought by Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) and his beautiful wife, Morgan (Gene Tierney) . She realizes it's too late for her husband to use her as a grandson, and Paine thinks she refuses to play. Fisherman Morrison hits, but Paine knocks him. It seems to be the worst, but later it turns out that the boy is dead; and Paine looks guilty. But this is not Paine's story. Soon Dixon fell in love with Morgan, but not before losing his temper and committing the terrible deed he was trying to cover up. Morgan's father, a story-spinning taxi driver (Tom Tully), can take a rap for it. It's up to Dixon to try to blame Scalis. Otto Preminger directs the script attributed to Ben Hem and three of William Stourt's "Night Cry" novels. This is a solid film of noir with excellent performances and all the shadowy photography and the dark morality we expect from this genre. It takes up to a brightly lit end, which looks like something the studio shot to calm the censors. Of course, the classical noir of Premiere and played by Andrews and Tierney is "Laura". You will have fun, but you can not miss it.
