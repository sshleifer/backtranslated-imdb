I became a fan of the TV series "Murder: Life on the Street" late in the show but became a fan very quickly. It was a police show that resembled any other: it was visually different when using camera cameras, everywhere with a viewer, multi-ethnic and mutiracial occupation, and various and fascinating personalities, and covering all good and bad police departments, including corruption and personal conflicts, which bubbling up to the surface. <br /> <br /> Murder: The movie, a series reunion, is as good as a movie made for television. After being shot dead, Lieutenant Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, members of the series are dragged out to help find a killer. In addition, players who have left power and those who have died have also managed to get their place in the movie. The intensity and fire that marked the series is returning, and the script is lucky with the same fire it marked the series. Everyone in all, the amazing TV movie. <br /> <br /> Voting: 9
