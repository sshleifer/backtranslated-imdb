With intelligent script and stable hands from writer / director Kevin Meyer, "Perfect Alibi" is a fun and very entertaining mysterious thriller. The film begins methodically and creates a pair because the tracks begin to reveal that there is nothing like that. Teri Garr and Hector Elizondo are amazing when they collaborate on revealing secrets, reminding Nick and Nora Charles of "Thin Man". Kathleen Quinlan is great because the tortured wife of Alex McArthur and the characters starring veterans Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Anne Ramsey and Estelle Harris are great and provide lots of light moments at the right time. Rex Linn even has a dude. Overall, I felt I read a good book at the fire.
