Unconventional historic track with some fine combat scenes. Tobey Maguire gives a brilliant lead and he makes a pretty good save. The script is literate and quite original and the film is merciless without heroes. This means that it is a little stretched and the last reel is much like the mini-series TV. Still, Frederick Elmes' cameraman work is still interested in boring bits (and you can see a shot that reminds you that he worked for David Lynch). Worth seeing.
