It's an excellent modern movie noir ... "Excellent" in that it's interesting, start-to-finish. There are some holes and some cracked parts that shake your head in disbelief ..... but I have not found anyone to get into this story. The film has the right amount of action, tension, plot and interesting characters. In addition, it sports some nice colors and cinema plus a good guitar soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I marked this crime movie as "film noir" because it's rough and all the characters are not good. Even the only good guy Nicholas Cage is about to get into trouble by lying and having a quick affair he should not have. He also does something in the end that is not right, but I'm not going to say it. Just say the other characters are so bad that they cause Cage to look good! When we talk about "bad guys", does anyone do better than Dennis Hopper? Not too much. At least in the category "deranged" is hard to beat. Lara Flynn Boyle is passionate about watching a lot of reasons. J.T. Walsh gives another great support performance. This is one of those movies that have never been too public, but it should have been. You will have fun watching this. By the way, try to say the name of this movie loud three times without spoiling it!
