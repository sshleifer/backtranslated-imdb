For me movies and acting is all about telling the story. The story of David and Bethsheba is a tragedy that is deep and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical account. In this movie, I thought the narratives of Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward were at their best. To get to know and understand the story of David and his way to become the King of Israel, he made this story even more urgent. Feeling his desire for a beautiful woman, Gregory Peck showed the real human face of this man who was bigger than his life at the time. Fear, Susan Hayward's reluctance, but obedience to his authority as her king, she portrayed her beautifully. One could also feel David's anxiety that Uriah spent the night at the gate instead of home. Just like sadness when he was killed in the battle. Raymond Massey's powerful and authoritative condemnation of the king made me feel angry. The sets were real and the atmosphere was believable. Overall, I think it was one of the best movies of its kind. I gave him ten.
