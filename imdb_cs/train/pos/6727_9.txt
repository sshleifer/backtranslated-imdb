A few days ago I realized that the creators of this film gave a word game to their name. This film is not primarily about the act of "riding giants", but especially about the giant sporting giants, the drivers of the giants to change the emphasis. In adolescence I lived a block from Wedge, one of the hardest and most bodysurfing places in the world. I was surfed at 15 to 18 feet and on many occasions I was riding and was pulled by 10 and 12 feet. This experience is the reason why I am in full respect in this film. The idea that Jeff Clark, with all the circumstances of a normal mortal, could have escaped Maverick BY HIMSELF for more than a decade, is beyond my grasp. The first safety rule for any water sport is "never surf / dive / swim yourself." He went to where the wise people would not be, and he lived. I would not be out there if the water was 75 degrees and the sharks were all gone. <br /> <br /> In the hot water world: The first wave of jaws always causes the skin to shake all over the body. They are not just scary waves, they are uncontrolled waves of evacuation of the intestines. When we see that Laird Hamilton not only survives 40 to 60 foot waves (these numbers can hardly wait), but in fact I'm working on my cheeks like a fun day at Rincon, so I'm fired. There is determination and focus on the bigwave rider that is comparable to everyone in the world. <br /> <br /> This great movie. I gave her 9th place in 10th because it does not neglect to mention that there are great drivers with large waves out of the Hamilton / Kalama crew and I think they deserve to be mentioned. Connect to Ken Bradshaw at the outdoor log cabins and 10 them!
