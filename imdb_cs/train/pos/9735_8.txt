Romantic comedy is not the right way to describe "How to lose friends and alienate people." Essential romance in the plot is largely displaced by a more interesting story of "snake to wealth". Though the central line of the story is somewhat humiliated, it has gone through several screens, it feels; getting a "nitty gritty" out of the way, focusing on those key relationships that make "office politics" and use those almost irrelevant scenes used exclusively for the comic effect. Yet it works so well, especially with Pegge in the front seat. The film is eventually very smart, playing well on the transatlantic relationship that Pegg shares with his stars, and links the cross between a high and low interest company and a relatively refreshing story that is a bit unique in spite of predictability. Various characters in the film are well presented and casting is definitely a benefit to the film. How the relationship between Pegg and Huston's business partners, and the relationship of "love, hatred" between Pegge and Dunste, work so well in a story that is, for the sake of a better word, charming. Even Fox, whose main benefit is, of course, a sexual appeal, shocked with what turns out to be a rather dark figure and makes "bimbo" playing well. One of these films, each small detail giving tributes to a great piece. From transsexual strippers to amazing soundtrack, it all fits well into what can be called a clever comedy.
