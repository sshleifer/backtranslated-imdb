If anyone is interested in getting a copy of this movie, just read the inscription of this description: CBS's first TV show on November 30, 2003, made for TV John Christmas is a sequel to the previous year's A Town Without Christmas, with Peter Falk as a versatile guardian angel Max. Valerie Bertinelli plays Kathleen McAllister, a sister of a small town whose depression ... because the hospital she claims might be forced to close off because of a $ 100,000 debt is briefly raised when she discovers a newspaper picture taken by photojournalist Noah Greeley (David Cubitt). The picture shows the acts of bravery done by Noah's Fire Brigade Hank (William Russ) who secretly left the city 25 years ago and has not been seen since then. Hank would want to slip quietly back into the city without explanation or fanfare, but it turned out impossible when Noah's newspaper dropped a $ 50,000 reward to identify Hanka, known only as "John Christmas." And there's something very, very curious about this photo: It also shows Santa Claus's suit seemingly floating in the air without a passenger. That unbearable "Santa" is, of course, an angel Max, who appears in various forms throughout the story to solve problems, give advice, join a loose conspiracy, and even share a duet with Kathleen's talented daughter Socorro (Jennifer Pisana). <br /> <br /> COPYING INTEREST: SIGN IN CHANGE HERE: IAMASEAL2@YAHOO.COM
