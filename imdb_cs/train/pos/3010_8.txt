William Powell's final trip, like Philo Vance, appears in the case of The Kennel Murder Case, where the murder of the championship shows that the dog leads to two more murders and one attempt of a human species. It's all about finding out how it leads to who and why. The Philo Vance murders by SS Van Dina were the most popular at the time, and the clever Mr Van Dine came to the way to sell his books one by one to the highest bidders. That's why you see so many Philo Vans and so many studies that expose them. If Bill Powell did not get greater glory with MGM like Nick Charles from a series of thin men, he would be known as the greatest Philo Vance. It turned out that Powell had entered his captain of a small terrier in the same competition where a murdered dog was detained, and then became the first rival of the first killer. As usual, Powell will show Eugen Palette as Sergeant Heath, whose largest contribution to the Corps has used his bulk to break the locked door from the inner door where the first murder was found. <br /> <br /> I was saying inside, and it was the upper story, so it was when I figured out how. Powell has a beautiful group of suspects, as large as what is usually in the secret of a thin man. People like Paul Cavanaugh, Helen Vinson, Ralph Morgan and Mary Astor are fulfilling their roles. Warner Brothers liked this version so much that they actually re-engineered James Stephenson in his thirties in his Single Trip as Philo Vance. This is not a candleholder. Because it's the only Powell Philo Vance on the VHS or DVD everywhere to see this or get it if you can.
