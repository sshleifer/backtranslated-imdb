I happened to be on this movie and really enjoyed it. Timothy Busfield's character is without the redemption of qualities and at one point Busfield and the star Meloni ogle women as they pass by ... Meloni's show is different from Busfield's. Janel Maloney is amazing ... Looks as much as Tea Leone, but the main difference is that Janel can actually ACT. Some very nice things in this movie and well worth the attention when it's on the cable.
