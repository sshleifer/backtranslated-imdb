First, I have only one word for this movie: "wow". This is probably one of the best films that touched me, from his story to his performance, so great played by Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. I was very impressed by the latter because it really brought the depth of character because it was a very difficult role. Yet, two of them created a pair that surprised me from start to finish, pointing the way, the love-filled friendship that developed throughout the day, settled in the movie. The story takes some time, because the performance of the characters is long, but we are finally compensated by the wonderful story of love and humanity. If you have a chance, look at it because it's a movie that stays in your mind many times. Just amazing - 9/10.
