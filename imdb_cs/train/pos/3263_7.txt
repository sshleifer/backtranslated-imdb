Usually they really enjoy movies like "Chances are," but I was not happy with this for several reasons. The first half was quite good, Alex Finch died and was reincarnated in a new body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). He meets his wife (Cybill Shepherd) and friend (Ryan O'Neal) and his daughter, who is now grown up. The scenes they met again, and Downey once again discovered who once used to be, are well done and there is a lot of emotion and happiness as soon as Shepherd finally believes that her husband has really reincarnated, but from there the film goes down. There are several sexual scenes that have completely turned me off, especially Downey and Shepherd, who want to meet again despite the differences in their age. After that, the film finishes in the most successful way, considering the circumstances of the plot. I was disappointed because I did not expect the movie to become so immoral. This story has great potential, and scenes in the sky are well done. There is a good theme song sung by Peter Cetera and Cher, but in the end the movie is not great. For a better movie, try "Heaven Can Wait". Dignified, but I really wished I did not see it because of the scenes in the second half. <br /> <br />
