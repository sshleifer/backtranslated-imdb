I really thought they were doing a great job, there was nothing wrong, I do not know how the first commentator could say it was terrible, it moved me into tears (I think it moved around everyone to tears), but I try to cry in the movie because it's embarrassing, but he got me. It was good SOOO! I hope they put it on DVD because I'm sure to buy a copy! I feel that it restores my faith and gives me the hope that I can not explain that I wanted to be a better person, have gone so much and so we take it for granted, I think. Compared with that, I feel that our own tests are nothing. Well, not nothing, but they barely match what they have to go through. I loved it. Who played Emma ?!
