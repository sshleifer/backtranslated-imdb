"Cypher" is a cleverly conceived story of industrial espionage that is in America in a not too distant future. While thematically incomplete, this film offers many different views of personal loyalty, ruthlessness and corporate conspiracy. To some extent, this film also attempts to represent modern corporate groups and companies that are indifferent to the risks their employees have in their favor in the contract. The film begins with a rather average worker, Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), who asks Digicorp to work as a secret operator. Following the initial instruction with Digicorp's head of security, Sullivan receives a new identity (Jack Thursby) and is sent to a business conference to record speakers' speeches about the marketing strategies of each of their companies. Upon successful completion of her first assignment, Sullivan / Thursby is sent to another mission to obtain the same kind of information that was previously collected. On one of his "business trips", however, he unconsciously encounters a woman named Rita Foster (Liu), whom she met in her previous work, and from there things are extremely angry. The consequences of a diabolical conspiracy involving the Digicorp espionage program are beginning to emerge, and Sullivan is forced to deeply cover one of Digicorp's main competitors, becoming a dual agent involved in intense rivalry between the two companies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bright lighting was mainly used in home / home conditions, while lots of shadows and dark colors were used for settings involving scam and cover. Jeremy Northam was also very impressed. I have not seen him so often, and the fact that he plays a disillusioned man right from Wisconsin was great. Personally, I think he is one of the many sublime players in the industry who have not gotten more challenging tasks. Lucy Liu was also incredible and gave the film its true tone on the cloak and dagger. In addition, the remaining part of the accompanying cast did a great job, but the only complaint was that some of the characters could be explored more to make plot and closure a little more complicated. For example, I would like to see what would happen if Jack Thursby created a more intimate relationship with his other "wife". Overall, this is a cleverly developed story about the cloak and dagger that guesses you right up to the very end about personal and professional loyalty, and whether it's possible to trust anyone in the movie. With the intelligent, stylish sound effect and great camera work, this movie offers a ghostly look at how corporations could work in the near future. I am surprised that I have never seen this "hidden jewel" before. It's a great, not too complicated spy thriller, so I'm giving it 9 out of 10.
