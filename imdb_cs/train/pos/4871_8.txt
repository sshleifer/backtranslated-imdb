It took Serbian or at least Balkan awareness to understand and enjoy many situations, characters and jokes "Hang" and many other Kusturica films. Take a look at, for example, the start-up scenes with a remote town in the Serbian mountains with low-frequency devices that prevent the integrity and way of life of the people, the nostalgia for the good days of Communist rule, and the awakening of a young brother watching his naked teacher on the sounds of the Soviet anthem. Kusturica not only tries to deviate from the tragic history of Serbia described in his previous films but creates the world of himself. <br /> <br /> It's not a political movie or an explicit political film in any case. It's a fun movie in front of everyone. Kusturica creates a set of characters that we are interested in. Music plays an active role in this film as well as in all of its other films. His style is direct and grotesque, we now feel his characters and we know he wants us to feel the same. The space in which it evolves combines the present, history and spell and colors seem to be Douanier Rousseau's modern cinema. It's also not a perfect movie. The main shortcoming is length, some adjustments and tricks would be useful because at some point the director seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions. This is one of the most catchy, fun movies I've ever seen.
