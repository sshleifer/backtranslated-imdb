E rated (Includes violence). <br /> <br /> I had an original spiderman game for PC for a few years now. Meanwhile, I did not beat it because in Windows XP there was a defect on one level that I can not beat for it.So be warned if you have XP.But for those who do not XP give this game try.Its fun clean family games with action and its great for all spiderman fans.In the game you play Spiderman and you on various criminals who commit crimes.Spiderman is a fun little game and I recommend it to any fan of spiderman or parents who want fun, a clean game for their children.
