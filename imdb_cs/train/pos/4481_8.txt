The only reason I give this film 8/10 stars rather than 10 is because 1) Sinatra is terrible and 2) love interest in Kelly's character leaves much to be desired (IMHO). Love that Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - Al, is a little boy. Dance sequence with Jerry Mouse is one of the most amazing and amazing dance sequences I've ever seen. Tom and Jerry are still my favorite and my daughter. I am 28 and 4, so while the character is less cult than Mickey, it is still popular with many children and adults today. Kelly is always charming, eyes full of fun and excitement. In every movie I've ever seen, you always steal a show. One of the best dancers of the 20th century. No wonder Paul Abdul "sampled" Kelly's movements. I would also introduce Gene Kelly to one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century. If you should only watch one part, do not miss Kelly's dance with Jerry Mouse. You will not be disappointed.
