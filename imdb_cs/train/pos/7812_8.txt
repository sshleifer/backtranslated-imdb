A long film about a very important figure from South Africa, Stephen Biko. He is one of these blacks who did not survive apartheid, who actually died long before the usual time. The old film, however, does not show how important Biko really was. His life and his teachings are limited to little, preferably several witty notes. The film has been since 1987, the aim was to move the South African border to the brink that would lead to liberation. The aim of the film is to show how in 1987 they are irrational partisans of apartheid in South Africa. To show that the film must look behind Bik's death, focus on the discussion not only about Biko, but about the white liberal journalist and his escape into the absurd system in which he lives. His escape is needed because of victimization, which is his victim with his family, and because he wants to publish his first book about Biko after his death, and that can only happen in England. The film shows a way to escape South Africa while apartheid is still standing and killing. So do not expect this to be realistic and true. That could not be. The film, however, is extremely aging, as it does not show South Africa any historical distancialisation, a long distance under the presidency of Nelson Mandela, which is called forgiveness, provided that those who want to be forgiven speak and speak. The film is strong and emotional, but this very historical boundary is relatively weak today, especially because the film did not mention the third racial community, the Indians. Panegyric books or movies have all these flaws: they look at the person who should have a portrait from a single perspective. This explains why the movie grew so long, it seems to have come from such a long time as nothing has ever changed. Transformation is necessary.
