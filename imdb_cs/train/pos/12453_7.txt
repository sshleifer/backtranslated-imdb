Unfortunately, many consumers who write reviews for IMDb have a low budget and are not good. Whatever the film might need, the budget is not really part of it. A big series and a lot of special effects would turn it into another Lara Croft movie. What we have here is one or two better than that. <br /> <br /> The almost unknown Alexandra Staden is breathtaking as a mysterious modesty, and this is crucial for this film. Her wise little smiles and conscious looks are great and you find that you want the camera to fall into the face. That makes it working that bad boy Nikolai, playing also the little-known (in the US at least) Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau could have an extraordinary brain interest in her, something that Modesta can use. He is able to avert his rape only by pushing and "spending time!" then he set out among his heavily armed, but suddenly unbearable supporters. Such a scene does not happen by accident. Probably the biggest problem I have with the thin Staden playing Modesta is that she is simply untrustworthy to go hand in hand with an athletic and muscular-looking guy like Coaster-Waldau and beat him. She simply is not Peta Wilson or exhausted Hilary Swank actress who can hit a convincing blow. Coaster-Waldau, who had been exaggerated by Staden, appears to be rough with his stupid sister. <br /> <br /> Because it's not really an action movie, it's not a big defect. I just hope that they will do better if and when they will continue.
