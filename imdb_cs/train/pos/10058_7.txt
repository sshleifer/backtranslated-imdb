I admit that I was somewhat exhausted by the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of his reluctant guardian. Did I see a lot of them? Baby Boom, Kolya, about boys, mostly Martha, and to some extent, a whale rider? expect the formula to be bored. What caught my eye in the King of Mask was the darnness of the environment: the small cities of China in the 1930s. Extreme poverty was a norm, and children were considered to be worthless to the poor parents of being killed at birth or given to anyone who would take them on the black market. When Wang discovers his purchased grandson, nicknamed "Doggie," he is a granddaughter, he initially dropped her, though she proved to be very promising as an heir grateful on the street. Even after reluctantly, she was not too upset when she was kidnapped. The film is gravely, showing the lengths that a young, intelligent girl must go to survive in this society. The two main performances are believable and enchanting in their social context. In Western society, we would expect at least a sign of repulsion from Wang, which would not achieve more material success. Wang has so thoroughly accepted his station as a celebrated artist with a low social status, even though I did. While Doggie shows the level of prematureness and cunning that would be suspected in a modern, suburban child, she is entirely believable in the context of a child who is still surviving in a society that keeps poor girls as garbage. And after she learned that her previous seven owners are physically and psychically abusing her, her furious bond to Wang makes sense. When we look at life in a small town in a foreign country, the nature of these two leading actors, the surprising conspiracy plot and of course the indignant decision contribute to a very attentive film.
