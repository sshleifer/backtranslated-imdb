The Equestrian Rider This documentary deals with the history of surfing and follows three other well-known and recognized surfařské films, Dana Brown's Infinite Summer, his sequel to Endless Summer II by Bruce Brown, Dana's son and Step into Fluid (IMAX). I saw the first, not the others. <br /> <br /> Whilst surfing is spectacular, I most appreciated the film's historical perspective. It takes us back to the origin of sport almost a hundred years ago and shows how it has evolved to its present form. This includes extensive interviews with leading celebrities and artists as surfboard patterns changed over time, where the most visited Hawaiian and California beaches were world-class surfers, and what incredible adrenaline had immersed in the sport. Athletes lived on beaches for months, surfed from dawn to dusk, camped on rudimentary beds, hunted for food, and went back to their tables the next day. What euphoric way to spend teenage days. <br /> <br /> We see the media discovering and promoting the sport after a slow start. What was the biggest increase in sports? Believe it or not, it was a Gidget movie, though I think copyright issues can prevent adding Beachboys surfing like Surfer Girl and Surfing USA. Surfing Magazine and Encyclopedia Surfing (who knew there was such a tome) are mentioned for their contributions. We also see comments from sports pioneers, their families, and how the current generation benefited from the originators in the 1960s. One such story lies in how 40-year-old Laird Hamilton, considered to be the greatest surfer today, associated with a former surfer, introduced him to his unmarried mother, whom he had married before becoming his father. <br /> <br /> This story accompanies the exciting musical background of contemporary music of all time. Have I written your appetite? Great. Very ride.
