"Bruce the Almighty" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from trailer. However, I found in him a deeper message that actually made me like this movie. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry with God and receives divine powers by being God for a week to find out if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man who is symbolized here as God, and though it is not his usual type of film or one of his best roles, he will do excellent work with him. Although sometimes crude, he laughs a little, from Bruce, where the soup collapses half as the Red Sea and the customer's reaction to it, as does Freeman's seemingly abandoned and wise image of God. It's exaggerated to exaggerate, and there's some rough humor, but overall it can be a bit funny. There is a decent support like Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter and Steve Carrell, who always helps. The end of the film turned out to be very romantic and tearing, and the message is clear that we should do what God called us and "be a miracle". The film is far from perfect, yet pleasant and much better than I and many people would expect, especially when we see a deeper film message. <br /> <br /> *** Off ** **
