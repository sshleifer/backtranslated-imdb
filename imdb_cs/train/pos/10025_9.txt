It must be a unique sample of the two genres ever seen. The genre of the giant film about the genre of the living mummy. This unique mix creates a unique and convincing story. The footage is extraordinary, including Tom BOSLEY, who until now knows he's never been in a horror movie. The effects are impressive and the idea of ​​a giant mummy full of smaller mummies is great. My only complaint, I just wish we could see more of the giant mummy, but others that I think they are doing a great job. Dialogue, characters and story were perfect. The game was wonderful. It must be the best movie that came out of the science fiction channel. You heard me, the best movie that came out of the science fiction channel. I give FALEN 9 of 10.
