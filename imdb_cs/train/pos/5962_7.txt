I've seen a bunch of 80-year-old rock heroes, from garbage like "Teror on Tour" to immensely entertaining gems like "Slumber Party Massacre 2". Somehow I managed to keep it, which is odd, because it is probably the most popular and best received. Well, I finally caught it and it's probably the best of this mostly terrible (but almost always cute) subgenre. The story (which was largely raised in the movie "The Black Roses") is about a disparate miser named Eddie, who has all been raised in high school because of his taste in music. He loves the 1980s metal, especially his idol Sammi Curr (played late by great Tony Fields.) After Sam is killed, Eddie's favorite DJ radio gives Sammy the last record. Once Eddie plays back records, he finds it a bit harder and bad things are going to do to those who scratch him. Is Sammy's music obsessed? "Trick or Treat" is a well-done and full horn. The special effects are amazing, although they feature typical 80s laser beams. I grew up in the eighties, and when I was not a heavy metal fan, I remember the city legend about playing the record backwards and hearing the sounds of Satan's worship. Ha-Ha! I also remember that my older siblings and neighbors said KISS and Ozzy worshiped Satan, so it's very fun to see both of them make friends like a harmless radio DJ and prosecutor priest. If I saw this movie just as a child! While the movie seems to spoil the railing in a popular connection in the 1980s between alleged devil's and heavy metal worship, the audience never finds out why Sammi Curr is back from the dead to create confusion and kill who gets in the way. This is the weakest point in the film, but if it's overlooked, it's a lot of fun.
