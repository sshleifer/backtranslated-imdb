Walter Matthau and George Burns were the famous, comedy comedy Lewis and Clark, who have not spoken for over 10 years. Burns retired, and Matthau took her personally, and since then he has been ignorant. Such is the notion of this merry game, Neil Simon, which was filmed. Of course, what is so good is Matthau and Burns in their main direction, and the material is more fun than anything you find today. Richard Benjamin shines like Matthau's nephew and agent. There are even old clips of real stars of the golden era that will lead you into the groove of the film, and an actor in Fritz Feld will start with "pop". Rosetta LaNoire, who started in the 1930s with Orson Welles and was later a grandmother for "Family Affairs," is great in a small role. The only problem I had (and maybe I'm too picky and / or serious) is the way Matthau treats Burns when they meet for the first time. Because he had all that much fury about it, but some of the things he did would be considered rough or simply bad ways that were excluded from the context. I'm also used to seeing Matthau working in other films, but not George Burns. And Matthau's shout tends to be a little old. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you need a 24-hour fun movie to help you forget about your troubles, put "The Sunshine Boys". They will lift your moods and make you think of the easier time and way of life. <br /> <br /> Benjamin: "You have to move it." <br /> <br /> Matthau: "Wait, wait, I think you need to move it."
