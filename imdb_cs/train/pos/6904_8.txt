This is one of the few movies I can watch over and over again. If you've never seen it, do it. Richard Dreyfus and Raoul Julia are wonderful together and although the film is very funny, it reminds me of the premature death of Julie. It's a good opportunity to sit down and laugh at international intrigues that are too big in our time of fear and fear.
