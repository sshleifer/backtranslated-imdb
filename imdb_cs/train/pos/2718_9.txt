Last year we dealt with two films about Truman Capote who wrote the book from which this film was made - Capote and Infamous. I can not imagine the film as it was made in 1967. Stark, a cool brutal drama; based on Richard Brooks masterpiece (Elmer Gantry, Cat on a Hot Sheet, Professional, Blackboard Jungle). Interestingly, Robert Blake, who played in this movie, has so many problems late, which may be related to his picture of the killer in this movie. The movie that stays with you after viewing.
