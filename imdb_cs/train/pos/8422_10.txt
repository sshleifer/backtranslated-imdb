In addition, the film about the Russian Revolution is invited to play the general. However, he is no ordinary extra. It is Sergius Alexander, former commander-in-chief of the Russian army, who is now forced to experience the same scene he suffered a professional and personal tragedy to satisfy the director who was once a revolutionary in Russia and humiliated by Alexander. Now it may be time for this broken man to "win" his last battle last. This is one powerful film with careful guidance from von Sternberg, which provides the greatest irony of Alexander's character in all possibilities. Jannings earned an Oscar for a very moving performance, playing the general at his peak and in his deepest valley. Powell delivers ominous support as a director of revenge, and Brent is perfect in her role with face and movements that show as many expressions as Jannings love. Everywhere around the shine. Rating, 10.
