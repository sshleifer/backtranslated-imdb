MINOR SPOILER <br /> <br /> Underrated little Stephen King shooter. It's not perfect, no matter how much imagination it is - even if the better performance of Dale Midkif and Denise Crosby was better, there would still have been badly controlled elements of the mystical story we might be struggling with. The old Micmac burial site, Rachel's finally sick sister, and Jacob-Marley - Victor Pascow never really met anything coherent, and the movie felt confused and exaggerated. But few horror films are really perfect, and there may be a lack in other areas for which he is willing to be shocked. "Pet Sematary" may in fact be one of the worst horror films in recent memory with his murderous zombie child and his crazy insensitive portrayal of Zelda. It's politically wrong, it's tasteless, it's immortal - and yet it will make us alter the way of safer horror films ever. Add to one of Fred Gwynn's best performances and the humorous direction of Mary Lambert, and you have a very satisfying scary movie - even with a hockey finish. Highly recommended for fans of genres. 7.5 out of 10.
