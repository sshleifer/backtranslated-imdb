I grew up watching this series. I was about seven years old when it was. I still remember the first episode, called "New House". I was terrified of me! I can still hear the statue and laugh madly. And finally, oh God! In the children's room, the fever comes: Yikes! It was classical television and it was one of the most diverse series. I found a collection of DVD for sale on the Internet: 2 actually. My question for all readers: Has anyone bought this file? It's a bootleg. Both dealers say they have a very good copy. I have hidden and poor DVD episodes "The New House" and a few other episodes that are a bit better, but if anyone knows if they are much clearer, it would be worth buying and sharing with my kids. Great series, smart, spooky and courageously supernatural. Thank you in advance to any fan who has something to do with this - basically I would like to discuss it. Chris Walker
