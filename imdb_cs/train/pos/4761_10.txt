A great movie with great performances from Zack & Lochley. Much to their displeasure (& mine), Garibaldi arrived at the station. (All respect for Jerry Doyle, but in season 4 and 5 I lost my sympathy for the character.) It does not take long before I criticize Zack (who I love most at the show) and took over. I'm sure Zack could handle it. Soulhunter's plot is fascinating, especially when you believe in the sky like Zack. Humor is nicely complemented. 10/10
