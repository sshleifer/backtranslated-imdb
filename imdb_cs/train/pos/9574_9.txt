It must be one of the best movies that came out of HK for a long time, waiting impatiently to get to this film, just looking at the title. Loads of fantastic actors in this show and I was particularly impressed with Sam Lee's impossible credible crazy behavior and Edison's portrait of a killer machine that completely turned his normal idol image. I would definitely recommend those who are looking for stylish film and action packs. But I have to warn you, it's just as depressing, because every character in the movie is in some motionless end and has his own trouble trying to breathe. Thinking about what life really means.
