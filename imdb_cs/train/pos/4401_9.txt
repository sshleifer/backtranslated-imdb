Ang Lee's ride (Crouching Tiger) is another jewel in this delicate overhead cap. For those unfamiliar with the history of Kansas-Missouri border wars during the American Civil War. Check out this movie and visit the sad Americana. In addition to some great action scenes (sometimes bloody). This is the story of love and devotion between men and lady. She's star Toby Maguire, Skeet Ulrich Jeffrey Wright & like a young lady Jewel, I've never heard of her, I've never seen her, I want to see her more). Acting is excellent, excellent production value, very well written novel) <br /> <br /> This is a long movie 128 minutes but it is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> My rating is **** <br /> <br /> /> <br /> Jay Harris <br /> <br />
