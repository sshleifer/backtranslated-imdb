The characters were lively and interesting, the plot was great, the pyro effects were masterfully completed, and it required the basic story of the triangle love and fits into the science fiction element into it. I could identify with many characters and their motivation logically rational sense within the story. Camera-work was great, audio bright and accurate, background music perfectly chosen for the effect, the singer of the fire a nice talented unforgettable peculiarity, sets greatly created and special effects made with talented talent. I'm a little confused how the whole mini carnival in the chain warehouse batch could be powered by one lamppost output. That seems impossible. The fight among the brothers near the end of the film was brilliant. Having Jim Varney in the non-clown role was a wonderful touch also played the semi-serious role of the carna very well.
