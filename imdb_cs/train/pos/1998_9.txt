In Cinema Retro No. 2, it was found that Mark Lester's voice was actually dubbed by a 20-year-old woman named Kathe Green. Although Leste was considered perfect for the title role, director Carol Reed was not at all satisfied with his singing skills. The secret was revealed in a 2004 British documentary called "Oliver! After They were Famous". Greene was paid 400 pounds for her work, and she had to agree to secret participation, just like Mark Lester. They kept their word and revealed this fact as part of a television show for decades after the release of the film. For the record, Mark Lester left the acting and is a practical osteopath in England.
