I'm sure most people already know this story - Crazy Ebenezer Scrooge gets a visit to three spirits (Christmas Ghosts, Present, and Coming) who highlight part of their lives in hopes of saving their souls and changing their paths. Dickens' classic story in one form or another stands as a test of time to become a beloved favorite holiday. While I grew up watching the 1951 version of Alastair Sims, and I believe it was definitely Scrooge, I was overwhelmed by this version that came out when I was in high school. George C. Scott plays convincing and bad Ebenezer Scrooge, and actors playing ghosts are rather terrifying and horrifying. David Warner is also a good Bob Cratchit. <br /> <br /> This version is beautifully shot and uses more modern movie styles (for the eighties), which are more appealing to my children than the black-and-white version of 1951. <br /> <br /> This is a dignified adaptation of the story and it's a theme I watch almost every year at some point in the Christmas season.
