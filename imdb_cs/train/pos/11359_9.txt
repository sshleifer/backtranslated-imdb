Citizen X tells of the real life drama of searching for a serial killer called "The Rostov Ripper." This great movie shows a long way to try to keep the killer. The film shows how the political government can help the killer to continue his storm for more than 12 years. (More than 50 victims, mostly women and children) Introducing Stephen Rea as Detective Manager and Donald Sutherland as the Head of Investigation Team was great. Jeffrey DeMunn as Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. This is the type of movie that will fascinate you and will instantly explore you on the Internet. This movie should not be missed. I debuted that I believe in HBO and I have never experienced the theatrical release. Great movie
