It is in my doubt that so many garbage from Norway has been remastered for DVD release, and still gems do not get a shot at recapturing their past of glory. I'm giving it 7, not because it's very good, but because it's one of the few SciFi films made for Norwegian TV. This film is nothing less than a film historical gem, which in many ways will showcase the first Alien movie. And my word, Blindpassasjer was the first! Did Ridley Scott or any of the crew miniserials say? However, the scenes are unlikely to be very similar. Okay, the budget is a little lower in the Norwegian film, but because it's a really well-done work from the desolate age of Norwegian film, which incidentally lasted until the 1990s.
