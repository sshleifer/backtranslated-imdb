the only word that summarizes this movie is strange. it's a reckless story over an existential concept. jumping (more than one) and a bit nutty. I would not say this to a spectacular and unforgettable cinema and it does not seem to me as memorable as the first film director, "the cube", but it's a good depth of fluff to watch on Sunday morning. it is both worthy and occasionally annoying, but I believe it is as it should be written. as a serious movie it could have been great, or it could well get to the forearm. a little like "matrix" meets "head" meets "human nature". <br /> <br /> 6,8 out of ten
