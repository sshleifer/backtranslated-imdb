"October Sky" is a movie that steals your heart, fills your mind with living images and lifts your spirit. The story of Homer Hickham and his attempt to create a rocket seems at first sight so easy, especially when the film is located in a mining town where the future is as bright as the coal of the mine. But Homer can not follow in the footsteps of his father. With the encouragement of Miss Riley (friendly teacher), members of his father's team and his friends, Homer tries to realize his dream. <br /> <br /> But as in every true story of life, many stops are on the way. Director Joe Johnston takes us down to the coal mines, where we witness the cold difficulty of miners standing under the rock ceiling. With the hatched helmets and bent position, strange insects were more like people in the dark. The hacker cough of miners and blackened faces constantly resembled the dangers miners faced in their work. The contrasting mine workings are images of Homer and his girlfriends rockets. Under the blue bowl of the sky, the rockets are placed on the mat and run into the stratosphere ... And nothing can match the scene when Homer first sees Sputnik. But what makes the movie so Cute is the relationship between the characters. Homer's father is a classy, ​​hard-headed man ... but he has a soft side. We see that he loves his son, despite many arguments. Miss Riley's love and support are also obvious. Best of all, the film is uncomfortable. It does not matter in a nice bow. It tears you, it raises you. It keeps the air of reality that is important in a movie like this one. <br /> <br /> This movie can be considered a complete job. At first I was disappointed that the film with Homer's life continued. I did not want it to end. Then I realized ... that's what a good movie does to a man. If she did, you will not want her to end. And "October Heaven" can do it.
