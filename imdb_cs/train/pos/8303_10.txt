This movie literally has every action film clich√© and everyone is working for it. Straight from Lethal Weapon, Gary Busey shoots and shoots in this movie, because he can not help with such ruthless abandonment but entertains and entertains. There are tanks, helicopters, machine-gun fights, grenades, and ice-cream supplies, and if there's not good reason why this movie looks, then best ... Danny Trejo. And if you do not know who Danny Trejo is, you probably will not like this movie.
