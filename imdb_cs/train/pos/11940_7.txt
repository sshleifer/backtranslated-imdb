As a baseball hard work, this film is at odds with what I expect in a sporting movie: authentic sporting events, credible characters and the original story. While "Angels in the Outfield" is unfortunately worsening in the first category, they are successful in the last two. "Angels" is a story about Roger and J.P., two Anaheim foster children in love with baseball, but about looking for a family with what is going on in horror English trying to draw fans and win the games. Promised by their father's promise that they will be family only when the Angels win the flag, Roger asks for some heavenly help and gets it in the form of diamond beings that bend the spiral downwards. And when manager George Knox (portrayed by Danny Glover) starts to believe what Roger sees, the team suddenly hopes to turn his season - and Roger and JP will find something to believe. Glover especially gives a nice performance, and Tony Danza, playing a washed jug, also does well, even though he has a clear idea of ​​ZERO how to go out of the win!
