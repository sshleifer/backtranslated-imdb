Impressive - fantastic. Story - amazing. Script - great. <br /> <br /> Just a few ways to describe this movie. Yes, it's slow and mostly talking, but the whole story of all their lives, and as narratives are told with spitting incendiaries that fall in and out, makes you want to listen to every little thing to learn more about this terrible and tragic story . I myself read the book from which the film is based and showed me even more light in this story and answered some of the questions that remained unanswered in the film. I will also read the Execcionary song, which is the "second" half of the Gilmore story. This movie has been thinking of me so much about the phrase "pierce the other side of the view". You hear a song in Gary Gilmore's Eyes, a punk band that wrote a song about how Gary Gilmore's eyes should be (which is one of the things Gary gave as a transplant when he died) and how you listen, which is after the last time Mikal sees Gary, everywhere you look at the whole situation a little differently if you only have the same song. This movie opened my eyes this way and in many others. I recommend this film (and book) very much.
