"Jake Speed" is a great movie with a wonderful message. Of course, it has its shortcomings. Sometimes it's a bit slow. He introduces his villain too far into the story. His actions move at heart rate. He has a Z game category (although I have always admired the work of Karen Kopins, who has the straight outlook of Sandra Bullock). But all this is happening, "Jake Speed" is really inspiring due to the charming scene of Wayne Crawford (who plays the lead) and Andrew Lane. Why is it so inspiring? Because he says, "Hey, why do not you try to be a good person." The story is basically a "stranger in a foreign country" assumption, that's good and heroic Jake Speed ​​is placed in a real world where bad things have happened to good people. Jake is more than Scouts. It's more than a knight in glowing armor. Jake Speed ​​is the patron of optimism in the dirty, bad and bad world. This is because "Jake Speed" really needed to be hit. She has a great message to go to Hollywood and then to the rest of the world. Imagine the film industry that really tried to portray good and decent people. I'm not saying that we should watch Walton in every theater at the festival, but it would be nice if another movie like "Jake Speed" got the chance. ("Due South", a TV show about Mountie in Canada, is a good comparison of what can be done to brighten American entertainment.) Sure, "Jake Speed" has violence, blood and weapons, but the overall message is that if you try be so good, you will always defeat the forces of evil. 14.4.1999
