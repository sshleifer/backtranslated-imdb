One of the best movies there. Maybe cinematography was not the biggest but a great conspiracy and concept. Great for time and brilliant and creative ideas. Something other than the usual movies and great entertainment. One of my favorites and I recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative movies. Post World War 3 and fight in giant robots, the actors gave great performance and made it all worthwhile. The sets are not amazing but simple and work for the overall look of the film. This movie is very hard to find on DVD but also on VHS. Look at that because I loved her when he came out. It's not about the mainstream and not about anything you've ever seen. Look and think like a child. It's a great look and it's very fun.
