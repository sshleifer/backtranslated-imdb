Of all the film nourishes of the forties and fifties it must be considered one of the strangest and most amazing. I say it because of four main actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The first two names are known to all, but these were the last two to make this movie so fun, especially Anders. His character "George Grisby" is one of the most amazing people I've ever seen in the movie. His voice and some of the things he said must be heard to be believed. Slaone is not in the "strange" category. Hayworth is not so charming with short, blond hair, but it's still Hayworth, which means a lot ugly if you're a guy. Welles is as fascinating as ever. One tip: if you have a DVD, turn on English subtitles. His character in this film is Irish and you need subtitles to understand everything he says. Welles also directed the movie, which means you have great camera angles and beautiful face details. You also have a unique end, visually, with a shootout in the mirror house. Great things! Just as bizarre as this movie, I still thought that the carnival atmosphere, which resembled an army, was too high at the end of the lawsuit to get rid of the seriousness of the scene. Other than that, no complaints. <br /> <br /> This is great fun, which is the name of the game.
