I have to admit that for the first half hour or such a movie I was basically lost. There was a slightly funny humor, but the best piece and the general sense of futility that was on the verge of thinking that I was wasting time. Then - for no apparent reason - I suddenly realized I liked it. There was no blinding moment of realization and no sudden dramatic scene that caught me. In fact, nothing exciting in the whole movie. It was as if I had suddenly realized that the film was to be largely insignificant - and that was in its absurdity its spell. Morgan Freeman played as an unnamed actor who finds a "little project" to start his career. He will play supermarket manager and spend the day in the neighborhood supermarket to explore the role. While he meets and connects with Scarlet (played by Paz Vega) - a treasurer who wants more of life. She helps her get ready for a job interview as if she has been involved in a bankruptcy job while introducing it to real life. It's really funny watching "that" (because it's a character that's identified in credit) to be flooded by visiting the local Target store. <br /> <br /> Freeman and Vega were great along with a strange but complete credible species of a combined romantic but father-daughter of chemistry. If you feel lost at first, keep it. It finally turns out to be a gorgeously charming movie. 7/10
