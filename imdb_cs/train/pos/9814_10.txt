This award-winning episode of the Peabody Award is one of the most significant first seasons, when the bug in the hologram is captured by Captain Picard, Beverly, Data and Historian of the Starfleet by Waylan in San Francisco in 1930. This episode is a homage to Raymond Chandler's "Maltese Falcon" Stewart takes on the role of Humphrey Bogart - complete with fedora and trenchcoat. The office itself is almost an exact replica of what was mentioned in Bogey's "Maltese Falcon". <br /> <br /> This episode also briefly introduces us to a mysterious insect track named Jarada, which communicates with predominantly high buzzing sound. Communication with this extraterrestrial race is difficult, and it is Picard's communication with this race in his native language so that negotiations and diplomacy can finally begin. The best part of this episode is the appearance of the famous Hollywood B-actress Lawrence Tierney in the role of gangster Cyrus Redblock. In the 1940s he was such a nice man. Oh, well ...
