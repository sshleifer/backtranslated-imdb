I was 10 years old when this show was on TV. By far it was my favorite. The actors were very credible. Alexandra Bastedo was just gorgeous ... I just ordered a DVD (15 episodes). They did not have great performances. They simply had excellent human abilities (strength, hearing, eyesight). The three actors were very good, very credible in their class. Each episode was a good story. At that time there were no special effects or explosions, so the script was good and the characters were great. There was no fantasy, just like in other shows. They did not try to joke every 2 minutes to make a light show. I highly recommend this TV show to someone who likes good things.
