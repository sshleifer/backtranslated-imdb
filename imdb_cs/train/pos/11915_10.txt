But how can you manage to run a baseball team that can not win. It's not easy for George Knox. As the film opens, Roger Beaumont (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) and his best friend J.P (Milton Davis Jr.) are on their wheels around an angel stadium. When he returns to his foster home, Roger is surprised to visit his father (Dermot Mulroney). His mother is dead! And when he asks his father when they are family again, his father jokes "I say when the angels win the division championship." So later Roger and J.P hide in the tree to watch the angels play baseball. When the cavalier George Knox (Danny Glover) pulls out his pitcher, the pitcher goes crazy and gets in the fight with him, and soon the team of angels gets into the fight where Knox gets out of the game. That night Roger prays because the angles win the championship. When his foster mother Maggie Nelson (Brenda Ficker) agrees that Roger and JP are going to basketball, Roger sees that real angles are coming on the pitch and helping the left spider (Matthew McConaughey) strike who leaves the crunch and play-by (Jay , Sanders), as he did. Roger learns from the chief angel (Christopher Lloyd) that he only sees angles because he was the only one who prayed for help. <br /> <br />
