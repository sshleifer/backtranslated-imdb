Martin Sheen, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin and late Vic Morrow are the human stars of this film about a young man looking for answers to his brother's death. Mrs. Sheen, Mr Margolin and Mr Morrow are taking part in their first-rate performances; Mrs. Phillips has a little less than an enviable task to try to spice up a movie made for television (twenty-five years ago) by giving "sexual interest" to another sexual film. The real star is "California Kid"; The Ford coupe of 1934, borrowed from "Jake" Jacobs, who put himself in front of the camera and gave the exercises that let the viewer lie, lap and hold the edge of the seat without breath. <br /> <br /> Scene events are spectacular (although some of the dialogues are a little fragile) and they do a great afternoon. This is how all the "car showrooms" should be created. <br /> <br /> Try capturing it on the late film channel; it is worthwhile to omit sleep.
