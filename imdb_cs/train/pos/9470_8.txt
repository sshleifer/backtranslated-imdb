I'm not a fan of Steve Carell, but I like this movie about Dan, a radical advisor who goes to his parent's home to be able to accommodate his children and finally falls in love with his brother's girlfriend. It's a story that has already been spoken, but not like that. There are just too many small bits that make the movie better than it should be. The cast is wonderful, and though Carell is not my cup of tea, she is pretty good as a widow who assumes she knows everything but finds out that knowing is different than feeling and that sometimes life will surprise you. Sometimes funny and wise in the way the Hallmark bulletproof card can be, the film can still grow on you and be something more than a miller movie run. It's worth seeing
