Although Cinderella is not an obvious choice to continue, I love Jaqa and Gus so I did not hesitate. The format of mouse writing for Cinderella was inspired. I love writing the stories myself and I hope the children will be encouraged by this. The three stories are cute and entertaining, though the songs were forgotten. Jaq and Gus were my favorite characters, but I also enjoyed Lucifer, Bruno, The Idea, and everything else. Pom Pom proved to be a perfect companion for Lucifer, and I liked the ruler. Continuation completed for change. My Review 8/10.
