For those who have not met Anne Marie Fahey Murder. You miss one of the most sad, but complicated murders of all. The killer is a popular Delaware lawyer, Tom Capano, and the victim is Secretary of Delaware Governor, Anne Marie Fahey. Their relationship was a well-kept secret until her disappearance and murder. She wanted to leave him, but he simply did not let her go so easily. On the other hand, he had a lady and wife and four daughters. Where did he find time to have two mistresses and family home life? In addition, the case is extremely complicated and fascinating for four hours of the mini-series. While the actress, who plays Mrs. Fahey, does a great job, she does not have dark long hair. His second lover is definitely more attractive than a real woman. Mark Harmon looks better, awarding Emmy for Tom Capano. It would be better with current locations in Delaware and Philadelphia. With Ann Rule's performance, she delivers the precision of Anne Marie's characteristic organization and her personal battle with eating disorder. These bits of information may be overlooked by another executive producer or director. If you have not read the book, it is worth it. Ann Rule is a fascinating story of true crime. It is ironic that Mark Harmon plays Tom Capano. He also played a former friend and subject of Ann Rule, Ted Bundy in a different book adaptation many years ago. He was just fine now. He performs above-average work with an amazing story. Even President Clinton offered his help in the case of Anne Marie Fahey. And now, former governor Tom Carper is now a United States senator for Delaware, who defeated longtime longtime popular Senator Richard Roth in the November 2000 elections. If you do not think the movie is interesting then Read Rule.
