Magicians are a wonderful journey from start to finish, thanks to the great part of the magic created by the stars. Alan Arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles for decades. Just like some really great movie, it's the way in which the theme of redemption and dreaming results. I can not believe this movie is so hard to find - I'd buy it on DVD with a touch of heart, but I still found a drawer.
