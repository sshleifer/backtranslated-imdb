Disney (and great PIXAR people of course) offer a pleasant, humorous story combined with the best computer animation. I admit that perhaps the "faces" of the bugs were a little more static than the "Antzi" and had only four legs (in 'Antzu' six ...). But the background was excellent and the animation was breathtaking. But it is a lesson: it was not the computer that made it so successful: it was a man behind a machine that added a nice little twist that was missing in Antz. Some warnings were of course "bloopers" at the end (So watch out for the end, it's worth it!) That were very fun and original. The line "Filtered on the spot" was intended for a more attentive viewer.
