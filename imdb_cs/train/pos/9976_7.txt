Sure, it was saliva and unreasonable and sometimes nasty, but at least the filmmakers did not try. While most television films are on the brink of mediocrity, this film has a real redemption for him. Cinematography was quite good for television, and Viggo Mortensen portrays the Aragorn shades in a film about a man playing according to his own rules. Most of the flash sequences were a bit of cheese, but the mountain-left scene was intense. I was a bit angry about Jason Priestla's role in the movie as a rebellious shock-jock, but then it's TV MOVIE again! Despite all the good things, the soundtrack was terrible. However, it was nice to see Tucson, Arizona prominently featured in the film.
