This great movie consists mainly of documentary shots that are currently featured on DVD along with Prelude to the war. The great American filmmaker and story-maker Frank Capra shot these films, which simply and clearly highlight the main points of World War II and Hitler's rise. Every school kid, no one, every American should watch them today because they are so good. History is repeated again and again! Lord Chamberlains are still alive and dig; tactics used by the Nazis infiltrated countries through sympathizers, and then communists and now Muslim terrorist groups, are still working on the benefit of this evil group. To sit back and let Hitler be aggressive in 1935 - France, America and England have killed more than 50 million people. The Americans, the French and the British would happily let Hitler do exactly the same, despite the fact that we should learn from history what happens when you let the dictators break the contracts. These great movies can be too simplistic World War II lovers of history. They do not say the horrors caused by the Soviet Union because at that time America joined them and fought against Hitler. This film explains the clear facts and motifs that led to a terrible war.
