There seem to be only two types of reviews of this movie on the Internet. Those who hate and curse the name of Ralph Bakshis and those who love him and call him brilliant. I'm inclined to be in the middle. I have to agree with most of the critics of this film (such as Cruel Cutting of the Story, Bad Rotoscopic Charecters, Acting, etc.). But distract the fact that I still love this movie. Rotoskoping (when properly done) gives the audience a strange realistic dimension and the final combat scene at the end of the film is fantastic. Surrealistic scenes where Frodo are hunters are stylish and well done, and musical scores ... magic. Sad bad points, but if you can ignore it, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> (No doubt I will lynch the angry crowd of people who hate this movie after writing this review, ah well, that's life)
