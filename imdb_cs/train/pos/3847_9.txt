At the time this film was written around the world (like most of the Verhoeven projects). <br /> <br /> It contains a very graphic display of deadly scenes; A parachute who does not open the body of the guys on the floor. The boy who is consumed in the neck by the left toothbrush. A guy who crosses a fast boat * enlarges * a bloody corpse that goes down. But besides the gore, this film also contains some brilliant (and amazingly beautiful) scenes shot in the gray fishing town of Vlissingen; Thousands of pink petals flying across the screen, in a somewhat insignificant part of the film, a beautiful (holy) woman who flowers in a milk crucible surrounds the blood-dripping plates that is in the cemetery's flooded love scene between two men. <br /> <br /> The story is closed in a furious but fulfilling 10 minutes that does not disappoint and lets you sigh with relief. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Of course, there are some disadvantages with professionals, some special effects are too overwhelming, and of course they can see how far Verhoeven can push a gore factor (eg several eyebrows hanging from their drawers). Also, while two main actors (Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk) are doing a great job of breathing life into their characters, the character of Herman (portrayed by somewhat clumsy Thom Hoffman) feels just infinitely depressed to take care of him after his tragic death. I've done the best to give you a light idea of ​​what you expect from this amazing movie, and as you can see it's not easy to sum up in words. So do a favor if you happen to be seeing this movie somehow, watch it! And enjoy the unique style and essence of this masterpiece.
