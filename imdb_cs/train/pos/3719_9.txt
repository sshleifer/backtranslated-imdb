They just caught him at the Toronto International Film Festival. It's a good story that has been solved in a compelling way. The handheld camera approaches action scenes that add to the intensity of these scenes (in a documentary style, not in the Blair Witch style). Joel Schumacher shows that he does not need a large budget to create a gripping film. The actors were strong, especially the actor who focused on the events in the movie, Boz.
