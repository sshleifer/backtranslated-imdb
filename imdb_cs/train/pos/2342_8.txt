I watched Pie-lette last night and the word that comes to mind is "original". It's a word that is not much used on television because everyone tends to copy what makes out of another network and end up with seven nights of criminal shows, endless comedies and crap of reality. The first thing that I thought of as a brick was the presence of Jim Dale. Those who are not familiar with the British "Carry On" series or those who have not listened to Harry Potter's book may not be familiar with the Next. I'm not sure if his presence as a narrator adds or draws attention. He will have to tune in more, but it gives the show the atmosphere of "Harry Potter". Maybe it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Lee Pace has a gift. He never tells where he is, but he can bring some of the dead for a while. She collaborates with Chi McBride ("Boston Public", "Roll Bounce") to resolve murders with this talent. Everything is all right and funny until she loves children's love, Anna Friel (Aim, dream begins, timeline), and things really get complicated. She can not send her back and never touches her. Man, that would be a difficult relationship. I will be tuned to find out where this series is going with the expectation that she will continue to have fun.
