I did not see any Japanese film Grudge, but I really like it. When watching movies I rarely got SCARED. I can jump if the effect and sound are quite surprising, but the fear of the film is a rare thing for me. But I was afraid of Grudge. Maybe because I did not expect anything at all when I was watching. I did not expect to be frightened. I did not even know about it. That was probably a good thing. This is a movie you probably either love or hate. It seems that most people compare it to the Japanese films Grudge, but even though I did not see them, I believe it is not right to compare a movie. This film stands on it. <br /> <br /> The story is weak, most people say. I do not agree. The story is minimalist, and that is so. Story narration techniques - such as a broken timeframe - are perfectly executed. The director knows exactly what he is doing, and I believe he got his vision exactly as he wanted it to. I've given this film 8 out of 10. This is a movie that will enjoy watching or hate. It's so simple.
