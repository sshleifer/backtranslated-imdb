I realize that this review will take me to the scene of film critics who watch this page, but I will defend this film. The dentist is really a really good movie. The game is not always top, but the excitement is good and the story is good. And you can see Linda Hoffman's shoes. Not that I'm an expert in this area, but the direction looks good and the plot makes sense. Corbin is doing a great scary dentist. That's what dentists do, blades do sharks ... ish. Obviously, he has a relatively limited budget, but he has done well and developed the characters well (those he counts).
