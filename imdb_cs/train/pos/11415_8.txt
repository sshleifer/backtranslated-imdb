This is a great movie you can see with your girlfriend. My boyfriend and I love dancing and into this movie we got to a video rental company. We had to get it. Without violence and such a warming story, it's a great movie that you can relax and just enjoy your night. I would recommend this film to any family or just a group of girls looking for a cute movie.
