The year 2000 was a bad year for Indian films due to the lack of quality and imagination of film directors. Other than Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, nothing was outraged. The CCCC had plenty of contradictory reasons for financing the film, and that it did not know what the film is about, generates good publicity and advanced sales of movie tickets in India and abroad. The only information was that it was a thrilling thriller. The film is now released in 2001 and the film was surprisingly good. The main plot is associated with substitution and is well processed. Salman and Preiti give a good performance in which Salman actually takes that shirt at all ... must be special effects !! Rani plays Salmans's wife, but it's a slightly less demanding role than Preiti, who plays a prostitute who eventually becomes a replacement mother. The three main signals confirm that after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega, they have solid onscreen and off screen chemistry (apparently). Salman Khan, who is excellent, plays a serious role in the film as a successful businessman, and is a shame that he is abusing his other films as a comedian because he is rather underestimated in the film industry in Mumbai partly because of the films he chooses. The sign of Rani does not know that Preiti is a prostitute until the end ... it kept from her and the rest of the family ... you should find out the rest because it would destroy the movie if I told you. All the songs are well photographed, especially the decinne walon and the main title song. Other supporting actors make a minimal but gentle effort as a family loving Salmans. Abbas Mastan produced a hit and shot the movie item tactically .. I say, go and watch it or rent it if you want it!
