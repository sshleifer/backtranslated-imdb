IMDb lists it in 1972 for some reason, but the other sources I've seen, including the remarkable notes of the program, call it '68. It does not matter except that it is quite interesting to watch this abstract film and video collage (one of the first works of art that apparently merged) in connection with the stargate sequence in 2001 that was released the same year. Pure abstraction is not really my thing, but I can take it in small doses and super-saturated optically printed colors and the psychedelic feeling of this line of flowers, Rohrschach blots, birds, etc. It is quite convincing and quite beautiful. He certainly helped prepare the way for many other emerging artists in the 1970s and deserves to be better known.
