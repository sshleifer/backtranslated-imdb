I am shocked. He was shocked and amazed that 428 IMDB users who voted you did not give this movie a rating of over 7 7! - that's C!. If I gave FOBH 20, I'd like to do it. This film stands on top of the pantheon of modern comedy, next to Half Baked and Mallrats, as one of the most funny movies of all time. If you know _anything_ about rap music - you have to see! If you do not know anything about rap music - learn something! Comparison with "Spinal Tap" can not appreciate the inspired genius of this unique film. If you like Bob Roberts, you will love it. Watch it and vote 10!
