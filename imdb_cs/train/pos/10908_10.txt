When I was watching this beautiful document, I could not hold tears. It was a heart-breaking, disturbing, and inspirational one. I recommend this document to anyone who is looking for something that would make them think about what they are doing with their own lives. Or simply, something that makes you think. You watch John live in the last few months of his life. You look when his days go through a positive attitude. At one point, you begin to see that he is a truly amazing individual. You begin to understand that he has something that all of us teach. His life and struggle make you cry, laugh, and find that life is much easier to live if you simply take it one day at a time.
