Even though I'm pretty young, The Beatles are my ABSOLUTELY FAVORITE band! I never had a chance to hear their music because it was a release, but I loved them because I can remember. It's kind of a movie that's worth trying once. I see why it was not allowed in the cinema, but it's definitely a great movie to be on TV. I was browsing my TV guide and by chance I saw this film, he had not much information except what happened: "John Lennon and Paul McCartney will meet after the Beatles, Jared Harris Stars" break. I never heard of him (played by John) or Aiden Quinn, who played Paul. However, actors are undervalued! The film had a slow start, but as it developed, I saw how well played Quinn, but mainly Harris of their characters. Like a huge fan, they know what real Lennon and McCartney are. The script was great, and Harris got Lennon's accent, personality and manners in place! Quinn played McCartney quite well, but sometimes he went into his Irish accent. Make-up artists look great for them. <br /> <br /> This paragraph can be considered * SPOILER *: <br /> <br /> As I mentioned earlier, it started slowly, but it soon developed and became quite emotional. I found a little in the park a complete waste of time and a totally insignificant one for both musicians. As for Lennon's gross line in an Italian restaurant, it is totally useless. The conclusion was very dizzy and tears in my eyes whenever I look at it. It's completely different from other biographical films I've seen, where it's about how the Beatles have come together and become famous, and they've never really done the characters. E.g. "Backbeat". Finally, I would say that if you are a Beatles fan or John Lennon or Paul McCartney, give him the chance to have a joyous surprise. In just 95 minutes, it's worth waiting for the film to develop. If anyone knows if a meeting in 1976 really happened, send it to a comment page for this movie. It will be very interesting.
