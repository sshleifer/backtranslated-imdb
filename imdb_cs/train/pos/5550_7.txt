are the main features of this function since 1917. The pride of the clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes a clan chief after her father dies. On an island off the coast of Scotland, villagers live with the simple life of fishermen. My copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read, but the film boasts stunning ocean scenery and the camera working on the boats is beautiful. Maurice Tourneur director Pickford in this nice movie. Pickford was the main star in 1917, and it seems that this film was written for her: a plucky young woman succeeds in disaster. Pickford's whip, which has lazy villagers to the church, is very fun. And the final scenes on the sinking ship are very well done. It's not a great Picford movie, but it's worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother Owen Moore) has a love interest and is good as a pilgrim island boy. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers, but I have not even seen her. My copy scatters a lot of bells and gongs, and it gives a creepy feeling when village alert bells sound. Very effective.
