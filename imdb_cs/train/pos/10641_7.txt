this dolphin lundgren vehicle is fun dirty hardback action moves, will not win any prizes and its not too original, but it brings the goods you would like to see from the dolphin lundgren movie. our male dolph is a former soldier who is now a teacher in a heavy high school high school and when the terrorists take him down to him to save the day. surely the script will not win any Oscars its good entertainment and has its fair share of eplosive action. dolph lundgren gives good enough performance, but lives more in action scenes and the rest of the cast are not the best actors, but they keep it well. everything in custody is a nice action movie, but you've seen it a million times before.
