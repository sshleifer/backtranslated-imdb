I am a true product of hip-hop and electronic generation of dance music, which is undoubtedly one of my favorite films of all time. Beat Street, though not in some ways "authentic" as a wild style, is a movie that is guaranteed to attract the heart of the string to anyone who boasts a culture of urban sample / DJ music and electro-club culture. <br /> <br /> Although I admit that at a time when the dialogue is somewhat cheesy, you can not help but feel for the characters and eventually "wish you were there" for the beginnings of hip -shop culture in New York City in the early 1980s. The B-Boy battle scene in the Roxy nightclub (real-time, real-time competition between legendary Rock Steady Crew and NYC Breakers) is equally important to hip-hop fan archives like any classic album. Watch some movement of the breakers in slow motion if you really appreciate the athletic and stylish expertise of an experienced B-boy / B-girl. All Praise for Zulu Nation !!!
