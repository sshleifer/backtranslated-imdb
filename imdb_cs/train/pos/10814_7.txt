Given the opposite situation in 2009, when we have a black president, this film has a rather strong historical significance. For amusement, I found this film biased and disgusting. I was, of course, averted from the racism of time, but also found incredible music and dance. It's also good to see Sammy Davis Jr as a very young child actor. He plays Rufusa Jones, a young boy comforted by Mamma. It is said to him, "Why should you ever be a president?" It was so ridiculous that in 1933 it was mocking and she thought she was cute, charming and entertaining. The bulk of the film is a fantasy sequence of what the government would have been if a black man led her. They describe where the government is, like the reviving Baptist Church. The fact was, when one day I came across the movie that drew me. It's really great and fun. I believe that if we look at racism, we can see this film for everything it brings us. In fact, we realize that it is not only ridiculous to have a black president, but that it is normal, just makes this film much more relevant. It clearly means a moment in our collective consciousness.
