This is the most confronted document I've ever seen. It was a simple and breathtaking view of the beautiful idea. Based on photos of a hidden industrial landscape centered around modern China's industrial growth, Edward Burtynsky brings to life problems that we have so easily decided to ignore. <br /> <br /> If we take no political parties, this film is a neutral, moving image of reality that our Western societies choose not to change - by-products of economic growth, external effects paid by citizens of less developed communities, source of comfort and waste of our consumer lifestyle. /> <br /> Amazing, heart-breaking, impossible to ignore. This is a challenging journey, but it is worth accepting - please stop staying unconscious and at least look at these pictures of truth without having to face these problems. 10/10 definitely!
