One of Sundance's best parts is to see movies that you would otherwise almost certainly miss. If you are not a true devotee of art, you probably do not have many papers. Only a handful have a recognizable distribution. Fortunately, Sundance has increased its commitment to documentary films in recent years. Shakespeare Behind Bars is a powerful documentary about a dramatic production group at the Luther Luckett Correctional Complex in LaGrange, Kentucky. Every year a group of prisoners presents Shakespeare's play. Director Hank Rogerson and his crew are watching the choir because the roles are self-selected, interpreted, tested and eventually performed. The film is full of fascinating revelations for those of us who have not been exposed to the prison environment. Despite the brands we know (convicted, criminal, murderer, etc.), we soon began to appreciate and respect these men as the thoughts of human beings. Serendipitously, the game chosen for the year of filming was The Tempest, with its penetrating focus on forgiveness and redemption. Actors all face the significance of the game for their lives, they find patterns and parallels with their characters and the meaning of drama. For a documentary, like a book, the best that can be hoped to experience something that will change our lives. Shakespeare Behind Bars was a personal revelation to me. "A brave new world with such beings."
