If you like Star Wars / Trek, check out where they got all their ideas and movie facilities. It's my best 2 favorite movies of all time, other worldly futuristic and psycho-thriller. The intensity of the root material (Shakespeare's "The Tempest") is not overshadowed by whisbang gimmickry (later Lucas). And just because it was made in 1956, do not assume that you can see strings that hold the flying saucer up. It was the first movie you could not do. The miracle was made on the scale of "A-film," the economy and tastes at that time were heavily handled against him. And the past "hit" by director Wilcox was "Lassie Come Home". When I looked at him, I assumed that "Fred Wilcox" was a pseudonym for a director who sooner or later became famous but did not want to be associated with science fiction at the time, which was strictly the "B" genre at that time. It was either a very visionary production or a very random "mistake" on the part of the people who financed Hollywood. There are massive scales with live events almost microscopically embedded, which Lucas used extensively. There are intelligent machines that go beyond the stereotyped "user interface"; "computers", because in later works they appear less futuristically. The Star Trek Transporter is virtually virtually unchanged from Roddenberry 10 years later. And if the Trek / Wars Technical Section will turn away, FP's scientific links are not exaggerated and accurate today. The "boat" set is comprehensive, sparkly realistic, as good as everything you've seen since then, and more convincing than whatever Trek did for television or film. We did not have enough time to spend as much as I wanted. If you've ever wondered how the movies got into space so competently, FP tracking will explain it all. It's definitely not "Wagontrain to the Stars".
