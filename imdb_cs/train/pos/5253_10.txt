I really do not understand why people get so upset about this movie! Remember people, it's SNL movie, not anything that should be unpredictable and original in plot or direction! The ladies man is a cheerful film, though stupid sometimes, with narrative cast and as usual WONDERFUL performances by Will Ferrel and Tim Meadows. Yes, some jokes are stupid and yes, the characters are incredible but their comedy! I really do not understand how someone could laugh at this funny movie. Anyway, all I ask is for people to accept it as it is - SNL, a silly and disrespectful comedy. Nothing to win awards but still some modern comedy gold. "10-4 apricots!"
