Japan has serious problems. Demons infested Edo, taking earthly forms and bending them into their godless will. In addition, the rebirth of Ashura, the queen of demons, is coming. The only thing against this serious threat is Demon Wardens, a ghostly group of warriors who could be as bad as the demons themselves. Izumo is an officer of Demon Warden who, five years ago, took the theater instead of Demon Slaying after accidentally killing an innocent child (in a battle that strangely resembles a bar scene from Dusk to Dawn). One evening in a random encounter, she meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named Tsubaki. Their wealth overlaps (literally) and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemies. If you think it sounds like your typical Japanese Fantasy / Swordplay epic, you would be wrong. In fact, Ashura is not typical. It's a nasty scam of many movie genres. Those who just mentioned, as well as comedy, drama and romance. Director Yojiro Takita (Onmyoji) juggles the genre relatively respectfully (though comedy appears to be forced in some scenes) and the end result is a ridiculous but really fun popcorn movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, there are shortcomings in the movie. Some of the humor seems to be fictional and in place. And acting is not the greatest. But seriously, are you watching fantasy / swordplay / comedy movies for great acting? No, we watch them at the action and crazy CG visuals that Ashura has in Spades. In order not to be misleading, the film is not everything, but it is generously distributed with plenty of swords and buckets of green blood to make the average viewer happy. <br /> <br /> Bottom line; movies have their mistakes and are not epic martial arts but they do not try to be and offer interesting visuals and good action fencing games. The reason why the movie worked for me is that you never get too much of yourself and if the viewer does the same, they are sure to be delighted with this fun and stupid swing of fantasy flick action. <br /> <br /> My rating 7 out of 10. Fun popcorn movie.
