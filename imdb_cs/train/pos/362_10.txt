In 1985 (my year of birth), director Steven Spielberg steered the emotionally strong and unforgettable story of Celio's young African-American girl (debut role for Whoopi Goldberg), whose life is followed by harsh times. The story begins in 1909, when Celie is only 14 years old. She gave birth to two children. Celie has a younger sister, Nettie, with whom she is inseparable. The widow puts his eyes on Nettie, but their father gives him Celie. It is the beginning of the era of terrible abuse and constant control. Women are worse than men, and especially African-Americans, their rights are less than zero. Celie's story is a real story of survival. <br /> <br /> "Purple Color" is the masterpiece and underrated film of Spielberg. It should do more drama that "The Color Purple" and "Schindler's List" are good concepts. Cast is awesome. Whoopi Goldberg is better known as a humorous comedy, but the lead role as Celie is a remarkable word that really can print heavy drama. Danny Glover was a surprisingly ugly "Mr.". I've never seen him in such a bad role. The talk show icon Oprah Winfrey is great as a strong leader in Sofia. <br /> <br /> Warning! Prepare to have a number of tissues when watching this movie. You can really join the story of a strong sisterhood. Especially if you have a close relationship with your siblings, like my sister. <br /> <br /> Great to please Mr. Spielberg!
