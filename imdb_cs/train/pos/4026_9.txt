Pinjar is really a masterpiece ... It's a thought-provoking film that makes you think and question our culture. It's undoubtedly the best Hindu movie I've ever seen. This film was to be featured at film festivals around the world and I believe it would be a serious candidate for Cannes. All the characters were perfectly occupied, and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai chased in their roles. The story telling the story about the division is a very important story that should never be forgotten. > <br /> He has no prejudices and prejudices, and he has given a human story. Here no country is displayed as good or bad. There are evil Indians, bad Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistani. Cinematography is excellent and music is melodic, meaningful and scary. Everything about the movie was amazing ... and acting just took my breath. Everyone was perfectly occupied.
