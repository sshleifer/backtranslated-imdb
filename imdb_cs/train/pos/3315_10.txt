Bette Midler shows her talents and beauty in "Diva Las Vegas". I'm excited to stick it and I can see whenever I want it. It has what it takes to ensure that viewers are in captivity. Her voice is just as beautiful as ever before and will really impress you. The highlight of the show was the singer "Stay With Me" from her 1979 film "The Rose". You can feel emotions in the song and end up with goose bumps. The show leaves you with the urge to go out and either rent a Bette Midlera movie or go to the nearest music store and buy one of Bette Midler's albums.
