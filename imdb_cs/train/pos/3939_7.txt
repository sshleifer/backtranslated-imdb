According to John Ford's frenzy, the fictional biography of Abraham Lincoln's life, his biggest mistakes could be hatred for a woman and the ability to dance "in the worst way." The Ford camera has just praised the views to reveal Mr Lincoln's early life. But because the film lacks the complexity of the character, it does in the beauty and depth of vision. The unusually beautiful composition of the early film, which could be a series of gorgeous pictures, has a unique eye-telling story for Ford. The film sings the life of a promising young man. Henry Fonda plays contemplative and spontaneously clever Lincoln on the tee, which is one of his best roles. The film concerns two young men, brothers, in court for murder, both of whom claim to have committed. In the classroom's annoying class, the city decides to take justice into their hands and lynch them until the honorable Abe goes up. He enchants them with their humor and tells them not to get rid of his first big case, and they are just as happy with him as a boy attorney. From what follows, it seems to be the subject of all trials-murder-dramas after Abe cunningly asks witnesses of the pleasure and humor of a judge, a jury, and a city before he encounters missing articles. <br /> <br /> The film is played like many John Ford films: Americana tablespoon, slow predictability, a tingle of sarcasm that you are not sure about whether you gave a recipe or whether Ford did it yourself. Despite the apparently "Hollywood" feeling of the film and the overly patriotic banter that mentions the forthcoming Lincoln presidency, this film is quite comfortable and well built if you can take your salt grain path.
