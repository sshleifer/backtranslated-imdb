It's really a "warming heart" movie. He won the George Peither Prize, won "Roots," so he can tell you something about the nature of this film. I'm looking for the internet to order this movie because my former father-in-law, Eugene Logan, the co-writer of this film, has died for several years, so I do not have the opportunity to receive information from him. I would like to have my only big daughters, my daughters, see this movie as well as pass this wonderful story to my grandparents. My eldest daughter was seven years old when it was on TV and I have been looking forward to seeing her since then. One of my friends said it was her favorite movie. I will not "spoil" this movie for you.
