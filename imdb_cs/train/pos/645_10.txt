I hate too long French films, but my favorite film of all time is the longest and most wanted French film of all. I saw it twice in the mid-70s and then disappeared. But finally I saw it again in 1999 and fell in love again. What is most remarkable is that they feel every day as fresh as 25 years ago. If you have not seen it, do not miss a chance!
