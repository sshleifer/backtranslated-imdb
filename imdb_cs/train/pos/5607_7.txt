I once watched The Tenant and interpreted him as a horror movie. It uses many of the tropics of the genre: a sinister apartment, suspicious neighbors, revelations, secrets, hallucinations. The life of the hero, Trelkovsky, was surrounded by the evil secret forces who tried to go crazy. I recently watched as I questioned this initial interpretation. If this movie is a horror film, it's just horror in the sense that the Kafka novel is terrifying. In fact, this film can be seen on a verbal level as a lonely man who slowly crashes without any external influence. Polanski has made three madness movies in his career: Forgiveness, which I do not have in particular, that the development of madness in the hero has never convinced me; Rosemary's Baby, in which the hero is driven by evil forces; and the tenant, which could be the best paranoji study that ever took place in the cinema. Trelkovsky is a young man who rents a flat in which a woman has been killed. She becomes obsessed and slowly begins to become her: she wears her clothes, she gives her make-up, she speaks like her. But is he obsessed with spirit, or does he just leave his wild imagination as good as possible? It is this hesitation between what is real and imaginary, and which Polanski will never solve, that makes such a fascinating film. Many events in the movie can be attributed to the supernatural as easily as they can be to normal causes, and it is up to the spectator to decide what he should believe. Although this is not my favorite film, Polanski is a good example of his ability to create tension and show insanity in very convincing terms. And from a technical point of view, it is also a miracle. Just co-operating with filmmaker Philippe Sarde and legendary photographer Sven Nykvistem (Bergman's DP) while filming this film. Slow and sometimes uninteresting segments may cause this movie to be hard to enjoy, but it's an experience.
