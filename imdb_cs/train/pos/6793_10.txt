I love this game completely to death. Since I was 9, I've been 15 years old. It has great graphics, characters, spells, weapons, accessories and do not forget to finally the amazing dragoon forms! I'm still waiting for the remake, prequel or continuation of this spectacular video game. <br /> <br /> You play as Dart, a young fencer who has the potential to be a proud hero. In this adventure, you will meet beautiful creatures and boss fights. You also meet some friends who have their own special element. Like fire, darkness, water / ice, thunder, lightning, earth, light and wind. There are also items known as Dragoon Ghosts that will allow you to transform into the magical creatures of the legend. Dragons, wizards, creatures called winglies and evil creatures that you will have to face in this adventure of action exclusive excitement and excitement. One of my most popular games, The Legend of Dragoon!
