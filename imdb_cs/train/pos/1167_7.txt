Alain Delon visited a quick, vengeful revenge on a ruthless criminal family who employed him as a hitman in the "Big Guns" thriller Duccio Tessari after accidentally killing his wife and child. Tessari and screenwriters Roberto Gandus, Ugo Liberatore of "Minute to Pray, Die Second," and Franco Verucci of "The Ring of Death," take this shareholder for a career shooter for the crowd up to the wire. In fact, "big arms" are more predictable but still qualify as solid fun with lots of wild and often sudden murders. Alain Delon from The Godson is well-liked when he methodically deals with death by leading crowd families who refused to let him retire to enjoy life with his younger son and daughter. Richard Conte of "The Godfather" plays a Sicilian crime boss who wants to bury an ax with the figure of Delon, but the rest of his dirty co-workers want the hit man to be dead. Like most of the crime thrillers in the 1960s and 1970s, "Big Guns" are accused of film morality, which is not criminalized. Interestingly, one person who has nothing to do with the murder of a wife and a hero's son will survive while another person betrays the hero with extreme prejudice. Tessari does not lose a second in a 90-minute shot. In addition to a mother and son dying in a car bomb designed for fathers, the worst thing that happens is in a car rescue yard when a hero co-worker is crushed in a junkyard car. Apparently, "Big Guns" is rather bloodless but has a large number of people for the melodrama of 1973. Only at the last minute our hero will let his shot down and the fictional morale of the eye for the eye remains intact. Tessari will culminate with a couple of honest car hunters, and the death of a don on the train that passes through the train tunnel is as bloody as the violent yarn. Photos and compositions are excellent.
