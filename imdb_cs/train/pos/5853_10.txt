I really liked this Summerslam due to the appearance of the arena, the curtains and just the overall view was somewhat interesting for me. Anyway, it could be one of the best Summerslam if WWF did not have Lex in the main event against Yokozuna, now it's time to be a huge fat team and a strong man, but I like times changed. It was a terrible major event, just like every match Luger is terrible. Next matches on the card were Razor Ramon and Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers vs. Heavenly Bodies, Shawn Michaels and Curt Hening. This was the case when Shawn named his big monster from Diesel bodyguard, IRS vs 1-2-3 Kid, Bret Hart first takes Doink and then Jerry Lawler and things with Harts and Lawler were always very interesting, then Ludvig Borga destroyed Marty Jannetty, Undertaker received Giant Gonzalez in another terrible match, smoking Gunns and Tatanka took Bam Bam Bigelow and Headshrinkers and Yokozuna defended the world title against Lex Luger. This match was boring and has a terrible ending. However, it deserves 8/10
