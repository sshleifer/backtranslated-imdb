This movie is terrible - in "so bad that it's a good" kind. <br /> <br /> The story is reevaluated from many other films of this kind that it will not bother to describe it. It is a sword / witch image, a child who hopes to realize how important it is in this world, has a "nomadic" adventurer, a wicked assistant / wizard, a princess, a hairy creature ... you get it. br /> <br /> The first time I shot this movie was during a very harsh winter. I do not know why I decided to continue watching the next five minutes before turning the channel, but when I grabbed a seat in Gulfax I decided to stay and look at it until the end. <br /> <br /> Gulfax is a white, hairy creature similar to Chewbacce, but not as useful or entertaining. It looks like someone stuck a bunch of white carpets and forced her to wear it. There are scenes where it seems that an actor can not move inside or is almost dropping. Though there is not so much in the movie, few scenes are worth it! Watch how he is trying to talk to Bo Svenson, while Solo-Chewbacca's comparison is even higher! <br /> <br /> Actually, I bought this movie just because of that character, and it's still somewhere! <br /> <br /> Gulfax can look like sh! t, but he shot this movie !!! The only reason I've never seen a sequel or even been looking for was because of his absence! Maybe it should be the final movie, completing the trilogy, Gulfax will make a lot of expected return!
