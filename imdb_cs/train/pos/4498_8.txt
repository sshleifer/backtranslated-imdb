Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen And Robson Green! Wow, what a trio ... Well, it's not Anna Karenina, but it's a good love story, very well written and well-performed by all. Even a few laughing moments mixed with some very serious observations about fidelity, age bias and aging of parents / Alzheimer's problems. <br /> <br /> Quirky music was added to the story. When I was a fan of Mrs. Annis from "Lillie" (in the 1970s) and Mr. Kitchen from "The Buccaneers" and "Enchanted April", I recently discovered Mr. Green ("I and Mrs. Jones", "Touching Evil", etc.). So I ask myself - why did not I recently see "Reckless"? Naturally more than "cat" than something a person will sit for is ideal for shiny afternoon lazy tours.
