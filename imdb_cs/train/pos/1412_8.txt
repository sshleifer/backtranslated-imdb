Why should you explore the charming natural document "Earth" on Earth? How much time do you have on earth to explain it to you? Well, we will not extend my reviews to "Earth" to infinity, but I have to stand up for why it's "must see". The documentary film organizes a natural round trip on the migratory trails of three animal families: the polar bear and her young with the real life of her daddy who take him to seek food on her isolated journey, the mummy mum with her baby whale with the whale migration tour for prey and elephant mom her small (maybe not so small, elephant) offspring migrating in Africa. Directors Alastair Forthegill & Mark Linfield have done "outside this country," which in addition to the magnetic shots of our three animal protagonists also captures the survival skills of many other species. The cinematographically trained team of Richard Brooks Burton, Mike Holding, Adam Ravetch, and Andrew Shillabeer were alive in the film shooting the miraculous natural habitat and animal behavior instinctively; unless we speak of the fact that the squalid animal prey was at n b e l a a a b e. "Earth" is also a teacher of the influence of global warming on animals; Pope Polar Bear in the dock is a poster of an animal boy on this effect. So fellow citizens, it's time to take a documentary cruise to visit "Earth" today! **** Good
