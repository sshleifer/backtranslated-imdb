Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) was just blown away by his wife because he is one of the most annoying, neurotic people in the world. Suicide is his way out, but he simply can not get to work, so he will head to his friends house. Oscar Madison (Walther Matthau) is also recently divorced and lives in the Bachelor sky. Smoking, playing gambling, hitting chickens, eating and never cleaning them is paradise for him. With attempts at suicide, Oscar decided to let Felix know. First it's a fight in the sky, Felix kuchaje and cleans and helps Oscar to pay for food in time, but early Oscar is going for women and Felix today's world would probably be gay) not ready to go on. They call out a few British birds and find Felix so tender that soon they and Felix cry and talk about their family life and leave the Oscar. That's him, he explodes and throws him out, but Felix is ​​not as helpless as it seems, and soon has his upper hand. My favorite quotation "You leave me small notes on the pillow and told you 158 times that I can not stand on the pillow." We're all from corn flakes. F.U. "It took me three hours to find out that F.U was Felix Ungar!" Based on Neil Simon (who also wrote the script), it has a certain theater atmosphere. Set up and excitement and the prospects feel quite playful (for better or worse). Lemmon and Mathau have excellent comedic hems and have appeared in Grumpier Old Men and Out to Sea films, which are repeated with the same finnish / slob role but with different names (to avoid problems with the rights, I'm sure). <br /> <This movie is like chocolate-dipped strawberries. Chocolate is smooth, sweet and rich, strawberry is cake, juicy and bright red (unless you have those nasty green ones). They are almost polar opposites, but together with the contrasts highlight and make a wonderful dessert. 7/10 <br /> <br /> http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
