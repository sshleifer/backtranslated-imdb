Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau started and finished their career together. You remember as the deadliest of old men as well as the most beautiful couple who ever laughed at us, and Lemmon and Matthau have been one of Hollywood's most beloved comedy teams over the past 100 years. Not like a "horror" like Pryor and Wilder, instead they were a classic comedy team that mirrored the more modern Marx Brothers routine. Such a physical comedy, as well as the mixed mixture of chaos that Marx, Chaplin and Keaton celebrated. In odd couple, Lemmon and Matthau play the full contrasts that create chaos. Physical comedy is as unique as Chaplins. The joke is usually worn because it is against crawling the joke to another. It's not your typical movie, it's a way of comedy with two old men who are against each other in favor of two young teenagers. The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is fun enough. Although this movie is not for everyone, it's a great comedy.
