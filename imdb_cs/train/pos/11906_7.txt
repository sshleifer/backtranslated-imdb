This documentary about Castle Schlockmeister William plays some nice shots in the naive 50's and 60's, in which his most characteristic work is to look at funny, stupid people with glasses - but it is also loving and lively, with a particularly clear commentary from John Waters, who was a target group for such things at that time, and the daughter of the castle who adored his father, and he was quite receptive to how he did his craft. (We will never know what happened to the other descendants of the castle.) The movies were not very good, it is clear, but his marketing was great and he seemed to be a sweet, hard-working family man. Fun people are still appearing, like Diane Baker's "Straight Jacket," which looks great, and Anne Helm, who was replaced by star Joan Crawford. Darryl Hickman, with all of them bursting to giggle when he remembered working with the "The Tingler", and there is enough scope to give us an idea of ​​the level of the castle's talent - not too high but very energetic. A nice view of the moment when the audience is easier to enjoy and makes it nostalgic for simpler movie days.
