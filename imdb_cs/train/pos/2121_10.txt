This is a beautiful movie that works great for all players. It will laugh at you and scream at you. The very end of the movie always blurred me. If you want to see a great movie, it's so. Jimmy Stewert delivers a gorgeously funny performance and Frank Morgan as Mr. Matuschek is magical. Morgan's character heterogeneity is not amazing. William Tracy as Pepi is an amazing comic relief and adds some of the most important films and performances. Felix Bressart brings a fantastic performance as Perovitch, the striker who is ambitious in life, is delighted with the ones he is working with. This is a simple story about how close co-workers can become and how two people who are very hostile to one another fall in love, although they are unusual.
