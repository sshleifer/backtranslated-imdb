Even if you do not know absolutely about Ireland, you have to love "My Left Foot" (and especially Danielle Day-Lewis performance in it). Christy Brown plays in polio. For this reason, he spent most of his life ostracized. Even if they try to point out something, they just laugh at him. The light in the darkness for him is that he has control over one part of his body: his left foot. He uses this thimble to paint and write poetry and brings them to importance. Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan shared very well on this collaboration and on later collaboration: "In the name of the Father" (but "Boxer" was useless). "My left foot" can make you feel many ways: sad, hopeful, or something else. But in any case, Daniel Day-Lewis did performances. A great movie in every sense.
