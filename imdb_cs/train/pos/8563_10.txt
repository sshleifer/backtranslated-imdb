The film, after the festivities of the novel "The Most Militant of the Earth" (could be translated as "The Most Popular among Humans"), written by Marin Pred (a highly controversial book and film), was a novel that became something like a Bible or a story about Hamlet very popular and difficult to access, due to its satirical content through the communist regime. It represents the drama of an intellectual man, humanist, in the "red" world. A movie full of passion, fear, sexuality, all the great ingredients for a great movie recipe. One of the biggest Romanian films despite his psychological accusation (after all, it is a European film).
