MY JU IS JULIA ROSS is a fascinating thriller from 1945 B by Joseph H. Lewis, probably one of the best directors of Hollywood's new films. This 65-minute Gothic peculiarity from Columbia Pictures came after a lengthy lecture by Lewis as a helper of a series of poor westerns, East Side Kids comedies, horror melodies (including incredibly bizarre Belo Lugosi's shocking INVISIBLE GHOST) and studio studio B (CO-ED Secret, BURMA bombers , FALCON IN SAN FRANCISCO, etc.), all of which set the scene rather well for what was to come from the extremely talented and imaginative Mr. Lewis. MY JULIA ROSS (as well as SHOW THE NIGHT from next year) introduced the director who mastered the rare and subtle art telling the dark and probing story quickly and efficiently on the smallest budgets. Later, Lewis' productions such as GUN CRAZY (1949) and THE BIG COMBO (1955), despite the widening scope of their narrative, continued to rely on complicated camera work and effective low key lighting. My name is JULIA ROSS probably owes more of the British secret tradition (it's set in studio-bound English) than it does to conventional movie noir and attitude. A young woman (Nina Foch) agrees to take a place in the home of a senior woman (Dame Mae Witty). Two days after arriving, she wakes up from a deep sleep in a completely strange house, and mysteriously enough, with a brand new identity - about the old woman's son. She said she was a victim of nerve failure, trying to grasp the complete and seemingly hopeless nature of her difficulty. But she will soon begin with this dark mystery that her "husband" (always dreadful George Macready) is likely to assassinate her true wife and that she is cheated to participate in a terrible and ominous plan. Much of what distinguishes this otherwise modest story is the indelible touch that Lewis brings into production and marks him as the first of his really serious efforts as a film director.
