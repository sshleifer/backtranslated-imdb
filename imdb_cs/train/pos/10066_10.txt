King of the Mask (Bian Lian in China) is a shocking and deeply moving film. Winning 16 awards from around the world, this film based on a true story focuses on Wang Bianlian, a street artist in the thirties of China who grows but has no heir to hand over his art-faced alter opera. He has a unique talent of fast-changing mask in performance and no one knows how he does it. He has the desire to long for his grandson because his art is a family heritage that can only be passed on to men. Then we go to the streets and see that people sell their children because they can not afford to take care of them. Some even ask to take their daughters for free because the daughters in this society have little power. The story of Wang Bianlian continues from there. The film was so surprisingly good, the acting was amazing and the problems were so hard and well solved. There is gender inequality and depressing the fact that nobody wants a girl at this time and place. It is also interesting to note that a well-known opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as a living Bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman, and while she is famous and respected, she is considered to be a little and a half woman. When it comes to the film, in the face of the issues of trafficking in human slaves and its demand, and thus the lack of possible solutions, the brutality and corruption of the army and the police and the helplessness and lack of power of any individual's face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions. It's definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life, and Xu Zhu, an actor starring Wang Bianlian, is another great performance.
