Old horrors are interesting, lots of screams, lots of screaming, and a lot of humor to get along with it. "Blob" is classic in his own work. Steve McQueen (1930-80) plays a teenager trying to be a hero in his city. Going on a date with a girl is typical of all teens. But when the old one discovers the same falling object from the sky, he eventually became a victim and Steve helps him to do his best. When it's too much to adolescence, this film really provides. I know most teens have trouble when they behave when there is danger, they have to learn to forget the past and start doing something good to save mankind. When the adults ended up in the city, they learned stubbornly that "The Blob" is running amok, having to learn to trust the teens and let their behavior get the best of them. The exhausting juggernaut was a rather cute day, and in my opinion it's JELL-O! When everyone comes in to stop the threat, the city is safe again thanks to the old good cooperation. Still Jello and I'm watching this movie all the time, if you do not like Jello, TOUGH! RATING 5 STARS
