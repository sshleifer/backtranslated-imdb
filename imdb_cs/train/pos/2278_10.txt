Mother of the Night is one of my favorite novels and I'll see this. I was expecting a great disappointment. Instead, I got a film that perfectly reflects the irony, humor, elevation and, above all, the grim mourning of the novel Vonneguta. This is definitely the best performance of Nolte. He captures defeat and selfloathing Howard Cambell Jr. consistently from the subtle intonation of his speech to the held tears behind his eyes. Alan Arkin is absolutely jolly like George Kraft. Sherryl Lee behaves in her separation from reality as Cambell's young lover. John Goodman is underestimated and more than effective as Cambell's "Blue Mother Fairy". This Pinnacle Cambell story, which tries to be his ideal hero and unwittingly becomes his ideal tragic villian, is a mature and lively look into what we are like people. Besides, it's one of the deepest romantic movies I've ever met. Cambell is the incarnation of a stupid and wise love. And in the movies, barely a painful conclusion, he finally learns what it means to be a real boy, because his Blue Fairy tale has his own wishes. And he realizes that ... well, look at the movie and you will see. Mother's night is undoubtedly in my mind one of the best movies he ever did. It is a beautiful poetic story that deeply catches our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author.
