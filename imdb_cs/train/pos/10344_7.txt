Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell collaborate on "The Amazing Mr. Williams," a 1939 secret / comedy that's pretty good though forgotten, probably due to the incredible films that came out in 1939. <br /> <br /> Douglas the gifted tale of a police detective, who married his work, plays while his girlfriend is waiting for a wedding that is constantly postponed. What happens in this movie is not an exception - it is called to the murder scene just as it is going to walk down the aisle. Both stars were great in the comedy, they worked well (and often) and helped make this battle for sex fun. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are at your fingertips for excellent support. <br /> <br /> As you can read in other reviews, Melvyn Douglas does not do a lot of women. <br /> <br /> Not long on the long side. One of the comments here was Melvyn Douglas, one of our greatest actors. Virtually effortlessly, he moved dozens of films as the second man and the best friend before getting into the movie as an old man. He was not lazy, but rather a very hard-working actor (who looked easier) who had a Broadway career with a film career. He was simply not occupied as a leading man in films or in very challenging tasks in the studio. I urge someone to see his devastating performances in "Hud" and "I have never mistaken for my father" and I called him lazy or referring to his smirk.
