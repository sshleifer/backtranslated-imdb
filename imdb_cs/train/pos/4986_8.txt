Lensman is a rather lesser known anime jewel from Too and MK studios.It is loosely based on the novel, but it reminds me more about the game "Metroid". If you want to see it, see it in Japanese with subtitles or just Japanese. The English dubbed version was almost cut and trimmed to death. There is nothing new, even though it's the first animated feature that combines CG graphics with a hand-drawn animation, but it's fun to watch.
