Home Room was a great movie if you ever had a drama in your life. Ensures you want to see more. You are wondering what lies behind the mystery of Alicia. I think I watched this film six times in a row and never lost interest. Besides, I usually do not cry over movies, but I always cry. I wish I could find more movies like this one. All in all, I thought it was a great movie. The more you look at it, the more you become part of it. The end is the part that really got me when she screamed when she got the diploma, because her daughter's name was on her. My heart felt as if it had just broken. And how her new friend came to comfort her when she did not get her yet. I loved it so much.
