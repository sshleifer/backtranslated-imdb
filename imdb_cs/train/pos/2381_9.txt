The "Classic War of the Worlds" by Timothy Hines is a very entertaining film, which, of course, comes with great efforts and lengths to faithfully restore the classic book by G. G. Wells. Mr. Hines will succeed in that. Me and those who looked at the film appreciated the fact that it is not a standard, predictable Hollywood fare that comes out every year, like Spielberg's version of Tom Cruise, which had only the slightest resemblance to the book. Apparently everyone is looking for different things in the movie. Those who pose as amateur "critics" are just trying to criticize everything they can. Others rate the film on more important bases like having fun, and most people never agree with "critics." We started from the efforts that Mr. Hines gave to the classic novel H.G. Wells and we found it very fun. This made it easy to overlook what "critics" perceive as their shortcomings.
