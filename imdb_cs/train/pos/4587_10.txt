Though Hard Boiled John Woo is my favorite movie number 1. But I have to say that police story is my favorite movie number 2. I say this because stunt games, combat action and my favorite part of the movie are when Jackie Chan jumps out of the dorm at the top of the escalator in the shop, grabbed a column surrounded by Chrismas lighting, and slid down the light over the light and finally land on his back on the hard marble floor. OUCH! Buy at amazon.com at 14:98. (Or something in $ 14.) VHS new home video lines. any questions or comments, do not hesitate to reply. (I'm only 14, but I know where you'll find some movie ever made.) If you're looking for a movie everywhere and can not find it, please answer me. Thank you and good night!
