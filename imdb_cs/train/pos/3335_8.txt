The film shocked me. I personally had a herd mostly bad buzz. Finally, after having owned the DVD for months, I moved him to sleepless nights. though the movies were drawn extra shots were used to the seriousness of his passion and his recovery from adding to the game would be less realistic if they missed some scenes. The best thing about the movie is that it's in harmony with the relationship. There are no exs popping up or characters threatening the relationship. I guess we typically see the girl meet with some amazing twist about the fate they're meeting something we've seen coming, breaking them, and then coming back together in the last five minutes of the movie. but this film did not keep this form. Actually, we have experienced a relationship, and these are mistakes, and although the characters have had moments of anti-love, they did not have dramatic pauses if they left and made assemblies every 15 years and then fell in love again. I did not feel that the film was as predictable as other romance. The story was a unique and true reality, as I felt that these people in the film are the most reliable of what I saw in a romantic film of modern times. And it did not hurt that all the baseball games were real and they were on the real world series, so fate kicked a bit. It's not "my good sir," but it's a lively and honest film. I just say I like it.
