Deathtrap is not whodunit. It is he who does it first. It's so hard to describe this movie without doing anything, so I will not mention the plot any more. As for acting, Crise Reeves has the biggest role as Clifford, a young song. You really see the extent of his acting skills in this movie from "exhaling cheesburgers" to absolutely scary. Clifford plays so hard, and at the production stage I've never seen Clifford play well at both ends of the spectrum. The actor plays like a little puppy or a murderous maniac. Reeves is the only person I've ever seen that has a character across the border. As for Michael Caine, it's ... well, it's Michael Caine. One of the best actors of the last 50 years and in this film as good as ever.
