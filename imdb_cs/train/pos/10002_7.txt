This is perhaps the most underestimated movie guest in the Brooks Cannon. Sure, his fault. It does not provide a realistic view of the homeless (as Citizen Kane gave a realistic view of the salon singers, or Titanic gave a realistic view of the Italians IDEOTY). Many jokes fall flat. Still, this movie is very nice, so many comedies are not, and telling it in the story of some of the most traditionally harassed members of society is really impressive. He's not Fisher's King, but his bullshit. My only complaint is that Brooks should place someone else in the lead (I love Mel as director and writer, not as much as management).
