This is one of my favorite family films. I loved it when I was small and still holding me with me when I was older. I still laughed at all the same old jokes and maybe even a tear. I never really cared for the animals to talk, or at least for the animated UN, but that I will hold. It's a pretty old movie, but it will always hold a place in my heart. There are no other live animal films that I could remember at a time when I could even compare them, much less like this. Maybe I'm going to give too much praise to this movie, but I do not think it would turn out. I really keep this great message that "Home is the heart." Or at least this is the message I got from her. Definitely recommended for a good old family movie night.
