Probably one of the most entertaining movies in the world. Oscar material. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are fun and before you see it, I suggest you see South Park one of the most fun cartoons. Buy it, you will laugh every time you see it. Pure genius. If you do not think it's funny then you have no soul or sense of humor. 10 out of 10.
