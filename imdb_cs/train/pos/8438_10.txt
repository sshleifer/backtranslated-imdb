HLOTS was an excellent series, what NYPD Blue will never be, HLOTS are real estate, dialogue is real, relations are real. With HLOTS back as a movie, bind all the free ends, it was good to have all the gangs together, even the couple that died to show up (as you will not say) The story was fast, emotional and full of spirit of the series had a week and a week. Murder, Life on the Streets, BEST Network !!!! 5 STARS !!!! Thumbs UP and everything. We thank NBC for not getting us at all!
