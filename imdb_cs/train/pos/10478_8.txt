<br /> <br /> This is definitely "must see" for those who occasionally smoke the refrigerator in their secret hiding place, trying to prevent them from being caught by parents, teachers, police, etc. The protagonist is a lady at her forty, living in her estate, orchid farming, and she did not know that her so-called rich and true husband actually broke and cheated. When he suddenly dies, he is confronted with the truth. An executive judge tells her she has a huge debt. She does not know what to do until her gardener tells her of the recent success of marijuana in Britain. She decides after a long thought of how to get rid of her flowers and start breeding pots instead ... The story is completely original, performing excellent! I can only think of a few movies that made me laugh more than this movie. Still, the melodramatic touch is present. The film is typical of British: jokes are not vulgar, it's no violence. It should not be mentioned that it is recommended that we take a few suggestions before looking at the "saving mercy". It will be much more fun! Especially the scene with the two old ladies in their tearoom is cheerful. I thought my jawbones would crack. 9/10
