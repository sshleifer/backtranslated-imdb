12-year-old Arnald Hillerman accidentally kills his older brother Eugen. His feelings are arrested by the fact that his family can not communicate with him (or he thinks this is not the right thing). His only refuge is his grandfather, who is the only one who seems to have sympathy with him. Realism will capture lovers of the film "Real 2-Life," but will not satisfy those who long for action and excitement.
