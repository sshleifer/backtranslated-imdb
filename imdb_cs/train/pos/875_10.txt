Well, what can I say that I just watched this fantastic movie when my nerves are still circling! Jacques Audiard, the director has a fairly good name in France, and that's right. Vince Cassel is not Tom Cruise, and Emmanuelle Devos is not Penelope Cruz, but these two are fantastic actors, and this is a tense and convincing thriller that begins slowly with some clever character building and then begins to draw strain on tension into a magnificent summit. Others wrote about the conspiracy, so I will not say that more than everyone in this movie plays their role in perfection, the director, the actors, the cameraman and everything seems so real, no silly weapon is playing, it becomes trusted, expressions, emotions, it's almost like you're there as a viewer. Make a favor, put a DVD, a bottle of wine, turn off the lights, unplug the phone from the hook and immerse yourself in this Hitchcock thriller :)
