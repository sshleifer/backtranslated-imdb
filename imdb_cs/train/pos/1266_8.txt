I have read several previous comments stating that this film is losing steam at the end of the film and that it has a similar end to Cape Fear. I totally disagree. I'll give a simple review for normal viewers out there. I thought casting was perfect. I thought this was one of Ed Harris's best performances. What a bad psychopath! I have a lot of respect for his acting after watching his performances in this film. During this film I was riveted. If you like mysterious thrillers, then it's definitely the movie you want to see. I also noticed the young Scarlett Johannson in this film. This movie is full of top stars and I highly recommend it!
