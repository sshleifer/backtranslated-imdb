All the dogs go to the sky is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The first time I saw it when I was 3. I'm 12 now and I hired it, thinking about things and bringing so many memories, that's been "days." I love music, I love when Charlie comes to heaven, I love the song "Let me surprise". I love what Charlie looks like and his voice, Bert Reynolds could play Charlie's voice just fine. I love this film, the first one is the best because it is so original and great. It really brings memories that no one can describe, not me. If I just returned to those days. I love characters. If so, as the memories return, when I imagine 12 how I feel when I'm about 19, I hope to be able to watch it when I'm older. When I first saw it, I never knew I was really looking at it and felt it, I hope it will be available. I'm so happy that this movie was made and a fantastic idea came to mind and heart. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give him the perfect 10. It's a wonderful movie. It's so hard to explain the feeling when I grow older and if I have children, I hope they can experience this feeling.
