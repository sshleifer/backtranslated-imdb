I do not know how and why this film has a bad rating on IMDb. This film, accompanied by "I'm curious: Blue," is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The only thing that you in this film slows down is when you do not like the film process, such as psychology or if you expect hardcore pornographic games. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie you want to watch to relax; it's a movie you want to see as any other masterpiece, time, attention and care. ****** SUMMARY MAY CONTAIN TWO OR SPOILER ******* <br /> <br /> The main thing about this movie is that it is a mixture of film in the film, but it makes it so that sometimes you forget that fiction is not real. <br /> The film is like many movies in one: <br /> <br /> 1. A political document about the social system in Sweden at the time. Which of them is still important to today's importance. Interviews for a young woman named Lena. <br /> <br /> The second story of the filmmaker Vilgot Sj√∂man, ... making the film deals with the relationship with their star in the film and how should never engage with the people they have to work. <br /> <br /> 3. The movie that Vilgot does. This is a young woman named Lena (IE # 2), which is young and very politically active, filming a documentary (IE # 1st). She is also age and her sexuality and freedom. The grandeur and the full gloss "I'm curious: Yellow / Blue" is how these three elements are connected. At one time you look at a conversation about politics and more watching what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes, but does it so well that sometimes you forget that it's a story. Another thing is the dynamics between "Yellow" and "Blue", which, if you see, you have to see the other. "Blue" is not a sequel at all. I will try to explain as best I can, because to my knowledge, no other films done so, although this is a great technique. Think of "Yellow" as a living thing about real events in the 14 scene. A complete story. Think of the "blue", like all the things between the 14 "Yellow" scenes you have not seen, that's a complete story about his own. <br /> <br /> Basically, they are parallel movies ... the same story that is narrated in two different ways. <br /> <br /> I did not see "Blue" until the first 30 minutes, Yellow "I hope it was useful for people who are deterred by different influences because this movie changed the way I looked at the movie. for your time.
