I lived at that time, and I think the program captured the heart of the time. I think it should deal with more African-American issues, but I think it's good for the program. It was scary to sit down and watch the riots on T V, hoping they would not go as far as your family home and not burn. I thought Jerry O'Connell did a great job of showing a vet returning from the war. I went to school with boys who came back. Some have changed more than others and some not so much. It hurts me when someone reminds me that the problem was not covered enough or was not fun enough. Go through it and then write. I thought the movie was great and everyone had a remarkable job. Thank you for your journey (sad and good) in memory.
