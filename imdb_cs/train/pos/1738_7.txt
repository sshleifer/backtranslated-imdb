It's a funny movie. Burt Reynolds is the NASCAR star who signs a sponsorship agreement with Chicken Pit Ned Beatty. The treaty has a different humiliating clause, such as forcing Burt to wear a chicken suit during a race! Jim Nabors is his (not entirely convincing) chief mechanic. Loni Anderson (oh, yeah!) Beatty is assigned to keep Reynolds honest and strictly following the treaty. It's a funny movie in which Burt proves he's not too proud. I like this!
