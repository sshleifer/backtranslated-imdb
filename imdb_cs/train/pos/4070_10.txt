I know Anime. I was in that long before it became a national phenomenon; I loved loving it before most people knew what Dragonball Z was. And just to know that I'm not talking about my, let me say this: Of all the animos I've seen, the Castle in Heaven is by far one of the best. Obviously, people say Spirited Away is the best, but I really do not agree. Most people know the movie because it's the Acedmy Award; it is not exaggerated - I showed Princess Mononoke and the Castle in Heaven to people who only saw Spirited Away and agree that these two are superior to three. Personally, I never thought anything could be compared to Princess Mononoke until I finally saw the Castle in Heaven. I still think he's better of them before, but the castle in heaven is as good on him; in many ways, the castle has the main elements that Mononoke missed. In any case, if you only saw Spirited Away and think it's Miyazaki's best movie, be prepared to let your country shudder.
