The star of this film is a screenplay. Attention to detail in seasons, language, social morals (women do not hurt) and politics are remarkable. It is today a reminder of Kosovo. Fine pieces in action scenes are for the attentive viewer, and the choreography of these action sequences is excellent. Perhaps this film approaches the bones of reality in order to gain the support it should receive. It is like a stair of growing violence with good pauses of peace and tranquility between every step. Great movie ....
