As part of the Royale casino celebration, this movie with the new Bond was played by Roger Michel (Notting Hill) in her performance. I almost turned it off because I was a little boring, but I'm glad I was with him. Essentially May (Anne Reid) is a single mother, Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones), who barely sees someone and has not had a boyfriend for years. Her daughter says she might want to marry a new friend, Darren (of course Daniel Craig). After only a few days, May and Darren have a secret affair. And at his age, with a 30-something, and a new Bond ?! Anyway, of course, they want to keep it secret, but my regrets and it depends on whether Helen learns. If he does, Darren has a little trouble than May. In fact, Helen asks her to hit her. Also play Peter Vaughan as Toots, Danira Govich as Au Pair, Harry Michell as Harry, Rosie Michell as Rosie, and Johnny English Oliver Ford Davies as Bruce. Very good!
