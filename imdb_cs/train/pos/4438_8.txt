Director Edward Montagne is doing a little more than an hour that other, more expensive and strongest movies can not do. Mr. Montagne will show us a police story written by Philip H. Reisman Jr., who, without being one of the best genres, keeps the viewer in what is happening. <br /> <br /> This is clearly a type B movie. In fact, the best thing is for a "tattooed stranger", and that's the opportunity to look at the way New York looked like at the time. Crystal clear cinematography by William O. Steiner has either been held this way over the years or has been lovingly restored. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the initial order, there are wonderful views of New York. Later, we take us to Brooklyn to the Dumbo sections and later the film travels to the Bronx and Gun Hill Road area with many sightseeing shops in the area. John Miles and Walter Kinsella made a great detective team. Patricia Barry is the perfect plant specialist in the Museum of Natural Sciences. Jack Lord, who has gone to bigger things in his career, is seen in an uncanny role. It was great to watch the city as it was because it no longer exists.
