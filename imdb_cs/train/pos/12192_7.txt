In 1947 he made the film Orson Welles (with a polite Irish accent) and Rita Hayworth's beautiful star with less attractive short blonde hair. So I hung with Orson before in Touch of Evil and Citizen Kane and Third Man etc. But it was my first interaction Rita Hayworth. Our first appointment went well, it did a great job when playing a terrified Else, marrying a crippled millionaire lawyer. Mike (Welles) and Elsa fall to each other. She wants to run away with her, she does not know if she can live without the money they can buy. Elsa, her husband and his partners got caught and tried, like the sharks that Mike describes as attacking each other, and his predictions seem too truthful. Several twists and turns follow in this murderous secret when we come to culminate in a fun house. (Think about ending the shootout in a Golden Gun Man who hardly borrowed from this scene). I do not know who the killer was up to. This film is like prawns in garlic and lemon. The dishes are laid out at sea, they are soft, sour and pungent, all have a great effect. You do not have to be the best, fresh shrimps, but the quality frozen shrimp from Costco. Tasty sauce contributes to the nature of pink shrimps when you fill a healthy but full alternative to a more common, regular tariff. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
