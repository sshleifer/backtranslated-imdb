"Honorable Men" - a true story of a proud and persistent black naval diver (the wonderful Cuba Gooding Jr.) is definitely a great movie that touches and entertains and is part of the absolute cream of the new millennium. Stunning acting is the main reason why this movie is something really special and quite a pleasant, wonderful experience. Charismatic Robert De Niro is amazing as the brutal, wild and ruthless boss Billy Sunday - the role is practically written for him. This film, along with the fantastic "15 Minutes" (2001), is the two most recent proof that he is still one of the best actors of our time. On the other hand, "Honorable Men" include excellent performance from Cuba Gooding Jr., one of the most promising young black actors from Boyz n the Hood. "Honorable Men" goes directly to "Jerry Maguire," "That's Good," and "Instinct". Kuba Gooding Jr. is a skilled and fantastic actor and I'm ready to get lots of other amazing movies from him. "Honorable Men" also has a great storyline and probably the most interesting sequence of film in the history of the film. It's a great, fascinating film and I can recommend it only.
