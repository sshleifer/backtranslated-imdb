I found unforgettable quotes for video clips; I forgot about one of my favorites ... <br /> <br /> Old person 1: You know, I remember that for the first time they played the thing. <br /> <br /> Old person 2: Remember pterodactyls. <br /> <br /> Old person 1: And I remember that you fell on it, hung up a line and a plate. <br /> <br /> Old person 2: Oh, no. <br /> <br /> Old lady: You did it. You put a big bucket on your head, and with them you went out with army boys to fight the Martians. <br /> <br /> Old person 2: Are not you still dead?
