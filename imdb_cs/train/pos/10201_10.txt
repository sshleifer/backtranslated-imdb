It's a very good movie, not only for Lady Death comic fans, but also for those who like animated movies / series of adventures and fantasy. The film is about an innocent girl to kill for something she has not done but for the daughter of the ruler of hell, Lucifer. <br /> <br /> Then try to avenge ... and the rest you see better from the movie. <br /> <br /> I like a lot of movies, the characters are like original comics, they make Chaos. I have never had a chance to read the first part of a story in a comic strip, just the last one in the passages in the movie, so I can not tell if the events are just like comics, but ... one way or another is the story of Lady Death!
