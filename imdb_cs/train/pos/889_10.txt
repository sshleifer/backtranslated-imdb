It is one of the best films in Hong Kong (action) and has a tense and exciting story as well as great fighting scenes. This Sammo movie has everything, Romance, Drama, Excitement and a great hero as well. It's the only film about martial arts that caught me rather than just waiting for matches. Sammo fans - it must be seen (See also Eastern Condors, Shanghai Express (Yuen Biao's Ace!), Dragons Forever and Enter the Fat Dragon.
