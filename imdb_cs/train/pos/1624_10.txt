The Old Pond is more a tribute to African-American animators from the 1930s than any harassment of the whole race (regardless of the cartoon by Stepina Fetchita). In addition to the ones I have just mentioned, there are frogs or fish versions of Cab Calloway, Fats Waller, Joesphine Baker, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson and Louis Armstrong. This Happy Harmonies cartoon by Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising is a very fun musical with perfect characterizations all around. Everyone sounds the same as the real thing that half of us think they might be. If not, they are definitely very flattering pretensions. Even the lazy, limitless characterization of Fetchit gets an exciting exercise here when a tiger chasing him like "Hold That Tiger" plays the score. Highly recommended for fans of animation and jazz from the 1930s.
