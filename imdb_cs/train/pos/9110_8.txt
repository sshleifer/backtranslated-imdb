You know? Our spirit is based on the revolution, it sleeps ... I can explain it, I think! Well ... As long as it does not happen on April 25, 1974, our freedom was limited, we did not have the freedom to speak, but when we got it in the revolution, it seems that the Portuguese people lost their opinion, we do not use our freedom of speech! That's all the consequence of the revolution! I think it's clear! ... About the movie ... I think he has a few mistakes in playing a character, but I think I'm looking pretty good on Portuguese films! I love it very much!
