I just read the main comment on this movie, which is on the first page with the results of the poll and cast. <br /> <br /> Why some people can not make a film about what this film should be a light heart, tone on the face, family comedy, things that make babies laugh and things for adults, and that is exactly what this movie does. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> So all movie makers stop trying to sound like film students and knock each movie because it's not a "Taxi Driver" or "The Godfather" and takes movies for what they are supposed to be , fun !!
