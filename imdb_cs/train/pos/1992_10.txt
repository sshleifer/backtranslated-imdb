I'm really old, I'm in the middle of watching this 40 year old movie and I wonder what my grandchildren will be watching for 40 years, its old sayings, but they do not have it anymore .. it's not just a story, its music, it's both young and so old ... actor seems to have been born to play their roles, young olives, old Fagin ... for many, the role played by the oliver judge is standing before, I have seen in other roles over the years .. Ingenuous dodger, Ron moody like Fagin, Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, the film not only won 5 Oscars but also took a few golden world awards .. if you decide to see this movie .. do a favor, do a couple, if not all children to see this masterpiece
