CitizenX (1995) is the answer of the developing world to the Silence of the Lambs. Where "Silence" terrified our peace, "Citizen" exhausts us and sadens us. This dramatization of the Chikatilo case translates rather well, thanks to the Western friendship between two Rostov police officers who become equal. CitizenX can also argue against (!) The death penalty far better than Kevin Spacey's David Gayle (2002). <br /> <br /> People are Machiavellian mammals underlying the limbic brains (lizard-logic). Why did the two children who knew better killed the toddlers they had kidnapped? Why are bloodthirsty women shouting "li-lilililililii" on the acts of terrorism OBSCENE? My own term for this is "limb domination", the lizard-logical desire to control the "enemy." If you have words in the "enemy" / "avenging" dictionary, you can easily control "limb domination". During the Second World War, the devastated Rostov (lying at the mouth of the Don near the Black Sea), did nothing to suppress Andre Chikatil's urge to "limb domination" by winning over the layers of civilization. Simple victims of Chikatila (Jeffrey DeMunn) were poor, usually children, who were on an interstate train because they could not afford anything else. CitizenX reminds us that denying the shocking Soviet bureaucracy cost 52 such lambs. Rostov's serial killer stopped after nearly seven years after the election and the police arrested him and left to go. Politization of the fight against crime is harmful to every police force. Although the police usually suffer from corruption around the world, in the west, political political politicians may get into chronic rivalries between authorities and prevent a more coordinated response to crimes. In the CitizenX Soviet Union, however, the murder of Viktor Burak (Stephen Rea) is suffering from repressive bureaucracy. Geoffrey DeMunn plays psychosexually deficient Chikatilo with flawless, but underestimated authority - a point completely unknown. Also in real life, Chikatilo had experience in life that mingled and avoided capturing. His pursuer, on the other hand, appears as a strange bird, which is caused by endless, naive explosions. Perhaps Stephen Rea's proposal is very strange as a forensic boss of Burakov. Rea's Russian accent is impenetrable; and his Burakov is humorous and confused, contrary to all. So it's Donald Sutherland who leaves with the picture. Sutherland's Fetis, Burakov's boss, and initially his only supporter is a very reticent, patient Militiaman, whose dignified carriage is evidence of a decade of bureaucratic machinations. His awakening as a logically driven and yet passionate cop becomes the ideal of the cornerstone of the film. Joss Ackland makes another twist as a bad apparatus, the secretary of Communist ideology Bondarchuk, overseeing the investigation. Naturally, he abolished the arrest of the most likely suspect, the Communist, in 1984 the man who carried the rope and the knife in a bag, reportedly returned home: Andrej Chikatilo. He soon replaced Burak's next Moscow apparatus, Detective Gorbunov (John Wood), who insists that the investigation now focuses on "known gay men." The craziest scene of this sad, sad movie comes during the institutionalized harassment of Bondarchuk and Gorbunov: a silly policeman firmly reports: "As I thought comrade, it was fornication. I made some drawings," the silence of laughter. the body began to accumulate, the police finally tried to enforce the criminal profiles in 1987. The only cooperating Soviet psychiatrist was Dr. Max Von Sydow, who named UNSUB 'CitizenX', later commending Fetisov and Burakov that "... together <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Although Chikatilo is still going through railway stations, police plans are about to go In 1990, Col. Fetisov was urgently promoted to the general, and his nemesis Bondarchuk disappeared from the scene and allowed investigations to finally proceed without political interference. Employees, communication, publicity - all of a sudden they were all available. During a single night telephoning, Fetisov got into the FBI's chief police department in Quantico, where he appeared that the staff routinely roamed from a series of killings to prevent such psychological damage to the investigators. /> <br /> Fetisov advises a newly-assisted forensic boss, now 'Colonel' Burakov, of all these changes in the avalanche of confessions that will become a movie's powerful scene. Fetisov is the most apologetic apology I've ever seen in the movie, "I offer you the most profound excuse to you and your wife, I hope you can forsake my ignorance someday," he almost whispers. HBO Production, CitizenX is the highest quality film. Not only do the exteriors look authentic with bleakness (filmed exclusively in the most dilapidated parts of otherwise magnificent Budapest), but the rising soundtrack of Randy Edelman is totally stunning - and it's often our only departure from grim brutality. Those who speak Hungarian will recognize many Hungarian accents and credits. Chikatilo real killings are depicted as a bleak aberrant behavior that was born out of character and ignorance in the same world. For this reason, it seems that the murders are not completely out of place, but of course they were. As President Kennedy reminded us, "We all appreciate the future of our children." CitizenX perfectly tells that killing is far more menacing and ambiguous than it could be imagination. Serious rape raped; serial killers kill to control. Likewise, some soldiers. Such "limb dynasties" make poor people. <br /> <br /> WARNING-SPOILER: ----------------------------- --------- --------- The real Andrej Chikatilo was the world's best-known serial killer. Condemned, he was executed in 1992 in all Soviet death sentences: one shot at the back of the head. Foolishly, such methods destroy any possibility of studying deviant brain after death. Conclusion: ------------------------- ----------------------- ------------ The best result is always to prevent killing, not prosecution. Performances only guarantee that the company is not aware of the complexity of the death of the victims, as we also broadcast unofficial evidence of how they died. Neither the killers will learn regret if they are dead. Vengeance does not kill the victims. Baying for the murderous blood is nothing better than an anti-sponsorship - once it's too late. <br /> <br /> Avenging the name of sadness is not justice for the deceased - it is the calming of the living. / 10)
