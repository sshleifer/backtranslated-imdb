For anyone looking for a traditional superhero movie, it can be an unpleasant surprise. It's definitely more drama than an action movie. It focuses mainly on emotions and it's a bit like a Greek tragedy - whatever the main character always goes wrong. <br /> <br /> That's because Sasha, like any superhero, takes the law into his hands and society does not appreciate it. Sasha becomes a plotter. While riding, she meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so things get complicated for him. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the plot itself is really dramatic, but the film lacks dynamism. It reminds me a little of the narrative in the recent films Ram Gopal Varma. Everything is happening very slowly. However, when the action scene is so dynamic that before you realize what's going on, it's over. But the director does not want to make us an imaginative and spectacular experience. Important is the result of Sasha's actions, which are mostly drastic. The score is very rare, which also makes it harder to focus on the film. So you really have to be very patient to see it. <br /> <br /> It's a movie for it? It is really hard to answer. I do not think this experience has enriched me so much, but in some ways I was still thinking about this film and I felt how to watch it again. Mostly because of the atmosphere that is really dense, but not suffocating, because all the time Sasha and Katya have hope. After all, they are young people who live all their lives. So no matter how hard it gets, it's always a little joyous melody when they're together.
