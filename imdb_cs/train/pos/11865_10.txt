I heard a couple of friends saying "Scarface is upset ... some idiot was trying to make another godfather in the early 1980's." Now I usually listen to idiots / watching CNN, so I decided to keep on going. Then my colleague handed me the DVD and said, "This is the # 1 with pelicanges," I confused I tried. This is the best movie. It is much more realistic than all the crap about racing stolen cars that are too expensive for anyone in this area to afford (* cough2Fast2Furiouscough *). But there is some humor ... that's Pelicangs and lights 80s music. Still, what is better than Al Pacino to control m203? I'm giving this ***** of ****, ideal for fans of Al or GTA: Vice City.
