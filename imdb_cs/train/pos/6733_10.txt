There have been many recent surfing movies that seem to happen to me accidentally without warning. This week, this digital cable covered this treasure and it was a pleasant surprise! Emphasis is placed on Greg Noll's big-wave surf pioneers to date Laird Hamilton, from Waimea Bay to Mavericks to Jaws. Damn, I could watch the film just about Laird Hamilton - one of the best sportsmen of this generation - so the rest is just a sauce. There is plenty of good surfing mixed with interviews of past and current surf stars, in a relaxed, relaxed and relaxed way. Of all the surfing movies I've seen is the best story about big waves and I think it's my favorite. Enjoy!
