This is just one example of the absolute gene Gene Wilder. He wrote and played in this amazing secret. No one would do it better. The tension was tangible. I wish Mr Wilder gave us another one. I liked everything I've ever seen with Mr. Wilder, but I did not know how really talented he was until I saw "Murder in a Small City" and this sequel. He did really carefully grasp what audiences want, how to add them in their writing and, of course, in his great acting. His gentle joke comes to his feet. I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in the secret or film work of Gene Wilder. His star becomes brighter and brighter.
