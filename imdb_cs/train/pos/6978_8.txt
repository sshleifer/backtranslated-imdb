Well I have to say that I expected it to come. I'm not trying to spoil it, and quite a few people are really talking about the pilot. On the other hand, I'm not sure I understand the harassmen who claim to be BSG fans and not as a pilot. What were the fraks expected ?! The background is set 50 years before we BSG, we have help with the birth of the Cylons, we see the life of the Adama family (we already knew about it from BSG), we get a deeper explanation of the Caprican population and its perception of other colonies and potentially the origin of God's human the unique beliefs of God's Cylons. <br /> <br /> I do not expect it to have the same depth of special effect or space opera as in the previous series, I make the difference between the two, even though I know that Caprica strengthens the BSG. <br /> <br /> This is a promising 1h30, I also believe it will put pressure on the scenario to be as good as BSG. I expect much of the following, but I have no reason to doubt that we will learn much more. <br /> <br /> Watching the squeezed DVD scene also gives more material to chew your brain. <br /> <br /> We are looking forward to January 2010
