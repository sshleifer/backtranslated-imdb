This is the classic action scenario of the 1980s that represents Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. Based in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything, including television networks. One of their favorite TV shows is "The Running Man," where criminals are convicted of hunting and killing for millions of fun. It is set up as a game show where viewers vote for their favorite "stalkers", trained murderers who hunt and kill unfortunate "contestants." Audience members also receive prizes that accurately predict who will kill someone. And the host plays no one other than Richard Dawson of Family Feud, who is in his game show such that he is suitable for this role. When Ben Richards (Arnold) is falsely accused of mass murder, he is forced to play this sadistic play. This movie is full of classic Arnold's unicorns, like his famous "I Come Back" just before entering the arena. And mocking a stalker armed with a flame-thrower, "What about the light?" I could go on, but I do not want to spoil the movie. It is funny! <br /> <br /> Whether it was intended or not, this movie serves as a great parody of today's "Reality TV" madness. There are already numerous programs that show that people suffer from pain and humiliation for the entertainment of viewers, and even court cases are broadcast for their "entertainment value." Running man demonstrates what happens when reality TV touches the rock bottom and it's a terrifying image. One can only hope that the nets have a common sense so that it is not that far. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a fun movie and I highly recommend it. 9 out of 10!
