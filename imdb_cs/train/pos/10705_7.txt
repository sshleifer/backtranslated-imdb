The trailer for this film did not make the film fair. And while the film did not know what she really wanted to get, the first part of the film was light romance and the other had a more serious romantic drama, the overall impact was much better than I thought it would be. This movie was more of a movie, but the trailer came into a bigger thriller that never showed up. Kidman, who is one of my favorites, is of course interested, but this film has turned out to be a light, sensitive, somewhat unpredictable film that deserved better. Three of the four stars. 9/5/02.
