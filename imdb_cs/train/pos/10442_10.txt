This is really one of the best movies about love I've ever seen. We are not following anything other than "Before Sunset," which is not a different film because it is about the same two people and the same romantic. This is "love" in the real world. OK, that's only when most people are as intelligent and eloquent as filmmakers. When reading other reviews, I like to know how many people are crazy even through dialogue films. And that's what he's doing so well before Sunrise. Dialogue is perfect. It's so real, fun and fun. It's hard to surprise Jesse and Celine to fall in love because you fell in love with them at the same time. My favorite scene is the one in the cafe where they pretend that their best friends are calling, others pretend to be the best buddies. It's perfect. It brings you back to the moment you fell in love for the first time in your life. <br /> <br /> I have to say, if you have a choice, look at "Before Sunrise" before you look at "Before Sunset". If you, like me, first saw "Sunset," it's hard to get rid of a feeling of compassion and sadness for two young mistresses throughout the show. And again the biggest romantic film in my book. Amazing acting, excellent scenario and beautiful locations. Young love is the best.
