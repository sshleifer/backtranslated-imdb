On October 24, 1955, Hadley Oil Company Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) meets executive secretary Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall) at her boss Bill Ryan's office in New York and invites her to go to a conference with an alcoholic playboy and the son of a tycoon Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). On the way to the meeting, he admits that they traveled from Houston to New York City to meet Kyle's unscrupulous childhood friend, eating a sandwich from Club 21, and the meeting was a mere excuse for Kyle's father, Jasper Hadley (Robert Keith). Mitch and Kyle immediately fall in love with Lucy, and Kyle uses her money to make an impression of Lucy; then she opens her heart and suggests Lucy. They marry and travel to Acapulco, and Kyle's uncertain Kyle stops drinking. Meanwhile, Kyle's sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) is an easy woman and Mitch has an unjustified mood that sees her as a sister. A year later, Kyle finds out he has a problem and can be sterile and starts drinking again. Mary's jealous poison Kyle says his wife and Mitch have a love affair. When Lucy finds she is pregnant, Kyle believes that the baby belongs to Mitch, and his distrust leads to tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Written on the Wind" is an overrated melodramatic soap opera with artificial characters and situations. There are at least two great movies with characters with a drinking problem: "Lost Weekend" (1945) with stunning performance Ray Milland and "Days of Wine and Roses" (1962) with the amazing performance of Jack Lemmon. Robert Stack has reasonable performance and his drinking attitudes are shallow and clich√©. Finally, the forgotten "windy" font is fun and is never nominated for an Oscar. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Palavras ao Vento" ("Words in the Wind")
