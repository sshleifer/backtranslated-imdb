In a poor village in Mexico, Colonel (Fernando Lujan) lives with his astral wife Lola (Marisa Paredes) in an old house. Lola still mourns the death of his son Augustine some time ago. The colonel expects his retirement fighter in the war against the Catholic Church for almost twenty-seven years. For political reasons, however, the current government wants to forget about this old struggle. Without property or money, but a valuable swing, they fight for survival with the expectation of a confirmation letter from the government, recognizing the law and paying for the late retirement. This slow and moving film reflects the social and financial situation of most older retirees in Third World countries. In Brazil, most retirees have to survive for about $ 80 per month. Colonel's debts in the story were paid for a cemetery for his son, otherwise he would be buried poor. Excellent cast performance, in a very sad story that is a reality in poor countries. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): (`NÃ£o se Escreve ao Coronel ') (Do not describe Colonel) <br /> <br />
