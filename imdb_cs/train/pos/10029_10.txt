Why people scare this movie and not about horrible movies such as The Godfather. Titanic is the largest film of the 21st century. Thanks to great acting, direction, effects, music and everything else. This movie is always thrown out by everyone because one day someone said they did not like it so most of the world decided to agree. There's nothing wrong with this movie. All I can say is that this film is not only the most heavily prized Oscar of all time, the most money he has ever made and sadly one of the most underestimated films I've ever seen. Besides, it's really the best movie of all time. The only films that are similar to all star wars and Lord of the Rings trilogies or anything else from Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton. These are all good movies and directors, but none can be compared to James Cameron's TITANIC Master.
