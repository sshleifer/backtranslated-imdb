Watching David and Bathsheba is a much better way to get your lesson from the Bible that it goes to Sunday school. Despite the script, which is sometimes inadvertently entertaining, the film is very entertaining. The studio system had its mistakes, but it saved no costs when rich production was demanded. Peck portrays King David as a lusty but hideous poet who committed what is equal to Sexy Bathsheba's Susan Hayward's bed murder. Raymond Massey as the Prophet Nathan delivers his usual, thrilling and wild power. Look at the silent screen of Francis X. Bushman as king Saul and young Gwen Verdon as a dancer. Hooray for the Old Testament and Hollywood.
