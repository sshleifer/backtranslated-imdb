When I first saw the movie, it was long ago on VHS-Video. I liked the movie because it was fun and exciting. A few years ago I saw another movie titled: * Andy Colby's incredible adventure * In this movie, Wizards of the lost kingdom * were used. They call this movie "KOR the conquerer". I started looking for "KOR" -Movie for many years because I wanted to see the complete film, not just the parts that were used in Andy Colby * -Movie. No shop had this Kor-film to rent, and no business knew about the film. For many years I watched my old VHS tapes I had at home and wonder ... I had this film for many years at home, but the film had a different title because in Germany it has 3 or 4 titles. So I was happy to find this cassette at home, and this time I had a lot more time to watch KOR the Conqueror again. Music is great during a hole, but the best part of shooting in combination with music is just this moment when KOR goes drunk in the green. Music in the background had some magic. I like Bo Svenson and also the boy who played Simon in the movie. They both did their job very well. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, 26.10.2004. Thanks all for reading my comment.
