This is a very moving film. I do not care what people say about this movie, it's a very good movie. Introducing the role of Amitabh Bachchan's dying father is great because he wants to teach his son how to manage his life in case something happens to him and Akshay Kumer was great in his role as the spoiled Aditya Thakur. Supporting role Shefali Shety, who played the role of Sumitra Thakura, was magnificent. Priyanka Chopra was good in her little role she had in the movie. Ragpal Yadav as a brain-dead servant and Boman Irani as a devoted father have a very good connection and the comedy scene is cheerful. Direction is very good.
