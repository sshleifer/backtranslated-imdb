Several years before, the Navy held the distance studied from "Honorable Men", a film based on the experience of the first black master of a major diver who tried to overcome violent racism. We are eager to support films that show that our navy has the best U.S.S. Nimitz and two helicopter carriers supporting coastal facilities have been provided to complement this stunning story of a young naval battle with uncontrollable rage. Some film was shot on board U.S.S. Belleau Wood. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher wrote the screenplay for Denzel Washington's debut, starring as Fisher's navy psychiatrist, effectively and deeply starring Derek Luke. <br /> <br /> Fisher is an obviously classified person assigned to the USS Belleau Wood (LHA-3), the front helicopter attack platform. Fisher can not seem to be able to drop his own attacks on the minimum provocation from his colleague. Referred to MD as part of a possible pre-separation trial, Fisher slowly opens the black psychiatrist and reveals the terrible childhood of great neglect and agonizing brutality. The story evolves as Fishero cautiously, but he is increasingly trusted by his doctor and is getting the courage to watch the love affair, a soldier called Cheryl, played by the stunningly beautiful Joy Bryant. Fisher reluctantly addresses his doctor by asking long-standing questions, but soon he realizes he has to look for answers, whether it's painful to grow up and diverge from conflicting, devastating behavior. While all the main characters are black, this story goes beyond race, while unshakenly showing the evil of lush religiosity and at the same time hypocrisy in the foster family environment. Viola Davis, the ubiquitous actress seen in a number of recent films, is a picture of a grumpy immorality, but it is nothing compared to a mother fist, Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson) who, in short but delightful scenes, will win Oscar for brutal brutality. <br /> <br /> Movies about the interaction between the patient and the therapist follow some predictability (everything about transmission and contraception), but Fisher and his doctor / mentor are serious about it. It's a good story, well said. Period. <br /> <br /> While in Navy, "Antwone Fisher" is in no sense a service story like "Honorable Men," an excellent movie that dealt with crushing racism against a real person. This is not really a film about blacks. It is a survival of horrible childhood experiences and, as Fisher says, can show in adulthood that the victim is still "standing high". The pursuers are diminishing in size and importance, for a brave and powerful young man claims to have a right to a decent life with the help of a doctor. My only question is that Washington is the Lieutenant Commander, but he is the commander. With all the marinas in the final loans, one had to tell the director of Washington that his character, like all the naval officers under the rank of commander, was designated as "lady." It's not a big critic, is it? :) <br /> <br /> I do not know why this movie plays in a few theaters. It deserves a wide distribution. Derek Luke can get an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> 8/10. <br /> <br />
