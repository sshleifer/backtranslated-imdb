This film captures the essence of growing up in small America for a young girl herself. Realism and subtle nuances, offered by Ashley Judd's, Ruby, stories, capture what can only be described as the real environment in Florida's panhandle. From the door of the screen door to the lack of work, echoes of what life is on the "red-necked riviera" gives the girl a rough choice. Paradaj was not easy. But slowly overcomes obstacles and deceit, and learns to be her own woman with the force flowing from inside. Ashley Judd's winning smile and infectious walking radiate warmth and command and admiration. The careful pace of character development resembles "Ulee's Gold" in 1997, starring Peter Fonda and also director Victor Nunez.
