When I walked through the TV Guide and found the movie section "Twisted Desire", I read her description. Three words caught my eye "Melissa Joan Hart" ... I found my role in "Sabrina: Teenage Witch" absolutely nasty, I hate such programs, so I just thought it would be a dull old love story ... I knew it. Eventually he started on TV, I had a bucket ready if I had to go over his cheese or soppiness, you know what I mean. At first you think she is just a pretty, ordinary girl who is in love but has parents. Then you find that she was manipulating her friend, killing her parents to be with her true love, you are like "Whoa". For such an actress, you just do not expect such a role. She played very well my role in my opinion, I never expected she to act like a bitch, and voila, she did it perfectly! I congratulate her, the movie was very good, I would definitely watch it again and recommend it to others.
