Comedy jewel. She laughed a lot, the scene of shops and pubs hurt me - she laughs uncontrollably. The characters are recognizable and the dialogue is well observed - I know they like it! Humor is surprisingly gentle and the movie (it may sound strange) reminds me of Ealing's comedy. It's a special film with lots of detail. Certainly, it requires several insights. I followed it a couple of times (I showed all my friends!) And I noticed something new - a little dialogue, something visual, which I had not caught before. I would like to be really picky and find some shortcomings in the film, but I'm not going, because overall it's a great fun movie that really fits for an hour and everyone has a sense of humor. It's a movie that finds my friends and I hope there's plenty there. Oh ... and he has a great soundtrack.
