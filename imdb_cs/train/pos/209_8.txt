Walter Matthau and George Burns work just fine. Willy's acidity with a confused amnesic Al is a mixture of heaven. The scene when they meet again in Willy's apartment is a gem and the last scene with the perfect film is filmed. Walter Matthau gives a great performance as a comic, boasting the fact that he only succeeded in eliminating intonation in the voice, and an exaggerated playwright, along with his general misunderstanding of what is happening, is a great characterization. George Burns's timing is legendary and nowhere better than in this movie, his quiet idea with desert dry answers is unforgettable. Watch the scene near the end when Al and his daughter ask for something from the Spanish administrator and Al's reaction - invaluable.
