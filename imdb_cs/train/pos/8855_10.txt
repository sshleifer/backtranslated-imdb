Sydney Lumet, despite being one of the oldest active directors, is still playing! A few years ago he made "Find Me Guilty", proof for everyone that Vin Diesel can really act if he gets the opportunity and the right director. If he had gone after this film (a true masterpiece in his eyes), no one could blame him. But he's still strong, his next movie has already announced for 2009. But let's stay with this movie here. The cast list is incredible, their performance is top-notch. The little nuances in their performance, the "real" dialogue and / or the situations that are developing throughout the movie are just amazing. (Time) structure of the film that keeps your fingers all the time, smooth mixing of time lines, that editing seems natural / flawless. The story is amplified, although in a "normal" time structure it would be at least a good movie (Drama / Thriller). I can only recommend a lot, the rest is up to you! :O)
