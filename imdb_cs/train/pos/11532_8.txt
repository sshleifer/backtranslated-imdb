Well, this was one of the films I captured at an extraordinary chance, and it was good enough for me to notice when it comes next ... If you enjoy more than eighty years of horror that is a little bit different from the norm ( ie not just another wrinkle of generic sequel), then I think you could enjoy it. When the evil person finally appears personally, it was definitely not what I expected! Overall, I would not miss this, but if you like this genre, then look at it if it comes and you have an hour and a half to kill. It could be 6.5 out of 10.
