This film ran around the original Dolemite. It had everything that makes the movie great ... except for real actors. (Ernie Hudson could not do it yourself and you know it! LOL) I confess that I killed my first videotape from this movie and I plan to buy the DVD version as soon as possible! This movie has so many catchy lines, it's sorry! I'm concerned that I know the theme song back and forth! I love the character of Jimmy Lynch to death and should win the Best Actor Award in Blaxploitation, but Oskar was never ready for it! This is a random film consisting of twisted policemen, breasts, chases, bad edits and, of course, martial arts. (It's the 1970s and I can say that everyone knows some martial arts). I think this movie should be restored and show one night in the middle of a marathon in local theaters!
