This film captures the absurd nature of a promising American patriot actor - who believes his work (and politics) is as crucial to the American people as the president's own views. Alan Bates captures this way of thinking perfectly like Michael Baytes, and I remember immortally Bates as a character. This is a movie for both Canadians and Americans. It is a valuable cinematographic film that is able to take its audience through the magic of filming and reveal how easy it is for a producer and director to lose complete control of the actor's will and innumerable external forces. The beautifully "Hollywood North" does not suffer from the subject that shows: Peter O'Brian directs with precision and complete control and commissions both the serious "backstage" part of the film and the film "The Flight to Bogota" movie with clarity and insight. you are interested in the joke and strength of Canadian film, "Hollywood North" is a great place to start.
