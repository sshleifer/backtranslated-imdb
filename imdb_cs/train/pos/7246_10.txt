This movie is totally ridiculous. It's not just a conspiracy, but acting is terrible. Special effects are asinin and the whole film is placed in the post-apocalyptic desert. Yet it is by far the most amazing film ever granted. It's 101 minutes of laughter because we all know that there will be no fuel in 3000 or in any other El Camino. There are other aspects that will not spoil just because movies are so sadly sad. I highly recommend this film just because of its utter idiot. I have no idea who would follow that she expects it to be a high quality element, but if there is a good laugh you need, check out the Exterminators of the Year 3000!
