I saw it at Cinema MK2 Hautefeuille just one night after the first public screening in Paris. A very nice film about three 15-year-old teens who are all in the same psychological stages. Many scenes allow us to return to the age of adolescence and first feelings about sexual relationships. one can imagine that the director would want to reduce the girl's first strong sensual feelings towards lesbianism, but it does not even aggravate the likelihood of the story. Sometimes you can find the movie a little slow, but that's what creates this intimate atmosphere. I finance young talents actresses, a special mention with Florian and Marie, very convincing. There are a lot of little detail, but this movie also allowed me to find out what is synchronized swimming: stunning!
