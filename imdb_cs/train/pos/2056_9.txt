I do not think most people give this movie as much credit as they deserve. I like low-budget horror movies, and it has a cake, especially for originality. Yes, the Scarecrow is a Kung-Fu fighter, but why not? No one else is willing to go far. I really did not have so much fun watching Candyman's movie. So the city chooses one child called a scarecrow, and his mother does not care about him. Then he is killed and the spirit is filled into a scarecrow, which then continues to kill. Its extinction is relatively easy to assume as soon as the film continues. Dedication at the end goes straight to a group of horrific directors, but with the greatest dedication to Dario Argento, I really amazed those people who wanted to make films of a newer genre. There are plenty of Arnold ripples on the film, you'll surely laugh as if you like, and he'd kill a sheriff with a wand. I'd say catch some pizza friends and laugh your A $$ off with this movie. I love it for my originality, the most fun.
