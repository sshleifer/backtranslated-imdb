At all my 60s, I learned that when we look at a movie, there is an identification (whether we want it or not) implicit with a certain character. Sometimes because the character performs a certain gesture, sometimes because the character speaks with a certain word or sentence? which are we using or which we would like to use? in the given situation. <br /> <br /> This movie should be seen from this perspective. Who can find a parking space now? in a shopping mall, in the city center or on the street - taken by a car that the driver can not remember thinking he is not the only driver in the world? Who has no urge? "" Haven said I was asking, "Did you identify with DELLA (played by Kim Bassinger)?" If your answer is: YES, then try to find absurd details? relative to the reality of life? in the movie because you will surely find the movie ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Abstraction, you will see that the movie has moments of surprise, such as: 1- The order in which Della grabs the box of tools in the trunk (that box contains a gun, and does not use that reconciliation?); 2- The order in which Terry dies in the fall; 3 - In the order in which Della attracts Chuckie's "Call of the Mermaid". If you've seen a movie or are planning to see, keep in mind that there are "realistic" movies, "fictional" movies, "political" movies and movies in which you can "wash your soul"? To show the last, we can quote: "Tropa de Elite". According to the newspaper, a unanimous applause was expressed when BOPE officials took certain attitudes. (As I saw the movie on DVD, I could not find the reaction of the audience) As for the directional part (Susan Monford), the interpretation (Kim Bassinger, Lukas Haas, Craig Scheffer, Green Card, Exceptional Edition, 'Robocop 2', etc.) It is well placed in the context of Piece), I value "When It Was Out" 7 (Regular).
