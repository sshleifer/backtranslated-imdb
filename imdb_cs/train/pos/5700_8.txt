I have read many negative reviews of this movie and eventually I have been able to see it on DVD. To be honest, I really do not know what a problem with it. <br /> <br /> It's a decent, murderous, mysterious thriller that is viewed from a different perspective, from the eccentric cast of often exhausted potential killers / suspects, including John Holmes, the late porn king. Please read a detailed description of the plot of the exact details of the movie - I want to contribute more to the review than the synopsis. Many reviewers have gone so far as to give the film the lowest rating due to violence, but I really do not see it. Many modern films were worse - Saving Private Ryan was ultimately much more violent than this film, which often relies on implied bloody stains rather than actual brutal killing (the murders shown in this movie were made with lead pipes). /> I was captivated by both halves of the film - John Holmes first portrayed him as a hopeless cash-hungarian drug addict, and the other half showed his side as a small conspirator in absurd bloodshed. The film has excellent acting, although Dylan McDemorant looks more than a bit out of place in his biker-esque person and feline personality of a bad boy. The soundtrack was also amazing - a fantastic combination of 70-side B-side and obscure pop, spread over several hours in all the right places of Boogie Nights.
