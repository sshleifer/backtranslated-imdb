Do not be afraid, Disney fans - this special edition of DVD loved Cinderella will not change the pumpkin at the midnight strike. One of the most enduring animated films of all time, the adaptation of Disney's view of the Grimm Brothers fairytale has become a classic in itself thanks to some unforgettable melodies (including "A Dream Is Your Heart Makes", "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo" and the title song) cute cute comic reliefs. The famous parrot (click to enlarge the picture) We all know the story - the half-half half-step half-sons do not have it, this Cinderella bin thinks it goes to the ball designed to find the lovely prince the right darling but the endurance, the animal friends and the well-admitted entrance of the fairy fairy will ensure that things take hold. There are some fascinating sequences of pure animation - for example, Cinderella is reflected in bubbles floating in the air - and the design is rich and evocative throughout. It's a simple story padded here comfortably with a comic, especially Cinderella Parents Friends (dressed as prominent as the dwarves of another famous Disney heroine) and their misfortune with a terrifying cat named Lucifer. There is also a lot of harrumphing and exposing the splashing King and Grand Duke. It's much easier and more elegant work than far frenzied animated films today, making it both great and very pleasing.
