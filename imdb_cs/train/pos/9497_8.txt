Absolutely fantastic waste ... this is everything: nudity, good fight scene, gore, action, explosions, etc. It also portrays Belinda Mayne as Ingrid - not Olga, as another reviewer has pointed out - though Olga turns into Ingrid later in the film you will have to watch to see what I mean). <br /> <br /> I will not bother going to the story because it is too long and uninteresting. The relationship between Ingrid and her brother Bo (Robert Ginty) is interesting - watch the scene of the stashing towel to see what I mean. The battle scenes were immediately good and then they were spoiled by some really dirty ghosts that looked like they did the City of the Walking Dead team (a strange color of blood flowing from the neck of the wound). I recommend fans of a low-budget basket to check if they can trace a copy - it's quite rare though I've never seen anyone bothering to re-publish it so it's going to be a few years rarer. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend it exclusively for the great naked scenes of Belinda Mayne! The lady is a fox!
