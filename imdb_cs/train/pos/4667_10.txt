I recently found this movie on VHS after I was looking for it for several years, I was not disappointed. It's better every time I see it. Peter Ustinov stars and co-wrote the original screenplay (nominated for Academy Award). The other stars you've heard include Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, and Cesar Romero. Ustinov plays accounting / embezzlement, just released from the renowned English prison Wormwood Scrubs (cheated from the headquarters of the Conservative Party, who was elected as a liberal). He immediately begins to look for a new employer from which he can kill and finds that computers are the wave of the future. Social engineers get to the London Men's Club and learn about the identity of the best computer experts in the city, stealing the identity of one Caesar Smith who has just left the city of South America to devote his hobby to collecting moths in the wild. He speaks his way to the American conglomerate Ta-Can-Co led by Carl Klemper (Karel Malden). Klemper hires Smith and shows him around the computer center, especially a security element that consists of flashing blue light. Ustinov asks computers to defeat his security, and the computer must tell him: "Disconnect the blue light." Using hacking techniques from the age of 30, Ustinov will penetrate into the system and program the computer to produce checks written by various bogus companies. The scheme will start to melt when Klemper's assistant Willard G. Gnatpole (Bob Newhart) learns about a number of Ta-Can-Co stores that seem to trade with Ustinov's fraudulent companies. With the help of her secretary, Patty Terwilliger (Maggie Smith), Ustinov manages to avoid prosecution and lives happily. I would tell you how it would spoil this very funny, romantic, intelligent and premature picture.
