Conrad Hall came out with a bang. A great film photographer has completed his famous career with this film before handing over. He became proud because it's one of the best crime movies you've ever seen. Of course, acting is not bad when you play the heads of Tom Hanks and Paul Newman! The amount of action here is also right: too much; not so small. None of the characters, honestly, is "good guys" because Hanks is a professional hitman for Newman City Chief. Hanks's exclusive redeemed quality does not want his young son to end up with a murderer like him, although he teaches him how to be a robbery escape! Just as acting is just as interesting as the story, the real star of this movie is Cameraman Hall, who draws a scene over a beautiful scene with a lens. His job is just amazing.
