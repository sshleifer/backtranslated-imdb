I found this movie "interesting"; in the end, I think my time spent watching and renting. It's true ... some scenes were at the top of emotionalism, shouting, etc. But what about the movie does not matter on its agenda, genre or ax on grind? Almost none! What surprised me was that I read another reviewer review by S.Fran at another review site but found his negative review instead of a more accurate description of his "own" movie review; not from the movie at all. Everyone who watches this movie realizes it's great to recommend family and friends; no car chase, yes! To be "in" the Italian family myself, I can fully relate to the on-screen environment. The film also has jerky parts. This is real life in such an environment. Nice movie.
