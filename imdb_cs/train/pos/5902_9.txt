As a westerner who looked at another culture and the marriages tradition, I found Just Married fascinating and gorgeous. The idea of ​​marrying an alien through parenting arrangements is difficult, especially in this modern age. Yet it is in this Hindu film. We talk with humor and fresh perspective, we learn that Abhay and Rita have met only once and are now on their traditional five-day honeymoon. As has been said, it is difficult to believe in this rich age of mobile phone that such archaic custom as an organized marriage is still ongoing. We see the pain that this young couple feels when they meet in the first night and how they try to create a bond even if they do not know each other. We see different views of the marriage and determination that both couples and holidaymakers represent, from the forty years that married others, are still not sure they made a marriage commitment. There is a song, funny dialogue, sad moments, mixing and comparing new ways and traditions. Watching a movie with subtitles surely loses some truthful stories, yet it is still a pleasure to watch. He has promised that some of the conspiracies are a bit sad and the bus event is a bit drawn and created; However, the overall movie is worth watching.
