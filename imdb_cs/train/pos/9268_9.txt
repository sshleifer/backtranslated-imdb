On the face of a movie about women who want to see a football match, they would not really care about someone with little interest in football like me, but it's not about football, it's about discrimination and the enthusiasm of women about the sport they love. The film opens on the day of the decisive World Cup Qualifier match between Iran and Bahrain, the girl trying to get to the Azadi stadium in Tehran by dressing up as a boy, seems to get a soldier trying to find her. Once caught, she is taken to a small stop on the outside of the stadium, where a handful of women who have already been caught are guarded here by a small group of soldiers who are the rulers of domestic livestock. We never know the names of the character, but we recognize them as people who ask the guards to watch them, even if they are near the wall in the wall, and when they refuse, try to get them to comment at least. <br /> <br /> In addition to making an important point about rigid gender segregation in most of today's Iran, the film contains many merry moments, such as the "camouflage" one of the girls wear when going to the toilet and the girl who she masked like a soldier and was captured just because she chose to watch a match from a seat reserved for a senior officer. The girl's enthusiasm for the game is that the end of the audience is likely to be on the edge of her place and hopes that Iran will win, and so she will get to the final in Germany. Soldiers are not shown as fundamentalists, they are just soldiers who are there because they must be, and when they explain to girls why a woman can not watch men's sports games, it does not seem to be convinced by their own arguments. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this film can not be seen in Iran itself, but it is good that it can see the wider world, and thus sees that ordinary Iranians are not a lot of fanatics who desperately fight in the West but normal people with the same passions and worries as people everywhere. Cast played a great job when their characters seem to be real people rather than mere cartoons.
