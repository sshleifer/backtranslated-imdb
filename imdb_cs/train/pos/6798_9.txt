(No spoilers, only drawing details) I can not understand such hatred for this episode. Want to watch the bad episode of Smallville? Look at Subterranean - it's a bag of bullshit. Tom Welling gives good performance (I do not say it very often) and Michael Rosenbaum is great, but most of the time. The alternative universe scenario seems completely realistic. The Martian manhunter, who had previously appeared in "Static," returns to Clarke to say that the doctor who is the head of the mad asylum where they are held is in fact a phantom phantom phantom, and if Clark wants to return to his universe, he must kill. Overall great episode, with good gameplay and decent pace.
