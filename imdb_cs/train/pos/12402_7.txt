**Warning! Spoilers Ahead! <br /> <br /> This short one is part of one that explains the short part of The Matrix in which Morpheus explains how the matrix was created. Because this story is already known, the plot itself is not a surprise; and short is not as fun as informative. But so it is presented as a set in historical archives. Visuals are better than average and generally cool colors help purpose short. A few problems. The violence of the story is a bit unreasonable and, in combination with an occasional dose of political correctness (UN scenarios), reduces direct narration of short ones. In addition, you should see that Part 2 will be complete. The Animatrix concept is great and, despite a few questions, this short task still fulfills its purpose. In the original movie it would not be appropriate in style, content or flow. It is the perfect method for revealing history. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Good information. It could have been a bit better but still solid 7 out of 10.
