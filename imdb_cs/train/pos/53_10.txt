The home room really surprised me. Compared with other movies that have been written about Columbine High School, it's best. The room in the house does not show school shooting but rather the consequences and effects of community and city. The film focuses on two opposing characters. Alec (Busy Phillips) and Deanna (Erika Christensen). Alecia is the exile who witnessed the whole shooting. It does not seem to have any emotions. Deanna is a favorite girl and the only surviving victim. Aleca is forced to visit Deanna at the hospital to graduate. Meanwhile, police are investigating Alec because he may know that shooting will happen. Alena and Deanna are very different and they do not go first. They finally get to know each other and become friends. (very styled club with breakfast). Home Room Wonderfully shows the power of proximity and confusion after training. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.
