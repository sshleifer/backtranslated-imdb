It might be difficult for some people to get in, be accustomed to the Hollywood styles of production. Direction is an uninvited, seemingly simple shooting of the scene, and the sound quality is wrong here and there (the humming of human clothing occasionally competes with its voices and the like). <br /> <br /> My buddies and I started watching without knowing what to expect and the first scene almost blew us off. It looked very shy and cheesy. Then we rose from the tone of content and we really started to enjoy ourselves. <br /> <br /> It's very funny, though it's wrong. Make sure you give him a chance if you appreciate a great dialogue. Also, Helena Bonham Carter is, of course, adorable.
