I confess that I am a vampire vampire: I have seen so many vampire films that I have lost, and this is definitely the top ten. I was very impressed with the original John Carpenter's vampires, and when I found it to be a sequel, I went straight out and bought it. This film is not exactly the same as the first one, and it's not that dark, but it's close enough and I felt it was pretty good on the original. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi was very good as Derek Bliss: his performance was pleasant and yet difficult for the viewer to believe he could really survive in the world he lives in. One of my favorite parts was just after he met Zoey and walked into the diner's bathroom to see if it was more than it seems. His comments are wonderfully irreversible and yet extremely practical, which is in comparison to the other scenes that unfold.

If you prefer your films less bloody, choose something else.
