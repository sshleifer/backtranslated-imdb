Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I've ever seen in theaters. My father took my sister and I, and that's a funny thing - when we came home, our father asked, "What do you want to do now?" and we said we wanted to watch Raggedy Ann & Andy again! lol, and my dad actually took us back to the theater to watch it again - at least that's what I remember. I was five years old. <br /> <br /> This movie was five years old. Scene with a huge ocean of sweetness and a hypnotic camel scene .. I can not remember much from this movie, it was naturally the beginning of a magical and a few scenes - I wish I could find it again and probably this is looking for. <br /> <br /> I remember that I loved Raggedy Ann & Andy.
