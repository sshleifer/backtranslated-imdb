I had to see this jewel twice to notice. When a widowed father interrupts the sleep of his two sons with a shocking revelation, they are torn between the believer and him. As the frightening events of this story are done, we learn a lot about the father, his two sons and their fates. With a shocking twist after a shocking twist, this film never lets a quiet conspiracy. Bill Paxton plays his father, but his most important performance is his older son, Fenton, starring Matthew O'Leary and his younger son Adam playing Jeremy Sumpter. This is one of the best thrillers I've ever seen, and you'll want to watch over and over again to appreciate every complicated aspect of the plot. I give this movie 9/10.
