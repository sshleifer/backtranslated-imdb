"Twelve Monkeys" has all the elements to become the masterpiece of Terry Gilliam. Excellent script, maintained rhythm, clever sometimes ironic dialogues. In addition, he had a good tint for the cast. "Twelve Monkeys" is also the first film where Bruce Willis will stand back from the character he played in his previous films. Here, a crazy and hopeless character that you could take over a prisoner's nickname from a fearless and invincible hero (as was the case with "Die Hard"). No matter how he tries, he is a prisoner of the time. The film contains a very thrilling end. It really has a dramatic power. But this amazing film is also a reflection of man, the danger he fears (especially those that could cause the end of the world and here, these are viruses that can cause illness). It does not matter how long it will take, "twelve monkeys" will be estimated at true value: one of the masterpieces made in the 1990s.
