This movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites. Voices for the animals are wonderful. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both great as rough cats and young, inexperienced boys, but the real reflection is Don Ameche as an old faithful golden retriever. This movie is a great family film because it can appreciate and love both children and adults. Humorous and thrilling and ensuring that every animal lover will cry! (happy tears!)
