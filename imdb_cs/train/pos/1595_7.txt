While I said I enjoyed the show, I expected something completely different from the first time I saw "What I like about you." I was expecting to find something like "All That" (I'm not sure if this is happening), but I have to say that I like a show and so far, I do not consider it a revolutionary show, it is very charming and I like chemistry between characters (including supported cast) <br /> <br /> I would definitely say it's great to see Wesley Jonathan back on the screen because I really loved him in City Guy. I also saw a woman who plays Valerie's friend in the Populary, and while I think it was okay, I really do not like her character in this show because it's just not my cup of tea but she's good off
