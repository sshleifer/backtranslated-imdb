This one tends to be threatened by a lot of Kurosawa critics and fans, but I thought it was great. This is an episodic multivariate study of the poorest people in Tokyo who live in a city that was literally made of garbage. Although it looks like A-Bomb just hit, the film has a kind of tranquil beauty thanks to the famous use of Technicolor. The title comes from the sound that makes a mad young man driving an imaginary cart over a slum. All the characters were amazing and all the stories fit, but perhaps the most tragic one concerns a man and his young son who live in a deserted car. When they are not looking for food, they spend their free time with their imagination to build their dream house. Emotively moving and beautiful film.
