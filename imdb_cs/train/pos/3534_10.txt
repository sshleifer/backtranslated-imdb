It's a very unusual film in that the star with a top-of-the-line invoice does not appear literally up to half. Still, I was impressed by the hook of the Phantom Lady. Curtis, though he is capable of being falsely accused by Scott Henderson, seems a bit difficult to be sympathetic (maybe he should have a shaved mustache), and his behavior when he first comes back home should probably convince the police at least to some extent of his innocence. While another commentator had a problem with Franchot Tone as Jack Marlowe, I found his character's appearance impressive. He is no villain. Outstanding actor Elisha Cook Jr. is once again in peak form like a "little man with great ambitions". His drumming in musical numbers brought a welcome touch of eroticism. But this film carries a very capable and beautiful Ella Raines because the devotee would be a lover of Henderson Carol Richmond. She definitely has talent and her presence on the screen is in the tradition of Lauren Bacall. It is the first of her work I've seen, and I'm definitely inclined to see her other roles. The rest of the support cast is also more than competent. Overall, the highly satisfying film anarchic mystery, which in today's view fully reflects the dark and complex urban world that is intended. Recommended, 8/10.
