Take 4 pairs whose relationships have already been on the rocks and put them on an island paradise where they will be tempted by 26 singles. It was the show of the show, simple, but overwhelming and entertaining. Let Fox throw the morale out of the window and let the pleasure flow. It was like the real version of Melrose Place. The good thing about the show is that it's not about people feeling and manipulating each other for financial rewards. It was a lust and temptation, a pure and simple and final relationship test. <br /> <br /> People either loved the show or hated it. It was like a slowdown when he looked at a terrible traffic accident. You know you should not look, but you can not just look. Drama aside, there were many eye candy.
