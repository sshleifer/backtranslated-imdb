What's so taboo about love? People seem to have transgenic problems. <br /> <br /> The name of this movie did not make me. It was a grainy shot about 4 minutes into the movie, which made me stop surfing the canals. I could not believe how amazing this film was. It touches so many levels of human emotion that I have never managed to move in any way. It's by far one of the best independent movies I've ever seen. I did not see these characters as sex, only human. I would recommend it to anyone who loves movies. Especially independent films. Praise all godless filmmakers!
