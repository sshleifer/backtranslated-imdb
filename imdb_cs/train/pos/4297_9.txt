From time to time the filmmaker brings to life a unique group of people and lets you see the things that make us human. Lawrence Kasden did it again. I always felt that Cg was the anthem of his age and he could do it again at the Grand Canyon. We often find ourselves in a place where we can choose life and we often throw it away. This is a film about people who are looking for the courage to vote and live a life for this choice. Approaching small and big events that allow us to see how virtually trivial most of the things we are afraid of are really brilliant. I have been watching this film several times, and I am constantly surprised at how deep emotions go through this film. Danny Glover and Kevin Kline are doing their part with great tenderness, and Stever Martins's portraits of the film are invaluable. Thank you again to Mr. Kasden
