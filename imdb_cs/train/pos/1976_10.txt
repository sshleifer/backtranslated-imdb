The man who directed the "Third Man" also directed the "Who Will Buy" sequence in "Oliver"! Now it's a talent. I'm raising Carol Reed's hat. I know it's a "second unit," but still ... <br /> <br /> <br /> And he had to deal with Orson Welles and Oliver Reed ... <br /> <br /> I suppose the quality will be out. <br /> <br /> (This shows up in the final scene with Nancy [avoid the spoiler - everyone must first see Oliver).) How many lines do I need to write. <br /> <br /> Encourage people to write too much, there is no need to encourage them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I hope it will be considered the '10th line'.
