"Hollywood Hotel" is a fast, fuzzy, wonderfully funny music comedy from Warners, unfortunately overlooked. It should be remembered if it is only the official theme song Tinseltown - "Hooray for Hollywood". The scores of Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer have many other gems, including the charming "I'm Like a Fish from the Water" and "The Moonlight Silhouettes". The best musical number is "let it be a lesson for you," in which Dick Powell and the company describe in detail the bad happenings of the "eight ball" people, a fate that literally lies in the slow burning of Edgar Kennedy on the end. The image celebrates Hollywood charm and comes across at once, as there are plenty of comic mileage from pompous and ega-maniac actors and duplicitous studio executives. The cast includes a great comedy comedy - Allyn Joslyna as a miserable press agent, Ted Healy as former manager Dick Powell, Fritz Feld as an exciting restorer, Glenda Farrell as sarcastic Mona Marshall's Gal Friday, Edgar Kennedy as Mabel Todd as Mona's fucking sister and Hugo Herbert as her still goofy's father. The "radio" element mentioned in the next overview here is a ten-second bit where Herbert appears on a black face during the pseudo-Gone With the Wind. It's in dubious taste, but that should not prevent you from seeing another delight in this movie, especially the Benny Goodman Quartet (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton!) In what I think is the only record available on this incredible jazz combo. "Dark Eyes" takes too long to come, but otherwise "Hollywood Hotel" is a jewel that's worth your time and definitely a movie that should be considered a DVD release.
