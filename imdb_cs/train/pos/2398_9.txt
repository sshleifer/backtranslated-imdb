I really enjoyed this movie. It was a rather dark story - that was Shakespeare's Macbeth - and wrapped it in a weird, often fun and irritating modern yarn. Kudos to the way the filmmaker brought the very different worlds of modern NYC and Macbeth Scotland together under one roof. The counter-worlds really bring out the intrigue and comedy of the game, and you have to love Harold Perrineau as a Choir, a part that does not exist in the game, but really helps with jazz stuff up. The conclusion stands out among the little Indians I have seen, because it is closure and originality.
