OK - you want to try somebody how comfortable they are with adolescence and embarrassing and manic therin changes - and then immediately react to seeing this sharp doctor about the kids who make socially relevant horrors in the suburban 80s. More than any movie I've ever seen, the film deals with the burden of sexuality and ego in a way that is totally human, never boring and flooded in the form of the inherent goodness of the youth that is faded by the fear-frenetic adult world, youth vibration is accredited to anything from madness to perversion. Mini-mogul Darren Stien seems to be set to gain a deeper understanding of his triumphs and doubts as a patriarch of the strict childhood world. What he finds in himself and others is not always nice - but it shows how one can improve and match with age. What does change without reflection mean? I love this movie.
