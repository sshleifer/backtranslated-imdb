The godfather of the television, but besides his famous and gangster characters, the two are not alike. Tony Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. His psychiatrist learns that Tony is actually part of two families - in one family he is a loving father, yet not a perfect husband, and in another family he is ruthless wise. After analysis, Dr. Melfi concluded that Tony's problems really came from his mother, Livie, who suspects he has a borderline personality disorder. Gandolfini is rightly praised as the main character; yet Bracco and Marchand are not nearly as well recognized for their performances as psychiatrists and mothers. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are recognized for their great supporting role. Van Zandt (E-Street Band) plays his first and only role as Tony's best friend and is quite convincing and frail. Chianese, the only recurring actor who actually appeared in The Godfather, plays Tony's uncle and on-a-off nemesis. Many fans also enjoyed the characters played by Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony's children are "okay," but they are not remarkable (except for the impressive performance of Ilera in the third episode "The Second Coming"); Sirico and Schirripa are unconvincing and persuasive, but the show is too strong to hold them back. Even if the show lasts longer than six seasons, it does not have a boring or predictable moment. <br /> <br /> **** (out of four)
