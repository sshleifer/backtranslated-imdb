"Painting is visible, then you remember better than you saw." So, says Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman), a painter in The Light That Failed. The film is in old Hollywood style, starring Ronald Colman and a courageous supporting cast that includes Idu Lupino in his first major role, reliable actor Dudley Digges (who also starred with Colman in Condemned) and a solid performance by great actor Walter Huston. The title and filming sequence of the film are largely given away by the fact that Dick loses his gaze. He is blinded by a snip shot while he and baby sweetheart Maisie (Muriel Angelus) play with a gun. Later, the blow in Sudan is a catalyst for his blindness. He becomes a well-known painter, but he is blinded by his ambition and really does not get full potential until the moment he leaves his eye. Enter the bad girl Bessie (Ida Lupino) and start herself construction. Lupino is very strong in this role and plays Colman very well. Her evil blacksmith reminds me of Bette Davis in Human Bondage. <br /> <br /> Well done and well-directed, it's one of my favorite Colman melodies.
