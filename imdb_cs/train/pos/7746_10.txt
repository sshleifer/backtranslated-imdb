Those of you who know the dEUS band know singer Tom Barman. He directed this movie a bit like he's making music, it's a mix of all. It's a comedy, though mostly absurd and cynical, dramas, none of the main characters have a happy life, and that has no purpose at all. The film starts on Friday morning in Antwerp, Belgium, with scenes of several personalities, some of which have nothing in common, but they will be in contact with each other day and night. There are several main characters: a teacher who writes books no one reads, a young morbid die-morte researcher and his sister, a gallery owner, two young men constantly in contact with the law, a man working in the cinema and two young women. A man who has something in common with the wind walks all over the film. All characters have problems with family or friends, or with life itself. The film is located in Antwerp and shows some beautiful pictures of the city and the port. Today's events are not easy to explain, I just recommend watching the movie, it's just too much information. But I can say that the Barman has a great use of the camera and uses a lot of music (mostly dance music, not really rock) to set the mood, especially in the party is full of excellent music. <br /> <br /> This movie is an experience in itself, it will leave you no wiser about life, maybe just that you must live and not lose it or have false moral truths. In short, to see it, it is definitely worth it!
