There is nothing that does not really like "The Odd Couple," and it's no surprise that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are making a remarkably successful comedy team. But there is something so developed that Neil Simon has adapted his hit scene to look more like sketching for comedy sketches than for full-length films. I did not see the game, but I have to assume that the version on the screen is quite true because it was written by Simon, so defects can not be blamed for adaptation between scenes. There are some interesting ideas in this story - the two recently divorced men who immediately enter traditional married roles when they become roommates because they do not even know otherwise - that Simon never gets lost. Still, there are several worse ways to kill a few hours.
