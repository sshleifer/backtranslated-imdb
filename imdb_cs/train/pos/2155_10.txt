Shoey Sugiyama (Kōji Yakus) is bored with his routine life, confined to hard work, and stays at home with his wife Masako Sugiyama (Hideko Hara) and the daughter of her teenager. One night, when traveling home by train, she sees the beautiful face of Mai Kishikawy (Tamiyo Kusakari) on the dance school balcony, and a few days later she decides to attend school and secretly take classes in the dance hall every Wednesday. But he will be ashamed to tell his family his secrets. Meanwhile, Masako feels changes in the behavior of her happier husband and hires a private eye to investigate if Shohei has any business. I just finished watching "Shall We Dans?" and I really loved it. What a beautiful and beautiful movie! The story is amazingly good, with drama, comedy, and romance. Cast is great and I was particularly impressed by the cold beauty and grace of the wife of Masayuki Suo's wife and professional ballet dancer Tamiya Kusakari. Last September I saw the American remake "Shall We Dansu?" for the first time, and found it to be a wonderful fun. But now I can say that this is another unnecessary remake and instead I recommend this original movie. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Dança Comigo?" ("Do you fare with me?")
