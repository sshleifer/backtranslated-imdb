Well, I'll be honest: it's not Sholay. But you can not get Sholay every week. In this movie you can see clear signatures "not without my daughter" (Sally Field, 1991). However, as most "inspired" films go, this was well-inspired, well-treated and well done. Nana Patekar, as usual, tends to exaggerate her hysteria, but everyone else is commendable. Especially for Dipti Naval: He has seen her after a long time, but has not lost any of her grace. In fact, she was performing much better when I last saw her. One more of Bollywood stars who seem to become more beautiful in old age? <br /> <br /> All in all, nice watches.
