I may identify myself with this film because I live in NYC and I suffer from poor insomnia, but whatever it is, I have to praise the filmmaker for amazing work. doing what she did without a budget ... wow, that's all I can say. really, really good. as if no money was spent on this film and it still threw me away. i definitley suggest a check if you can. fantastic score, and of course the script that knocks your ass. to see it.
