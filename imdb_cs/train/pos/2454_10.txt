Cinematography - Compared to "Wrestler," a certain degree of verity and film skills that disarm the viewer and then hypnotize as well. Performer - Dialog is minimal, but pauses and silence tangible. The story - the conflict in "balkanized" Denmark is volatile, as we have seen recently in the Netherlands, the jihad murders and the unrest in France. Although I have no love for Islam, leaving the West for Christian values ​​has no cause for celebration. The director of this film was able to mirror two companies in a way that was not addressed nor by the development of Aicha as an individual who became a champion, not in a ring, but in everyone around her. Even her worst. . . I'll stop to avoid the spoiler.
