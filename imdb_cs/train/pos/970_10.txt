Now I've seen a lot of movies in my days, but each of them has appeared a few selected couples who were really good for me. And I am a 19 year old man who is amazed at this film towards a younger audience. This is a very underestimated jewel for those who watch foreign movies. Almost all the acting is plausible, the graphics are decent (you will not even care when you look at the film Trust me, the whipping of graphics would be stupid to do), the story is well written and it's a movie everyone can to enjoy not only children. <br /> <br /> Here is basically what this movie did to me. It does not matter, I was laughing ... a lot, two, they made me feel the characters like you think, and three, it's a very exciting story. By the end of this movie you will feel good. Sure, there's no young guy in the anime who's going to turn into a great warrior and anything to beat any big evil. It is a formula that is widely used. But in this case it's a mistake, because even if they use puppets for some characters and some average graphics you would see five years ago, it does not seem like it. It's very touching, the end is original and will keep you in the movie that's supposed to. But if you try to compare it with other movies like "The Infinite Story" or whatever else thinks about you. Follow it the way it is and you will be looking forward to it. <br /> <br /> It was a good time because I was so impressed. The only other movie I got this feeling is when I saw TMNT back when he came out. It's something about this movie that I felt about TMNT that he really loved me. So do not think too much analysis or take too much movie, just enjoy it.
