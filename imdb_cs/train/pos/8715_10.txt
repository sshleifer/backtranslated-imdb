This movie is by far the most cute thing I've ever seen! Amazing animation and delightful characters (even the evil people were cute!) They made this book a winner in my book as well as in the books of those I saw with them. I still want to see it again, but they did not have time. Better than Toy Story, which was good, but not good.
