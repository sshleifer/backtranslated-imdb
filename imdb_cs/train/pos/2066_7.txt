It is easy to forget, as soon as the series has developed an extraterrestrial conspiracy plot, that once in a while X files have written episodes like "GenderBender" and "Fearful Symmetry," where the aliens were not all small gray men or mind-control goop but could really surprise. "Stunning symmetry" begins with an "invisible elephant" - an elephant that has somehow scattered in space and time, not a mile from "The Walk" - and ends with the kidnapping of a pregnant gorilla. And it's really an episode of wonderful moments. Subplot is unpleasantly good - yes, we get it, zoos are bad if they are not, but ideas that are fascinating, visually powerful and very memorable, and cover the angle of abduction that is mostly overlooked - why * people * things that foreigners are interested in? In the end, it was not an instant classic, but it was a nice watch, as it took, again very memorable, and it's something that you can not imagine many other performances.
