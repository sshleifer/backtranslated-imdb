The story is about a little girl growing up in colonial Africa, but it's a lot more. <br /> <br /> Everyone who grew up in the South will experience the same things. Desire for another, another race that can not be completed. Even the view is forbidden. There are no words needed. Their expressions on the face say everything. It's the story of a black servant, Isaach De Bankolé, and white Aimée (Giulia Boschi). Their desire is so strong that they torture each other because they can not rely on each other. Little girl in France (Cécile Ducasse) is lonely and spends her time with Protéé. This dance really does not see. One of the most irritating aspects of the movie is the laziness of the colonnade. They can not even get off the bed themselves. There the world is about to quit; they simply do not know. Their racist attitudes will be erased by their presence. I think I would like to visit this Africa. It seems so quiet; especially at night, when you hear animals.
