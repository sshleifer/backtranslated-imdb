In terms of visual beauty, this film is excellent! I did not know Technicolor came out so early. Even though I did not like the end, the whole movie is fantastic and it makes me want to be in North Africa. Cast is great, and Marlene Dietrich is a big plus, and of course she is so challenging and I just loved her in this movie. Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this film. I could not get through scenery and set ... Hotel, palm trees, desert, that's all ... legionnaires will also bring the movie "Beau Geste". They certainly do not have such movies anymore. Do not forget to watch this classic!
