I simply do not understand why this movie starts to pull. Jeez. It is breathless, it is not polished and is (as I read) unnecessary on some. Casting this movie plays their characters on "T" (If you watched Permanent Midnight and became a fan of Ben Stiller, then yes you will be disappointed). These are misunderstood, well thought out mistakes that try to save the city / world with nothing but dust and determination. The problem is that they do not realize their limits until a big fight and that's why! That's three times the movie that Spy Who Shagged Me still gets the same demographic group, probably the same people who feel that the first AP film is fading compared to the sequel. I just do not get it. Jokes work on more than one level; if you did not, I know the level you are.
