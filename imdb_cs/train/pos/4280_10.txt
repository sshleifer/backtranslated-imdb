A group of people travel to Belgrade in a terrible bus led by a drunken conductor and his stupid son (who likes to drive with closed eyes). Their journey is often interrupted by many merry events, which with great irony describe the fall of the national spirit in 1941 and are so funny that they are now used as common jokes. The man who "steals the show" is a peasant 4 feet tall with his 4 sons, who are nearly twice as big as him. Finally, the film is filming dramatically, and the trip will become nothing but the song of the dying country.
