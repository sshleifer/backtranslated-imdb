"Adult film" is nowadays scarce, but Moonstruck does it well and is still better than the average movie that is getting very old. Although the comic moments are a goal lower than the rest, the film has a wonderful specificity (the Italians in Brooklyn), which is not used to shorten the characters or spectators. (that is, Mobsters never appear and never become grotesque, such as My Big Fat Greek Wedding). The second story line is economically resolved by short scenes that allow a break from the main thread. These are scenes that are currently lacking in contemporary films where their immediate value can not be overwhelmed by producers and bigwigs. I miss these scenes. It also beautifully includes older characters. The film takes its own small, quiet path to the conclusion. There is no bad scene anywhere else to get some executives calmed down. Cage and Cher do a very nice job. Moonstruck allows old school, ethnic, work-like events in New York like 'Marty', except Moonstruck is far less testimony.
