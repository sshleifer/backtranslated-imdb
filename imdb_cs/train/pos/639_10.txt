This is a good family show with a great actor. It's a nice break from the late reality reality blitz. Now, you will not like anything like this even on TV if you do not count Joan Arcadia as a similar because he has a teenage figure. Anyway, the clubhouse is worth seeing because Jeremy Sumpter gives Pete Young a kind of liquidity and naivety that is appealing without being too sweet and plush. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms conclude the other major members, and each of them is stunning in his role. I really like Kirsten Storms as Pete's sister Betsy; She's a pretty pill, but she's still taking care of her mother and brother, even if she hates to show it. It may take several episodes to really find his legs, but Clubhouse is easily one of the best shows that will appear for a long time, so look at the people - you will be glad you did!
