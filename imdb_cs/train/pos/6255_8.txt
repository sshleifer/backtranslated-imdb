This film shows people in the middle of the hottest 2 days in Austria. It shows people who humiliate other peoples and are cruel to other peoples. It shows the inability of people to communicate or talk to others. During the screening I had visited, people were leaving in the middle because they could no longer watch the movie. And right. Because the film is not simple and attentive. It has a very depressing message and there is no mercy in the movie. It's a very cruel film, not everyone. You can not talk about enjoying this movie. It catches you in the throat and never lets go and in the end you simply feel without breath because of its intensity. I can not "recommend" or "not recommend" this movie. You should make your own opinion based on what I said earlier. Just remember that it's not a normal movie and it's not for everyone's taste.
