Wow! Wow! Wow! I have never seen a globalization document until I saw MARDI GRAS: IN CHINA. This film has a zero narrative and combines verity with sensitive interviews with four teenage workers in China who live in a factory. Playing with toys, jumping ropes and dancing. Yet most of their days and nights consist of work, work and work - but the shots of their work are enlightenment and fascinating to watch. The factory owner in China is incredibly open, enough to hit the effects of globalization at home, while "punishing" the workers. Beautifully alongside Mardi Gras beads from China into the carnival, the film uncovers how local is associated with global humor and interesting, compelling shots from both cultures. One of the most interesting parts of this film is the cross cultural presentation of factory workers and Mardi Gras, who are out of the picture. Here the film comes in full circle and shows how pictures can be a communication and transformation point. The film is never a sermon, it is not followed by guilt and permits the presence of every person. In conclusion, we - viewers - make our own conclusions about the complexity of film and globalization.
