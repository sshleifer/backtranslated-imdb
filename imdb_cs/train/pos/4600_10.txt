It is sad that this film is the pinnacles that should be at least in the 250 best movies. This is still the best action movie he ever did. Today's action movies are badly done Actors and action directors do not have the power to fight and spell good, how to do it. just some of them how to do it, mostly from Hong Kong like Jackie Chan. Stunts are so clever and wild, I do not think we'll see it like anytime. The start when Chan and his team descend the hill is amazing. Ultimate fighting pieces are the best pieces for me that have ever been shot. The final piece, sliding down the pores, through Jackie Glass, was badly injured.
