Everything should be a musical comedy. Gene Kelly (like Joe Brady) does not miss a step and Frank Sinatra (like Clarence Doolittle) does not miss a note. Scenes with them together are very good, showing how many talents can add to a rather uneven conspiracy. Sinatra "I'm too interested in" is a token of his then and future best. Kelly's "Mexican Hat Dance" with a young Mexican girl is wonderful. Kelly was nominated for Best Actor. And there's a box of really funny lines like, "Do you think the Navy has impacts?"; "Do you think somebody is singing to a seaman to sleep?"; and "We had a little trouble raising a little kid." A very nice film, just a thing that shaken the dust of the recently closed Second World War.
