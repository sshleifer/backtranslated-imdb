I did not expect the performances of Gackt and Hyde to be as well done, and I did not expect them to be cast in such a well-developed, well-crafted, artistic film to make you curious and diverse enough to be original. This film was an unexpected masterpiece for me and I will be looking for another movie like this. I especially like the fact that it's a movie of vampires, but it was not the vampire's enchantment, and it was not even better. The characters had all the human features. The way he shows the character's growth was incredibly tasteful and makes them feel like he's sorry for life. I give this film two inches so far up. Definitely the best film I've seen in the last five years.
