I'm glad that other people enjoyed this movie because I know he does not have the biggest reputation and does not make money at the box office. I thought it was amazing and there are several reasons why - Bogdanovich drives with the weakest touch, cast (especially Coleen Camp) is perfect and Big Bad Apple never looked better for the movie. You've seen worse movies!
