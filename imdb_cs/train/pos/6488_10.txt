War is hell. But this document of World War II is heaven. <br /> <br /> Not only is this series an eager and almost exhausting view of World War II, it is a poetic work that Laurence Olivier has clearly and exquisitely said. /> <br /> This documentary series defines the genre. It's really long, no doubt, but you'll all like it and want to go back and forth. (I have DVD series and probably watch the series three times a year). It's really a perfect piece of film. Other than Olivier, the best part of the series listens to veterans telling their stories; whether it be real battles or finding a pig for a butchery to have something good for dinner. I'm going to go watch it right now (again, my ... 11th).
