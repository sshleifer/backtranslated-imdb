Although he is a blockbuster, it's definitely a "good feeling" movie. All the actors were excellent and Will Smith as usual, doing the job and doing it well. I could go on but I chose ten of the "10" ratings and they also said it and probably better than I did. <br /> <br /> But since I have to include at least 10 lines to post a comment, I will say that Rosario Dawson was largely unknown as a viewer. Her performance was the most enjoyable and I'm looking forward to seeing her in many movies. And this film proves that Will Smith has nothing to prove in terms of his ability as an actor.
