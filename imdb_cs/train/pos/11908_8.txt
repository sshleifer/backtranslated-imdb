This movie plays really well with the audience. Especially after the start of persecution. Plus, Trevor Howard, with his smart, smart spells and Jean Simmons, with innocent behavior and pierced eyes, is amazing. The film begins as a psychological drama, but after the murder returns to the persecution thriller, the two guides are heading to the edge. Some may think that persecution is unnecessary, but in fact, persecution is crucial because it helps to eradicate the idea of ​​the character of Jean Simmons by driving it out of the oppressive household, and helping to bring out a real killer - who suddenly got to the point of completing the task. The killer rightly believed that once the Simmons character was arrested, it would be postponed. And it is true that her lack of control in the household - as well as the evidence that shows her the way - is not a way of getting a murderous charge. The Chase that follows helps you to get the truth. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie. Search for it if you find it.
