This is the second part of Animatrix, a collection of animated short films that tell us a bit more about the "Matrix" life. <br /> <br /> Here we learn how men and machines can not work and live together. It is a small historical lesson in the "Matrix" world. It's not as good as the first part ("The Final Flight of the Osiris"), but still fun.
