Saving Grace is a good movie with his heart in the right place. Grace is recently widowed and realizes that her late husband left her a lot of debt. She could lose her beautiful house and see no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana. She lives in a beautiful village where most of the audience would like to live and the villagers are all the wonderful people that most viewers like to have as neighbors. There is only one error in this image, and that's the way it portrays the effect of marijuana on users. Obviously, none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever smoked things. The way the villagers go after smoking a knee is ridiculous and just funny. It is in these scenarios that the joke is replaced by English tiles and that is a pity in a movie that is, however, very pleasant.
