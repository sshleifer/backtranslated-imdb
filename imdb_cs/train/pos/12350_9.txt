I'm not sure how I skipped this when it first came out, but I'm glad I finally saw it. The film takes place in the Okabas district in the red area around the 19th century, Japan. She tells the story of prostitution, caste systems, and women who are strong in a society based on Samurai's Japanese code. Unique is Akira Kurosawa! Even when he died before he could direct this film, he showed his adaptation to the script. His view of the Japanese world and the caste system is well known and sheds light on how these systems work together. The characters can rotate around, but the caste system remains intact when each character returns to the world it belongs to. A Samurai warrior who plunges into a world of good-natured and loving prostitute goes back to his life as she embarks on another road with a man who is part of her caste system .. the smallest. Many have appreciated the world of the samurai above all others, yet they are inhabitants of lower castes who can support each other and who can love without restraint. Samurai in this film will turn out to be weak, while carefree lovers will prove to be honest. <br /> <br /> The film deserves a higher rating. It is the story of the survival of women in feudal Japan. During this time, men were considered survivors ... strong, while women were considered helpless and weak. This film highlights the strength of Japanese women and how they did what they had to survive, and how their power allowed Japanese culture to continue as it does. I recommend "sea looking" to anyone who is a fan of Akira Kurosawa and although they are not fans. It is a beautiful, quiet and mentally-kept film, and one to be valued for every film collection.
