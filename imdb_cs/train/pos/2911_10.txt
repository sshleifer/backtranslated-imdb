This is one of the best concerts that someone will ever see and hear. I grew up when All My Lovin 'was brand new and heard today the original artist again today is the degree of strength of Sir Mc Mc to woo any crowd of any age. This doco is set behind the scenes to show us life on the road not only for the group but also for everyone on the road. I saw the guy who lives in Aussie 1975 and I assure you that his performance on this DVD is no less than almost three years ago. I have a huge 5.1 surround sound system that does this justice and is recommended by someone, especially the Beatles fan. This is closest to today's Beatles concert. Singer, songwriter, lead / rhythm / bass guitar, piano, ukulele, just pure genius. There are few fun people who can stay alone with one tool and hold the crowd in their hands. If you want the perfect music, buy the studio's recorded CDs. If you want to hear raw music as intended and spontaneous towards the crowd, with all the excitement and emotions of the crowd - this DVD is for you.
