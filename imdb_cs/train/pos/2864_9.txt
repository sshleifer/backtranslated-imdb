It was a running joke around Bonanza about how enormously fatal to all the women of Cartwright is for all women. After all, Ben Cartwright was a three-time widow with a son in every marriage. And every woman who joins Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe will end up dying because he can not get rid of the formula of the widow and the three sons who have started this classic Western TV. <br /> <br /> Maybe if Bonanza was done today, the writers would have revolving women who would come to Cartwright's lives. People have relationships, some are doing well, some are not as good, it's just life. And today our heroes need it, so if one of them goes south, we do not have to kill the character to keep the nobility survivors. But that was when Bonanza took place today. But we still waited a lot from our Western Heroes and Bonanza, although it took a while for it to go away and the change of watch time from NBC certainly helped, the secret of Bonanza's success was the noble Patriarch Ben Cartwright and his brave sons. Ben Cartwright was an ideal TV dad in any genre you want to name. All his life was spent in the hard work of building this immense Ponderosa, which spread to its three children. The boys were all different, but they all agreed. <br /> <br /> The Cartwrights have become and are still an American institution. I think more people than Kennedys care for this family. Only the popularity that Bonanza has in the syndication is evidence of that. <br /> <br /> Pernell Roberts as Adam's eldest son was written from the show. He said he did not care about the noble cartwright characters that he felt bordered on by the saint. Perhaps if it were done, it should be better as I describe it. It was just the start for Michael Landon, how many people got three hit television shows that were entrusted to them. Landon also has a road to heaven and a small house on Prarie where he had creative control. Little Joe was the youngest, worst, but most romantic of the Cartwrights. <br /> <br /> When Roberts left. the show took place with two younger sons, but when the big Dan Blocker left, the heart came out of Bonanza. Additional characters were added, David Canary, Tim Matheson and Ben Cartwright received the young Mitch Vogel. But the big, loyal but a little fat Hoss was the most popular of Cartwrights. Sudden bouts of surgery have left too much a hole in this family. <br /> <br /> So the Cartwrights of Ponderosa have gone through history. I really like America to take Cartwrights into my heart when I visit the real city of Virginia. It looks as if you were in Bonanza. But at Lake Tahoe, just where you see Ponderosa on the map with the initial credits, Cartwright's home is a set kept and open as a tourist attraction. Like 21 Baker Street for fans of Sherlock Holmes, ranch and Cartwrights are real. And if they were not real they should have been.
