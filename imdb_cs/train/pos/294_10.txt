Critical and financial flops at the first release turned the critics and said that this film is the best of the director. And La Ronde feels like a movie is evolving when the guys from the detective agency (Ben Gazzara, John Ritter and Blaine Novak) persevere, fall and attract some of the most strange and beautiful women on the film (Audrey Hepburn, Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen). Much of the script was ad-libbed or re-written on the filming day, which makes the movie feel breezy. Ben Gazzara is excellent as a detective leader convincing Audrey Hepburn after dropping the singer Colleen Camp and seeing the convertible Patti Hansen on her side. John Ritter follows Dorothy Stratten and immediately falls in love with her. Blaine Novak has several girls to chase (including Joyce Hyser and Elizabeth Pena). This movie has some great performances in the form of supination. It's Audrey Hepburn (no line in the first half of the movie). Ben Gazzara has never been a better (and inspiring choice for romantic leadership) and Colleen Camp has one of her best roles as a manic country singer Christy Miller. She is delighted to watch her firing her lines in the rat-a-tat-tat van. Highly recommended! ********* Stars!
