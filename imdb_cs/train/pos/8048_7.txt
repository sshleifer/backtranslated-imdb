RECEIVE !!! They have done it purposefully! Two of my current television favorites ("Oz" and "L and O-SVU" melons and Janel of "West Wing") joined a nice little sleep / study character. The plot has nothing fancy, but the acting is right on the stamp. Tim Busfield appears behind some neat bits. It's worth a look.
