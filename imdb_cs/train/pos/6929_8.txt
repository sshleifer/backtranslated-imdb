This crawl on ENCW last thread for third or fourth time. I used it so much that I ordered a DVD. This is really exceptional and, of course, the first man of Mann Stewart. More here than usual, though not as strong as a seeker. Numerous obvious symbols of achievement of masculinity, but mainly acting Stewart, his partner Millard Mitchell, Shelly Winters and Waco Johnny Dean-Dan Durya. Steve Miller (not The Joker) is interesting as a handsome hero who is interested in Lola but too yellow. Like Stewart in The Man Who Killed Liberty Valance, he is practically limited to putting on an apron and serving his enemy coffee. Dekaf is no doubt. Tony Curtis of the Bronx Cavalry and Rock Hudson act like no Indian I've seen on the screen with interesting portraits. John McIntire's special performance as a too happy card / arms dealer hanging on the very low western version of American Rick Cafe. No one wants to spend the night there. Jay C. Flippens made a kiss from Lola (Winters) and has some pretty scenes with Stewart before he gets to Bend of the River and Far Country. It will be Geer like Wyatt Earp and the Indian Chief, who takes Walter Brennan's teeth to Red River, is a pleasant observation. This is a kind of West that could only be avoided by Stewart, not Wayne or Scott. It's worth it, I repeat. :-)
