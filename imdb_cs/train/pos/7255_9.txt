This is not the movie you watch for fun, at least most people I know not. <br /> <br /> It's a portrait of both body and mind's cruelty that's going on pretty well in the war, the characters seem plausible because you've "read their mind", something more often found in books and rarely in movies , but in this work it was very good. I should put it next to "All Silent on the Western Front" and "Die Br√ºcke" in terms of leaving a lasting impression. I wish I could see it at school along with two more films - but finding a copy turned out to be quite tough - which is a shame.
