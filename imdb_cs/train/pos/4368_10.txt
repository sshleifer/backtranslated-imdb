It's a very exciting and romantic movie. I've seen it several times and never get bored with it. Everything is realistic and it's a good conspiracy. The actors are outstanding Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cox. I actually prefer this movie like Braveheart as Braveheart to contain so many historical mistakes. There are many exciting scenes - pay attention to the Bridge Scen and the last scene. This is really good and surprising scenes. <br /> <br /> Music is beautiful ... it really suits the movie. The setting is amazing.
