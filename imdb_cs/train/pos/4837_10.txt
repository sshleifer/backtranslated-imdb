I was a young film student in 1979, when the Union of Soviet creators came to Bulgaria's Sofia Bulgaria and the premiere of Konchalovski "Siberiade"; Tarkosv's "Stalker" and Danelia's "Autumn Marathon". I was overwhelmed by the cosmopolitan dimension of artistic form. Only then did I see "Siberiade" 4 and 1/2 hours of epic, and he was speechless. The way better than Bertolucci "1900". Far! <br /> <br /> I hope that Andron will get into the negative and once "full version of the director" full length! On DVD of course! I also struggled to fight this film against most of my colleagues who had a bad taste with Soviet film! Time is on my side.
