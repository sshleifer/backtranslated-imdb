This film revolves around Japanese culture as well as the life of one modern Japanese family. Physical contact is cloudy for those over 7 years of age (especially in public), and therefore everything that is worshiping instead of embracing, even if you are close friends / relatives. Dancing in the dance hall involves placing weapons around someone else, even in public! However, less dance hall is (on quite) extremely popular. People who make a dance hall in Japan are seen as a nudist in the west ... much more they want to do than culture, but they are suppressed by culture. An amazing family film that every amateur dancer could enjoy only for dance sequences. I understand it was more popular than Titanic in Japan. I think the Japanese are just like us - they also want to be embraced.
