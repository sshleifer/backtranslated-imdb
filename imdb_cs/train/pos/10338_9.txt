Norman, is that you? it was (that's all from third hand, so take it with a grain of salt) tailored to the African-American family from the Jewish when you move from the scene to the screen. It was also one of those movies originally shot in the video, so the prints from the theater could not be so great. Still, Redd Foxx and others were pretty good. <br /> <br /> I wanted to tell you all that the movie is PERIODIC BONE: it reflected the attitudes of the mid 70's to find out that you have a gay son or daughter in your family. That's why it's quite interesting - if not a little "Hollywood." Do not believe me? Look at curtain lines, etc. Very stereotypical. It's not too deep. But ... the film really shines in several areas. There is a scene scene when Redd Foxx tries to find his wife, who has gone with his brother (!) To Ensenada in a pitted Pinto. Telephone conversation across the border is really unforgettable. <br /> <br /> But ... the best scene in the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame did their gay routine that he did in gays and nightclubs. To my best knowledge, it's the only time the routine was shot. And it's a slightly cleaner and much shorter version. Yet it is a vintage Madame, and should not be missed. People still steal lines from Wayland; the man was genuinely gifted. Enjoy a movie!
