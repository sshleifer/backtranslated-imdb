Legendary Boris Karloff ended his famous career by producing four fans of cheap fear in Mexico. This is a token of the mood of the gothic entry of horror from the volume. Karloff gives a typically stupid and dignified performance like Matthias Morteval, an eclectic ecumenical patriarch who invites a few of his tiny, greedy, and stupid homeless people to his horrible chateau for reading the will. Soon, hateful guests will get from the fatal life players who live there. One of the Mexican sex symbols Andres Garcia of "Tintore" shamefully portrayed a proud police hero, and Julissa looks absolutely breathtakingly the only pleasant female character. Endless, fertile (not) direction, modest scenario, ugly empty cinematography, ridiculous murderous pieces (gross fat thick is burned directly into the face with a miniature cannon!), Morbid throbbing atmosphere, predominantly dirty actress (exceptionally extraordinary Karloff) bad dabing, and an exciting fiery conclusion all give this deliciously terrible lemon a certain, extremely cruel, and therefore strangely entertaining, fragile spell. Great bonfire.
