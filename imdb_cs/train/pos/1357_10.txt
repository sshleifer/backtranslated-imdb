What an episode! After the last week, when she saw Mellis constantly shooting the stones of Annie and Brandi's friendship, I almost shuddered. But it was nothing until they saw Tilde Mellisy after being released. Seeing her swing at her cast and screaming obscenities and screaming for someone to get a purse was a very cheerful thing on real estate television. She continued screaming at the people who had "all" in their clothes, as if someone else wore one of her stunning clothes. Are you Mellis for 40 years, and you're still arguing with lively fits? Then Joan will call Annie and Brandie every name in the book and get up and leave the show! Both rivers are corrupted crap who have been on the show for as long as they can keep ratings. Mellisa, who weeps and rejects the ending interview, proves to the American what they all thought you were a spoiled child. WAH WAH I can not get in the way! I love Annie telling cameras that she can manipulate Mellis to think about it, and she did exactly that. Mellisa is by far the smartest competitor and clearly deserves to win the game.
