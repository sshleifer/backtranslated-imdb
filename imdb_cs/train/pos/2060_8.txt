This movie is not your typical horror movie. It has some humorous and deadly scenes that can be a bit comical. I personally liked the movie due to its off-beat humor. It's definitely not a super scary movie, which is good if you do not want to be scared and paranoid afterwards. I liked the performance of the hillbilly guy and Lester ... very believable. I think I'll color my hair red like the girl in Strašáci - very cool! Anyway, overall, it is worth renting for humor and an extraordinary experience of fear.
