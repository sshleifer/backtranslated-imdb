I'm not a big martial arts fan, but the videotape was almost empty, and Jet Li was in Lethal Weapon 4 and I got it for free when I was the other movies I leased as I leased it. I absolutely loved it, my roommate and me (22 year old biochemistry and accounting students) spent half an hour after the film making strange Kung Fu sounds and throwing beermat shurikens on top of each other. I can not explain it (maybe a little tequila). I have never noticed Bruce Lee, a skinny boy who kicked a big boy, beat him, kicked a bigger movie, etc. Think of Jackie Chan with a little less comedy and more action.
