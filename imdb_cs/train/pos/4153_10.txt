it was a fantastic episode. I saw a clip from YouTube and I promised that if ever he ever appeared on television, I would join a set to see. that I watched it with my friend who would become a gay, and we both cried at the end. it was really well written, a hearty episode of forbidden love between the two policemen who, as I felt, were really "Lucky" in Coop's words. these are such episodes that really make Cold Case one of CBS's most appealing and most popular television magic. I'm looking forward to another episode and re-running "Forever Blue" because I've always been watching it again.
