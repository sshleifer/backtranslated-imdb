First; I am a devoted fan of Modesta and have been reading comics since I was a child, and I found older movies about our heroes unsatisfactory but where they fail, this ROCKS! <br /> <br /> So here we go: Mrs. Blaise is working for the casino, there's a gang of robbers and she starts playing for her girlfriends. If a robber wins one round, he will have to tell him about himself. If he wins twice in a row, one of the staff is free. (Sounds stupid, yeah, okay, I'm not so good to explain it.);) She says she grew up in a war zone, without parents or friends, about helping an old man in a refugee camp and escaping, living according to their own rules of nature. They are looking for food, and they teach it to read and fight. As they approach civilization, they get into the war, and when they are taken to the rebellion, they are shot and the old man dies, leaving him alone to meet the city. <br /> <br /> Then she meets the man who is the casino for whom she is now working, and the story ends there. <br /> <br /> What is to follow is that there is a wonderful fight and the line is totally cool. Alexandra Staden's TERRIFIC Modesty Blaise! Just as modest and powerful, graceful and intellectual as a comic book. <br /> <br /> But he feels uncomfortable, but to hear the modesty speaks with a bit of a broken accent, but it is not relevant because the comic book-blaise can not speak loudly, but it must have a somewhat existing accent. (Not to mention that it is weird that everyone speaks English in the Balkans ..) Actor's acting is really good, even the child who personifies the young Blaise must have applause! <br /> <br /> My favorite piece of work must be where she tears her clothes to kick a stupid thief ass! Totally amazing! : D I can not wait to see the real adventure in the next movie! <br /> <br /> Look at this, you will not be disappointed!
