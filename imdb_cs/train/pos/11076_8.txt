I'll start by listening to almost everyone! The fact is, it was not what someone expected, especially from Guy Ritchie. What everyone is waiting for, the cocks and good linery "do they like you?" etc., but it is much more advanced than its previous work. I agree that this is confusing, but all the facts are for us, we just have to see them and listen better, this film requires all your attention! Look at the cool and dazzling look of the film, try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performance and I think we all will have a more thorough understanding of the whole movie. Yes, this has its influences of modern classics (combat club, pulp fiction, etc.), but it is in the whole original in both directions and in step with the musical score, which is second. I feel that if everyone were looking at this film over and over again, they would have understood it a lot more and maybe they realized it was a great piece of modern cinematography, and that's it, and I hope Ritchie continues this futile, because I prefer it mockney "masterpieces".
