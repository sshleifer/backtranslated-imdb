This is one of those little Christmas movies for everyone. Our Scrooge is Ben Affleck, who decides that money is not enough, so he rents a family that lives where he thought his family was doing. OK? This is a great small soap in high school, PG-13, but small sexual references are comedies, so if your child can not cope, they can not even live in the real world. <br /> <br /> Now Affleck is a bit and as usual goes through this fun, OMG, remember when we did ..., assemble a piece as if it was at the end of a neuroinfectious disease. But it's okay, because even the old Oracle still hopes that if Ben is so well distributed, well, hope we have ladies for us. Fortunately, the rest of the band - Catharine O'Hara, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Udo Kier and Josh Zuckerman - fills and keeps this shadow-side-Ozzie-a-Harriet Christmas alternating cheerful, comfortable and warm. br /> <br /> This movie is a kind that you can jump to and get popcorn, and when you get back, everyone wants to encourage him to show you what you missed. <br /> <br /> This is a happy movie, after all, and leaves you feeling good about life, love, family, Christmas and Chanel. There is really something for everyone.
