Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare (Yokai daisenso, 2005) a movie about "yokai" or traditional Japanese "monsters" of folklor. It is alternatively known as the Big Monster War or as ghosts at the show. Yokai's first installments include a freak teapot, a water imp kappa, a living brella, a woman whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic, a woman with a second face on her head, a dwarf priest with a giant batter-like wrist, and so on. Such moody monsters come not only from fairy tales, but from the summer fun of the Tokugawa era, comparable to today's haunted Halloween houses, or "wild shows" from ancient times, but with exclusively furious anger. Ghosts & goldfish monsters and dancing single-headed umbrellas were made to create "fever" during the hot years. The woman who was born on her face was re-created by tricks or illusions, based on monsters depicted in medieval scrolls; and if their design for the movie is a bit simple and hoky, it makes them increasingly representative of what has been historically re-created for summer fever. These rather cute monsters have to face and destroy the ancient Babylonian demon of the vampire who came to Japan and disguised himself as a Samurai lord. Despite the fact that some of the Japanese apparitions are a bit goofy, and too many costumes are a little more than masks without moving their lips when they talk, it's all played a lot of poker and it's very charming. He has beautiful cinematography, just like in the CGI movie of the same decade. Looking at the right mood or the right friends is exciting, moving and touching. Yoshiyuki Kuroda also directed the famous Lone Wolf & Cub: White Heaven & Hell (1974) and was the special FX director for the excellent Daimajin trilogy. The Yokai Monsters series is by no means the same as Majin, but Yokai is very entertaining. The first film Mike, which is most focused on children from his family films, with GOZU and IZOO is gradually more serious, though not too severe for young audiences.
