Here's a real wonder for you. It starts with another take-off on the PSYCHO shower scene on the school grounds, and then becomes more crazy when a couple of carols and their dear friends head south to Spring Break. Problems begin when they reach the county where the murderous Sheriff Dean ruled. One of the trackballs crosses the forest, witnessing the murder of the sheriff and having an open head. Then what makes MACON COUNTY LINE as dean stamps, traps and kills insignificant witnesses one by one. Tony March is in goal as an evil, happy shotgun Dean. The overall tone of the movie is really troubling. The end is so sudden that you almost think the director has fallen out of the movie; it's also a study in despair. SHALLOW GRAVE is a must for misanthrops, misogyves and nihilists around the world.
