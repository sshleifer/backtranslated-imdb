Corbin Bernsen sent letters to the four criminals he'd been working with in the past, and it's a real intergenerational mix with Fred Gwynn, Lou Diamond Phillips, William Russ, and Ruben Blad. He has to meet him in this obscure town of Montana, and he does not explain why he was then picked up by the New Jersey State Police. <br /> <br /> The criminal groups that have gathered all know Bernsen, but they do not know each other. A lot of comedy is that they feel each other. Because the oldest Gwynne, though denying that he will take care of it, and the others will blink, but they go together. Especially when he finds out what Bernsen meant. As for Bernsen, he is fortunate to be picked up by a pair of bumbers in Ed O'Neill and Daniel Roebuck. He dropped to O'Neill and escaped. Then four criminals try to finish what Bernsen started and Bernsen get away from the police. In a complicated plot scenario, it is fascinating how the story lines intertwine. Hoyt Axton as a local sheriff looks amazed at what's going on in her town. Disorganized Crime is a wonderfully humorous caper film that plays a lot of players who seem to have mostly backgrounds on television or soon. I can not say that someone has been cast in, they seem to click well too. <br /> <br /> Ironically, none of these people are a comic in itself, but they all have a light comic touch that has won good leadership. <br /> <br /> "Unorganized Crime" is one very entertaining philharmonic film written by well-known pessimist Mr. Murphy.
