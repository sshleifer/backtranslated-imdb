Those who remember later Sir Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot or a professional religious would do well to look for this charming satire of the late 1960s. Ustinov stars as a convicted convict (we see him for the first time in his gaol on his last day, where he prepares the prison governor's tax return), who, when he sees the future as a computer, represents (using theft of identity theft) a computer expert and tries to penetrate American multinationals. <br /> <br /> Ustinov (who wrote the script) is in the top form as well as magnificent Maggie Smith, which is unusually occupied here as a random cock -sparrow dolly bird. Bob Newhart also features amusing performance as a suspect manager who has suggestions for Maggie Smith. Besides, Karl Malden is as frank as Ustinov and Newhart's female boss. What do I really like about this movie? Not only is it a well thought out "caper film," but it's also a touching little love story; Ustinov and Smith are very convincing because the two disordered havens attract love (the whole set of cards is particularly effective.) So, what's wrong with it? The script is not more computer-literate than most movies (it's hardly at all), although it captures the impression of honest enterprise computing from the late 1960s. Also, there are a few small patches that you probably do not notice until the second or third view, but I consider them a tiny niggle. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's a movie that's worth looking for, and once you've seen it, you'll want to see it again at regular intervals. <br /> <br />
