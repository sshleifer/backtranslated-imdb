Noni Hazlehurst, Colin Friels, Alice Garner, Chris Amphitt and Michael Caton - What more could you ask for? Monkey Grip, based on the award-winning novel of the same name, explores Nora (Hazlehurst, the single-person who falls into Jobe's dependent heroin (Friels)). The simple story is really extraordinary thanks to the versatile great acting (especially Noni Hazlehurst) the nice use of a small budget. The only downside is that (if you can pick it up) is that the story is in Melbourne, though for budget reasons, the movie was shot mainly in Sydney, so in several scenes you see trams (Melbourne scenes) and then Carlton Post (Sydney scenes) . In addition, "Monkey Grip" is to be seen (apologize for the clue, but it is) at least for the award-winning performance of the former Play School and Better Homes & Gardens by Noni Hazlehurst. <br /> <br />
