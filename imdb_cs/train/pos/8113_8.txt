This science-fiction masterpiece has too many shortcomings after the editors, after its opening in 1936, have been killed by him. Visually, it's a wonder I see, but the script allows too many intellectual expressions of war and progress. given to recite a lot of high-minded reports in all circumstances. Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke, both great actors, fall out like a lot of fanatics. Ralph Richardson is very good as a "boss" megalomaniac warrior. The prediction of the Second World War was very exciting, given that the world was at the edge of the most devastating conflict in human history at the time. I'm sure the war was not found in the movie. There are some visually awesome assembly sequences spanning the jump of time between the different episodes of the film. Though it's not as fun as I hoped it would be, the movie holds in your mind long after you've seen it.
