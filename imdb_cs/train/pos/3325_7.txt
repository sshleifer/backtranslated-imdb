Okay, I would not normally see a movie with Farrelly brothers. I can not remember I've ever watched him. I also do not remember watching Jimmy Fallon's film. I watched the taxi well, but I said repentance and was forgiven. But this movie had Drew Barrymore, and I think it's the most cute thing. I do not know what it is about her, but I just smiled as I watched her. She just caught me. I mean, I even watched Adam Sandler to see her in the first 50 years. How sad? It was not the biggest baseball movie - it was not supposed to be. It was a love story about a sad puppy hanging on a single thing that never kept him until he found something that could happen. It had a predictable ending, but there was so much there that it was worth it.
