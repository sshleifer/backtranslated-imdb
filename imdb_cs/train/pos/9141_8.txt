You can talk about the prince's acting talent, or even about his decision to parody his own life in this movie. There is no debate about his musical talent even now or not. It looks like a shadow - twenty years later, but music remains relevant and fantastic. <br /> <br /> After surviving the hype of this film (graduating from high school in 1985), I can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the time. From Tipper Gore (Al's wife) who tried to censor "Little Nikki" and everything under the sun over PMRC (Parents Music Resource Center) to every "Air Bond" at the time of the Prince, it was absolutely the worst thing. For at least several weeks, Prince was bigger than Madonna and Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> We were waiting for the movie and we were excited to talk. It did not disappoint. They were all caught. I was then MTV musician (in fact playing the music then ...) Prince played at least once or twice per hour. I have to comment on this comment by being a favorite of Billy Idol, Oingo Boingo, The Fixx, Flock of Seagulls and others in the Punk / New Wave genre. "Prince's music at that time crossed all types and styles, and one of the reasons why some of them seem so deep and brown is that it was a big SOOOOOOOO, all the things that remind you of the 80's were symbolic It was like a rapper grandmother for Wendy's hamburger. <br /> <br /> It looks silly because everyone was caught in it (sadly, like a bizarre violet macarana or something.) I hope it all gave you some insight.
