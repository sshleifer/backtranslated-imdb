It's a nice little movie with a nice story that plays the most important part of the movie. It's a pretty interesting dramatic story with romance in it. The story is slow, but it works too well to build it. Characters are pretty and nicely rendered actors. Normally, I'm not a big fan of Asian acting, but the acting in this movie was just fine. Of course, the film is completely different in its approach and style from other genre films in the West. In this way, this film is more advanced thanks to its approach than Western films created during the same era. I just wanted the film to have a slightly better visual style. For a movie that is considered a kind of film art, this film certainly lacks some good-looking sequences. This was probably a relatively cheap film that was made, and it was made quite generally. Not that it's a bad thing, it prevents this film from really being different from each other and acting over the genre. But well, this film is about its well-built story and characters that are in it. In this respect, this film will certainly not disappoint. <br /> <br /> 8/10
