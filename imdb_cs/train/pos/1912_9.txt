I'll be short and short, the people who wrote stories for this show are brilliant, actors are just perfect for the role they play (CJ's character is legendary) and have so many chemistry on the screen, which makes what a very successful comedy . When I first saw new episodes that are likely to return for only 6/7 months, I was wondering what happened to Paul. I was gutted to find out he died when I was going through Google. He was so entertaining and he played his character to perfection, an exaggeratedly protective father who likes to keep his daughters out of focus and from boys. The comedy, I think, disappeared into strength, even without Paul. <br /> <br /> Plus, I think most people would follow this.
