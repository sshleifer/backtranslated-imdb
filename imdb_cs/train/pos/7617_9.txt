Very addictive series. I have not seen the exact combination of drama, action, tension and Sci-fi ever before. I am amazed by every chapter. The script is very intelligent, I do not know how the creators make up all these amazing stories, each character has a strange past, trouble, stormy relationships, gives the show the personal meaning needed to create intimate characters. <br /> <br /> Most incredible is the fact that there are all the characters among them: Numbers that they met earlier without knowing it, and so on. The other, the mysterious security system and the Darmy initiative are elements that will not lose us the chapter. <br /> <br /> JJ Abrams, what do you think you will create this amazing story?
