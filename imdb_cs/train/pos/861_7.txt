What can you say when you see a good French film that attempts to draw a thrilling story in line with the social background of the characters? The main point is that we believe in these characters and as soon as they meet, we want them to stay together. It's simple and really effective. The background story is less important. Why does the script come to the side of the half-developed thriller? It helps them not get caught up in the social demonstrations most French film criminals do. It's not much ambition, right: Sur mes l√®vres is just a fun French movie with a good character. For all clever new points in the script, the end is too easy. This is quite as easy as in the back window (obvious link and definitely no noir movie) but with a less convincing context. Where I am amazed, it is clear that the character of the probation officer has not been erased. The story brings little; when he appears himself, we wonder if we have missed a part. Jacques Audiard is not yet a newcomer. Odd and strange.
