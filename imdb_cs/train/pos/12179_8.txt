It happened to me that this film was randomly watched a few days ago when I turned the channels. My expectations were not too high, but it was an interesting movie. Jason Lee starred in "A Guy Thing" Paula, who is about to marry Karen (Selma Blair), and sets up the indisputable middle-class household. First we meet Paul at his bachelor party, where he has no desire to engage in normal bachelor party activities that his (surprisingly few) buddies encourage, if he is a little naughty and gets into a terrible harassment with his early troubles and disputes. Of course, another thing Paul knows is the morning after the night, he's in a naked hula bed with a dancer and his mother-in-law to inform him that Karen is on his way. Oh, and the hula dancer is Karena's cousin Becky (Julia Stiles). From this small harbor of potential trouble grows a mighty oak of frenetic misery as Paul scrambles from a bad adventure to a bad opportunity, trying to conceal what he did while maintaining the look of a good, family-oriented good man who is enthusiastically enthusiastic about his close wedding. His endeavor to keep Karen is nothing more about the potential misconception of his work ironically to Paul's closer and closer Becky, who loves him, and asks him to ask if he really wants the life he dreamed of ,. The film contains the right combination of comedy and romance. Definitely worth the watch.
