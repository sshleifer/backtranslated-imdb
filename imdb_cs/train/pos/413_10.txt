Make sure this movie is not historically accurate, but it's great fun. Most of DeMille's pictures, especially the later epics, are slow and fruitful, but the action here is on a clip. The story is essentially a series of tips with very little silent moments. The action leads us from an Indian raid to the cabin; one of the best parts of the film with Jean Arthur outstanding in an attempt to calm the war painted natives. This follows when Cooper and Cooper arrive at the war camp and are tortured. Later comes a long battle with Cheyenne. The whole thing is ridiculous but very fun and fun from start to finish. Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses of this time and he's lit up here.
