This is a very well filmed movie. I've heard mixed reviews when it was in production and waiting for it to be released! Inspire the director and all the actors. The support cast gave Eve Mendez what she needed to take it to the summit. As everybody else says, the second part of the film is riveting. Katie Cassidy did a wonderful job with her character because she did not do a lot of work on filming this movie. She has a pretty good career in front of her. I was impressed by my performance. I was really enjoying the film, questioning my values ​​in life and priorities and being a better person for her! The movie is great news. Make it easy for everyone to enjoy!
