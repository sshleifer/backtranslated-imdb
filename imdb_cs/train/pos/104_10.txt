This movie had an interesting story that he did not have a list, but the actors who were in this movie did a good job. I'm glad we have b movies like this, the story is basic, the actors are basic and so is the way they do them, you do not need a million dollars to make the movie just a mix of a list of ordinary actors and a basic fence. I like the way they had a way to go and no one else was around, and what was interesting was that they did not go to a caf√© to put their equipment in there and that they were doing it all out of the police station. Arnold vosloo and Michael madsen have done a great job of displaying roles in hostages. It was a great movie and I hope she will like it in the near future.
