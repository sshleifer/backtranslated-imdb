Silverlake Life, A Look From Us, is an amazing film about AIDS as well as a homosexual relationship. Some pictures are really hard to take, especially when a person is homosexual or fears AIDS, and probably also for every sensitive person who is watching him. It is not easy to make a film about such terrible illness and its consequences not only for the life of one, but for two people. This film teaches how to care for yourself in such difficult times, but never immersed in it, it still shows life at any time and reminds you that outside of theater or your peace, life goes on regardless of the fate that some people may be. The characters are incredibly cute while watching their intimacy in shots that never exceed a very strict limit without revealing anything too private or offensive. Children should definitely not watch this film, but adults, whether or not to deal with such situations, should do it, and they will not regret the tears they pour.
