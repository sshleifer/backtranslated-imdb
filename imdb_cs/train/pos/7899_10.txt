It was a great movie. I do not understand why so many people do not like it. It was a lot to bring him together, so many beautiful pictures and so much sympathy with things that were not told. I was totally entertained and was left with a joyful enthusiasm just as I did when I finished most of Tom Robbins' story. Now I have not read this book about Robbin, so now I do not know how it was, but I can not imagine that this film could be a very bad interpretation. The film left a lot for you to choose yourself, which is the best part of every novel by Tom Robbins, dreaming about the details. <br /> <br /> Those who said it was the worst movie at all, I regret how little to stay out of the dampening light in your hearts. Far from the worst film, this film was famous. Long live a crane.
