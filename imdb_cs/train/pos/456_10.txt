It is a beautiful, spiritual renewing movie. From using a real villa that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write a novel in the twenties of the last century to inspired casting, every choice was absolutely right! The silent joy of this film does not stop after repeated views. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright were apparently born to play these parts! I'd love to see Enchanted April released on DVD in a wide-format format.
