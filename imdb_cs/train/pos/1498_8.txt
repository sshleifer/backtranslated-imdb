It's a very funny and sometimes quite spooky anthology that if it's a bit short in the scenario scenario, it's more than to compensate for shortcomings in acting, on-the-job, and overall enthusiasm. The best episodes of this are the first when Denholm Elliot plays the writer of horror, the character of his novel in the work (a perfect example of acting, which he drew from a mere pedestrian); third, with Christopher Lee as a man terrified by his own daughter and the final episode of late late Jon Pertwe as the hero of a heroic movie star who has more than a new role in his latest project. The dialogue between Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt is sparkling and inspired, and apparently enjoys the opportunity to really do it! Cushing is typically good in the weakest segment, which certainly will not help the fact that the waxy figure of the woman she has possessed in the local wax manikin museum is something other than "beautiful" as she tells us she believes it is! Someone shocking beauty needed, and instead we got a woman with a turtle turtle. Small pieces aside of this movie and it's a wonderful setting of a country house is no matter what to catch when you can.
