A bit biographical portrait of Abraham Lincoln in the early years from director John Ford, who concentrated primarily on the lawsuit, in which a young lawyer defends two brothers accused of murder. The film offers an interesting portrayal of this important American character, and the film is well-made, but seems to be somewhat incomplete without having a great moment in his presidency or even his debates with Stephen Douglas. The obvious intent was to portray Lincoln as a young man who developed the attributes that would make him a big man who would happen. But the result for me was such that while I admired the scene, it was just not as content as I think it could be with a larger scale. In the role of Abraham Lincoln we have Henry Fonda, who effectively shows silent power. Performance Funds include some gangs of manners and other affections that are quite effective in portraying Lincoln portraits, especially when combined with some effective make-up and costume, which is sometimes a bit clear. it's solid and surprisingly does not include the fact that many of Ford's regular accompanying casts (sometimes referred to as his joint stock company), but we have Ward Bond one of the most productive actors in Hollywood. Bond has appeared in more AFI Top 100 Films than any other actor, both the original and the revised list. He also appeared in eleven best photographers. The film contains one scene that seems to inspire a fairly similar scene in "Kill and Mockingbird," where it would be even better than it is here, though this scene is one of the most effective in this movie.
