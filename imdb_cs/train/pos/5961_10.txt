I can be biased, I am the author of The Hungry Bachelors Club, which I published in 1994. The script was written by my good friend and hungry bachelor Fred Dresch, who inspired the character of Marlon in the film. I could not be more satisfied with the trailer, I hope to see the whole movie and comment on it. But Jorja Fox, who plays Delmar Youngblood, my character, is stellar. It carries most emotional vehicles in fine form. I could not do better! It looks like real people, barely guiding the formulation, and fortunately guides my statement against the racial prejudices of home, with charm and heart.
