I think it's a nice movie; I think it's a very romantic film through scenery and atmosphere; I think it was not meant to be sensual (sensuality is the result, not the purpose); I think it is very natural; I think it's humane; I think it was interesting; I think actors have never had me think that waw lame works (they're not Sean Connory & Co) nor is the movie a block of Buster, they're like a movie ... a normal ppl that can act ...; I think the film has achieved its intention; I think I felt things (or feel it again :)); I think I'm not objective; <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it ... I know it.
