(Question) What do you call 100 film critics who are buried in the sand? (Answer) Good start. Well, I do not know Petra Mattei from Adam, but if he's a fancier auteur his filmography suggests, "love in time of money" is a "good start". A unique shot with moody music in the style of music, this film looks at a chain of weak relationships as it moves from person A to person B to person C ... etc ... and back again ends with A & B people in carousel fashion. The film gently probes the unfortunate circumstances of nine people with gently shaded shadows beginning and ending the shit and her client. The disadvantage of this film is the lack of a story that may have something to do with the many critical strikes it has gained. I watched the behemoth "Angels in America" ​​last night, and I was bored at the end, while this little concatenation of charismatic characteristics kept me spellbound. Be careful. Maybe I'm the only person she really liked. (B)
