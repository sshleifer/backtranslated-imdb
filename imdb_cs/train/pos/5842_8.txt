Can I be so simple and primitive in my reviews that I just say I like it? It's funny enough, it has great stars and it's wonderful to look. Tracks (about two, which are then repeated) are forgotten, but they get a healthy ironic treatment (such as the terribly handsome Mr. Fairbanks who explodes into the frantic Wagner version of the Miss Balble dance ballet); there is not much dancing with all the 1861 crinolines draped around Miss Grable, and the comedy can be a bit difficult to serve but the result is still very uplifting. Photography (including real outdoor shots that are exciting) is amazing, playing with different shades of fresh heavy gold. Miss Grable is a bit far behind her toe and on the full face but still fresh and comfortable in this continental comedy "olde worlde". It's pretty much along the line "Down to Earth" with Rita Hayworth, and that someone has a lot of reluctance to many. So I suppose some people would consider "that lady in Ermine" as obsolete and exhausted. But it's a fairy tale, and you tend to move along a certain paste in any case. My suggestion is - just enjoy artwork, costumes, humorous screenplay and everything else that this movie offers and stops complaining. The film was released on DVD in Germany, with German and English soundtrack.
