I consider myself a huge movie buff. I was sick on the sofa and appeared in this movie. Right from the start to the end, I watched with wonder the great actors I had never seen, saying a great word. Shooting was beautiful. It was just what I needed. I hope this message will hear about all the bad comments written by others. The director has hearts and beats with all his actors. Thank you for filming a movie like this one. Just amazingly unpleasant, beautiful lovely characters that are disturbed and charming at once. Just great. I can not do it without 10 lines altogether, so I just say that I want more from this director than from all the actors of this film and rather from the writer. I did not want it to end. End
