I look forward to this film, but it's nothing new. Everyone who groups them together with other war films has been wrong in this movie! It's not a war movie more than "One Fly Through the Cuckoo's Nest" is the Asylum or "Cool Hand Luke" is a prison movie. It is a film about individuality, disagreement, self-esteem and the cost of this type of personality. <br /> <br /> This is the same as "One Fly Over Cuckoos Nest" and "Cool Hand Luke", his at GOOD and owns. Her films should be opposed and compared, not "Apokalypsa Now" or "Platoon". <br /> <br /> Eric
