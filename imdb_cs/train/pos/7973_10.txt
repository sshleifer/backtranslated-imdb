Maybe I'm soap, but this is the sweetest movie ever! I saw it for the first time when I was about four or five years old, and I was crying my eyes. Between and now (I'm embarrassed at the age of 15) I've seen it over 25 times and each of them has been sobbing. Do not be afraid they are lucky tears! And it's not all soap! This is a lot of humor and comedy. Usually it can be a huge pull, but it's not like this movie. My only advice: Even if you love it - You do not see the continuing ... fury! I suggest that everyone check it out ... you will not regret it, no matter how old or young you are!
