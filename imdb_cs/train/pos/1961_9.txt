He just came back from the first introduction of Basic Instinct 2. I went into it when I thought it would be bad based on criticism of the preview and I was pleasantly surprised! If you liked the original Instinct, I think you will like # 2 anyway, if not more. A great story that always astonishes and thinks. The music is beautiful, it reflects the original theme. Do not expect to have an Oscar, go for fun and fun. That's what the movies are meant for - an escape. I can not think of a better way to escape than to escape with Sharon Stone, which is as sexy as ever. I mean, I'll be back on this weekend. Go for it!
