Doghi is a wonderful movie and Renuka Daftardar is great. So is Uttara Baokarov√°, who is usually excellent in most of her roles. Together with Kairee, Marathi is one of his best examples. In both films, there are certain parts that tend to be didactic - it would probably reinforce the film so that it does not have few scenes in which the social report is strengthened. These scenes are likely to arise from the political interests of the filmmaker, but the film is realistic and moves sufficiently to avoid it. But besides such bits, his film that deserves to be seen more and one, I strongly recommend. Concerns and humanism Sumitra Bhave's intermingling.
