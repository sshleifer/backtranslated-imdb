This movie was crying at the end! I watch at least 3-4 movies a week. I've seen lots of great movies, even more bullshit. But when the scene ends - katharsic in his core - I came Boy! And if not, you have serious problems! The story is archetypal - nothing new or original. But it is real - because it really did happen and people actually existed. Glam is not my kind of music, but I really admire everything that went through the early 1970s ... At some point, it directed me to Velvet Goldmine! Docudramas never really work. But this movie really calmed down that we believed it all ... Because they are not trying to make it like a journey full of glorious concerts, present musicians who are superheroes, groupies of girls who are stupid and emotionally insensitive, and alcohol, support rehabilitation and redemption, which comes even 20 years later ... Again a great movie. Since "Leaving Las Vegas" I've never been filmed like that.
