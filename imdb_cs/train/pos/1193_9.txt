The recollection of "The Last Hunt" has fallen on me since I saw it in 1956 when I was 13. It is a film that was far ahead of others at that time in dealing with the natives and still the existing contrast between the short-term and long-term effects of greed. Today is as relevant as in 1956, the cinematographic discussion of the highest depth and significance. At the top of the setting is beautiful and cinematography excellent. The memory of this film will be with me until the end of my days.
