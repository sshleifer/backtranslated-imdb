Better than a typical movie made for TV, INVITATION TO HELL is blessed with an excellent cast (Urich, Lucci, Cassidy, McCarthy, pre-Murphy Brown Joe Regalbuto, Soleil Moon-Frye). Urich is always sympathetic and Lucci is especially alert and devilish over the mother's top of all femme fatale roles. It's a hybrid version of STEPFORD WIVES and THEY LIVE, the film will soon bind to its apocalyptic Miltonesque vision, and horror fans probably will not have many complaints until soppy, maudlin denoument. 7/10
