That reminded me of Spinal Tap, on a more serious level. It's the story of a group that makes a reunion tour, but things are not harmonious between them. I was particularly impressed with the performance of Bill Nighy as Ray. You were sorry, but some shyness around him. It's a great movie that can be watched if you've ever seen your favorite band get bent, old and pathetic.Bittersweet, it's recommended ..
