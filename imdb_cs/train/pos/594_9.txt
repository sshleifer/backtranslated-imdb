13 Days Glory tells a traditional story with sympathy for the Mexican view. The main problem with this film was that while Cowboy actor James Arness played convincingly with Jim Bowie, other actors of actors Brian Keith (Davy Crocket) and Lorne Greene (Sam Houston) were too old. > <br /> Raul Julia played General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna with grace and dignity against a professional soldier who eventually won the battle. The scene in which he gets rid of his officers that they could not stand the guards and prevent them from divorcing is a screenwriter they did not understand. Lack of attention is a major weight in the army. Santa Anna was within her privilege to be upset. Raul Julia beautifully carried the wrong writing scene. Kathleen York was an impressive Susannah Dickinson, a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage. However, Kathleen York could have remembered that as Dickinsons invited from Pennsylvania probably did not hear too Southron.
