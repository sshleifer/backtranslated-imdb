Nice character development in a very cool environment. Being a man, I probably do not qualify for full understanding, but they make an opportunity to create a restrictive Victorian environment from the beginning. It's not as bad as it really was, and the treatment of women was probably even more harsh. What he does is a great chemistry among the main characters. Everyone has their "thing" they are struggling with. Once they come out of the rain and set off from spiders, they begin to interact and slowly lose suspicion. What I liked about this movie is that it was not a cheap comedy if it could have. She did not try to teach us lessons. People who seem to have absolutely no merit are truly mature human beings who see the light. I had a little trouble with the personality of Alfred Molin, who had such an apparition so quickly, but it was going to happen in this world. Good works everywhere and something positive happens in the life of some pretty good people.
