Personally, it seems to me that the movie is a very good watch. It outlines the real situation of the triads in Hong Kong and gives the viewer an insight into how triads are organized. Besides, it also shows the audience how the Hondon police control the situation of the triad, and why the police are not just going out and clearing the triads. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is rather violent because of the gangland methods of killing and torturing. However, the film remains true to the real world, so violence on the screen is just a reflection of what's really going on. I would recommend this movie to any Triad / Mafia movie. Another good watch would be the Dragon Squad. The film has more weapons than this because there are more knives than a weapon in this movie (in fact I do not remember seeing one weapon).
