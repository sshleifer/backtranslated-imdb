This movie is SOOOO funny !!! Acting is WONDERFUL, Ramones are sexy, jokes are gentle, and conspiracy is just what every tall schoolboy does with his school. I absolutely loved the soundtrack as well as the carefully based cynicism. If you like monty python, you will love this movie. This movie is a tad bit "grease" esk (without any annoying songs). Songs that are sung are sympathetic; you can even find out that you are singing these songs after you finish the movie. This musical belongs to the other in the musicals (second beside the blues brothers). But please do not think about it as a musical; that as the songs are so pleasant, it is difficult to say that the choreographic scene is taking place. I think of this film as a comedy with romance. You will be reminded of what it was like to be an angry teenager; Needless to say, you will remember your old high school after you've seen this movie. We are highly recommended for the family (because it is very young, but also for adults because there are many jokes that are more fun with age and experience.
