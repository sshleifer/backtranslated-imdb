I remember that when I first broadcast the American Gothic, I found myself in my mind recently, all I remembered was the same guy who appeared in Midnight Caller, which is Gary Cole, I do not watch a lot of television but I was watching on the American Gothic, bought the Complete Series on DVD this week & is still as good as ever, this is one of the best TV series ever, the reason why I do not watch much on television is that it's just garbage besides Derren Brown, it's all Reality TV or soap like Grease, Big Brother, etc., I'm afraid, I got a Complete Series of American Gothic for Â£ 16.97 from Asda's website, it's the cheapest I find.
