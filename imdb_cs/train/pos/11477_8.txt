In my honest opinion, everyone should see this movie at least once. He really was thinking when I was watching it. Though it was fictional, this film is about what could happen to its children. It shows how easily two children can hide both their hate for their school and their plans to murder innocent students. This movie would not work in any other format. They manually pulled the hand-held camera. It reminds us on April 20, 1999, when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold murdered 12 students and then alone. It also reminds us of the media storm that follows. Everyone wanted to see the Rampart video and everyone wanted to see the underlying tapes. This film is a fictional version of our dreams. We see the child as a monster. The only bad thing about this movie is that the market did not work well and few people know it exists. If it had a single insight into a single market, everyone would go and see what it was, Zero Day. I believe it's the best film adaptation of the school from the couple who really tried. Filming itself takes about ten minutes and half a long film because it's mostly about Cal and Andre and what they did. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, go and watch it. I guarantee that when you are done you will be speechless.
