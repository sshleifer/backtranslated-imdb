Generally, I did not get Loretta Young, he was too interested in her appearance and too ladylike in all the wrong ways. But in this lyrical novel by Franco Borzage, and although he plays a low self-confidence that is filled with too much bullying by Paramount Spencer Tracy, he is straightforward, honest and irresistible. It's a strange little movie that's played mostly in a one-room cottage in Hooverville, unusually in the middle of Depression, but romantic and idealized. Tracy, playing the horrific, hard-to-reach "common guy" who would be a terrible chauvinist and anger at today's standards, softens the hard edge of his character and almost makes him attractive. There is good support from Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (which has never been as far as it should), and John Swerling's script is modest and effective. But the real heroes are Borzage, who always liked to dramatize true love in lyrical detail and Young. Something you want to slap and tell her character to be wise, she's too good for this guy, but she's so expensive and convincing, and you're happy to watch their story play a satisfying conclusion.
