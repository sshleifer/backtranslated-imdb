This is a warm, fun movie that is basically the same as the works of Almodovar. Surely a 10-year-old boy sucks milk from his chest, but the style is so playful that I do not even understand all the readers who considered it sick or perverse (but I would be willing to leave my 10-year-old part not so sure!). <br /> <br /> Spanish cinema is often quite a sexual but very open and healthy way that leaves a viewer without any sense of voyeurism. I think that if we had the same approach for Nordic Europeans, it would be much better. <br /> <br /> This liberal attitude is also seen in the merry "Fartman Maurice" character. As his lover says, "Most people are embarrassed with farting, transforming it into an artistic form."
