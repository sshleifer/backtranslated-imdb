Urban Cowboy John Travolta plays one of the most powerful alpha men on the big screen. She is a pretty decent young child leaving the parent's home and going to the big city of Dallas where his uncle Barry Corbin promised to find him in the petrochemical industry. In 1980, it began to widen, and Texas was definitely a growing place in the US. Travolta does a good job of looking at our character, who, when you come down directly to her, is a sexist pig. She meets and marries Debra Winger, who is from the same background, but has some ideas that women should not be the shadows of their men. And when he takes Gilley's mechanical bull, a man's game, it's for him. Scott Glenn, a former convict, works with Gilley, and this film was his job. He's a real snake in Urban Cowboy, he gets Travolta's goat with a glance and he's moving to Winger. Travolta is back with a rich girl, Madolyn Smith Osborne, who behaves in Gilley. <br /> <br /> Despite the characters, Urban Cowboy was really a huge ad for the world's largest tonk hunks. Gilley's is no longer in the suburban Pasadena community in Texas, but the memories are still alive. And the best thing about Urban Cowboy is the wonderful country / western song scores that were featured in the movie. I'm not sure if some of the songs were written specifically for Urban Cowboy, but that's the only reason why I think why the film academy ignored the musical aspects of this film. I especially liked Johnny Lee's Looking For Love, if it was specially written for this movie, it's shame that he was not nominated for the best song. I liked the character of Debra Winger best in this movie. It does not lose the trace of femininity, but she stands on Travolta and does it in style. And this review deals with the still-unknown woman who will one day be the first professional bull rider in professional bull riders.
