Magnetism radiated from Elvira, which draws from its legions of devoted admirers, is of first class quality. With its lengthy, well-toned figure, big bust, innocuous dirty attitude, and lexicon from the megenerational valley slang, Elvira's character is universal and timeless. As an aspirational folklorist and an individual who is deeply interested in the structure of the narrative, it is clear that the person Elvira has some archetypal elements that help make the character more than the sum of her arched unicorns and big chest. As soon as it responds to the way children respond to it, it represents a deep adolescent fantasy for experienced women who can combine their levels: a strange blend of one-dimensional romantic desire, boyish sexual desire, and the desire for unbearable carefree entertainment. It symbolizes an improved idealism of womanhood, which is perfect for boys and a source of power for city girls. Other adults have problems with it for the same reasons. In the end, however, her film can not move through her more occupied folders. The ultimate result is that while Elvira is infinitely interesting, her film is limited by how weak the performance is for her talents. Almost everything is adapted to the attitude of adolescents and although it is a straightforward comedy, only those who can handle the idea of ​​a young person can use these nonsense. Fortunately, I have such a skill and find the film as a wonderful magician. <br /> <br /> Best Quote: Bob Redding: How's Your Head? Elvira: I had no complaints.
