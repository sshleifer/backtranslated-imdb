Now it's more! The first film had some dialogue and some weaker acting, but it seems that the team behind them got their stuff together for the sequel and released a solid, thoroughly fun, cheerful and creative comedy that will have everyone at the edge of their seats path. <br /> <br /> Seriously, it's just a great deal of great stuff, full of creativity, and it's more of a spoof of movies of the 1980s at the same time. The scenes in hell are great and they are in heaven. There is really no shortage of crazy adventure romp that promises you and you never see another movie like this. Even the hammams' final act of the film is not as bad as the first, being generally heartwarming and enjoyable in its extremely clich√© repertoire of family fun movie bliss. And even Keanu Reeves, even looking at thirty, is not that bad. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a good job with me.
