This movie was last week, and although at that time (around 6pm) the quality of the movies is almost never good (at least here on Mexican television), I could not turn off the television. The story of Madeleine Moore really touches you. At first she did not come as a very sympathetic figure, but when she saw the whole movie, you wanted to make her so successful. This movie really lets you think. And I think basically because of Brooke Johnson's great acting. I've never heard of her or seen her in another movie, but it was great acting. Compliments to Brooke. I hope to see her soon in the next movie.
