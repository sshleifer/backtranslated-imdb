Attention Chuck Davis and Emefy: I've seen PHANTOM LADY many years ago when I was not a jazz buff. The exhibition takes place until the end of June in the completely new Paris MUSEU DU QUAI BRANLY, called LE SIECLE DU JAZZ, which you can not miss, as a special entertainment NEW excerpts from jazz movies, including the famous PHANTOM LADY drum series. I have seen Gene Krupa - and Elisha Cook Jr - in almost all of their movie appearances, and I can confirm the following: 1.Elisha Cook Jr was DUBBED in the movie. It was some progress, because in most of his other performances he was killed (mainly in Howard Hawks BIG SLEEP). 2. Krupa probably guessed Cook in PL. I was able to realize my style because she had already been using (and abused) tomatoes at the beginning of her career - in SING, SING, SING in Hollywood in 1937 - and eventually gained everything that was possible, what we are calling in French "la caisse claire". 3. The PL order, at least as stated in the museum, is not censored.harry carasso, Paris, France
