Picking up just after Moscow's revelation of Superiority is Bourne's greatest adventure and its ultimate climax. During a thrilling, 115-minute run, Bourne shoots from Russia to Madrid, Paris, Morocco, and finally to New York. Damon is every inch of heavily trained killer Robert Ludlum imagined he is the most dangerous spy in the movies right now, and that is underpinned by the emotions that make him so credible, and that's exactly the great way Damon can combine these two polar opposites of oneself that are so fascinating. In this third period, Bourne is on a mission to save the soul, and while watching it, Ultimatum brings such highly octane performances that you find yourself in the delight and absorption of his really strong branch of ideas and pulling; just look at two great auto-chase and battle scene as realistic as Bond vs. Shaw in 1963. Director Greengrass was surprised by this surprising thriller and it's about as exciting as film thrillers get; true rewards for Bourne fans and the new standard of the spy thriller.
