Watching this movie again has really brought some great childhood memories. I'm 34 years old, I have not seen it since I was 12-14. I almost forgot about this movie, but when I watched it recently, some scenes literally brought me a tear! That little robot "Jinx" (friends forever!). It was like restoring my childhood. It was a wonderful experience for me. I will always love this movie for this reason. I hope some of you readers can relate to my experience, not for this particular movie, but for some movie you have not seen for a long time. Very nostalgic ... <br /> <br /> - Thanks for reading
