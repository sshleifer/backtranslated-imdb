I saw this movie by Ralph Bakshi (Wizards, Hey Good Lookin ') one night at www.afrovideo.org and I did not see anything racial (I'm not stupid), I admit that character patterns are today, I think, it's satire and a very masterful storytelling of Uncle Remus's old stories that a black American culture created directly to the main characters and a convulsive nod to "The Baby Baby" and "Briar Patch." These are not fake stories, they think of you but cultural icons created by black Americans and me I am a white woman who reads and loves these stories. And I also found this to be an interesting black-culture capsule magazine in Harlem, New York in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> Well, let's get into the stupidity of this movie: This movie is a live action / animated film that begins with a live performance with colleagues called Sampson (Barry White) and Preacherman (Charles Gordone) to help to his friend Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) to escape from prison. ends in a firefight with the police. While waiting for them, Randy listens to Pappy's second escape (Scatman Crothers) as he begins to call Randy's animated story of a rabbit brother, a young novice, into a big city that rises rapidly from uncertainty to rule all of Harlem; you know, for me Rabbit, Bear and Fox are animal versions of Randy, Sampson and Preacherman. Abstract juxtaposition of stylized animations and live action shots, is the film graphic and condemnation of the satire of stereotypes prevalent in the 70s? racial, ethnic and other. <br /> <br /> So it's another good film Bakshi; and should we sweep such films under the carpet? Pretend they never exist? hmmm ... I think it would be a pity; I think we should watch these movies and find out what is happening when we are far away.
