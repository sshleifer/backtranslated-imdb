It was a good movie. It was not your typical war, but something a little different. This film showed us that we recruited before training and did not fight the war. This film is one of the more realistic views of war and army than most other films like this. Colin Farrel did a great job in portraying a military recruitment, and Clifton Collins Jr and Matthew Davis also contributed reasonably. When you see that Colin Farrel moves from b to grade within a few years, you would never have thought it would happen. I also add that the makers of the Tiger country did a great job of filming the film in 2000 and it looks like the 1970s were good. Her good talent saw the talent wisely, and I hope to see this talent again in the near future.
