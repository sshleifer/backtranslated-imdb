I must totally disagree with the other commentary on this film. The visual effects accompany the supernatural motifs of the film, and they do not harm the plot, and I loved this movement not being similar to the Crouching Tiger because this time the sword action had no strings connected and most of the time you can see how the action is coming. <br /> <br /> I think the western audience will be very confused with two scenes, one of which involves a monk who is trying to revive the living, and the other about the villagers singing it's the end of the world. These scenes come from certain interpretations of the Mahayana Buddhist text (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea and Japan) and the second scene deals with a piece in the Japanese calendar ... people believed that the world would come to an end ... Gojoe has an event, a story and visuals that enchant every viewer. I firmly believe that it can be sold in the USA with some kind of dexterity. One of my complaints is in the last battle scene (I can not give anything - sorry).
