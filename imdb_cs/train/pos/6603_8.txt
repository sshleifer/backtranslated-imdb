I have to mention two failures to understand that this movie was greatly successful where they failed: "Darkly Scanner" and "Immortel Ad Vitam". If you were thrilled with the concepts of these two films and felt sorry for disappointment (like me), you probably will have a Renaissance. You will immerse yourself in the world of future Paris. It's not quite a dystopian. They made the animation so good that I thought it was a rotoscope, but it was not what I could say, it was just capturing motion. The expressions of the face are amazing! Ever since I saw TRON, I have seen a fantastic world so well represented in the animated / live hybrid. Black and white media serve to slowly orient your attention to the subject of the scene; my favorite effect was what they did with the headlights, beware of it. The director plays with your attention and confusion, but you are finally happy to find the thread you want to find. The overall effect is a harsh and rugged urban world full of small surprises. <br /> <br /> This plot is secondary, but it's not terrible. It's noir-ish. There's a story for most of the main characters giving them some depth. It's the weather. There are "sets" so you can feel like you are in different places in Paris. There is some action, and even a car hound. I have to look again to get everything. I also recommend a very large screen to see it because the "sets" are detailed and the credits are small.
