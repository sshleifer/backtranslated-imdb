Wow. I saw it last night and I still like it just how good it was. Each character felt so real (though most of them are a tiny, selfish hole), and a bizarre story - a middle-aged widow begins to shake her daughter's ruthless friend, she felt utterly convincing. The best performances all around, but the hats on Anne Reid and Our Friends in the North Daniel Craig (the other one came as David Thewlis). And director Roger Michelle? It's so far from Notting Hill as it may be. Thank God. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie !!!
