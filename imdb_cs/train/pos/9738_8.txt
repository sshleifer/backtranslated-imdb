Oh, dear we do not like our superhero loving interest in brain development? We've become something that happened to people, lost the ability to enjoy, just a good feeling, love story / comedy? Kirsten Dunst's Revelation - Funny, Sexy, and Real. I laughed loudly at least five times, and I'm not ashamed to say he has a tear in his eye a few times too. Cast, acting and script is great, watching a lot of movies right on the record and I have not seen this genre so successful. Those who disagree tell me where I can find some! I'm sure the book is good, but I think you have to judge it for your own merits.
