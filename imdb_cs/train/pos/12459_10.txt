This film is definitely one of my favorite films. Interaction between decent and morally invincible characters is a matter of chivalry and honest code among thieves and cops. He is interested in topics such as duty, guilt, word, manipulation and trust as few films and unfortunately nothing I can remember from the deaths of the police in the late seventies. The sequence is delicious to the point, so it does nothing and leads the viewer into a masterful plot of right and wrong without having any eye of an attractive and spectacular scene that is often needed in smaller specimens of the genre to awaken the audience. No such scenes are present or needed. The argument is fluid and sincere for the viewer, which is an important contribution to the genre in which tensions are often reached through audiences. No, this is not Miss Marble ... Congratulations on the music is fine Film, which looks and saves every minute, not just to see.
