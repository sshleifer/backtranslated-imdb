I have seen this French version of Loesser's Guys and Dolls for the third time with a mother she has never seen before. She was pleasantly surprised by the singing voices of Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando. And she thought the Havana sequences, where Simmons and Brando danced, were excellent. They were pretty impressive and mostly they were the best of the movie. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, this movie, which originated as a story by Damon Runon, takes a while with a slow passage of non-musical scenes, but it will take you for a while. The second story with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine was not so appealing to me, but it still had their charm especially during the "Sue Me". He also loved Stubby Kaye's "Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat" and the performance of Sheldon Leonard and B.S. Pully. Viewers and dolls, with a theatrical look, are not a great movie musical but certainly very good.
