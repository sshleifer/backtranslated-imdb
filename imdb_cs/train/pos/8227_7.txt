An interesting thriller that Paul Winfield has as a detective in the event of a murder. Paul Winfield was an undervalued actor who with such ease pulled all his roles away, it was hard to say that the man even acted. Perhaps most well-known to younger audiences as the voice / narrator of "City Confidential," Winfield ends his career as a film; but as always Winfield shines. The goal is to watch. <br /> <br /> Erika Eliniak is good, Erika Eliniak looks nice, but leaves a lot in the acting department. Although it is fair, it is one of her best efforts. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: An observable thriller that should not be missed by any fan Paul Winfield. A decent telefilm that helped send Paul Winfield to the celluloid sky. What actor. He will be missing.
