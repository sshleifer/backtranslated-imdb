I am surprised that no one has ever mentioned that there are two versions of this film. The lion's share of the paintings is the same, but it differs: In one version (the version I have most often seen on TV), a group of clergy who guard the gate form the "Brotherhood of Protectors," a (fictitious) group of priests and brothers, "excommunicated "churches. In a different version I have seen only once on television, the priests of the official church are depicted as a spiritual defensive gate, meaning the Archdiocese of New York (or possibly Brooklyn). Also in the former version, in most of the important scenes, the clerics are referred to as "brothers" (and in some scenes you can see where your lips say "father" so-and-so, but the dubbed sound says "Brother" so-and-so. I believe that one of these two versions is more or less partial re-shooting of the other, with all the "Brotherhood of the Protector" scenes re-shot as scenes of the "Archdiocese" "or vice versa (Reminds me of Raymond Burr's scenes in" Godzilla "), it's coming out of the broadcast TV, so no, I can not imagine. Can anyone explain the story behind these two versions of the movie?
