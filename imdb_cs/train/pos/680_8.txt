"The Last Wave" is one of those films that hardly rely on the mind. The title relates to the theory of indigenous judgments: the last wave that erases everything.

During the native defense, David learns the theory of the last wave and begins to wonder if it's just mythology. The last sequence of the film is a metaphor for descending into the depths of your mind. Peter Weir created a mysterious but thoughtful film. Indigenous actor David Gulpilil (which you may have seen in "Walkabout", "Crocodile Dundee" and "Rabbit-Proof Fence") provides an interesting supporting role as one of the defendants. <br /> <br /> By accident, watch the "create" feature on the DVD. Peter Weir explains some of the subtleties of the film, some of which relate to Richard Chamberlain's background.
