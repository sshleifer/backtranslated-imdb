Very slow, but complicatedly structured and ultimately very moving. A nice, very true view of a small beach in Florida in the winter - I was there and it is absolutely accurate. It is also the debut role of actress Ashley Judd, and here it makes a great impression. It is hard to believe that this film is 12 years old - I remember seeing it in theaters and recently rented "Ruby". Except for the eighties, it looked very nice. Ashely is so brilliant and touches herself that it's hard to think about her subsequent career without being deceived. Boy, talk about not meeting your early promise! Anyone who would see Ashley here at Ruby In Paradise would assume that this elegant, natural beauty comes to all the interesting artistic films and serious acting acts - instead she has become a "go to" girl for silly action movies and films for slasher! Very disappointing, but at least we have preserved this beautiful performance to show our early promise. <br /> <br /> As other commentators say, it is not for everyone because it is very slow. This is not an action movie, nor a romance. The director (Victor Nunez, "Ulees Gold", another great charity study) treats this playful life of a young woman with deep respect, allowing her story to build slowly and with lots of detail. In this way, I think it's one of the most moving and respectable stories about young women I can recall - it's not Ruby's sexual awakening or "how she lost her virginity," but her life choices and her growing maturity. Nice movie if you want to watch it ... I think it would be a great movie to show teenagers and young girls (or boys) and give them a chance to think and discuss them. A special delusion to director Nunez, who also wrote a script that is so realistic and pretty detailed that I took over the whole film based on a woman's written novel or memory, but in fact it's the original work of Mr. Nunza. Rated 8 out of 10.
