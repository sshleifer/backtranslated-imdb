When I saw this movie, I was amazed at what a great movie it was. This is the only movie I think if I gave 10 stars. I'm sure this movie will always be in my 5th place. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are in their best job. I do not think anyone could do a better job than Kate. <br /> <br /> If it is a rainy day and you can not decide what to rent, this is the one. You will love all the actresses, special effects and much more. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, you will rent it or buy it now! You will not regret it. <br /> <br />
