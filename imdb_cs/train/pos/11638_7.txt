I was having fun with Red Eye. It is not a masterpiece, but it is well focused and structured. Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect in the role. Yes, it's the same old story with another setting, but Wes Craven did it a good pace. At least no more Scream with the usual school killer. It's nice to see a pure, coherent thriller, even if its originality does not look like its main character. Especially from a filmmaker such as Craven, who has brought so many innovative ideas into the thriller and horror genre in the past, and who is now only able to bring home, which could be a good TV film if it was not released theatrically. Good work!
