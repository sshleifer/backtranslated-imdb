I saw this movie on Hallmark, and I thought it was amazing, especially because it was based on a real man. Pierce Brosnan was very good as a lonely English man who married a half Gray Owl. Photography was beautiful. The film made me investigate the character of Archie Belaney, known simply as the gray owl. I want to read about it as much as possible. At that time, I did not know Richard Attenborough directed him. But I'm not surprised. I like all his films, whether acting or driving. I gave him the highest rating. However, I would like to see more in the film about why he took this personality because he showed only the two dudes that lifted him and his room in their house. You can not go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story without having to hear the bad language and fictional special effects every few minutes.
