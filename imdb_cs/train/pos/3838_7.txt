FOUR CHILDREN (Paul Verhoeven - The Netherlands 1983). The film is based on the novel by Gerard Reva, which works best as a thriller. This is quite surprising, given that Reve roughly needs a hundred pages for a tiny twist of twist and tension is the last thing I have in mind when reading his work. <br /> <br /> "The Fourth Man" is top symbolic. Paul Verhoeven is generally extremely concerned by being able to prove something to most enemy critics, and I'm never sure what he is trying to prove. He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in an unsatisfactory way, deviates quickly from his original thought or plot, and almost seems to forget what is to be seen on the screen and what should be left out. The "Fourth Man" is not so explicit as to describe the conspiracy as it is with sex and nudity (which is a lot), but like most movies, it seems that the viewer is not going to get away and the home of a story with with clear symbolism mixed with some allegedly shocking nudity and graphic sexual scenes. It's barely a scene without sex or a full queue of nudity, most of it so undisguised and in your face undermines another good story. <br /> <br /> However, when you can cope with Verhoeven's pretty satirical approach, it's a pretty fun thriller sometimes with some interesting plot and good performances everywhere, specifically Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabb. > <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
