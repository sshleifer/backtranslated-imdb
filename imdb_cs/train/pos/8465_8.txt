Booth gives a completely new treatment to your typical J Horror movie. This film will put you in the role of protagonist of the story. The director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thinks. The story is about perceiving people who work, live and love our protagonist and perceive the people who surround him with the outdated DJ station of the stand. The story reveals the layers of the main character as the bulbs in the flash as the film runs, and we learn that things are not always as it sounds. The film mostly took place in a small, obsolete radio station with a very bad history when the main character was forced to broadcast its radio show due to a radio station that was in the process of resettlement. It is from this limited space that this film thrives and feels very claustrophobic and very paranoid. At a time when our protagonist can not find out what strange events in the old studio were caused by the spiritual or some plot of his collaborators, or that was all in his mind. What I like in this movie is that movie makers bring you through the eyes of the main character and make you as paranoid as the protagonist. This film is a very clever, relatively short 76-minute film.
