I saw this movie by accident because I bought it as a side B on the DVD The Omega Man. The Omega man was a bit disappointed - except for the beginning, which was a clear inspiration for 28 days later, the rest is just a matter of television films. But Soylent Green is in another league. I bet he's one of Tarantino's favorites. There are at least 3 scenes in the movie I have never seen before. Heston happened to get into the bed with "furniture" and talked about something else that did not quite fit! A whole crowd of people filled with a fleet of mechanical excavators! A priest who is confessed and is shot by a confessor. Maybe that's been the case since then - but there are not many films that are so consistently original. And what happens between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this the least likely gay couple ever, or what? Fortunately, I saw this film without knowing the end - which is probably rare. Then I watched it again and enjoyed all the small footprints that make that long early scenes worth it. Very nice scenario - and great files. Just when you thought you saw everything. . .
