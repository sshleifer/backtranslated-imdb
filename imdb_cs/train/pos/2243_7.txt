I thought the whole movie was beautiful with fresh pictures and interesting cinematography. The actors were at the top of their character in almost perfect timing and looked great. The music was fresh and well thought out. She even had a decent ending. So what about every vote? The story was not entirely fresh (he felt like a remnant of "Running Man" with the whole idea of ​​a TV show), but the attitude to Christianity and Judaism on how the public chooses their Messiah was definitely true. It was meaningful to watch one man who was placed in front of the modern crowd and put him on the pedestal because of his opportunity. It is possible that Christians or other religious people will pick it up because the movie has the word "God," but it shows what the filmmakers were trying to do is teach the possibility to people who may have never seen such a world, especially in a modern world where Christianity increasingly accepted and forgotten by some. <br /> <br /> I gave her 7/10 stars to IMDb. I thought every ounce of the movie was fun and original, for the most part. See if you are not too hurt to see a fun movie from Madrid, Spain, about the possibilities of the upcoming modern Messiah near the television near you.
