I started with this movie with a bit of exhausted hack-and-slash movies that appeared on the screen today. Boy, I was surprised. This little treasure was pleasantly crossed by the dark atmosphere. Even more surprising was indeed a very limited amount of blood. As with most good movies, this leaves something fantastic, and Bill Paxton did a great job of directing. The scenes that were shot inside the car are well done, and after watching the episode "Scene Anatomy" at the end of the videotape, it was good to see that some gentle yet amazing things I noticed were deliberate and not just "Oh, it looks good , hold it "direction type. It's a bloody film full of blood. Yet, for a dark subject, a large part is filmed in daylight, even some of the more disturbing scenes. Acting is exceptional (Well, I've always been a fan of Powers Booth), and never exceeds the top. Au Contraire is very subdued, which works very well for this type of movie. If there is an area where this film lacks, it's the end that seems a little too distorted but still works at a simpler level without destroying the mood or message of the film. What's the message? It's something that everyone chooses. Overall, in the range of 1-10, this film achieves 8 points for those who like the South Gothic genre (ie "Body Heat" or "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil") and about 5 for those.
