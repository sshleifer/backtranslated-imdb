It took a long time until I found a title in a special videotape in Berlin and I was lucky to find an English version with Dutch subtitles. I think this is one of the best horrors. It seems strange to me that some people call this movie a black comedy. I have to admit that I could not laugh when I first saw it (and it was the same for the second time!) Trelkovski seems to be so nice and even cute in his shy behavior on one hand but on the other hand he defeats this boy on the pitch and there is no explanation for that. The heaviest thing, however, is his transformation into Simone Choule and the fact that he does not know who he is. His hallucinations are most frightening in this film. Of course, it's all in his mind, but it's the apartment that brings this woman's side out of him, or he was before he moved - I think that's an interesting question. His schizophrenic behavior is hard to grasp, and it is terrible to see his two sides or identities fighting each other. As a result, she cuts off her hand for the first time and then jumps out of her window. But this terrible scream - that is, everything repeats itself and over and over again ... that his soul is in a cage or something? And these Egyptian hieroglyphs and other Egyptian things? The fact that she looks like a mummy in the hospital - it's not an incident, but an idea from my point of view.
