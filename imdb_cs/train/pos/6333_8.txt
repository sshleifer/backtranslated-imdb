I just used this video and watched it last night. It started extremely badly (hey ------ hey ------ twister), but soon after the rounds he got very good. Tornado looked extremely fake, and many of the effects of CGI were very nasty, but the scene that the house crumbles and the contents inside was melting and drying was extremely well done and almost the same as films like Twister. Scenarios of devastation have been exceptionally well done. The story was very well written and it's a refreshing film to see, like a departure from the same old "catastrophic recipes," movies of this genre seem to have been stuck for 30 years. The film had a very strange mix of FX and acting quality, it deserves And in my book.
