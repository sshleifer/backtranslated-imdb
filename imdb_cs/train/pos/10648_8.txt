What can I say about "The Haunting" not being told? It has everything that could make a great picture. Beautiful sets, moody music and sound design that died were all right. However, the scenario sometimes dampens the mind in such a special, surrealistic way. The whole team had to forget about reading, perhaps because they were too busy creating cg effects and building Goths to see how weak the plot was. Each cast member gives good performance, though with little conviction to the material at hand. Lili Taylor has something to do, while others usually react to her. But that's about it. All I can say is that it was a bit pleasant for two hours, but you'll want more. Much more.
