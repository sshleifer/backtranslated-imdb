This is not a film critique, but rather a commentary on how we are blind to our past. I recently watched the Winter Soldier, and The Ground Truth was like watching a remake or a sequel - except that it was Iraq rather than Vietnam. Like the Winter Soldier, because it is a one-sided message, both films illustrate how joyfully immerse in conflicts based on false pretenses and allow our young and courageous (and often naive) to bear the head of this greedy warfare. Both films actually show that mentality forced into the minds of the young and willing makes them effective killing machines, but training falls unhappily without teaching the diplomatic and police skills necessary to effectively harvest the hearts and minds of the people they are supposed to fight for. This eventually lost the Vietnam War and probably lost the war in Iraq. <br /> <br /> My only negative comment is that the film is so one-sided that it could easily be released as a leftist propaganda. Not me, you think, but those who aim to discredit the film and the message. A more balanced view would speak to a larger audience.
