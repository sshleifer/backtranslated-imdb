Streisand fans, who have become acquainted with her FUNNY GIRL work, must see this show to see how great the artist Streisand WAS - before achieving her goal of becoming a movie star. She was never a female singer who would look like her anytime before, and never again (I'm sorry, Celine - just in your dreams!) But Streisand will never sing with life, energy and above all with ENTHUSIASM and VULNERABILITY she plays - until she got to the concert in Central Park two to three years later, she shot FUNNY GIRL in Hollywood and her acting style became more spontaneous and reserved, let's say it: more anger) - there is a wall between her and the viewer . The live actress was never what she really enjoyed - she did it because she knew it was her ticket to Hollywood, and when she did not have to do it anymore, she did as little as possible (that legendary phase, apology!). The vocals here and on her earlier performance Judy Garland Show are unbelievable: Streisand could really make an old song that sounds again and composers like Richard Rodgers and Harold Arlen loved it for it. But in the 1970s, Streisand was trying to be a "rock" singer, her albums a young audience, with a supernatural cry of songs that were not worth her effort or voice. <br /> <br /> In the eighties, she returned with this great "Broadway Album," but she continued on and on what the fight was like to do, how "they" told her, etc. Oh, when did someone tell Streisand what to do? It could do a good thing like that, bring the audience up to her instead of leaning on what she thought the young public wanted. (The "Back to Broadway" sequel was not as good as Streisand seems to need to improve the work of other composers: if he was alive at the time, Richard Rodgers could even recognize his own "Some Enchanted Evening" Rodgers, famous for singing the singers to play with melodies, would undoubtedly sing on Streisand what he wrote! "Michael Crawford also blows out of the CD in his Music of the Night duel to obviously remind him which CD it is: Why does he insist on writing songs who are duets singing on their own, and songs that are not duets and singing them like duets with someone else, Judy Garland supposedly Judy Garland took her aside and advised her: "Do not let them do what they did to me, "advised Streisand without killing, despite protests against it, it seems to have always been her way or highway. Just imagine - she told her CBS brasser how she would make her first TV specialty - no guests, only JE, but no one can argue about the results that are so obvious here. Enjoy this brilliant musical phenomenon before it was a legend - you'll be totally surprised by the difference! PS - I saw it again yesterday night (12/01) when I did not see it for many years - it was even better than I remembered! The first law begins with "I'm late" and includes "Make Believe" and "How Wine Taste," and Barbra's Tribute to Childhood, "I'm Five" - ​​culminating as Streisand appears full FULL) to sing "People" she is bored with this song, and although it's a slightly shorter issue, it's actually growing - it's compared with some of her later "autopilot" versions. The second act (after the "kooky" schtick-stroter, which has not changed much over the years) is the famous series of music songs, which is in the middle of Bergdorf-Goodman's extravagance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I fear the audience and dissatisfaction with such performances may have been the hardest for them, but if it is, it is not a sign for her. It goes beyond "Lover Come Back to Me" and "When the Sun Comes Out" (although I do not remember the order!) Pride "Why did I choose?" (One of my most popular Streisand features FUNNY GIRL, including (of course) "Do not Rain on My Parade," and my favorite song from "The Music That Makes Me Dance." The explanation that "Fanny Brice was singing such a song in 1922 and she made a toast on Broadway, "Streisand then sings" My Man, "and it's almost a dressing gown for her later screening in FUNNY GIRL (the main difference is that the black cloak here is sleeveless - the movie dress has a long sleeves and on the black background we all saw her hands and face), but the vocal here is more urgent and more agitated than her later vocal. (Her performance song has everything to do with Streisand and nothing to do with Fanny Brice who, of course, never sang a song in so all-out is how Streisand is doing here or in the movie - see THE GREAT ZIEGFIELD to see Brice's undervalued version.) The show ends with the singing of Streisand "Happ y Days Are Here Again. "It was after all I said to a friend with whom I watched her:" NEVER EVER, doing nothing better! "And she was twenty-two years old!
