After reading a diamond book, I was a little disappointed in the series, but overall it is quite informative. When reading other comments, it is nice to know that "culture warriors" are hard at work, see "attacks" on "Western civilization" underneath each rug. Is Diamond a Few Sermons? Sure. Just as many academics see his theory as the most important thing at all. He uses the term "weapons, germs and steel" for seemingly every opportunity during the series. We got it after the first 10 minutes. Is Diamond a Simplifying (in Series)? Sure. Part of the Spaniards in South America is especially fun and condensing a very long and complicated history to "smallpox, swords and horses" and killing the entire conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. But this point remains valid - these things really contributed (but did not fully define) the reasons for Spain's success against established cultures. Is it a preaching * against * Western civilization in some way? No way. There is no word. Not in your ear. The only thing he says is that happiness played a big role in determining which cultures progressed faster than luck was the only reason. Finally, if you are looking for something that confirms your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. However, if you are interested in all the factors, rather than how the company is doing or failing, this series is a useful interpretation of historical evidence.
