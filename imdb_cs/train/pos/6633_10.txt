The first movie ever to be shot. Workers flow from the factory, some cyclists, most walking, moving to the right or left. Together with Melies, Lumieres is the starting point and starting point for cinematography - with Melies begins narrative fiction, cinema, fantasy, shot, theater; with Lumieres pure, unobserved, observing. Truth. There are many intellectuals who litify the ossification of cinema from the second to the tired former recipes. But consider that shortcut again. This is nothing "objective". The film is full of action - the static, inhuman scene breaks into life, activity and the quiet harmony of the frame is torn apart, decent from the back to the right or to the left (but never, of course, the front where is the camera). Still, the camera still stands, contains energy, possible subversion, subordinates to its will. A cinematographer may be a revolutionary invention, but will be used for conservative purposes - map the world, modify, restrict, restrict. <br /> <br /> Worst is the historical reality of the movie. These factory workers are employees of Lumiere. The bosses spit on their laborers, invisible eyes on their helpless servants. The film therefore describes two types of imprisonment. Behind the gates workers are restricted at their workplace. Opening the gate seems to be an image of freedom, escape, but faces another wall, a fourth wall that further restricts it. The first film is also the first example of CCTV surveillance, the image of an invisible, omnipresent organ that captures its servants. A scary, too prophetic movie.
