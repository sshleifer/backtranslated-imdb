At first I was totally out of the first-rate lyrical film, and then I was completely enchanted by the developing story and had a great overhead. The characters were fully developed, not bigger than life, but just like the people we live in, wherever we are in the world, in Sweden, in Turkey or in America, all the completely credible human beings with weaknesses and nobility. Hollywood could learn so much from this beautiful movie. It turns out that there is no need to go into every detail for every action that brings a clear and clear whole subject, and it shows the brilliance of the director! Hearfelt thanks to Kay Pollak and a wonderful cast for this great experience!
