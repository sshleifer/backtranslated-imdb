Shintar≈ç Katsu, who played the blind Zatoichi swordsman in a total of 27 films, ends the Hanzo trilogy with this excellent film in which he falls in love with the ghost, Mako Midori (Blind Beast). <br /> <br /> The great stick, which was often used in the practice of justice, is forever retired. Katsu was his usual unnamed name when he pursued those who would steal from the treasury to lend for a violent sum to those who could not afford to pay. <br /> <br /> I was presenting the usual amazing sword and skill of a big boy along with blood. I miss it.
