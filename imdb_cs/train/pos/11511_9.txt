Weak scripts occasionally? Yes! Special effects of cheese sometimes? Yes! Do you love most of the time? Yes! More about Carl Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Yes! I've always enjoyed science fiction as a child, but found so much Dracula / Frankenstein / Mummy / Horror as just so much bullshit. It took Abbott and Costello to give me a new look at classic monsters and I had Carl Kolchak to win me on the "dark side" of fun. The Duke had Rooster Cogburn, Eastwood had Dirty Harry, Garner had Maverick and Rockford, Selleck had Magnum, and Darren McGavin had Carl Kolchak. Mixed with all these weak scripts, cheese special effects, a baroque group of supportive characters and actors and stars, Darren McGavin was like Carl Kolchak. He had a sense of humor despite the dangers, he was an idealist in the search for truth and a realist when he accepted the compulsory incompetence and the possible cover-up of government officials. In addition, unlike 98% of us, Kolcak was willing to push his neck and do what needed to be done, even if it meant his disappearance, the end of his journalistic career or his jail. Due to all his faults, including without any taste in his clothing, Carl Kolchak was the man of charm and joke who was on his way to save the day for humanity, the beautiful classic yellow Mustang (which was an old used car). Just like any other fictional hero Carl Kolchak, every single week of Darren McGavin was brought to life by every hero. Now that it is handed over and its show is on DVD, I hope she will have fun while looking at how I look at how he enjoys playing Kolchak The Night Stalker again!
