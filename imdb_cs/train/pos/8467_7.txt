I like this movie because it basically did more and less. It might have been more interesting if they stayed even more in the studio (although some elements would have been harder to develop). The guy who played the DJ did a good job to show someone scared and scary memories. I also found his dialogue with the callers quite funny. While part of the movie you see coming miles away, other parts you do not expect to show how they did it. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a largely harsh ghost story that focused more on the living side of the equation. The last 5-10 minutes were pretty well done when everything was revealed. <br /> <br /> Although it was a shorter film, it felt like it was probably the right time to tell the story. Even more and it began to pull.
