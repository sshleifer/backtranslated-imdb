This movie struck me as a project that had a lot of good ingredients, but they did not quite meet on the way somewhere. I do not know who did it, but it has a little Disney feeling. While some of them are unlikely (like when they go to a public office before adolescents) and tend to prevent the story from being taken seriously, there is a healthy dose of normality (whatever it is) to keep things balanced and perspective. The game is fine. Interestingly, the relationship between Frankie and Grandma is convincing, but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is a bit ... off. It's interesting to see how hard he has to work to maintain a balance between his best friend, grandmother and two passions: ballet and baseball. I was a baseball player myself, it was pretty painful to watch Frankie try to keep his own team of boys, but it's a good job to show the match he's struggling with. Somewhere I read that she is not really ballerina, but the adaptation in this movie was a very good job when her dance appearance not only naturally but beautifully. Overall, it was a good film about honesty and ambition, but his star Mischa Barton did not reach the realism we saw during Lawn Dogs, "Lost and Delirious" and her small but shocking performance opposite Haley Joel Osment in "6. meaning ".
