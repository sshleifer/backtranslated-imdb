The party, in my opinion, could be, in my opinion, the greatest filmmaking of adults of all time. It is made in such a wonderful way and the actors are greatly portraying their roles. The kitchen scene with Yvonne and Juli Ashton is spectacular. Using butter and milk really does the scene. In addition, the medical scene is well done. The campfire scene is full of enjoyable events, although the selection of actors in this scene is controversial. Carrera's Asian performance on the girls scene is unbelievable, but whoever would expect less. The final scene is somewhat predominant in adult movies, but it is classic. I recommend this movie to all fans of adult films and to informal viewers. Go to your department store and get it today.
