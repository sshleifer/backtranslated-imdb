I watched that film did not wait too much and did not know anything about it. I loved it. Very good, careful conspiracy, an interesting hook in the shape of an ugly, thick, deaf girl and ex-con and a tempo that kept things going without hurrying. <br /> <br /> Many, much better film than the same director De battre mon coeur s'est arreté, which was boring and incredible. The only thing that did not quite work out was that the allegedly ugly, fat girl was neither ugly nor fat: hard, certainly not far from conventionally beautiful, but with such a large nature in her face that she took over the screen whenever she was on her. Splendid. I wish she was in more movies and better than usual. I saw a little bit of Gilles' wife and some shrubs and both looked like garbage and I saw all the battre mon coeur s'est arreté and that's definitely waste. He seems to have a few people, so I keep my fingers.
