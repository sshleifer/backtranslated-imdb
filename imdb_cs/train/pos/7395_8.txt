Almost the entire film takes place in a public bath in China. There are no fantasies, blasts or charming people - just fine writing, playing and leading (Hollywood, note!). The stolen son returns home when he believes his father is dying. He is surprised to see that Dad looks good and goes as a normal family business. In fact, he notices that his father and his retarded brother really have created a close and careful relationship, and it will soon be obvious that he is out of the loop! Dad is very traditional and this guest son is from a big city and really does not see the value of an old spa. How does their relationship change and where the conspiracy is from here is exceptional and believable. I was happy that not every Chinese movie is an action picture (for example, those who play Jet Li or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) because I'm not particularly interested in these frenetic movies. Shower and Spring in a small town are two wonderful examples of good Chinese movies about the people!
