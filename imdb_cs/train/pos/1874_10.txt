Everyone should see this movie because each of us is broken in some way and can help us realize 1) My life is not as bad as I thought it was and 2) How important it is to take a child in distress. There are so many people. Thinking that the film was really based on a real person made us think deep into life and how the world has and will always be. Corrupt, but corruption does not have to reach your home. We all have a choice! Surely to recommend ... and when you're in, I'd like to throw "The Color Purple" and "Woman, Thou Art Loosed" by TD Jakes. <br /> <br /> These are all movies that are based on life and give us a look at life.
