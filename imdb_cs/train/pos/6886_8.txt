Unlike other films, the closest thing I can compare is Woody Allen's film ... But where Woody Allen is constantly developing human weakness, Bret Carr seems to be trying to find a way to cope with one paralyzing uncertainty , which tends to define us for better or worse. In the case of Lou, it is the main cause of his stuttering, which can be traced back to the unique trauma of a child's hood that is revealed by flashes. the world and I believe that everyone deserves a chance to redeem, although the variety of human nature is after all what makes the world so interesting, so maybe we should not repair our neurosis any more than repair our noses or breasts. /> <br /> This is an independent film shot on a long track, but the production values ​​are huge as well as the range of the film. I feel it is a special jewel for the market with my own strength. I'm really looking forward to seeing what this filmmaker is doing, I could imagine a career in Woody Allen or Albert Brooks, though usually when such a guy broke, he disappears and makes "X MEN" and his humble unpredictable origins are soon forgotten, or they are .... X Men is a a bunch of charm if I remember well :)
