Poor Geeky Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is terribly burned for the cruel April crazy day. Flashing for the past ten years, and participants (including Caroline Monroe, known to horror fans for her spinning in Maniac, Faceless & The Last Horror Film) in prank are psyched for the upcoming ten-year high school meeting they do not know that the mask killer is hiding in closed) school and outside for revenge. Capture it as a guilt, I knew it was a bad movie. It has all the features of one. Still, it's something that made me look from time to time (preferably with a beer in hand). I'm even willing to overlook the absolutely horrible ending (which I have to say, I hate). I think I like it because it has a fun atmosphere and a lot of cold killings. <br /> <br /> Candy Eye (For Men): Josephine Scandi & Donna Yeager Both Get Topless <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (For Ladies): Free cock shot Simon Scuddamore at the beginning of the movie <br /> My Classes: B- <br /> <br /> Lionsgate DVD Extras: Optional Trivia Track; trailer for this film; and trailers for My Bloody Valentine (1981), Monster Squad, Dirty Dancing
