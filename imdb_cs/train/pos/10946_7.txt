Do not listen to dirty critics who are likely to suffer players who have been terrified a few months ago from roasting Silverman, who left them playing Spike TV Video Game a few months ago, "Sarah Silverman" is surprisingly bizarre, surrealistic, immature, ridiculous is rather nice in Adult Swim. If Silverman dampens teen jokes and stresses the darker, deeper attic to which the show has been shown so far, we could have one of the biggest cult comedies of the canceled "Strangers With Candy". But watching the pilot, it's just a solid, lofty, uncompromising dark comedy / musical, but with tremendous potential. <br /> <br /> Silverman has created a cheerful child character character - a prettier, younger, Jewish American princess of late Jerri Blank and the show is one of the most unconventional, non-stereotyped gay couple portraits I've ever seen on television. Early reviews suggest that the next few episodes outweigh the pilot so I can not wait to see how this show unfolds.
