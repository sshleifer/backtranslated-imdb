French film Ester Williams would love. Synchronized swimming was, however, only a hook on the story of three girls in the exteriors in Paris. There is no question where Sciamma's sympathy lies because all the boys are depicted as "animaux," but in fact only 3 girls are in focus and all the time, with little adults and other adolescents mostly in the background. Mary is a girl girl, unattractive but determined. She wanted to be a swimmer and attracted to Florian (Renessence's beauty of beauty by one reviewer), and she is also an appreciative friend of Anna: not unattractive, but for her, the time of perfection of her body was short, and now she is a teenager in a woman's body. The result is a path to self-realization without a planning plan, but it's a little awkward that it's a bit unnatural: where is the cheerful and hopeless thumping? While the d√©nouement was breathtaking, with Florian's self-absorption beautifully rendered, as well as the equally beautiful connection between Marie and Anne, it all looked abstract, Sciamma puppets.
