"Some at the door." OHHH, I miss this show so badly ... but we are lucky to have an "invasion" now. Thank you, Shawn Cassidy. American Gothic, it had everything. If I had to choose one thing that best liked the show, it must be her "unpredictable plot". The favorite actor was Lucas Black .. I love her southern accent. I bought the DVD as soon as possible and my children are also fans. Some hot n smelling scenes. Some devilish ones. So if the baby is going to look, you may want to adjust it (quick skip / skip). He has a humor, at the level of Joss Wheaton, for which such a show is missing. Adult joke and adult situation with fines. The DVD has some accessories, but I wish it was a lot more. If you want to get excited and enjoy a great show, add the "American Gothic" watch!
