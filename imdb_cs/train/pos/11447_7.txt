This movie is probably for you. She had a total meditative quality from music to beautiful photography, and often listened to the clich√©s of life that Andy Goldsworthy would say when he worked or between shots. If you are familiar with Buddhism - that's the kind of sense I got from this movie. The continuity of life, the beauty of nature, the interconnection of all things, etc. However, what I did not understand, confused and eventually forced me to leave without completion (I saw it over an hour), the whole thing was superfluous. You will find only the pieces, why he is commissioned, and how he can afford to live out of this kind of work. Works of art come alive, but speaking without conclusions leads to dead ends.
