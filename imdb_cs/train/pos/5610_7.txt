Roman Polanski masterfully manages this kind of variation on the same theme as forgiveness. I can not imagine there being an honest moviegoer who would not be able to recognize an outstanding director at Le Locataire, but the two parts of the dipstick may not be all right for most people, including me. <br /> <br /> Polanski is a very good way to feel the inner torture of his character (Deneuve in Repulsion and himself in Le Locataire), begins with a certain lack of self-confidence, which will gradually turn into a psychological restlessness and eventually blooms irreversible physical illness. Shared suffering for characters and audiences is really different from the fear and tension of horror films because there is no tangible supernatural element. While horror films allow some sort of catharsis (whether it's cheap or more complicated), Polanski sadistically tortures us, and if his last humor is dark, we are mostly nervous, unlike the edge of our seats. <br /> <br /> Miracles, horror, all this is a matter of playing with the expectations of the audience (alternatively it is crazy and fulfilling), not literally with people's nerves. In my book, Rosemary's Baby is much more successful, because utter paranoia and simple rationality are in constant struggle: the story is about a couple moving in a strange apartment while we are forced to identify with one character. What's more, if all the fantastic elements are in the hero, the situation is most unpleasant because we, the audience, are forced to judge him, to reject him while we were masterly tempted ("painting").
