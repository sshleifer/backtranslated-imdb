This movie is perfect for all romance in the world. John Ritter has never been better and has the best movie in the movie! "Sam" throws near home, it's beautiful to look at them and so much fun to play with. Ben Gazzara was an excellent cast and easy to fall in love with. I'm sure I met Arthur somewhere in my ways. Everywhere, a great choice to pick up in the evening! :-)
