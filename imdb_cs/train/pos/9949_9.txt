This is quite a nice surprise. A cute little story of a heroic expedition, a very surprising metamorphosis of a four-member brunette who soon becomes a spinster figure into the fairy-tale queen sex queen. <br /> <br /> Visually look at the painful eyes, not just for two pretty stunning actresses, but also for (most) costumes and make-up actors. Unnecessary cheapness brought some ridiculous imitation of the castle. Back to positives: The film is spiced with some unusually explicit cameras that you would not expect in a soft core. It loved the scene with icicles, the absolute classical potential. A slight minus only for (very) few weird scenes, where the malfunction of small casts soon paused the suspension of unbelief. <br /> <br /> 9/10 including another credit for a serious tearful effect.
