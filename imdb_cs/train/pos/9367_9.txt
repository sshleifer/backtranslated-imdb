It's not too often that the movie can literally listen to the audience and fill the eyes with tears five minutes later. Many movies try to do it, but little can bring the emotional impact of this film. Adam Sandler virtually pulls you through his heated and often violent explosion, but he also laughs at you when his past does not draw. I'm not going to ruin anything, but there's one scene that should have watering eyes and my lips trembling. Even most of the macho men would have to be heartless bastards not to feel anything watching this movie. Don Cheadle gives another great performance, but Sandler is out. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith give a solid performance, but none of what is in both major roles. Sandler's humor is still present, which in fact saved this film from being borderline depressed. There are a few laughs that you need to have, but do not think you will stay here long, because it will be serious again without a great warning. I could go on and on, how well this film touched upon every emotion that the human body contains, but I will shorten this. I feel there's nothing more to say. Make a favor and pay attention to this movie. Even if you have to wait for it to come out on DVD, it's 100% time. Deeply moving film that tears you in your eyes and a smile on your face ... if of course ... you are heartless.
