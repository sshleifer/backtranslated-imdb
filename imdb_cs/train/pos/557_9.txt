When I left Skagway, Alaska in Dawson City, before Yukon a few years ago and I was amazed by nature, I can not just wish that this film, even though it has beautiful colors and picturesque views, would be shot in the real spot. Jasper in the Canadian Rocky Mountains is a wonderful place, but it is still not the real place where the film takes place. When the story moves to Dawson, it is when I feel that Anthony Mann, who so well used outdoor locations, could do the best if he made a real place. James Stewart is again a man fighting in himself, one party does not want to get involved and helps people who are worth it to make money, and the other side simply is not able to turn away from the murdered people. Ruth Roman is an ambitious woman who does not care who she is, Corinne Calvet is a pretty girl. Mann is an excellent shot director, but the top of the film is how well he does in outdoor scenes. He enjoys the most outdoors and helps him with winter scenery, predominantly white, as was the case with Greens in "Naked Spur" and Brown in the "Laramie Men". Like all Mann-Stewarts, it is a traditional Western, with a difference in the processing of Stewart's character, which is more complex.
