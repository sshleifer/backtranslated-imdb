Kolchak is absolutely fun. Great stories and great cast, and nothing else they value. Darren McGavin gives an energetic performance that attracts the audience. Simon Oakland, Jack Grinnage and Ruth McDevitt give McGavin solid support that most leading actors can only dream of. Some outstanding stars add color and warm episodes - Erik Estrada in Terror Heritage, Phil Silvers in Horror Horror, Antonio Fargas in Zombie. It's easy to see how a boy spent watching Kolchak directed Chris Carter to create the X. Darren - RIP files. Simon - RIP. Ruth - RIP.
