I had to see the whole movie last night and it was very exciting to me. At least it was not like teen-slasher movies that appear at any moment. Finding the killer and the relationship between the hero and the so-called bad was part that I liked the film. I also remember when I was on the edge of my seat during a particular scene in the movie. I think it's exciting. I think after some time later I could watch the movie again. ..
