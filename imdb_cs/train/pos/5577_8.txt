This time I did not really smile at the film in a very long time. The ice cream that Hollywood has recently given me brings me to the wall! This was obviously fresh and funny. If you look at demographic ratings, only a few women voted! I do not want to destroy the movie for you, but I'm sure every guy who saw it ran into his computers to evaluate him and give him a bad score, why? Because the film puts men in their place, it's a reason. If more women vote for this movie because of its real humorous value and not because it is harmful to men ... it could be easily a "7" rated movie!
