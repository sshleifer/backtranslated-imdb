I read a little Chea before looking at this film and wanting to know it was a real hero for people because he just wanted to see equality for everyone and that he hated what made the repressive forces of his people like all the other Latin Americans in general! Now I do not know about others, but for me I did the right thing by wanting socialism so everyone had to pay their fair share. The strong elite, however, apparently did not lend for it. So, rather than understand what Che Guever wanted, they were forced to kill him in an attempt to suppress the revolution. It did not work because there were too many other followers who just picked up where it ended. A good example of this was when Castro continued his leadership in Cuba. As for me, and how did he say to himself before he died, "If you kill me, it's okay, but you kill only man, you will NEVER kill it!" I could not say it better by myself. <br /> <br /> But ... ALWAYS ... so I give this movie 7 out of 10.
