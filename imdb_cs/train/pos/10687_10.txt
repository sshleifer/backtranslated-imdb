I have to admit that I was completely shocked by this film. I went to see one of the whims that expected something average, but it was most shocking that it was in the populist American cinema at all. It's a British comedy in her most beautiful - dark, weird and fun ways that American movies are never. I must, however, stop shortly recommend it to anyone without reservation; I went to see it with a few people, some English, some European and some Americans and some of us loved it (mainly from the first two groups), some hated it and found it worthless. If you think you are on such a thing, go. If not, no. 10/10.
