A direct story is the story of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives across the border. He decides to go to his little kitten because he could not drive, and he wants to jump. The movie beautifully portrays his way and the life that touches the road. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth will show up in a beautiful performance as well as the rest of the cast, most notably Sissy Spacek in a cute performance as his daughter, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but never-ending role. > <br /> At first I felt that the story of an old country trip would be boring, but soon I found out that Lynch, with all the insights into human life, is doing this film that I would recommend to somebody.
