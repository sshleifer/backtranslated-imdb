Not only is it a great African-American classical comedy but one of many great American cult classicists. I recently bought the Rudy Moore collection. If you like old movies of karate and black comedy, it's for you! They do not make such films. My whole family is film lovers, so this site is an extreme help in solving many debates. I am deployed in Iraq right now. This helps me to stay in touch with the world I know in these states. Thank you IMDb. I recommend this site to all my friends. Dolemite rules! Do not just use the word for it, look at yourself. Ten lines are a lot to comment on one movie, I think, but if it gets right, I'm for it!
