An excellent film that portrays cross-streams in the life of a multi-ethnic mix of not so ordinary people in the rural northwestern Pacific. Strong directing and writing, along with fine acting, especially Kwami Taha and Dan Stowe. Interestingly, this film was created in the same year as the highly successful "Crash," written and directed by Paul Haggis. The pace of the event may not be as frantic as in Los Angeles, and characters may seem to be more familiar with "In addition," but personal character relationships are just as flawed and trouble and their stories as resonant as any of those in the Crash. For those audiences who appreciate "Crash," it's a movie. Also, fans of Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes will like this movie.
