I think this film is highly recommended, especially the particularly sinister performance of David Morse, and more than satisfactory performance is always worth watching for Mr. Foxx. Although there are lots of holes in the plot, and motivation is in some cases very, very difficult to trace, it all makes a nice time before the tube.
