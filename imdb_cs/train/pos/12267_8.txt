Tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a child. I once borrowed books from the school library every opportunity I get. My favorite was "The Red Sea Sharks" - so much action and humor. This documentary was a great interpretation of the story of Herge and his development in Tintin. The personal experience of the filmmaker when interviewing the herg and the story of his relationship with the artist who inspired the nature of Han was very moving. A great documentary of a very talented and dear artist. A great example of someone who has become internationally recognized and brought joy to millions of children (and young people in heart) around the world.
