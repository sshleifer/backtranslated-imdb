I was so impressed by the film version of Jan Austena's novel "Emmy" by Doug McGrath, and I like Rachel Portman's musical score a lot that when I went to a video room one day and found two of them reunited for "Nicholas Nickleby" rented it without any other consideration. I read a book, and for those mostly supporters of this adaptation, Jane Austen, I do not know what McGrath could do to better capture the spirit and great conspiratorial elements of Miss Austen's work, especially with regard to the two-hour film limitation (some complained about they are too long!). And as for the accent Gwen Paltrow, I have to admit I did not know her too much when I first saw it in the theater and I was absolutely convinced she was an English actress! <br /> <br /> I'm surprised by the one who criticized the film for its lush scenery. This is one of the things I like and I look forward to being in English speaking time slots. The beautiful background of the film is the main contributor to its determination and success. If your idea of ​​escalator fares is something fainter, you might want to rent something like "Death Wish III!" The English setting of the country is as attractive and charming as the cast and combines with the story and the sound entertainment for fun, which does not bother you with repeated tours. McGrath is astonishing at the choreography of constellations of subtle expressions that are so crucial in conveying the complex romantic intrigue that appears in this story. This refreshing film could also be a clinic about how a pleasant film can be minus sex, violence or even a vicious antagonist. The story is often fun, cute and occasionally quite moving. I've seen many competent Jane Austen books, but this is no doubt my favorite.
