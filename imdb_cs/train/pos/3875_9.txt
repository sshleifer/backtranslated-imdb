This film was made by one of the most absurd humor in Canada, Yves P. Pelletier. I was shocked for a moment that he made a romantic comedy, but when I knew it was a heavy film, he was seen at every local festival and local cinema, I had a positive feeling about this film. <br /> <br /> Hell, I was right. Right before the fight, the script (written by Pelletier himself) is a little twisted and heavy, but in Pelletier's fashion it's a unique 90-minute jack-in-the-box. <br /> <br /> Loosely inspired and largely reshaped "Les Aimants" Dangerous Relationships (Laclos) consists of a twisted play on the fridge. Throughout the movie, you will have the opportunity to find out who is who and who writes who in that crazy fridge .... that appears in an interesting affair. Great story, great photos, great quotes from other films. Should we ask more about the first film?
