A classic cartoon, always enjoyable and fun. It has interesting land complemented by nice characters. Road Rovers is a show that is worth seeing, it's a short 13 episodes, and if you ever manage to see it, you should. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find. I think Warner Brothers Studios should release a DVD that includes all 13 episodes. I would definitely buy it if they did, and if so, you should buy it too. if you have children who love dogs, they will love the roads! Road Rovers should get more attention when it was broadcast, it was definitely an original and very special show to be valued much more than it was.
