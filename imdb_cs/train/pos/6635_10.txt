What can I say about the first movie at all? <br /> <br /> You can not rate it because it's not fun. But if you have to judge it, you should give it 10. It's amazing to see moving pictures from 1895. It was one of the most important films in history. I wonder how he was one of the people who saw the first movie ever! <br /> <br />
