that's what I say a great movie. lives through fantastic acting skills and a simple but human story. there are real characters that can be fun and dramatic. but the main topic is very harsh, as it is alive. The bus driver and his son collect people across the country (Yugoslavia) on their way to the capital of Belgrade. funny and cruel situations that are happening on the road bring together people and pigs traveling together. <br /> <br /> Watch and you will remember it for a lifetime ... filled with Slavic humor and lifestyle. Another reason for his magic: it's hard to get there!
