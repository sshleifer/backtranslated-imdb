I was forced to see this because a) I have an 11-year-old girl, and b) We showed her Bonita Granville Nacy Drew films from the 1930s that she enjoyed. Personally, I did not think it was as funny as the 1930s, but on the other hand it was not a disturbing piece of intelligence - offensive fluff, which I feared it would be. It was a fearless, slightly funny movie. Although I'm delighted that Nancy has not "upgraded" to the "hipness" of the 21st Century (Veronica Mars has the title of Modern Nancy Drew), I think it did a little too much it was not enough to shoot Nancy Drew - be called "Jane Doe, Girls Detective". I have to blame the script: I think every actor did a good job with what they had to work on. I liked Emmy Roberts in this role, but she made her do it for television, not a theatrical release, a screenplay ...
