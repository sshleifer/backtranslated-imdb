You have tracks from the first scene about what's happening here. It becomes more and more obvious how the story unfolds. Performing in the whole is excellent and these actors touch your soul. Even though I knew what was going on, I was extremely confused about the motif. Still, I'm confused why Ben did what he did. On his face we could see "second thoughts," but it seems that the final sacrifice is against his emotions and feelings. It was a very interesting and moving story, but it made me confused. Maybe it was a movie. I loved the movie and Wil Smith can pick up another good movie selection. The guy knows how to entertain the audience!
