It began to be a film about the Bronx street culture in New York. What she did was to create a new culture and way of life for American youth. What other film did it except Rebel without a cause? One of the most important films of all time. Elements are simple but fascinating. The story is timeless, young people are trying to succeed against all possibilities. Still, the story is always believable and never depressing. The characters are so realistic, the city's inhabitants recognize them as neighbors. The story is fun and comes to a satisfying end. Buy it for a permanent collection. It's a piece of American history.
