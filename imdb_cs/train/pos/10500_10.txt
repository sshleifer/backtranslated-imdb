Although Super Mario 64 is not like other games in the series, it is still classic and is just as good as the old games. Games with this playback value are low and far. In addition, this game has so much variety. There are 15 levels, each with several different tasks and many other hidden tasks. The game is not too demanding, but its lack of challenge does not undo the game at all. Once you beat them, you'll want to delete your game and start over again. And it's just as fun as the second, the third or the twentieth. It must be proprietary for each Nintendo 64 owner and is in itself a reason to own Nintendo 64.
