It is a magnum opus from the Swedish king crap, Mats-Helge Olsson. The film of this size is rarely shot in Sweden, which is truly one of the most amazing successes of the Swedish film. Who pays for these things? <br /> <br /> The Russian nuclear scientist Markov wants to waddle into Sweden. But his plans are being destroyed by the Russian army who kidnaps him and tells him that he has come to Sweden. This trick is their way of seeing that Markov continues his work in nuclear physics, which will revolutionize the energy supply for the entire planet. But the CIA tries to get Mark to the west and send his ninja to free him. The practice of Swedish actors who speak English is something Mats-Helge has done in his later work. An inexpensive b-movie that creates this is probably unmatched for performance. But besides that? The action is the standard direct video style. Machine guns burn huge clouds of smoke. Thousands of Russians are dying. People run in black ninja suits and try to hide in the snow. But what really stands out is the maddening way that the battle scenes are choreographed. When they say "Ninja" in the title, I expect martial arts, I expect combat in a close fight. But there are two or three scenes of real martial arts in this movie. And they are gay. It's so bad I miss the words I'm describing. If the ninjas moved slower, their hearts stopped. And of course, the whole movie ends with a bang indicating that it is a budget with special effects, which consists of four food stamps and a McDonald's coupon. So what is the verdict? Instant classic of course. Never before has a movie been made that is apparently intended for consumption along with a huge amount of alcohol. It's the ultimate party movie. Insert into the video and laugh. One must realize that such films are no longer produced. This is film history. <br /> <br /> This is why 8/10 for fun, 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for accents.
