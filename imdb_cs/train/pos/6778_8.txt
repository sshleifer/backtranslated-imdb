The fondly remembered melodrama? thanks to Ronald Colman's great central performance? on a topic that often deals with: the nature of acting and how it can prevent the perception of reality. In this case, we have the famous Thespian, which deals with Shakespeare's "Othello", so the last third of the movie effectively penetrates the thriller genre? with Edmond O'Brien (who is really starring in Colman's star and ex-wife, Signe Hassem), and "investigates" the possible engagement of an actor in a desdemonian thirsty sergeant looking for a celebrity (a very slender Shelley Winters). The theater / New York atmosphere of the post-war era is captured by Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon and the legendary acting director George Cukor (all nominated by the Academies); by the way, the film won the second oskar for Miklos Rozis' eclectic score. Colman, a forever captivating leading man blessed with a velvet voice, does Shakespeare well enough? thus gaining the conviction that his character slides into obsessive jealousy, murderous rage and ultimately paranoia; However, he is unauthorized by the support of cast, which also includes director Ray Collins, reporter Millard Mitchell, detective Joe Sawyer and coroner Whit Bissell. Although the middle section is a bit tense, the film is matched by some flaws with highly manipulated Expressionist revelations.
