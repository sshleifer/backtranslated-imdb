Prequel to the reconstructed Battlestar Galactica series, from the same creative team of Ronald D. Moore and David Eick, as well as co-builders of the new Remi Aubuchon series. Caprica is located in twelve colonies around 58 years before the Battlestar Galactica. In addition to his human drama, the new series also records key steps in developing what would have happened to Cylon's race. The pilot and series are ready to watch two families; Graystone is Daniel (Eric Stoltz), a computer genius and corporate tycoon and his equally brilliant but rebellious Daughter Zoe (Alessandra Toreson), while Adam includes the Joseph (Esai Morales) lawyer and his son William the future Admiral Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> Just like the Battlestar Galactica series, there are some great actors in Eric Stoltz, Esai Morales and Polly Walker as well as some very talented relatively new actors including Alessandra Toreson and Magda Apanowicz. <br /> <br /> For Battlestar Gallactica fans there is similarity and continuity with this series, but it is also very different. There are definitely sci-fi elements in the pilots, but they are part of this series. Caprice scenes that reflect the technologically more advanced company also have a retro feel that is achieved through some architecture, costumes and the way it is shot. While the appearance and impression of the two series have some significant differences, some of the themes will seem to be very well known, religion is again very important, while the racial topic rarely affecting Bulgaria is much more important. We also deal with terrorism about the existence of a soul and about whether or not a machine has a machine or not, as well as issues related to crime and government. The pilot was released directly on DVD in an expanded and unrated version before broadcasting on television, the series will be launched in 2010. <br /> <br /> Just like Battlestar Galactica this series is filmed in Vancouver
