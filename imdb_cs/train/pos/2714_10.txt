It was one of those gorgeous moments in T.V. that I wished to take on the VHS forever. Will it never again? <br /> <br /> It was so creative and I remember it was broadcast once a week and waiting for another episode was unbearable. I want to see it again. I want to buy it. I want what I can not have. Not even on EBAY. <br /> <br /> So, with enough, it was by far one of the best series that was launched in the 1980s. It should be considered a classic, but it is lost in space. At least on this website and Wikipedia we will mention this. Reindeer. She was totally attractive, funny, flirtatious and original. Perhaps not like the Sherlock Holmes original, actually, I think Quintin is a lot more attractive and he has a better chance with his leading lad than if Holmes could,
