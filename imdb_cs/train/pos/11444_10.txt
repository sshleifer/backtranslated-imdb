Take a look at this movie for the wonderful idea of ​​the Andy Goldsworthy statues and get ready for a thorough opening and relaxing experience. Music perfectly complements shots, but never gives attention to itself. Some commentators called program snippets with the artist as a weak point, but you should consider: Why would you extend this in the movie if you can read Andy's interviews or take part in one of his excellent lectures in his books? This medium is much more appropriate to show the passing nature of works of art and is professionally used in this respect.
