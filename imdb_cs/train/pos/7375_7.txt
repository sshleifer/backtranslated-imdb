Not at the same level as Ring (or Ring 2), but still a good Japanese horror effect however. I wish the horror producers in North America choose a page from the Japanese horror template, and in their movements they have given more "spookiness" and less cheap shocks. A lot of good examples in this scene where the faded face is the scene that looks at the young actress, and the pictures on the wall suddenly look at the smile, just for a moment and more. It's worth considering if you like this genre.
