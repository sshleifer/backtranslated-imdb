"Five days" is billed as something special, a crime crime that consists of a series of episodes that take place every year in a police investigation. In fact, this element of the story seems a bit less significant than one could think of because the fact that the action in each episode is limited to 24 hours is hardly visible and very little distinguishes from the countless other stories of crime. In fact, one can hardly help with a comparison with the last "suspect" because one of the sub-topics focuses on a single, cynical female approaching retirement: and this is not just the absence of Helen Mirren, which makes a comparison of the unfavorable . There is a lot of serious over-emotion, manipulative music, and sets of seemingly imaginative characters, so everyone is compassionate in a sense, in another suspicious. And it is possible to guess the wine side well before the end, not because of the inner dynamics of the story, but rather because of the construction of the whole drama: certain things must be true to justify the way serials focus on certain characters at certain times. In spite of these failures, the series grew at me: I was quite gripped by the end. But it is a sad sign that the BBC, who once sang like a singer, boasted "the best drama of the year" because there are few original offers and claims that reveal a lack of ambition that is terribly disappointing. "Five days" is not really waste; but it's formal and could hope that the best the BBC offers would be something a little more innovative and fresh.
