I do not share any comments. The first time I saw a movie on the British TV channel, it was introduced as an indie film, and if you take a movie under that angle, I think it's a whole different matter. I could not believe what I saw, and I immediately joined him. The story can be just as bad as the JS show (ie, there's no plot), but acting is bad, it's funny and it's all in all the incredible baskets. <br /> <br /> He says so much about America than Bully or Ken Park without a dramatic perspective, but gives a look at American society and more precisely on what afternoon television viewers in America (and I believe there are lots of them!) , which he is interested in. After all, they're the neighbors we talk about, right? 100% fun!
