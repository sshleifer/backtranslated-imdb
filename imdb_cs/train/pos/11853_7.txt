Life Pod is one of those movies you are watching and trying not to try too much. The game is rather amateur, at best. Special effects are probably a low budget, but not too bad. The story line is rather popular but interesting. The computer runs amok, but it's not exactly a computer, and running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed. The film still has its moments and is very attentive. For me, at least part of the charm of this film is the prominent role of Kristina DeBell. Perhaps she is not the greatest actress in the world, but since she was a former friend of the moon she is pretty cute. In all Living Pod is similar to other low-budget Sci-Fi movies from the 1980s and somewhat predictable. Bit White Lines bit is cute if it is totally inaccurate. The last of the White Star Lines Company's actions were purchased at Cunard Lines in 1947, and the last White Star ship was Britannic (not Sister Titanic), which was sold for scrap in 1960.
