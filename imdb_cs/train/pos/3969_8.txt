Someone noticed that James Earl Jones is a waiter who serves when Hagart's wife reveals she is pregnant while at a lake restaurant. I saw this movie on a video I recorded from TV. When I was watching this scene, I thought I recognized Jones' voice when the "waiter" laughed at the end. I rewound the tape and then slowly walked through that section as the camera pulled back and showed the waiter. Listen carefully when the waiter laughs when Hagarty looks and tells him to have a baby, then carefully watch or slow the scene when the camera shows the waiter, though fast.
