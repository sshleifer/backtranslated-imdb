This film is directed by Renny Harlin, a Finnish miracle. Stallone is Gabe Walker. Cat and mouse in the mountains with unscrupulous terrorists. Renny Harlin knows how to drive an action movie. Stallone needed this role to get back on track. Snowy Mountain is a very good place for action film and who is better to manage a film where snow, ice, cold and bad weather is than a Finnish man. The event is good! The music in the movie is spectacular. The thief is John Litghow, other stars Micheal Rooker (Portrait serialkiller), Janine Turner (Strong Medicine). It is located in a beautiful place and it is a very exciting film. Overall, a good movie **** / ***** <br /> <br /> Do not forget Extreme ääliöt: a special edition of collectors, with good equipment. Directly in Finland directly to the video.
