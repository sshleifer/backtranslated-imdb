Whether this film is propaganda or not (I firmly believe it is not), it really shows the power of the media. The importance of this document is not to show how good Chavez is. It really is to show the way the Bolivarians saw how it happened, Chavez's way of seeing it. Though it may seem bad and bias to support the film, I think the view of the film is absolutely legitimate. The Venezuelan people, through Venezuela's private media society, saw only one side of the view, a neoliberal party. This film shows us the way the Bolivarians have seen. Call it propaganda, I say it's a court call from you.
