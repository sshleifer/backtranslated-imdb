For all murder murders, this movie was great! Every character who has ever been to the show has appeared in the movie. It helped solve some (but not all) issues in the series. Unfortunately, if you really followed the series, most of the experience would have been lost because the film made tough links to each season of the existence of the show. That would probably be useful as a serial finale, as opposed to being a separate movie, but we have to take what we can get. I hope they will do more movies and continue to showcase the Law and Order murder.
