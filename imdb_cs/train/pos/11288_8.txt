It's almost all the critics of the best of John Weissmuller Tarzan's films, I have no argument, though there are a few others, I thought so amusingly. One thing: it's the longest of the series I've seen in 105 minutes. I only saw six of them, but it was longer than I used to, and with the exhausted action final I thought the whole thing was too long. However, it is a good mix of action, tension and romance. The only thing missing is color and stereo sound. The initial special effects do not bother me because it was all they had back in the 1930s. Among some, this movie is best known for one thing: skin! "Jane" has never done anything after this film because Hays's law was introduced at the time when another Tarzan movie was created. Her equipment showed what a great figure Maureen O'Sullivan had. Nude scene underwater was not her - long. The underwater woman had no character at all, no matter where it was. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action. It was not exaggerated until the final. The end, however, continued for 15 minutes and was so intense that there was too much to watch. Still, this film offers everything - except "Boy" (their adopted son) - you "want to see Tarzan's movie, even O'Sullivan, as Tarzan yells about a dozen times, with her pair of lungs not a problem.
