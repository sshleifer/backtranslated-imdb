It was Austrian alone, it was a straight knock in her face. Fortunately, I do not live the place where this film takes place, but unfortunately displays everything the rest of Austria hates Viennese people (or people near this region). And it is very easy to read that it is precisely the intention of the directors: let your head fall into your hands and say, "God, how can it be possible!". No, not with me (in my opinion) a totally exaggerated uncensored club scene is not necessary, I look at porn, surely, but in this context I was rather disgusted to get into the right context. <br /> <br /> This film tells the story of how misguided people who suffer from a lack of education or a bad company are trying to survive and live in a world of superfluous and boring horizons. A girl who, with her superhuman boyfriend (and yet still returning) who is considered fucking like a street, a teacher who discovers her masochism by giving the life of her super-cruel "lover" on the line, an old couple who has almost mathematical (she is the "official replacement" of his ex-wife), a couple who just divorced, and a former husband suffering from the underworld of her ex-wife, apparently has a relationship with her masseuse and eventually a crazy tracker who asks her drivers the most unusual questions and stretches her nerves by being super-poisonous. After you've seen it, you feel almost nothing. You are not even shocked, sad, depressed, or feel that you are doing something ... Maybe that's why I gave her 7 points, I responded as I had never before reacted. If it's good or bad, it's up to you!
