I have read most of the comments posted here and I can say that most of these posters have major problems in life. This show, unlike most of the game shows, was fun. Mr. Shatner, who is all over the show again in all he does. It's really a bubble of personality that shines like a beacon wherever it goes. It's fun and makes you a smile, and that's exactly what it will show. Dancers and queries, the round fashion they represent, only add to the appeal. And although there is a lot of money at stake, it's fun. The pressure (stress) that exists in most game shows does not exist here. Several people who posted the news complained about how much time dancers and questions were choosing, and like Millionaire did not have similar time bribes. I can only say that most of you missed the whole concept. The idea here is to have FUN & ENJOY yourself. There's something for everyone. Communication to test your knowledge, eye candy, tension, Mrs. Shatner's wonderful fun full of personality ... well, if it does not pick up boys, then I feel bad about you; and if it is not enough, you can get wealth! I really miss a show. All games show up games that have ever appeared, and to be honest, I HATE, this is the one I really liked and really missed. The only other game I ever wanted was the Match Game.
