I saw this movie a few months ago on the cable and it was fantastic. William H Macy is one of my favorite actors and his performance was amazing. You are worried about his character, though he is clearly doing the wrong thing, and Neve Campbell gives the performance that is undoubtedly the best performance I've seen this year in the actor's play. It's fantastic as a wild young woman who is wise for her years. Donald Sutherland is just as creepy as Macy's father, and John Ritter is as cool as ice cream in the midst of everything that's going on. <br /> <br /> I wish it was in the theater because I feel it's a movie that should be seen by a wider audience. That's a shame because it's a hell better than most new movies come to the theater. <br /> <br />
