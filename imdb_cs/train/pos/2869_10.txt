First of all, I want to say, "Thank you, Disney, for finally releasing the movie" Cinderella "on DVD! Now you have all Disney animated movies on DVD (including limited editions 1999) What are you going to do next? You go to Disney World !!!!! , technically (I think, look at the castle !!!!!) Anyway, Disney remains magical in its animated classic film "Cinderella" from 1950, a film that mapped fiction films on the map. We are all familiar with the story of Cinderella, her sister, date, glass parrot, pumpkin that turns into a carriage just because it says "Bippity-boppity-boo!" And, of course, trying to return home at midnight! <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie: It's a big old fairy tale that kids love, now in the movie (as well as on DVD) !!!!! <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" - thank you, Disney !!!!! 10 stars.
