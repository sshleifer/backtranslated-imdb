I also viewed this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. It was an excellent film about adult family relationships. Paul Reiser wrote the film and included some similarities with his family. It was funny, hot, irritating and moving as well as fun. A movie like this would be very good with oral reviews. I would definitely tell my friends and family to see this movie. I just hope they have a chance. I should consider this film as one of the best films I've ever seen. It does not contain any violence, action scenes, murders, sex, so the distributors are probably asking if they will pick it up. Believe me, there are people who would like to see a movie that has redemption instead of the many typical box-boxes we usually give.
