This is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen in my life. It's not just a fun movie or a well-shot movie. This is a landmark in the art of animation, and even if it was not, only the technical skill that went into his work would give him a place in the history of animation. Wladyslaw Starewicz created a stop-motion film about the secret life of beetles. He imagined a coherent world of insects, with jobs, houses, nightclubs, movie houses, even small props like posters, bicycles and paintings. In this film he tells a simple story of hypocrisy and revenge. Mr. Beetle has a matter of dancing dragonfly, much to the rage of grasshoppers; but he is a cameraman and decides to shoot. Mr. Beetle returns home and finds out that Mrs Beetle has her own affair. Mr. Beetle pursues a lover but forgives his wife. They both get ready and go to the cinema. And the movies they watch are Mr. Beetle and the dragonfly. It is described as banal, but once it has been seen, it has become a stunning piece of cinema. Together with Emil Cohl and Jiří Trnka, Wladyslaw Starewicz invented everything that future animators would use in their work. For this reason, it must not be forgotten.
