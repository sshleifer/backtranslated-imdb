Tom Cat, Jerry Mouse and Spike Dog (here called Butch, his third name, his second "Killer") decide to sign a peace treaty so that everyone loves them. It's strange and a little bit unnatural that all of them are friends of this type, and they seem to think their friend too. But ultimately, because of disagreement with the steak, everything is normal and everything is as it should be. This short is the second of three on the new Spotlight DVD to be edited, and I have no idea why this was. This cartoon can be found on the disk one of the Spotlight collection of the DVD "Tom & Jerry" <br /> <br /> My class: B
