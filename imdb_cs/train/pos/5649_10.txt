I'm watching the series again when it's on DVD (yeah!) It's striking as fresh, relevant and interesting as when it was broadcast for the first time. Central performances are breathtaking, the scripts are superimposed. <br /> <br /> I will keep my neck out and stand there with The Prisoner as a show that will win new fans and still be watched come 2035. I was asked to write another line it seems that IMDb is as a user hostile and anally retentive coded as ever before! Pithy and point is not clearly IMDb way.) Well, unlike IMDb publishers, American Gothic understands that simplicity is all. In 22 episodes, the show covers more character development than many shows do in seven seasons. In addition, he questions the personal ethics and strength of the character in a way that invites the viewer to ask at every step what they choose and what they would think of. <br /> <br /> When the show was first broadcast, I was still wondering about Twin Peaks and I thought it would be cheap. Personally I start to evaluate it much more and I think it will be better over the years. Let's assume it will not be so controversial!
