I do not know how to explain "Darkend Room", because it summarizes that it really did not do justice. It's basically a Lynchian short film with two beautiful girls in a strange, mysterious situation. I would say that this short is definitely more at the "Mulholland Drive" end of the Lynchian spectrum, unlike "Elephant Man" or "Direct Story." It's hidden on Lynch's website and it's worth it.
