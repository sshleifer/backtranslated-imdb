Great British film Indy! Fantastic chemistry between the three main characters makes Cheech and Chong proud. Great to see Phil Daniels back on the big screen (even if he exchanged the pages from Quadrophenia!) And Gary Stretch is surprisingly good and a gift for ladies! He loved the last battle scene by nodding to Zul, and now I know what happened to Arthur Brown after he fired at Top of the Pops! ... does not act ... is really a bona fide British hippie !!! You do not have to be a biker who could enjoy it and it's right to my Friday night after the audience. <br /> <br /> Let this movie go and you will not be disappointed.
