For some reason, this film seems to be badly criticized. Probably just a mass population. In fact, it's really a very interesting movie. The film is a science-fiction film that is actually inadequate, and it really works thanks to interesting storyline and great scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie does not have to be for everyone. If there are some sci-fi fans reading this, I really recommend this movie if you like good science fiction. The film has crazy ideas. This setting includes nations that are going to war with the GIGANTIC machine that all countries invest in all their money! The world was divided into territory. Everyone can attack someone else to war, or rather to a "robotic duel". The way of warfare is cleaner than the nuclear war, because now everyone wears those masks to breath. Definitely a movie that thinks about you. Intelligent, well-written and good effects for an idle budget. I tend to like movies that have small budgets and actually work.
