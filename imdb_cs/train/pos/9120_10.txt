This film speaks of a universal language; it can relate to yourself, the community, the society, or the wider world. It's a way not only to open a few questions, but also set one to find discoveries and questioning the right questions to get to that point of self-esteem / ownership. The representation of stereotypes in the film deals with the archetypes around us, which must be recognized as a recurring cycle of destruction, the opposing force of innovation, creativity and growth. Factors that disturb the natural flow of things must be clear and resolved. Idea is definitely a movie that is to be experienced and not just to be seen because it is inserted through the inner voice / conscience through the eyes, and thus it feels like the opposite to just watching.
