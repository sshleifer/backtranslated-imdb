Merry hardly begins to describe this unique, original tour-de-Star-Wars-force (Luke: how powerful is Vader: the force of a small pony), in which, even though he is master, smash sweat, deliberately saves the maneuver. 2 hours by swirling his history, his birthplace, Europe and others. From Heimlich in the middle of the night, "I invented a maneuver!" to the British Empire ".. do you have a flag ..?" and the ancient gods, "Jeff, God of Biscuits!" and much more, this is a fish-flop-on-the-floor-to-jumpstart-your-full of fun. And I confess that he has given this video dozens of times over the years, as the British transvestite standup who is in a chair is one of the long tenants, especially one returning for 10 years. And yet this material is not only timeless but almost obvious, the present day is nothing more than a thicker, more fun / sad version where we were ten years ago, although they were thinking about it, it could be just a coincidence.
