A sharp political commentary posturing as the story of the coming of age is what this film is. It is annoying that it works effectively at both levels. It is not, but it does. This story of four boys and girls who grew up in Communist Belgrade in 1953 is warmer. That's what gentlemen call a classic cinema. Obviously, in 1953, Belgrade is not such a harsh dictatorial and fascist environment as is often depicted by communist society. One can listen to rock and roll music, one of the songs played is the song "Hey Babu Riba" ala movie name. But jeans can not be bought, nor some drugs that are illegal. Contrary to critical criticism of communist society, this film does this by showing how it affects the lives of the five protagonists who refer to us as our four. A girl who has a father in exile in Italy and waits for her mother's passport and she sets out to join him, a piano that has been taken away from the community, one of the boys, suddenly giving your home and home to your new friends because they need it. The boys spend a lot of time listening to music, and it is clear they despise the fascism that Communism has created when they engage in tiffs with fascist charlatan that Stalin carved on his hands. All of this leads to the activities they will receive later, and to the time that disappeared because this film was released in 1986 at the twilight of the Soviet Empire. A great movie that's worth seeing over and over again. "Repentance is not your enemy, but none is a friend."
