How wonderful this movie is! I've seen it over and over again over the years, and I've always wondered about it. The reason why the movie is so easy to watch is, of course, the arrest given by young Bette Davis. Not only has she stole any scene in her but she is actually much nicer and better photographed here (not to mention sexi) than she was in one of the films she had shot in her home studio Warner Brothers (this film was made by RKO Radio Pictures). She has a very delicious make-up and she has very attractive hairstyles, and oh, those wonderful big eyes (especially in the restaurant scene taking place in Soho, London). Her body was so young when she was young. Lose it from the cheap negligee she wears for her big explosive confrontational scene with Leslie Howard. And boy, this is absolute power in this scene. Howard is a bit too nervous, but he senses the hero's sensitivity. Frances Dee looks like a sweet, pretty young Sally who really loves him. Max Steiner's score is charming and tangible. Great performances and a thirty-minute taste make it a must see the version of the classic novel.
