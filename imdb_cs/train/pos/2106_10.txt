Would these romantic comedies be so deeply executed as this? I have never thought of a wicked one, as if the simple sale of a music box could let me get excited. Margaret Sullavan makes a wonderful salesman and she and James Stewart have always done the best in themselves. This film sports what I think is Frank Morgan's most successful performance and his "Curtain from Oz" and "Tortilla Flat" that says a lot. The way he finds a Christmas dinner has made me happy with joy. Director Ernst Lubitsch may have thought that "Trouble In Paradise" is his favorite, but he must certainly think of triumph. Some of the smartest dialogues have American films from the thirties.
