This place in England in 1940. Three orphans (Carrie, Charles and Paul) are sent to live with Miss Price (Angela Lansbury). He does not want them, but he will take them reluctantly. She seems to be studying to be a witch through a correspondence course with the College of Witchcraft. (OK - I realize this is a family movie, but - College of Witchcraft Come on!) Before she can complete the course even though the college is closed due to the war (???) and she is looking down Professor Browne (David Tomlinson). And she and the children travel on the bed with the help of a charming bedclothes. I first saw it when I was 9 years old and I vaguely remember that I love it. She certainly does not stay as an adult! The story is stupid (even for fantasy), kids are horrible actors and one of them (Charles) is incredibly unpleasant. Roddy McDowall is also the third factor and only appears in two short scenes! There is also a trip to the island of Naboomba, which is run by animated animals. I thought it might be fun, but the animation is bad (for Disney) and has a very violent and too long football game among the animals. There are a few rescuing graces here: Lansbury and Tomlinson are just great; songs (while forgetting) are nice; the long dance sequence on Portobello Road is very varied, and the full energy and special effects that have won Oscar are still quite impressive at the end. But the weak story line, bad animation and unforgettable kids really pull down. I have heard that the extended version is even worse! I can only give 7.
