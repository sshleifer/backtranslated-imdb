A great example of the "cowboy noir," as it is called, in which unemployed Michael (Nicolas Cage) loses work because he insists he is frank (he has a bumpy leg). With the real thing he can do, he decides he will be lying once. When he enters the bar and owner Wayne (late, great JT Walsh) apologizes for the hit man Wayne hired in a sexy young woman Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle in good shape), Michael plays and accepts Waynes' money. * Then she goes to Suzanne and informs her of the intentions of her husbands and accepts * her * money to get rid of Wayne! If that's not enough, the real hit-man "Lyle of Dallas" (Dennis Hopper, in the perfect role for him) appears and Michael is in even more trouble than before. <br /> <br /> "Red Rock West" has a lot of places. Director John Dahl, who wrote the script with his brother Rick, was intelligent in realizing the potential of a story in a truly isolated town that could see better days and where residents could be involved in any way. It's also a fun idea of ​​the problems an honest man might have come to if they choose to renounce their principles and give up any level of temptation. It's a noticeably dark, twisted story with a number of main characters that are not damaged, at least morally threatened like Michael. Cameraman Mark Reshovsky's lighting is excellent in his mood; even the culmination in the cemetery brings the whole thing a pretty morbid quality. Even if writing is not particularly "logical or credible", the movie has a nice way to fascinate the viewer and just draw them straight. Cage does a good job at his head, but his co-stars have a great old time to sink their teeth into their flesh and greed characters. Hopper, Boyle and Walsh are fun in these parts. Timothy Carhart and Dan Shor are fine as Walsh's deputies (in a particularly good twist, Walsh is also a local sheriff) and there's a fun acting role for country and western star Dwight Yoakam, who also loves the movie with a nice ending of tuning. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty good little movie that's worth checking out. It moves forward with an impressive pace, and if nothing else is ever boring. <br /> <br /> 8/10
