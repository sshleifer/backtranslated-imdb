I consider this film to be a masterpiece, but it took me at least 4 to 5 times to realize it to realize what a great movie it was. It first describes the face of World War II, which we usually do not see in Hollywood movies. In particular, German soldiers, the army and the Nazi government are more "humanized". One of the things that attracted me most was by the end of the film the mention of the murder that took place in the woods for the last 20 years ... this forest is the venue where the final chapters of Alexanderplatz Berlin are: these are forests where Reinhold kills Mieze . Another guideline for those who love details is the display of the door. Fassbinder is obsessed with changes in people every time they crawl through the door or open the door. Many doors are displayed on the screen, open and closed. And signs change into their personality, their actions, etc. Whenever it happens. Did you notice that?
