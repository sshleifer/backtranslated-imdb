I think the team has done a very good job with the restrictions they had. only Â£ 300,000 and seven weeks to write, film and edit the whole thing, which in my opinion is a success in itself. although this film is not for the masses (as a young innocent teenage girl is killed and homoerotism is involved in the story), I think this movie is a hearty tragic tragedy and the deeper you get in the story, the more sad you feel. more on Heaton for the love he feels but not returned. This is one of my favorite British films that I liked and looked back on. I think it's a shame that the movie is not too well heard.
