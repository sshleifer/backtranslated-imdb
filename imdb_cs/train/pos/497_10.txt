Call me teens, but I really think it's a great series. If you did not have the chance to experience several episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely look at this. Maybe it's more convincing than what Voyager Caretaker says, who launched the Cpt series. Janeway, Archer's adventures are completely different, but strangely familiar ... Music is also catchy. No real science fanatic can go without seeing at least one episode of Star Trek - and these installments make you wait.
