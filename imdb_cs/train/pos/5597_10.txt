"Le Locataire" is undoubtedly one of the most important horror films ever made. Polanski stars as a trelkovsky, shy archivist living in Paris who responds to the ad to the apartment just to find out that the former tenant attempted suicide by leaping out of the window in the apartment. Třekovský is forced to visit her in the hospital and there she meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani). Třekovský moves immediately when the previous tenant dies, and at first he is quite satisfied with finding such a nice apartment. His luck is soon replaced by waves of paranoia as he becomes increasingly suspicious of his neighbors who are trying to provoke Trelkovsky to repeat the suicide of a previous tenant. This movie is great. Polanski can create surrealism in the atmosphere of fear and paranoia. Most of the great moments, such as the classic scene where Trelkovsky discovers the tooth from the previous tenant in a hole in the wall, or the dream of a fever where the building enters is a bathroom where you can find walls covered with hieroglyphics. Taking Sven Nykvist is really beautiful. The tenant is a neglected jewel. It can be difficult to trace, but it's more than what's worth.
