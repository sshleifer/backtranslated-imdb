For those of you who do not have this link, clubberin was 4 fists that hit one body ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, for a review. <br /> <br /> I miss WCW Saturday Night. Some of my favorite matches took place on this scene. I remember watching stunning Steve Austin, Rick Rude, Brian Pillman, Cactus Jack, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, DDP in his working days, Lord Steven Regal, Harlem Heat, Ricky Steamboat, STING ... here with a list of all. The point is the WCW had an amazing list in the Hogan days before and they were producing a fun television. Dusty Rhodes for a comment in his later years gave me a whole new reason why he was looking at smoking the pot as a teenager ... I really wished Vince to put him on the microphone for an exhibition or two, maybe another Great American Bash ? They CLUBBERIN! Here comes DA PLUNDA! Was great. <br /> <br /> -DirrTy
