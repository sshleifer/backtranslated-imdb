As other reviewers have said, it is an unfairly neglected film about the era of depression. Director Frank Borzage (two Oscars) and written by Jo Swerling, "It's a tough, well-structured and realistic step to persecute Shantytown in New York. They are fools, beggars and women who are forced into prostitution, but they are a community of good and bad people, with a loyalty as complex as any group. Perhaps this is the primary among the many admirable features of this film is the contrast between Spencer Tracy, Bill and Loretta Young Trinou. He speaks heavily, physically aggressive, and apparently fearless - but Bill is not a character that gives his film his breezy feeling of survival. While he suffers, Trina actually hangs tenacious (if this term can be applied to a character so ladylike). Her devotion to him is obvious and complete. When she gets pregnant, she says she'll pick her up if she wants to leave, or "I'll even give up if you're happy." This is the dignity of Loretta Young's performance (at the age of 20) as a rather simple figure that she does not seem to be either weak or dependent, but rather a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds her and does not say anything.
