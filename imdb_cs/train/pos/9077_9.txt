I really liked the pilot, it was just as amazing as I hoped it would be, if not better. Patrick Warburton was a turmoil even though I thought at the beginning that I could not build his character. He and Megyn Price They had little chemistry at all, but let's hope that as the season goes, they will get more of each other. It had to be strange that Megyn became the star in her last show ("Grounded For Life") that she was a star. <br /> <br /> Bianca Kajlich and Oliver Hudson really love the Sitcom scene, but I think they will improve over time. The character of David Spade, for my surprise, was not the whole attention of this pilot. The way he delivers his lines is so different from someone else I've ever seen on TV, but I think it's just his style. It works for him. I think couples, or even couples, will be able to relate to all the doubts and struggles and will not be sure of their decision that this show is about. All the situations in which the characters are built simply feel like a real life, not as a diabetes like most concerts. I hope all the actors that CBS gives them a chance. This show has the potential to be one of the best series if you get the chance and time.
