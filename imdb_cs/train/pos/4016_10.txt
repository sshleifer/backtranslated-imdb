This amazing little movie has all the elements that make Spaghetti Western so exciting and fun: GREAT music (one of the few ... if not the only ... female composer working in the genre, Nora Orlandi), EXCITING action sequences (and very bad on day!) and BEAUTIFUL scenery and sets (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). It also has a very good story with beautiful tragic romance. The actors are doing amazing work - with truly exceptional performances by Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalby Neri (the most important task for a Western spaghetti woman.) Outside Cardinale in Leone's Once Upon Time on the West. Without publishing spoilers, let me say that this movie contains one of the finest finishes of each movie I've ever seen!
