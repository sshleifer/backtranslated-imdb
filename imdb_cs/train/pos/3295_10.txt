Such a beauty movie that is hard to describe. Perhaps it is the absence of superfluous dialogue, or maybe it's an absolutely stellar soundtrack, or maybe just Meena Mumari's legs, but it's a pleasure to watch this movie over and over again. I have never seen another Indian film that would come close to him and only a few of them compete with perfection.
