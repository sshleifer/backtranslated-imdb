This is a strange film about an archaeologist who studies the culture of the ancient Indians Hohokam. She takes the mummy (really fake-looking) from the burial cave and brings her home to study her. Well, he will soon start to wonder and speak with this mummy. And shortly thereafter her son becomes obsessed with the spirit of the mummy. Even strange events take place when the spirit tries to destroy a woman's family. In fact, it's really fun and in general it will cause you to sleep the first sleep as you try to watch. But if you stick to it, you can only end. <br /> <br /> Ahh! What is the mystery of the mummy? Is the mummy spirit angry that he was removed from the cave? You may not be able to find out what the spirit is, but if you like scary shenanigans with a low budget (and 70 hairstyles!), It will have a certain calming challenge. <br /> <br /> The way I described the story is much clearer than the broken, boring way the story tells the story. Can a boring movie really be fascinating? Well ... somehow this will happen. Maybe it's a good movie in your heart, but it's done in a somewhat unpleasant way. I do not know. What I know is that I enjoyed it a bit, even in spite of its dullness. "Spider Baby" fans will be interested to learn that some of the music signals from this movie (including the instrumental version of the theme song) are used in this film. <br /> <br /> It is a frightening and fairly well-done sequence that shows the possessed boulders and rocks that are racing themselves and eventually attacking some people in the camp. Other scenes in the movie are just scary or strange; but this one scene is pretty scary. <br /> <br /> Look at this! It's weird and it's worth it. You may even want one in the field.
