"Midnight Cowboy" is one of those films that has been declared a masterpiece for good reason - indeed, it is one of the best films ever made in America. Her artistically valid but completely accessible and commercial. No wonder it was a huge success when he was initially released. But being warned is also one of the most heartbreaking movies he ever did. The characters are unforgettable, well developed and ultimately tragic. Movie makers should be delighted to have not given us the end of Hollywood, which was fundamentally binding in the 1980s. Still, I considered the years 1967-1977 as American film. It is a time to produce well-made, innovative and, above all, immense movies with great budgets that Hollywood could offer. All this ended when Star Wars was released. The death of John Schlesinger makes material work. Combines simplifying style with experimental adjustment. Unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects, "Midnight Cowboy" has very good ages. Even as powerful as he was initially released. However, the effect is doing this masterpiece. Characters of characters are never fully explained, but the performances make them fully developed. Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely unforgettable and sympathetic (despite their sometimes doomed acts). Besides being a fan of vintage films, I loved scenes that were placed on the infamous 42nd Street. "Midnight Cowboy" is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful movies ever shot. (10/10)
