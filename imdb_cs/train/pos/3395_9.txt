This is a great science fiction film, which is very strange in both men and women both seeing the same movie. I talked to many people about the movie and almost everyone loved him and said he was great - while most women thought he was just nasty and stupid! This is the only film I know about polarized opinions based on gender. Perhaps many women have little tolerance for disgusting or depressing land - but regardless of the cause, I have always seen this difference fascinating. The film begins with murder and subsequent investigation conducted by Charlton Heston. That is in the near future and the chief of the huge international Soylent Corporation was murdered. As the film unfolds, you quickly realize that this is a terrible and highly unfair future American society. The rich live in gorgeous apartments with confidence and all the pleasures they can buy money (including "furniture" - the euphemism for paid mistresses that come along with the apartment). At the same time, the masses are dirty, unemployed, and in many cases live in abandoned cars or in the corridors of the apartments. Overcrowding and smog have taken a heavy toll and the future looks really awful! <br /> <br /> Why did a rich man die and the terrible truth that he could not live, I should not really discuss - it could destroy the film for you. However, the film has a great script and acting and is very exciting to watch. In addition, Edward G. Robinson presents himself as a fragile helper at Heston in his final performance. Though not for a slightly depressive or squeamish, it is a great sci-fi movie that is allegorical and deep.
