"Shall We Dance?", The Lusty Film of Japan, tells of a reworked accountant and family man who is attracted to the dance studio by a beautiful woman she sees on a train during a daily commute. What he finds in the studio is a dance lesson and above all his own. Funny, dizzying and totally charming, "SWD" is an award-winning movie that's worth seeing with more mature audiences. (B)
