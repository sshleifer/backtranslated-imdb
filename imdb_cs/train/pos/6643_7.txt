When I heard that this movie came out in the night before Halloween, I was very excited. When I found out that it was a book written in 1978, I had to read it before I saw the movie. I'm sure the film would be very different to me if I did not read the book. Writers really do a good job of being faithful to the main conspiracy of the book, with a lesser difference, of course. I think what disappointed me most was that Boyle played the role of Coller. I'm not a big fan of Boyle and it seems that no matter what mood she's always trying to use her during the movie - her full lips and dark ornate eyes to look super sexy. I think the movie really matched the real crawling of the house. My favorite sub-plot was the Sheehan family (which is so strange that her son was killed in Iraq, and in recent events is Casey Sheehan, whose mother went to a huge anti-Iraqi tirade). The book did not seem to be Iraq, but rather Vietnam, and when the house appeared on the video of a son in a helicopter, I was really exhausted. Overall, I was amazed at the film by watching the book very well.
