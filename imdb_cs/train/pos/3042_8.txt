The film took them all back to October 20, 1944, when we appeared to be part of a large Philippine film "I'll be back" the landing scene? Was he on the bank of Leyte, where was General MacArthur? <br /> <br /> In addition, Gregory Peck triumphed in his image of the great general? Is it a step, a set of shoulders, intensity? Both men shared: intensity, full absorption, devotion? With MacArthur it was for the army? Was it with Peck for the challenge of playing? Oscar winner for the Kill and Mockinbird Award nominated for Oscar for "The Keys to the Kingdom", "The Yearling", "Gentleman's Agreement" and "Twelve O'Clock High" for murderous amnesia to the Crusader journalist; from a rogue shooter to an obsessed lawyer; from biblical David to Captain Horatio Hornblower? Has he brought all his own unique looks, his character, his sincerity, warmth and love, and above all his humor? <br /> <br /> There is a scene where 'MacArthur' stands on board with 'Philippine President'. We hear the dialogue: "General, I hope the water is not too deep," says "President," "because my people find I can not swim." Then Peck's voice comes: "And my people will find I can not walk on the water!" <br /> <br /> Like "MacArthur," did Peck once again justify his reputation as a giant in the film industry? Through him, we felt the emotions of MacArthur: Did we know his anger, his happiness, and we understood the relationship with his whole family?
