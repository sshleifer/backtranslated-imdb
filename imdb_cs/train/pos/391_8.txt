"Zu: Magic Mountain Warriors" was and is an impressive classic! You would never know that it was made in 1983. The use of Tsui Hark's special effects was very creative and inventive. (It went on in the Chinese Ghost Story trilogy and later productions.) Even now, it can measure up to other films of this genre. "Legend of Zu" is associated with the "Zu" warriors from the magic mountain! "It is not necessary to see this film to understand its plot.This story is a bit difficult to watch.But to be honest, it's all about action and adventure! he wondered what Tsui Hark would do if he had his hands on CGI. Now we know he made this movie. Maybe sometimes too much, but the overall result is so beautiful that we will not criticize it, the screen is happening so much, simply I think it's a great shame that this movie was not in the theaters here in the Netherlands The movie is screaming at the cinema screen This movie easily defeats the big budget of Hollywood productions such as Superman Returns or Xmen 3. All I have to mention, is the lack of humor In most of the films, Tsui Harks combines drama, fantasy, martial arts and humor, something in this movie is missing from these little things, "The Legend of the Zu" brings the finest special effects that you will see.
