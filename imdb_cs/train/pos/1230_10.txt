after I've seen this movie for the third time, I think it's almost Adam's worst film, PUNCH DRUNK LOVE IS FIVE, compared to that I have to say that when Dickie gets a hug, she is so funny (her hair is different from his and I like it when he throws all off.This film should only be brought if your real fan Adam Sandler's characters are bad compared to his funny films like Waterboy, which has the same people in him (Peter Dante) who is one of the killers trying to kill an Australian bird. This film lacks the depth and decent story line and deserves to be at the bottom 100
