Peter Falk is a diverse and perfect actor. The film is well written and playing looks like a real life. For all Columbo lovers it's great work. Because it shows how talent Peter Falk is. There's no detective playing carpet retailers retiring. At the time credits begin to play, you'll want to watch it again. An interesting part of the film lies in the fact that the report will apply to everyone who watches it; the depth of his "adequacy will be the only thing that is different." It's a shame that Hollywood liberals just promote sadness and skin because it's the type of movie people would take pride in. It would be a great movie that would became a live scene.
