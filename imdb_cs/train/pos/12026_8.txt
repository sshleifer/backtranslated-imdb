I have to say that this television movie was a work that really showed how talented Melissa Joan Hart is. We are so accustomed to seeing her in a sitcom and I really hope that the TV station will once again show this TV movie because it will show Sabrina fans that MJH is shining in the drama. We have seen him look at Sabrina for five years now and give the audience the taste of her very untapped talent. Melissa plays so well that she wants her parents to "get away" so she can be with the guy she loves. One thing all Sabrina spectators will notice, Melissa is working with David Lascher on this subject, long before he played Josh on Sabrina. So it would be a bit neat if it was visible whenever it was broadcast again. Hopefully, MJH will get some good roles in movies or even in more TV films, something like Kellie Martin, who always starred in television films. A lot of untapped talent waiting for her bust when Melissa joins Joan Hart always shines Melissa !!!
