Pinjar is a really good movie, with great acting, good story, good presentation, touching emotions, etc. It seems to me that the quality of films produced by Bollywood is improving nowadays. this film is one proof. No Bollywood movies I can remember have had such an impact on me - literally thinking about the movie for hours - enjoying the various emotional situations that test humans in human beings. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the great acting of Uríla Matondkarová and some of Manoj Bajpai. Violence plays a girl in northern India in the back of the ward, and all the problems look sweet if we compare it to the problems it encounters. <br /> <br /> You have to see the movie. Bollywood's high-tech product, which, in my opinion, is comparable to the best films from other countries in the world.
