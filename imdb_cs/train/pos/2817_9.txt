This review is focused on the extended film of this film. I first watched the Dragon Lord when I bought it on DVDs many years ago. I always enjoyed this movie and you can read some more positive reviews to get a general idea. <br /> <br /> It was said. I always make the story a bit confusing. The film is after all a love story. And I always thought it strange that the love story would end with a 20-minute scene. <br /> <br /> Well, in the extended version, it is not. The old "original" version starts with a huge rugby-like sequence, which is a new ending sequence in the extended version. The opening sequence is Dragon (Jackie Chan), who hangs around his house and pretends to feel trained and recited whenever his father is around. Other sequences have also been shifted or extended in an extended section, and the story does a lot more when you watch it. Stimulation is also better and overall it works better. It feels like a love story and does not let you wonder why it ends drastically and dramatically like a normal version. I suggest to anyone who is a Hong Kong cinema or just plain Jackie Chan fanatic to get hold of the extended version and watch the movie as originally intended (or at least that's how I think it was intended.) Why would they otherwise do it and to organize some scenes.) When I was able to see it, I felt I was watching a whole new Jackie Chan movie, even though most of the sequences were the same.
