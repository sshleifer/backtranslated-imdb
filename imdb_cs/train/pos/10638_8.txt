When I think about this film, all the adjectives that come to mind are somehow related to the physical awards of the world. Texture, smell, color, so I think this movie should be judged in terms. Look for the rich golden tones surrounding the young concubine sleeping by the fireplace or the Turkish bath, and let it flood the impressions of spices, coarse fabrics, smooth skin, fragrant oils, flashing flames, satin rust. Do not just watch and listen, be absorbed, let the horrible voice of the storytellers enchant.
