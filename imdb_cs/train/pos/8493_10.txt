it's a great movie !!! <br /> <br /> For the first time, I saw this movie when it came out. I recently saw this movie again and still keeps my memories of it. A lot of the movies we watched when we were younger do not seem to be reluctant to watch them later in life. The film is indeed a great example of what is being produced at the time. Keaton is in his best work, all the actors did a really good job, and Ron Howard was very good at letting the story compress the film instead of compelling him. The pace of the movie is fast with a few slow spots and seeing cars from the 1980s are too fun. Since the eighties, I've been glad to see the ugly move again. The film is a great movie for comedic lovers and 80 film lovers.
