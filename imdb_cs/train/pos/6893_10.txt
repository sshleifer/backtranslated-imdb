Gerard Phillipe is absolutely perfect in this film, funny, gentle, courageous and loving. It gives the upper dimension of the film, which is even a masterpiece, as well as the other actors (Gina Lollobrigida: miaoooou !!) of the rhythm. Never boring, always creating new emotions: for me the best French film of all time.
