This is one of the first independent films I've ever seen. It was good for such a low budget; As insomniac myself, I can be sympathetic to the main character even though my sleep problems have never been so intense or disturbing. <br /> <br /> Well done, it works well, about an object I have not seen in theaters, lighting, and settings both ideal for setting the movie. There are few visible goofs, but they can be intended; you will see after watching the movie. The film is very personal and is worth the attention twice. No movie is flawless, but the version in Hollywood could not make the story better. total in all, 8/10.
