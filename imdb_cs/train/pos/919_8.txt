As a fan of "Columba" I was very disappointed in "Corky Romano". While it was definitely a funny film, Falk's mob boss figure was far from the dear lieutenant he'd been playing for so many years, especially with the offensive language he used. After "Corky Romano" I was frankly surprised and burned at Mr. Petr Falkovi. However, when I just saw "The Search for John Christmas" and his predecessor "City without Christmas", for the first time in a week, I have to say that Max, the perfect figure of Peter Falk in both films, is surely unforgettable and dear like Columbo ". While some parts of the film are quite predictable, such scenes are by no means relieved from the pleasure of seeing the narrative story. I also wish to record both these hearty Christmas movies and I strongly recommend that you are a fan of Falk, a Christmas walnut, or just someone who has an occasional feeling of a good film of the week. This movie may end up being a loss among the crowds of vacation holiday movies, so be sure to find "John Christmas Search" before it's too late.
