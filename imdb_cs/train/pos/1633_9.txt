I loved it when it appeared in the 80s and still does! I have still quoted classic lines like "tell it again" and "you said you would push me balls". Ron Leibman was hot and very fun! Though it has been underestimated and rejected by MAD, I must say that this little jewel will always be my treasure and film I would take with me if I were sent to a deserted island! I just wish someone released the DVD because it has VHS tape for wear! If you do not like comedy, it's definitely for you and it should be considered a classic cult! It's military humor, it's the best and worse! Rent it if you can not own it!
