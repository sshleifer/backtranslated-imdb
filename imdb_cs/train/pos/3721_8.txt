It was one of the best war films I've seen since it focuses on characters more than a real war. All players are doing great work, and since most of them are relatively unknown, doing everything that seems more credible. The camera shot is great, so it was a step and an adjustment. This movie really gets to you and will make the audience look after the characters.
