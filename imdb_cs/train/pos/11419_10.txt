Debut Claire Denis is courageous and self-confident. In this portrayal of life at the end of French colonialism, Cameroon explores relationships between men and women, black and white. With the black servant "Prot√©e" as the main object of the film of desire and oppression, the film starts from the beginning of the taboo. Denis builds an image of life through a series of characteristic relationships that keep an informed viewer firm on the screen. The film's mood is perfectly captured by the camera and lack of lighting. Big discourse.
