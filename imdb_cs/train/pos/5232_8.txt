This film is a way through the idea of ​​a screenwriter who is captured in his paradoxical philosophy. He sometimes examines the illusory question of "who am I" and "what am I?" It's a courageous and thoughtful business. There is a ship's picture of gorgeous, inspirational images, paradoxes like Escher's, reminding a hand that draws itself or rather erases. More and more follows the writer in his agony of what to say and what to film, we see him talking to his wife who went to Peru and let him take care of his child, a task he performs with less and less attention he is absorbed in his dilemma that he is no longer looking hard at the child. His wife returns and makes a scene, destroys his notes and helps him go past the last threshold until he erases it. With scattered eye and I-devastating images, the story is mainly philosophical. It's about Maya's veil, a world of illusion. The paradox of the film, however, is that it needs a lot to talk and think about thinking should end. During more than two hours of provocative beauty and rapid philosophizing, the film made me quiet or shorter. If it was the purpose of the manufacturer, he succeeded quite well.
