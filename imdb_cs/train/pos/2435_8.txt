I never thought the old cartoon would bring me tears! When I first purchased Casper & Friends: Spaving About Africa, I wanted to see the first Casper cartoon called The Friendly Ghost (1945), but when I saw the next cartoon, it's a good boos-night (1948) broke me! I could not believe how sad and tragic it was when he saw Casper's fox kill! I have never seen anything like that in the other Casper cartoons! This is the saddest of all! It was so depressing, I could not watch it again. It's like seeing Lassie die at the end of the movie. I know it's classic, but it's too old fans for us who behave like us! If I wanted to watch something old and classic, I'd rather watch something happy and fun! But when I think about this Casper cartoon, I'm thinking about my cats!
