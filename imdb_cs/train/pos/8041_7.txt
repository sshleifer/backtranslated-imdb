In spite of some of the negative comments that this movie has received on IMDb, it is still worth it because it is a story of survival and comradeship between two different men with different mentalities while in a difficult mission in the Panama jungle. <br /> <br /> Peruvian director Luis Llosa takes us to watch this thriller in Panama. The film has several good moments when Beckett, a veteran sailor, takes the newly arrived person who was recently sent to try to remove the notorious drug cartel head and the corrupt general of the army who might be the next president of the country. The only problem, Miller, has no experience with what was entrusted to him. Millero, an arrogant new jungle man and guerrilla warfare between the army and drug gentlemen against the infiltrating American intelligence men, teaches a valuable lesson from Beckett. What looks good in theory is irrelevant in the jungle. Tom Berenger is an actor who is not too registered, as he is shown in this film, but in the context of the film, he is like a few words. Billy Zane plays Miller does what he can, with a role that will not allow him any glory until the critical end. For lovers of action movie "Sniper" offers 112 minutes of action, bit trimming would be a more satisfying film.
