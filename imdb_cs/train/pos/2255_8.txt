It's not a bad martial art movie. Battle scenes were good. Michel Qissi did a good job when he made his first film without Van Damme. The story worked without a bad tongue and too much blood. Screenwriter Jeanette Francesca has a good story that works. It would be great if he saw something else in the same genre. She likes art and has a strong women's promenade. IT is definitely worth watching. I recommend the film to all lovers of dramatic and martial arts.
