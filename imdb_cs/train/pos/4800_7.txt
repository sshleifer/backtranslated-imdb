I went to The Straight Story, where I expect a sad / happy drama with a beautiful direction and a good actor. I got this. What I did not expect was an allegory for testing human existence. Let Lynch take a simple story about 300 miles on a mower trip and turn it into a microcosm for a human condition. If you have not noticed, watch it again, pay attention to the age of the people Alvin sees, the terrain he leads, the reactions people give him, the kind of discussions he has (one of the first is about pregnancy and children, one about the last one outside the cemetery). The last route he directs is especially fascinating in this context because it narrows and his fears and nervousness increase. The last mechanical failure could be considered the death and miraculous rebirth of his engine, which concerned the post-mortem life in which he achieved the required assembly. I just hope some people who call it a slow sappy melodrama have taken the time to watch with holistic attention.
