I just saw this movie on TV .. <br /> <br /> I lost my father when I was young and this movie really touched me .. <br /> <br /> I feel lost that little girl Desi she felt .. feeling he wanted to see her father again .. <br /> <br /> he wanted to talk to him .. or at least because of the chance to say goodbye .. and I touched the letter , which was written back to her .. saying her father read her letter and sent her back to someone who would answer her and buy her a gift because there is no business in heaven. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
