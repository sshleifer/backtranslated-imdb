I love buying the cheap DVDs from Alpha Video. One day I bought it. It's the perfect science fiction movie of the 1950s that is sexually. FULL OF SCIENTISTS ALL, dressed girls and a lot of melodrama, it's a nice movie for those who appreciate such things. And if you can "pause your infidelity" enough, you can really make money - not just the psychotic head or the bit of things in the closet, but towards the end with the character of "perfect body." It is so. . . . what's the next word for mindf *** ing?
