H.G. Wells Classic has several incarnations. 05 "Speilburg Version and Classical Version 53" But this book remains quite true. Nothing changes, nothing is removed. <br /> <br /> Originally released as a 3-hour film. Re-cut film cuts down to 2 hours of pure perfection. He gained a chapter visualization of novel pages that "Wells would be proud". The story is the way everyone remembers. Martians attack the Earth with capsules that contain an army of Tripod military machines. 19th-century people are ill prepared to deter foreign forces and fight cannons and weapons that hide shells tied directly from pedestrians, and when humanity is no longer a world power, they are rescued by the smallest organisms on earth. The film is a great success for director Timothy Hines, who has great potential to bring this vision to life with a modest 5 million budget. Today B-movies have bigger budgets.
