After reviewing several episodes of this series, I came to the conclusion that television producers are completely lacking in any form of originality. Here is an old science fiction bookcase, sophisticatedly packed in a truly original concept - yet they can only - to the fullest extent possible - function. Dialog is good! The male actors are experienced enough in their professions. Most of the character is well-rendered, with a particular delusion to the hero and his more than pleasant side kick. And most of the episode drawings run into taste. So what could be wrong? What about, female characters and cosmetically perfect actresses who are chosen to portray them. Producers insist on portraying female characters in this - almost good - series, in a way that causes the end product to appear as an incompetent cheerleader. Why, why do I ask? <br /> <br /> All episodes fall when a visiting guest star or recurring character appears on the screen. These actresses are absolutely unbelievable in their roles and you do not have to see them actually to know they are not able to perform their tasks. It could have been the blind man. Listen to them, talk. They bring their dialogue with all the dramatic effects and the effect of the 16-year-old at the grammar school. Who would believe that these women are PhDs, Senators, Company Leaders and Doctors? In Walnut Shell, if the producers have the choice of Stockard Channing or Morgan Fairchild, guess who they choose - each time? And, of course, the series suffers from it. Very bad!
