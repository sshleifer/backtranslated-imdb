This production of PM Entertainment is coupled with enough bullets for John Woo to say, "Enough!" Of course, it's not as beautiful as Woo can deliver, but in 90 minutes it's tough. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a secret policeman in the near future. When his wife is murdering the Governor's murder by a team using cyborg with a similar look, it's up to Eric to erase her name. Wilson is trying to get Van Damme's duty when he plays the hero's lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger. Why the academy has not been involved is beyond me. Being a PM production, there are plenty of car chases, exploding cars (4 in the first 5 minutes!) And shots. Especially I liked the van that floats in the air before even touching an explosive truck. My next favorite bit included the neighboring girl who came to finish karate in Don's simulator. It's just a chance to show some cheap LAWNMOWER MAN effects around 1995.
