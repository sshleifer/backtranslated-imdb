Sly is the best action movie. It's a very nice movie with some interesting characters, solid performance and Renny Harlins direction is stylishly ensured. Stallone is rarely so interesting in his action movies and definitely looks as to action scenes. It was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most exciting and enjoyable of the nineties, a classical classic genre. As a Stallone fan, this is the one I look back on with memories. Lots of great events and Sly in the main male form. Action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the features that make up a good action movie. The movie looks great and there is great support from Janina Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. ****
