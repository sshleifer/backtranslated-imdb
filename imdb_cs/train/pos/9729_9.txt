Weak start, solid middle, fantastic surface. That's my impression of this movie. I like Simon Pegg in the two films I've seen - Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. But his role here was completely different. It shows his scope as an actor, but I really did not like the character as he was portrayed at the beginning. <br /> <br /> There is some humor I call frustration comedy. His anticipated "jokes" and joke are really nothing but painful and unpleasant moments. Just like Bean character Rowan Atkinmson. There are a number of other comedic actors who display similar characters. I do not think I'm tripping here, so it will not. But be warned that if you are like me and you do not like stinking and crazy crazy idiots, Pegg shows just such qualities for the first third of this movie. But that improves. <br /> <br /> Somewhere I read that it is based on a true story. Hmmm. Maybe. The story of the film stopped being annoying and became a kind of triumph "little guy" in the last third. I do not need all the films to be sugar and light - but by the way, because this movie has improved, it has begun to become an increasingly happy ending. It was also a pleasure to see old favorites, Jeff Bridges, playing the role so masterfully. I liked "Iron Man," but he was saddened by the fact that Bridges's character was a villain. Of course, purely personal taste, because his acting was great. However, it was amazing here as a bigger visible person, publisher Sharps. It was nice to see him in a role I could really afford. <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked it! I just wish I came in 40 minutes late and I missed the beginning.
