Director Brian De Palma, written by Oliver Ston, "Scarface" is a movie that will not be forgotten. A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) comes to America for an American dream. Montana then becomes a "king" in the drug world when he ruthlessly directs his realm of crime in Miami, Florida. This gangster film is very violent and some scenes are unpleasant to watch. This film has about 180 + F-words and is almost three hours long. This movie is fun and you never get bored. You cheer on the drug master, and in some scenarios you will find that Montana is not as bad as some other criminal lords. This is a masterpiece and I recommend that you see it. You will not be disappointed. 9/10
