I was following my son, who was recently interested in 9/11. At that time he was a kindergarten, and he had no idea what was going on. I liked what was said to be a "documentary film". If there was one movie I would recommend seeing in connection with 9/11, that would be the one! Normally you see a movie that has famous actors. No one knows this movie. You also see a movie about 9/11, you hear about a fire or two who lose their lives rescuing people. I did not feel it had any of that! I just rented this movie and I would definitely want to add it to my collection! Very well done! My heart goes to survivors and family victims on September 11!
