I recently hit this movie on TNT five minutes into it while on vacation in Florida ... (hey, there must be some time in the hotel, right?) I was initially surprised to see Melissa Joan Hart in any length of film features to TNT. I mean, "Drive Me Crazy" is not old, is it? <br /> <br /> But I was stuck with it and was very surprised and entertained. Melissa plays Jennifer's role as psychologist. Supporting cast (Nick, a former friend, Karen, her best friend, and her parents who run their lives) added great credibility. The twist at the end was a nice closing of this story about a girl who always seemed to be one step ahead of all. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, look at it! <br /> <br />
