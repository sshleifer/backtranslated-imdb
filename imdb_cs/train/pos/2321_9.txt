Here's the kind of love story I like. And most of it is for two reasons. One, focusing on young people, very young people. People who are still growing up and are experiencing love for the first time or at least think they are. We were all in our lives, and "The Man on the Moon" is a wonderful reflection on our memories, perhaps adding more details and improving what we have experienced. The second reason is that it is a triangle of love. And I believe that, as a teenager, it is the most dramatic one. And the story is so well developed that you believe the characters can really be in love or are just new to love that they only firmly believe they are and after the tragedy, or it happens, they will believe it for the rest of their lives. <br /> <br /> The cast of "The Man on the Moon" is full of great talented names. Sam Waterston is a truly versatile actor, capable of playing hardcore lawyers as well as a strict, yet caregiving and wise father, as in this movie. Also, Tess Harper, Jason London and young Reese Witherspoon. If you look at a young, talented actress at the age of fourteen and think about ten years after the journey, you will win the Academy Award. All cast members reflect great performances and, through real-life scenario dialogue, are improved in real-world situations to look like real people. As if everything really happened. This type of movie I want to see is more common. Love story or not. I'd like to see movies that make everything real, and it's not either false or unbelievable.
