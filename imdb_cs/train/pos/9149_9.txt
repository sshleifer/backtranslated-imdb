I have never seen Richard Thomas play bad guy. I was not sure I'd like him that way. And I was not sure he could take it out. But it struck me. He sent me a trembling spine and made me look more closely at street people. The movie is breathtaking and fast. Bruce Davison is convincing, but everything he can really play is a nice guy. Great talent here is Thomas. The end was a bit clumsy, but maybe that's the way real people would really fight ... If you're a fan of Tomas, you have to see him in the best of what's wrong!
