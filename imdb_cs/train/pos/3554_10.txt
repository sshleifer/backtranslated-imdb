Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra attempted to visit this movie in the following years. Braando asked Sinatra for a couple of songs, but Sinatra (who was already exasperated at the fact that he was filmed like Nathan Detroit when he wanted part of Skye Masterson) wanted to be a star singer in the production and did not want anyone to be better than he was. He spoke to Brand that he had lost himself, so he returned to him. Sinatra ate cheesecake to eat, eat and eat. In later years Sinatra gave Brand the nickname "Mumbles" or "Mr.Mumbles" because of how he talks.
