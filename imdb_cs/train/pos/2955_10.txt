There is a certain love I have always found when exploring a large (partly) unknown film. These discoveries are almost always dramatic films - according to my experience of unknown sci-fi, action and horror are not known for very good reasons. I found "High Tide" on a video in a junk shop that mingled with countless dozens of different quality tapes. Of course, this is the only place I'd find it because it's not on DVD yet. While watching Judy Davis (like Lillie) throughout the movie, I was sure I was watching a great undiscovered performance. Yes, before I saw Davis in a few small parts - and one role in "Passage to India". But even though it was excellent in the above-mentioned film, "High Tide" is a completely different animal. Since I recently watched the later Gillian Armstrong movie "Charlotte Gray," I was really aware of an actress who impressed her. Davis draws a lot more than just a passing resemblance to Cate Blanchett - both in terms of both sensitivity and sensitivity. Judy Davis's performance is stunning, I can not say enough good things about him. She shares an amazing relationship on screen with young Claudia Karvan (like Ally), this next great movie actress. There is a lot of drama and peaceful humanity that they share together, details I do not think I'll uncover here (you see it yourself!). There is too much good in the "High Tide" that appears in one overview. I really would not care much - the film is good for itself. Finally, I would like to praise scriptwriter Laura Jones for her stunning dialogue, directed by Gillian Armstrong for her understanding of actors and great Russell Boyd for his brilliant, compelling cinematography (see his work in "Tender Mercies").
