Scanners II: The new order is just as good as David Cronenberg's classic scanners, the scanners were made in 1980 and the Scanners II in 1991, so their eleven years between these two films. The film captures the style of the scanner, which is a good thing, it would not be scanners without a blast of the head, so the II scanners have a scene with a blast of the head that is the first to be horrible. Scanners II: The new order includes some other imaginative scenes that are doing well. Scanner Scenario II: The new order is a new sample series because it has scanners used as vigilance for the police chief and the group of scientists until the young scanner David Kellum detects that he is being used and decides to avenge himself. <br /> <br /> Scanners II: The new order is a great sequel to David Cronenberg's science fiction classic scanners and should be seen. Look at this. 10/10
