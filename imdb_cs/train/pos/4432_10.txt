I'm happy to admit that I'm crazy about a beautiful film and enough inventive moves and camera angles may be enough to care about a fairly long film. None of them was the length of Gojoe, even though she had one of the most remarkable cinematographs I saw from the Korean MUSA. However, Gojoe provides much more than just beautiful pictures (just like MUSA ... it does not mean contrast) - it's the second greatest power is a great acting and a fascinating story with a very dark philosophy. I have to admit that I was not sure what it meant to do, but there are certain ideas. Ambiguous but definitely thoughts: p One department in which the film could be better is action. There is a huge amount of bloodshed in the film, but everything is filmed with hyperkinetic details and is often covered in foreground. It creates some very intense and impressive visuals, but it would be nice to see some other real moves, something that would be more believable that the villains could simply crawl through the whole army, which would become waste for everyone. <br /> <br /> The film is definitely one of the most exciting and beautiful movies I've ever seen. We recommend!
