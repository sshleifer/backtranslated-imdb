Gentleman Jim is not really a boxing movie. It's a vehicle for Errol Flynn as Jim Corbett. But when he said, boxing scenes are a real opener for a modern viewer. Erlle Flynn plays an Irish banker who gets shot at a world title with heavy weight. Flynn is suitable for the role of a decent but unpredictable Corbett. But his opponent, John Sullivan, is still getting better, which is an insight into the old school played by Ward Bond. The theme of the film is the man who is pushing his big chances. Corbett leaves his secular life and builds up a new personality like Gentleman Jim. Jim is a chancer who can adapt to any social environment. He is a liar and an egoist. Sullivan heavyweight champion is portrayed as simple brutal, but his sincerity and sporting gives a certain contrast to the main character. There is the action and excitement of the aplenty and the wonderful end with the requisite redemption for all. And Errol Flynn gets the girl.
