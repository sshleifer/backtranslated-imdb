While the movie feels a bit long at times, it's worth it. Gordon drives in a style that reminds you of the styles of writing Vonneguss. Unrelenting, thoughtful, ironic, unpredictable and dark, it's a movie that will stay with you for some time, asking for answers to impossible questions. Nolte, Goodman and Arkin are incredible. Sheryl Lee is also awesome in the role that Lynch fans of her Laury / Maddy day remind us. Do not miss this!
