LAST WAVE never reaches the main audience. It's a slow but fascinating film for those who are willing to go with it. Australian owner lawyer is asked to accept a case of five natives accused of murdering one of their own. First, a variety of deeds and signs appear, for the death of a person involves a tribal affair that was not intended for a white man's court, and soon the lawyer has difficulty distinguishing reality from fantasy. It seems that the end of the world may be on hand, and he and the natives may know it, but no one else. Richard Chamberlain as a lawyer is at his peak. David Guptil, a well-known face from several other Australian films and a decent actor, is one of the five natives who are judges. LAST WAVE is simply not for everyone, more than MAGNOLIA (both have random things that fall from the sky). Check out the slow Saturday night.
