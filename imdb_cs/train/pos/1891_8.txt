When you see this movie, you begin to realize how drastically little used property was late Dudley Moore. There should be a dozen films in our archive, like this one. Before he went to Hollywood, he was a top talent, both a comedian and a musician. But he usually remembers him because of his couple with Peter Cook, on TV, and in one or two indifferent British films. Perhaps the best of them was "Bedazzled". <br /> <br /> The chef has always been inclined to shake him, who jealousy and stupidity disrupted their partnership and allowed Moore to realize his real potential in America. "Arthur" is the result. <br /> <br /> This is a really beautiful movie. Moore's clown comedy as a drunk is undeniable. The script is perfectly suited to his way with a number of merry, almost unreal conversations. There's something so British about him that I'm actually surprised to find such a challenge to American taste. Tommy Cooper, an anarchist comedian who had the same way, tended to exhaust. The sea is such a childish vulnerability that is so cute. Liza Minelli and John Guilgud tend to play a role against him but still have some excellent unicorns. John Guilgud especially brings his sarcastic and seasoned treasure authority. Constantly steal any scene in which he appears and earnestly earned the Oscar. Fix me when I'm wrong, but never played another comedic role. <br /> <br /> There is a subsequent movie titled 'Arthur 2 - On The Rocks'. It never achieves the same levels of entertainment that this person achieves but still is still good. Guilgud appears at first as portrait and as a ghost. It's darker. And there is some interesting search for the soul. It will be disappointed when you first look at "Arthur". Hollywood seemed to have lost interest in the Dudley plush after these two exits. Eventually he returned to Britain, devastated, and apparently was dying. But "Arthur" is an illustration of what could have been. We can just imagine other great movies to shoot. <br/> <br/> Unfortunately you missed, Dudley.
