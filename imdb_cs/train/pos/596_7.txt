This was a much more objective, more realistic version of the legendary stand against hopeless chances than the earlier filmed versions of the events, though one of these films may have been too far in humanizing the characters Sam Houston, Bowie, Travis and Crockett. <br /> <br /> He focuses on Jim Bowie, playing with a sharp, cynical separation from James Arnes, who is apparently still alive at the age of 85. Then 65, he returned to acting after years of screen making this part . <br /> <br /> Raul Julia, born in Puerto Rico, humanizes General Santa Ana as no one because J. Carol Naish made it in 54. However, the Mexican dictator is portrayed as crazy, harrowing popinjay - gaudi uniforms have never been seen before or ever since. He gets excellent advice from the European officers he hired, but has convinced himself of his infallibility, he does not care. Alec Baldwin is the only actor whose age is suited for the character played by Col William Travis. His view is serious. He is almost amazed by older men who share a command with him. The only sparkling message was Brian Keith as Crockett. In a hat with a basket and carrying Ol 'Betsy, he finds it as if he was going through another film. Without conviction in the image, the character is limited to several stage conventions. <br /> <br /> The scenario reveals some of the historical facts overlooked or suppressed in previous movie releases. We learn that Jim Bowie was in the person of Santa Ana fighting against his brother-in-law. The Mexican troops performed poorly in part because they were armed with the weapons remaining from the Napoleonic wars before generations. "Santa Ana likes to have an edge." Bowie explains. The entire defense project of the former Spanish mission as a fort was badly rewarded militarily - a fact explored more deeply in the film "Alamo" in 2004.
