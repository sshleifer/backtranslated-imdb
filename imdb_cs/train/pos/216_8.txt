the question: how do you steal a scene from an expert on Walter Mathau's scenario in the full, furious and brilliant clumsy old man's regime? answer: silence, deadpan and with perfect timing, as George Burns does here. I know of anything from Vaudeville, but this remains a favorite movie, both are fun, the funny script, the direction and the tempo very delicate. Richard Benjamin is very entertaining as a direct man - trying to get to Burns through the window, etc. Even small parts are great. There are so many fun scenes, Mathau waves commercial, Burns repeats his matches as senile ... <br /> <br /> Pleasure. <br /> <br /> Enterrrrrr!
