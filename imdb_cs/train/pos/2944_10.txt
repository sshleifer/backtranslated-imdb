This is the hand down the biggest show up ever. I saw a lot of performances, I had a lot of performances and watched Bet's Comic View, but I never saw anyone who could put Murphy's skills on this show. Impressions are excellent, jumps are great and timing is perfect. You can even say the crowd really gets there. When he did Raw a few years later, it was also really good, but it's in my book number one. It also shows that Murphy was fun, especially from the beginning until the mid-eighties. My favorite show spots are when she tells a family barbecue and "ice cream !!! Mooommm! Another great role has his mother like Clint Eastwood.
