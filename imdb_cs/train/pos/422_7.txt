"Plainsman" features the directorial bravery of Cecil B. DeMille in his most accurate and untruthful cases. He creates parallel stories for a starring story like Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (George Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln, though in fact Lincoln was already dead at a time when the story takes place. DeMille is dangerously approaching the truth at any moment, but it is as easy as turning away from her into an unfortunate spectacle and showmanship. The film is an attempt to seize the last stand of Custer with a pile of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people who have already been the product of produced products and legends. It's really a world according to DeMille - a zeitgeist in entertainment magazines, but a nice arched monument according to today's standards. TRANSFER: Due to the year's film, it's a slightly attractive transfer, often pure white and extremely solid black. In some scenarios there is a considerable amount of film grain and in other moments there is an absence. Overall, the image quality is somewhat inconsistent, but it's never bad or good? just a little better than the middle way. Age-related artifacts are minimized and digital anomalies do not distract. Sound is mono, but nicely balanced. <br /> <br /> EXTRAS: Forget it. It's universal! BOTTOM LINE: As a pseudohistory painted on celluloid, this western is convincing and entertaining. Just take his characters and the story with salt grain? in some cases ?? the whole box looks better!
