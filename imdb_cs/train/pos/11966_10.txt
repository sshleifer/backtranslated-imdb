This is an excellent series. You will laugh, you will cry, these amazing people will be part of your family. The way this family takes care of each other and helps each other through their crisis is a great example of how we should live our lives. There are many good things they do, and a number of bad decisions, but they never rely on family, they work through problems. Michelle, the youngest daughter, is the most cute thing I've ever seen. Stephanie, a middle-aged daughter, is suffering from middle childhood syndrome, and with ALL in the family it's better. DJ, the oldest daughter, grows up, whatever her dad wants to happen or not. One thing everyone shares is their mother. Danny (daddy), Joey and Uncle Jesse love these kids so much and it's obvious in every episode.
