STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> A particularly bad actor, getting to his (now faded ) seems rather than a strong dramatic talent, Richard Gere has always occupied a rather curious position on the American Hollywood scene, always a sure bet in the leading roles of a man who still holds a remarkable presence today. But today he seems to be more concerned with this kind of direct roles in DVDs / limited editions, and as such may seem to be more established in his power. <br /> <br /> He has to get some rigid stuff here as a hardy, cynical case worker Earl Babbage, one such worker assigned to hundreds of sexual offenders in one part of the US who, along with his new protection, Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes) take in her last case, immerse yourself in kidnapping a young woman in an attempt to forgive herself for a case that has failed before a long time. It is a certain dive into the darker side of mankind, treading on the material definitely not for squeamish or those looking for light viewing. And as such, it's a pretty strong, convincing film, fearless and unlimited by being directly on the DVD's budget. The only thing that really pulls it back is too much nervousness, a quick cut of camera sequences used in more dramatic moments that look a little irregular after a while. But it's still one of the most powerful materials I've ever seen in Gere, tirelessly darker and over the edge as it goes on. ***
