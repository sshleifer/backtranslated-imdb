I've seen this movie many times and every time I look at it, I can not help, but I enjoy doing it. Gunga Din is one of those classic films in Hollywood's golden years, when actors themselves had to draw audiences into the film without relying on fantastic special effects and the human "monsters" that carry the scene. The charisma and comraderie on screen, demonstrated by Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr., are strange and very entertaining. The language and face in which these three actors play a role are beautiful and flawless. Some may consider it "cruel", but I think this is a "classic" filming and is doing the best. While watching this film, we have to remember that Europe was involved in the war with Germany and the audience went into films to escape the horror of the war and enjoyed and went to a place where people were bigger than life and heroic deeds and would always win over evil. Gunga Din completes perfectly by making the audience manage to laugh at gambling. In short, it's a classic movie that is not too serious about audiences.
