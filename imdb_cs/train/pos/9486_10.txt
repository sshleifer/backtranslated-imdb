Eventually a thriller that omitted car pursuits, blasts and other effects. The film combines a simple conspiracy (the French president's suffering) with excellent backgrounds. He looks at the behavior of men with the authorities and explains why we would observe almost every command (even murder) that would be given to us. In addition, he shows us how secret services can manipulate history and how difficult it is to control them. The best thing about this movie is that there is no classic "Hollywood end" that can be easily predicted.
