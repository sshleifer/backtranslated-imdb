I've never seen many movies online for most of my life, but if I chose one of them, I would choose Spatula Madness, A clever reference to most films such as Star Soldier (etc), Using Camera, and Jason Steele Handled Art of Conversion of Normal Image to the picture and then it all comes together with frame-by-frame animation to get the world populated with spatula. the story starts in the middle, is it happy for the director? then it's middle in the beginning and so on, when I first watched it, I expected it to look like a sad pixel, but Jason, like me, looks like Love, so he took every detail to the maximum. although I do not recommend it to kids, or I would like somebody else, but please check it out on the internet (his short film, look at the movie cow), her style reminds me of South Park but less violent. 10 for the look, 6 for the laugh and 6 for the story, it all comes on 10/10, well done by Jason Steele, I'm terribly watching the movie.
