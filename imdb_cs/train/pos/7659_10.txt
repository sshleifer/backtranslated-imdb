I just watched this movie, which made me very upset. He was also in South Africa twice, at the time the movie was set. <br /> <br /> It's definitely hard, and the opening scenes tend to 'set the scene'. A slow but steady increase in pace barely allows a break and there are certainly few light moments. <br /> <br /> Nigel Hawthorne will never be able to see the same again. He came as a very twisted man, and found out he did not like him every time he appeared. I fully agree with the clear and well thought-out Steve-thompa comments.
