Since the third or fourth tour, I have been abstaining from LaMaman et la putain some time ago while I was waiting for a DVD. Meanwhile, I read the French script and the Alain Philippon monograph on Jean Eustache. The second ends with frustrating filmography, eleven films, fiction, doc and meanwhile impossible to see, or in the case of Mes petites amoureuses and Le Père Noël ... you will see again. <br /> <br /> Some questions that struck me this moment: Polish Véronik's French is more of a colloquial (maximum d '' maximum d '). Does that even have an accent? I think I can say he's doing it. What invisible color adds, especially in one place is the edge of the city? How does this edge differ from sleep and the path that separates the worlds of The Tempest and Winter's Tale? Ditto Alphaville. Can we imagine the years since they did, but Eustache intentionally delimits the film environment? Is it a charming island? Is Alexandre a fairy-tale? Alexandre is always choreographed, worried about how and where to stand or go, what to say when he announces these decisions, who needs to worry less than he does what he does. Or is it a way of trying to choreograph others by doing it to them? How different is it from Scotty Vertigo? (I say, I think very much.) What's the difference, and there is some, between Eustache Léaud, Truffaut, and Godard? How different is the current Léaud? Is it still what's happening in the last few roles, Irma Vep, Le Pornographe, no matter how old? Once I came soon for one of the series mostly by Antoine Doinel (Léaud character) Truffaut movies. For a long time, every three to five minutes, down the aisle would come the sixteenth man in the scarf, the tattoo, Léaud's hair, his nose attached. I have no idea whether it is a conscious or unconscious mimicry. I was at that age, but I have no idea what I was looking for myself. Not just a scarf. But I have a brother who seems to have learned from Bresson.
