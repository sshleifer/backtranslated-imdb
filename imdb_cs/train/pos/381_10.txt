I gave this film 10 not because it's a great movie, but it's its pure ability to elicit emotions in the audience. The story of one-woman-fight-versus-all-odds is an old clich√© now, but very few films have carried it with so much warmth and sincerity as Color Fial. It also showed another aspect of the African-American experience - showing that after liberation freedom was granted many fell into the path of the hated "white man" and abused their own people. I think this is an important point, as it goes against the outlined, white-to-black-violence-a-win-a-oscar trend. Also performing performances are excellent - especially Oprah, have a new reverent respect. <br /> <br /> It's a lot worth watching - but keep some tissue handy.
