Midnight Cowboy is not for everyone. It's raw, painful and realistic, but very fun. Leading actors Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who become Oscar actors, will deliver an amazing performance. Voight as a Texas cheater, Joe Buck, who moves from the small city of Texas to New York to become a guest. He apologizes for his profession, but it is not that easy. Women in New York, such as the rich lady played by Georgeann Johnson and Cass played Oscar nominated Sylvia Miles, are different from Texas women. Unfortunately, Buck is trying to escape his past life in Texas. He was brought up by his grandmother, Sally Buck, played by gorgeous actress Ruth White, who died in 1969 from cancer. Location in New York is wonderful to watch how the relationship between Fatso played by Hoffman and Buck's characters evolve into a moving man to male friendship. Men try to overcome their lives in New York by not playing the rules to get a real job. As the film evolves, Buck's past appears on the surface, and it's scary but not clear. The film is not intended for children, but compared to today's films and television programs, the Midnight Cowboy can be much quieter. I can not forget the young Bradda Vaccaro and a party you can not forget. It's also a tearjerker movie, so get your hankies out too.
