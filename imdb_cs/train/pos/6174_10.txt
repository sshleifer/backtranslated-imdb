It's really unfortunate that most people outside Canada think that the only thing that Canada produces are snow, swings and hockey players. This film is the second superlative Canadian film I've seen over the past few weeks (the first one was "Red Violin"), much better than all but the best Hollywood effort. Gustad Noble is different than that; middle-aged is a Parsi Bank employee in Mumbai in the 1970s. This film sensitively explores the various things that have happened to him regarding his family, his friends and his work and their influence on him. At the same time it is fascinating, and I think I have accurately depicted the urban life in India at the time. Still, I was a bit ready to read Rohinton Mistry's book a few years ago. The movie, as you can expect, can not capture all the complexities of the book, but if you want to read a really good book and see a really good movie, read and look at "That Long Way".
