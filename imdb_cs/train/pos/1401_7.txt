Well, we have extreme Verhoeven violence (although it's not as extreme as other Verhoeven films), we have a lot of sex and nudity, but something is missing ... Oh, yes, it is missing as Paul Verhoeven is known in his science fiction films. I admire the way Verhoeven introduces the characters and how they have a sense of humor, but unlike most Verhoeven films, the film itself does not have the humor to get into the comedy genre. Overall actor was above average compared to most slasher films. <br /> <br /> What makes Hollow Man a good movie is not a story, not a cast or character, but amazing special effects that would otherwise make the movie impossible. The crew actually created an invisible man without using things like a floating hat hanging on piano wires and other practical effects (set effects). The most stunning effects scenes are not seen while Kevin Bacon is invisible, they are when Kevin Bacon becomes invisible and visible. The problem is that this invisible male story deserves to be much more flamboyant. This is where the laboratory works for the most part. I'd love to see the invisible Kevin Bacon who'd rob the bank and get along with it, or say we'd steal something from people's wallets or something. But what is shown is decent enough for Hollow Man to be a fun movie. Step: B
