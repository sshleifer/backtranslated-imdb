I have not read other commentaries on the film, but I see from the average ratings that they are unlikely to complement them. I looked at it for the second time with my children. They absolutely loved it. It's true that adults do not turn around the floor, but the sound of a child's experience looks like that. It's a real farce, Mel Brooks, who has a lot of moral content - how sad it is to love for our money, not for who we are, and for how our friends and companions are unstable. There are a number of other films on a similar subject, no doubt many will have more comical or emotional impact on adults. It is hard to imagine such an impact on young family members. <br /> <br /> That's why kids, 9/10 from me.
