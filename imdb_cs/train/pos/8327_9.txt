It was a great romantic comedy! Historically inaccurate (Einstein had no nieces or nephews, as mentioned elsewhere in IMDb), but he became a great lenient. He brought together two very nice people who played two of the best actors. Supporting casts (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.) Everyone clicked on the screen and made a great watching experience. The fact that he was driving by car to get around seems to be in contradiction with all those pictures and posters of having riding a bike to get around. And he wore socks in one scene ... supposedly the professor never wore socks! (Two new items for the IMDb goofs section.) Historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside, it was a great movie to look at with great occupancy. I give it 8!
