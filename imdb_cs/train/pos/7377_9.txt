this film is practically impossible to describe. the alternative name "Do not search" is much more descriptive. Like most Japanese cinemas, the story is not as linear as the American. The story revolves around a director who writes a story about the ww2 deserter. The ensemble is haunted (?) The actress who died (?) While filming TV shows in the 1960s. the director is the only one to see this show. if you saw Ring (director Hideo Nakata is the same) and liked you, you will enjoy a theatrical actress. I loved the spirit actress much more than a ring. a really scary and worrying film. and 10!
