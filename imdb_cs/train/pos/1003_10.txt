Another masterpiece of the Aussie, it immerses itself in a world of unknown and supernatural, and it does very well. It is not used for great special effects such as American motion, but rather focuses on emotional impacts. A relatively simple plot by Rebecca Gibney & Co. brings to life. He follows the story of a couple who bought an old house, allegedly home to a very old woman who never went out and whose husband disappeared under mysterious circumstances a hundred years ago. There are strange things going on in the house, and John Adam is starting to turn into a missing man who was in fact a mass murderer. Highly recommended. 8/10
