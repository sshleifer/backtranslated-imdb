John Garfield plays Marine, who is blinded by a grenade while fighting in Guadalcanal and who must learn to live with his disability. He has all the stereotypical notions of blindness and is sure he will be burdened by each. Employees of the hospital and his colleagues wounded by the Marines can not get him. Even his girl can not play Eleanor Parker at home. He is stubborn and blinded by his fears, selfishness and prejudice. It's a complicated role that Garfield has in mind, in a great performance that keeps an observer in spite of the ubiquitous raw melodrama. The best scenes are on Guadalcanal, where a machine gun is in the nest trying to prevent the advancing Japanese soldiers in a hellish night battle and a later dreamed sequence in the hospital where they see that they are walking on a train with white cane, dark glasses and holding a tin cup, while his girlfriend walks back from the camera.
