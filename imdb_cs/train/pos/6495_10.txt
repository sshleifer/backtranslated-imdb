10 out of 10 is this brilliant, super documentary film that must be seen with film clips of war that people have not seen for years until it was projected in 1974. The film clips in this documentary of war do not miss something, some clips have left me stupid. The entire series is 20 episodes long, and Sir Lawrence Olivier is a narrator telling a stunning story about the war. It is simply the best document of the war, and now over 25 years is still able to wrap a huge blow. You have to watch it sometimes, even if it's just a few episodes, even if you're ever thrown out of the impact of this document on those who have suffered and died in the name of WAR in WORLD AT WAR ..
