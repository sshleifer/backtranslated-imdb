....... You play Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernando, etc. The man was quite wide and screaming. I like seeing Amanda Blake, Don Knotts, or anyone - clearly had the ball and I think it made it easier for my guests - until they knew it was not disciplined, 19 grasping production. Relax and clear the name of the game there. It reminds me of boys like Milton Berle, Benny Hill, maybe even Jerry Lewis. The great timing, the ancient gags that held the stitch audiences for decades, had a lot of fun about what they were doing. His sad little clown he played was also good - but in a moving way. Personally, I think he's great because he just bought two DVD series of his shows from '61 or so, it brings him I liked it for. I remember seeing him on TV at the end of his run when he made the show in 1971. Check if you are a fan or a curious one. It was a turmoil.
