Surprisingly, you can see a rather low score for this movie. This movie appeared for the first time in 10 years and I remembered why I like it. Come back with me, kids, until Michael Keaton has been a straightforward comedy, and you can find some joy in this movie. It's a fine comedy - a second Ron Howard - but if it's your thing, you should check it out. Keaton's key spell is precisely this project. <br /> <br /> "Gung Ho" is a bit late, because it takes place in the last phase of the global economic world, the country where the company is based. It means bringing laughter and learning about how people can teach each other with great benefits. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie and enjoy it without memorizing one scene you especially liked, but it's because the whole movie provides a slow but constant stream of laughter. It's like I.V. drip. And I think so well.
