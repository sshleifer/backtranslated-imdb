I was about seven when I first saw this movie. It's not that strange, but a few years later I saw it again and it was fun then, a lot :) I think the best part of the movie is: Yeti's body language and <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, do not wait the Hollywood made-up, even this film was made of approx. $ 1000 <br /> <br /> <br /> I have a copy of it.Movie and video version as well (But I do not think it was ever shown in cinemas) <br /> <br /> Watch it, enjoy it! Yeti forever !!!
