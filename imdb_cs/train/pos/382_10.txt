One of the best movies ever made! Why only 7.6 reviews is a mystery. This film is a window into the world of black experience in America. It should be a mandatory check-up for all white people and all children over 10 years of age. I recommend tracking it with "The Long Walk Home" as an accompanying piece. If you think that Whoopi Goldberg's work is about "Homer and Eddie" or "Hollywood Squares", let's go. Do not miss this movie to win Oscar. (And read the book!)
