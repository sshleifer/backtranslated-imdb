Just kidding. Jon Voight is a young optimist Cowboy (almost Forest Gump-like) Joe Buck of Texas who is looking for green pastures in the form of a cries in New York. It does not take long before the Big Apple undoubtedly absorbs it and its ambitions overall and very soon. Joe is the target of both the cold of New Yorkers and the unconscious of his street robbers. Because of his pure heart, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) likes one of these criminal throats, and later joins his apartment wreck and two literally tries to survive. While Midnight Comedy is labeled drama, it is, in my opinion, best described as a tragic comedy or comedy tragedy. It's especially a beautiful film that is stylish, capturing the contemporary hippie atmosphere of the late 1960s with its obligatory vertiginous Warhol party cinema and adjacent to the ultra-urban New York City. The film is filmed by cowboy Joe Buck somewhere between them, emphasizing his place out of place. We feel for his struggle, but also just get enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo. Midnight Cowboy brought tears to his eyes because he is also rich in substance and shows a lot of hearts. I believe that this film must inspire Forest Gump with pure and extraordinary lead and, to a large extent, Crocodile Dundee because it deals with almost the same kind of humor - the contrast between country-cowboys and neat New York cosmopolitan. A very convincing and sensationally creative film I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
