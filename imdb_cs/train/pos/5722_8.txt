It was great. When I first saw the Japanese version, it was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. It was not blood and intestines, it was weird, atmospheric and frightening. When my mother's ghost was over the bed in the Japanese version, I almost had a heart attack ... I was concerned that the American version would be destroyed and that Buffy would take away from the dark spooky shades of the original version. I did not have to be interested. The creators of this film wisely kept the same Japanese people who joined the original film at hand and gave the film the same man direction. They also located in Japan in the same place in the same house. In fact, the Japanese director tried to make the same film as in the original, the only difference was the casting of American actors. This has in fact turned into favor by adding the element of "foreigners in a foreign country" to total horror. Not only were they persecuted with an absolutely terrifying and inexorable spirit, they were also stuck in a completely foreign country struggling with integration into society. It only added to the overall anxiety built into the movie and I thought it was a great touch. Buffy actually does a very good job. He looks vulnerable and can show off his fear. There are no clever notes that are so common for American horror films, or one trap that worsens the overall darkness and horror of the characters' situation. In fact, it was just as good as the Ring, which I also looked forward to. I hope the future of American horror follows more Japanese new waves of horror that began with the incredible success of Ring. Finally, we get movies that really can be considered "Horror"! 8/10
