This movie, however low budget, is one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen. If you admit that there is a low budget from the beginning, you can appreciate how well a story is, how well a script is written and how great the creator is to produce something so awesome with such little money. > <br /> All the elements of the great movie are here. The visuals, though digitally shot, were beautiful in places. The bizarre, dreamlike feel of the movie is remarkably well captured in the scene with the talking dog, the scene was amazing. It's such a bruiser, but it's not a terrifying way, and that's why I have a great respect for the film. It is recommended to all who are looking for something unique and captivating, and they differ from many recurring films that are out there.
