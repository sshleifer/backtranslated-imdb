I watched this film a few days ago in a small independent cinema in Paris. It was my last night in the French capital and the best farewell I could choose. These twenty episodes have made me take the impression I have gathered in Paris, no matter that I have gone to a kitsch or a sentimental schmaltz. Each episode is full of surprises, strong emotions and suggestive images, and each short film is governed by the rules of a good story. For me, this kind of film requires a lot more talent and qualities than any epic two-hour track and writer, and they all have done great! The stories were carefully chosen with a view to their adaptation to the Arrondissement and perfectly expressed their perceptions. Each episode was seen from another ankle, had another theme, another style, and twenty stories yet led to a harmonious orchestra of films. The most striking advantage with the concept of episode film is that you can switch between a wide range of feelings and mood, without the danger of overloading, just the opposite: melancholy sadness, melancholy, pure joy, despair, anger, anxiety, curiosity or passion the film's unique freshness and harmony. And do not forget the whole theme of love! Love between the characters, love between the characters and Paris and also the love of directors and actors / actresses for this project. I do not want to get into the details of the episodes because there are so many people, but I have to emphasize a number of world-famous actors and actresses from around the world and their access to this project. Some played with their painting, some were completely broken and some interpreted the stereotypes associated with their home country or the roles they had previously played so that intertextuality was given by the whole movie. Overall, I can absolutely recommend this great collage and look forward to her release on DVD.
