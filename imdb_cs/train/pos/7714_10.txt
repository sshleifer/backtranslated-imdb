There were plenty of 50 sci-fi movies. They were big grabs for Drive-in theaters. Many of them have been dirty so far. This movie and "The Day The Earth Stops" stands out and they both care well in their own way. From the very beginning with his mysterious theremin musical score (which still sounds strange because theremins are hardly used) Forbidden Planet will take you where no one has ever gone. Speaking of Star Trek, there is so much material in this film that got to Star Trek TOS as a pilot for the show; from an interactive captain / first friend / doctor, mad scientist, extraterrestrial beings, babe in a short skirt, computer intelligence; that's all de rigeur, but this was the first of its kind. Besides, he has a good acting and well-done art work, which still gives some respect to his ideas. Consider how a huge Krell machine is successfully displayed with some real depth. I saw it as a child (on arrival: 0) when it was a new movie and it scared me. Of course, every film that was even vaguely scary was preserved at that time, but I remember that I was really afraid of an invisible monster. Forbidden Planet is a science fiction movie fan who can watch several times and find something new with each view.
