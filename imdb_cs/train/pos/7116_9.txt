No one should say that this 1945 war film was a masterpiece. (How could a 1945 war film be a masterpiece?) And yet it is an extremely effective storytelling story about Al Schmidt, blinded on Guadalcanal as John Garfield plays, who spent days watching his eyes capture the nuances of the blind persons. Robert Leckie, in "The Cushion for My Pillow," discredits Schmidt's popularity in favor of his friend who was killed and wrote that "the land must have live heroes." <br /> <br /> Well, I think the country did it. And they had one. The only combat scene in the movie is associated with a studio that lasted only about ten minutes and less than half of the film appeared instead of being rescued for the climax, but it is the most fair and realistic picture of the men under the fire that I can remember when I seen on the screen, including those in "Private Ryan Saving". Men scream for fear, yell at themselves and on the enemy, bleeding and dying without the help of color, stereo sound, splitting or gore. Simply from a technological point of view the film is excellent. It's not just that we learn how complicated the 30-caliber is, the Browning water-cooled machine gun, or that it has to burn just a few rounds or it's not like a hose fire like many other war films. Technical precision contributes to the quality of the riveting scene. The need to keep a short explosion is terrifying when dozens of shouting enemies pour over a stream fifty meters away with the sole purpose of wiping you and your two isolated comrades limited to a small weapon placement. <br /> <br /> The performances are solid, if not bravura, including the ubiquitous 1940 support, John Ridgeley, and the vibrant, youthful Eleanor Parker. The frame love story is a substitute, but it works and eventually moves quite a bit. Significant senile sequence is included. It is not Bunuel, but for the routine 1945 film he stands out as original and effective. <br /> <br /> Albert Maltz may have rewrote the script, or someone else has changed it. He could have used such pruning, which could be some ambiguity. Yet there are odd verbal punctuation that has a surprising impact on the viewer - "Why does God not fit me?" And, "In your eyes, Lee, take them in your eyes!" Depth of anxiety in a few dirty words. And a surprising amount of bitterness expressed by wounded veterans in a 1945 wartime war. <br /> <br /> Notes that may be unlikely for the current viewer, but perhaps not: A tongue that is hard to believe for many today's kids, , that sometimes they speak - "private gab", "dripping", "hai," "you stupid kitten", "girl", "crazy guy", "and" you are sorry. " Consider the historical context and be kind in our courts. At that time, part of the dirty lingo was at the top. <br /> <br /> Real weaknesses? The wounded veterans gathered and muttered about how many collective futures they had and that the argument was finally resolved with the conclusion: "Just because you have a silver plate in your head does not mean that people will be a bad person." Sometimes they are voices and silent prayers that are useless and meaningless. "Please, God, let him come back to me," and such things. <br /> <br /> Well, the filmmakers worked within their time constraints. Maybe that's why the last glimpse of the Independent Hall and the inspirational tribes of "beautiful America" ​​are growing in the back. <br /> <br /> Nothing can remove the virtues of the movie, which are significant, especially the impact of this terrible combat scene. It's not often on TV. If you have a chance, catch it in any case.
