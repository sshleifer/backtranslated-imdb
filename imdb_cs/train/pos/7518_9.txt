Beautifully crafted with a magnificent performance by Gretchen Molla capturing such a neat ordinary happiness in her work, and recreation of small films and photos are perfectly made and often cheerful. According to Harron, they used film stores that are no longer produced, and studio lighting in the 1950s, even in the outdoors, to give their colorful looks a distinct look. Bettie Page saw a movie in the house of Hugh Heffner (now eighty-three) with the producers, but not the director, if it was unpleasant if she did not like it. Apparently she liked it until the official investigation she found disturbing. Some beautiful costumes. The idea for the film started in 1993, but it was worth waiting for it. Her portrait never seems to be fake in relation to all the images and snippets of (spooky) films that many of us have already seen. It would be an interesting companion to Goodnight and Goodluck, but a much more enjoyable viewing!
