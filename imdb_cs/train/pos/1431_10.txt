It's just the most amazing movie you've ever seen. I thought it was just another document, but it really is something else. It does not try to teach you anything, it shows you how life works in nature. I'm not going to talk about the quality of the pictures, because of other notes you probably know is unbeatable. <br /> <br /> The country is fun, tense and sad. It can make you laugh, it can cry you. Sometimes at the same time. This is the first movie that screams me, not because you like animals, but because you realize how fragile our planet is and what treasure we blessed, we still do not believe it a bit. /> <br /> This movie should be compulsory in schools. It's the most beautiful movie you've ever seen, so go and see. Who knows, maybe it is the last time we could see our planet as such ... 10/10, but I would simply rate it if it was possible.
