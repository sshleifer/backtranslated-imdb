Since this film was based on the real story of a woman who had two children and was not very well, it was scary how it really was! Acting is what gave the film that pushed itself to size. Diane Keaton portrayed the main character, Patsy McCartle who had two sons she adored. Her performance is what caused the real life story to come to life on the television screen. It was very hard to watch some scenes because they were so real what happens when one becomes addicted to drugs. Just watch this very sweet mother go sweet out about it, but so true. I know the people who went through the selection and it was very similar to what happened in this movie, what I remember. I also thought it was very risky for the director, a film about what happened to this woman. Yet it was so good. I praise the director of this film. I highly recommend it to anyone who has recognized someone who has ever been drug addicted or just learned what you can become if you become addicted to them.
