I agree that the capital city should be on DVD. I watched this show just by chance in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was nice to see Americans working abroad in London in the financial industry for change. I loved Rolf in this role and I loved every other role he was in. I can not believe the show lasted only 13 episodes. I like William Armstrong as Hudson's glamorous charming friend in the series. When they broadcast this show in New York, it was always late at night or outside. The show takes less than an hour. I felt that this show should go on longer, but the casting changes in the second season actually made the show a little less interesting. I did not care about Sylvia, but last season I missed Julia Phillips-Lane's actress. I felt that it turned out to be a chance and it often worked. It showed Americans who loved and decided to live in London. American characters were not arrogant or trying to overcome their British counterparts. I also liked the fact that they tried to internationalize filming rather than being all British. I liked to watch Julia Ormond in the early part. I felt that this show should take longer. I felt sometimes that the thumbnails lasted for as long as the show in less than an hour. They could transfer the cast to New York and it would be a hit in America.
