I have to say that sometimes "looks" is all important, just as Jeremy Clarkson of the BBC has stressed (not about our country, but he is right). And as far as it seems, this movie is such an incredibly stunning beauty that you will absolutely love what your eyes will see. And then there's also a personality of film just as interesting with a captivating storytelling voice and narrator stories that touch your soul when you look at those great filming images. The movie is unlikely to affect your lifestyle, the destruction of these beauties, but it will certainly remember how precious our country we live in is. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves ten stars because it is one of the few stylistic land papers I really enjoyed.
