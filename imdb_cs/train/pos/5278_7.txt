What begins as a generation conflict in this film ends with understanding, festivity and grace. The film rotates around Europe with father and younger son in the car over 3,000 miles. Scratching causes life styles, beliefs and life skills to crash. In fact, the winner is not clear. Everything is eventually added as experience, experience with several layers of life. For those who are interested in understanding Islam, this film offers a generous and gentle view without being aggressive. For the young son is the story of the next ages, his averted and rebellious nature turns to openness to gain other ways of life.
