"Show People" is an absolutely wonderful silence directed by King Vidor and starred by Marion Davies and Billy Haines. Which ones are in this enchanting comedy about a young girl named Peggy Pepper, whose acting is how Savannah tries to do on the big screen. Although she is successful in comedy, what she wants to do is make "art" so she moves into high school studies. She soon becomes Patricia Pepoire and is too good for her friend Billy. Many stars of the Silent Era have comeos in "Show People", including Davies herself without curly hair and make-up. I'm sure that when people saw the film in 1928, they recognized everyone who appeared in a complicated lunar scene; sadly, it is not the case today, even for movie lovers. In one part of the film, however, he meets Charlie Chaplin; in another, the author Elinor Glyn is pointing at her, and Vidor himself has a portrait at the end of the film. Other stars appearing in the show People are John Gilbert, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Leatrice Joy, Bess Flowers, Renee Adoree, Rod LaRoque, Aileen Pringle and many others. Davies was an adorable and live comedy. It's a shame William Haines left the movies - he was cute and energetic, deserving a huge star all day. "Show People" is a simple story explained in a humorous way. It's also a look back on an exciting time in Hollywood's history and includes a performance of two gorgeous stars.
