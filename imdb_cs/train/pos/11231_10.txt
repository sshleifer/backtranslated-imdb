I really like Star Trek Hidden Frontier, it's a great series of movie fans and I can not wait to see more of how I started watching this movie last week and I just can not get enough of it. I have already recommended that other people look at it because it is worth it. Every episode I've watched many times and I've been waiting for more episodes. I'm rated ten, but I think he deserves a 12-hour compliment for Star Trek Hidden Frontiers employees for excellent work. If u like Star Trek, I highly recommend tracking this fictional star fan movie. The details associated with this series of films are excellent especially for the ships and planets that are used in it
