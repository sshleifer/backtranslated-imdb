Brilliant film about family, guilt, sacrifice, betrayal and love. Macy is such a great actor. It was almost a shame to see him in the same scenes with Campbell, who looks like a part of a neurotic sexual subject, but he does not work with him at the level he wanted the script. But he is such a good actor that he got down to his level to make the scenes work. I'm very applauding Tracey Ullman's distinction as a neglected woman. Who knows? Sutherland is also very good. The way it moves causes its character to look higher (and sometimes even younger in some scenes). Almost everyone knew what they were doing. Macy's rendering of a single situation in which his character can not be careful is nothing but a complete mastering.
