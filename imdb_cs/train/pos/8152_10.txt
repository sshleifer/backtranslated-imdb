I just read the last notes on this movie and I'd like to answer. you probably are not familiar with the original rap story of N.W.A. which dates back to the beginning of 1988, in 1989 the ice cube left the band to go solo and finally in 1991, the band fell apart when dr. which led to a lot of beef, beginning with the departure of the ice cube and dr.dre in 1991. This story was somewhat based on that. <br /> <br /> The next one was 90 minutes of laughter, they explained the bootie juice song being a political statement was merry. not to mention the "tasty love song" was the hook up. and when vanessa sherbert got his ass kicked, as well as the lead of the recording company is also cheerful and when the managers are shot every time too. People who did not have this movie are unlikely to get, or they were completely idiots, my opinion
