This first part of the BRD trilogy has more passion and conspiracy than Lola, but less spells of Veronica Voss. Political thoughts point to them: we see a lack of postwar as black traders have managed to control so much of everyday life (the delicious moment when Fassbinder, who plays a sinner, is trying to sell a complete set of Kleist to Schygul, who notes that burning books does not provide much heat: really wants fire). In the first hour there is some clumsiness. The scene in Mary's room with a black soldier, interrupted by Hermann's appearance, should go faster. The train scene, when Maria meets Karel Oswald, falls to the floor when he offends GI - I pressed it, it was so bad. But as the story unfolds and the years go by, I was getting more and more attracted to this shiny, cold world.
