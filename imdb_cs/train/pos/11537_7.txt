Neil Simon had an order for dialogue, and nowhere is it more clear than the line that WALTER MATTHAU and JACK LEMMON give as opposite types in CUPU ODD - a mixture of comedy and sadness that totally depends on the credibility of two such wrong friends. <br /> <br /> Lemmon is a non-citizen Felix Ungar, who, after divorce from his wife, attempted suicide and reluctantly agreed to share an apartment with Oscar Madison (Matthau) with somewhat disastrous results. It seems that everything Felix says leads Oscar to the wall, and no one can stand in the way of another because Oscar is the saddest man to imagine, and Felix is ​​the exact opposite. <br /> <br /> Funniest scene for me was when the Sisters of Pigeons giggled at the apartment overlooking them for dinner. The invaluable interaction between Lemmon, Matthau, Carole Shelley and Monika Evans is enough to get stitches. Talented pigeon nurses are girls who made voices for Gabble Sisters in Disney's THE ARISTOCATS, and here, their comic timing at the top of Lemmon's sad tale of despair, it's enough to make the film cheerful - with plenty of time left. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Neil Simon and you enjoyed the screen processing of his work, you may not miss it. Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly busy (even though they were considering role change before the start of filming), and of course it's easy to understand why it later became the best-rated television. <br /> <br /> Summary: Up Simon Comedy, you should not miss it.
