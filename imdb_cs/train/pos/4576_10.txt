I thought this is a totally charming movie that focuses on the lives of Mary and Kate and Ashley's characters Sam and Emma Stanton! They both try to make themselves and their parents happy, but; Unfortunately, it's just not easy for them! I thought it was a totally charming and sweet film, and if you are a real fan of these amazing young ladies, then I'm sure you agree with me! If you have not seen this movie yet, I say you really missed it; great time, and you should definitely take the time to see it! This movie is a real winner! Yours sincerely, Rick Morris
