This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Everyone who considers this film to be absolutely unhappy is not smart enough to grasp all the gentle humor that this movie offers. It shows us that real life and "fictitious" actions can result in a winning combination. Like a romantic comedy, she has one of the smartest ways to find two people. Mark me another movie where you can see everything, just like Donald Sutherland sings like "They're going to find their end in the mountains on Mars."
