It seems the Pentagon's scientific team has perfected the serum that causes invisibility, but when the leading boffin leaves him, he can not reverse this process. Frustrated and drunken power has become psychotic in the classic HG Wells tradition. This is the funny, terrible story of an invisible man who has always enjoyed Verhoeven and Bacon as a genius, crazy maniac. As with most of Verhoeven's songs, the awesome unbounded adventure of adventure boy (secret underground laboratories where scientists are working is simply amazing) combined with the worst and worst visual visuals by the invisible devil, the animals slaughtered to death, literally gallons of blood and wholesale defeat in recent two reels). While the story does not start any new interventions on the old idea, CG special effects from Scott E. Anderson are eye-popping brilliant as we see the arteries and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissues, bones and flesh literally appear from nothing. Especially the sequence where the team brings the gorilla back from the invisible state and the scene in which Bacon drowns Devane in the pool, absolutely breathing in detail and artistic invention of the effects. The film also features a great soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith and Jost Vacan's classic horror film. The young cast is largely overshadowed by the technical pedigree of the film, but Shue and Dickens are extraordinary in their depth. This is a great fun movie.
