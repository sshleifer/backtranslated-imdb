If you modified the book written in the 1950s in the 1990s, set the bloody thing in the 1950s and not in the 1990s. Look, 40-year-old morals and values ​​tend to not play or sound like true, so strong. It's a simple rule that Hollywood usually violates. And that's a problem with this movie. It should have been set at the time it was written. Do you think it would not be deliberate, but nobody. I would elaborate this, but the commentator's comment explained it quite well. I will limit my comment to Rachel Ward. She seems to have lost her completely for this role. The result is that it looks like a crack in chemotherapy and is about as sexy as a gay leather sofa. I found that "whenever I can die," she looks quite disturbing and she has turned away from her supposed "bitterness" and "sexual tension" that the film wanted to create. In addition, the film was quite good; 7+ of 10.
