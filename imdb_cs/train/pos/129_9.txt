With amazing cinematography and the Kafka absurdity thread, this film had a simple but fascinating opening scene. The film is more like a dream, and I think it may be the reason why people either hate or love it. The characters are superficially drawn, and the story itself is mild and maybe a bit unnecessary. But these are the shortcomings of the film, but the conscious decision. Film work does not seek to work as a history, but rather is the deconstruction of war films of the 1940s. <br /> <br /> I'm having trouble arguing that the movie is actually essential, but the movie is such a movie miracle that I was completely gone. It is one of the most beautiful films in the past, and in its style is a wild fantasy. I can fully understand why people would hate it, but I'm giving it 9/10.
