This was the second time I watched the movie (the French version, unlike the first one that was nicknamed in Italian), and I think it improves on subsequent shows. which is beautifully shot and the Paris setting is just as impressive. In the long run, this is not the pinnacle of Polanski and I would throw it in his filmography at number 9, but it's still a sure mixture of fine winters, and surprisingly it's often a wide comedy. She also has a fine cast, all in good shape, but mostly Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas and Jo Van Fleet. Still, I am a little confused by the sudden coercion to Trelkovský "change" to the previous tenant; besides the café owner opposite the apartment house, where he was given what Simone had to offer, without asking if he wanted any other, there is little to do (what I did), that's what everyone wanted from him! Okay, so he found Simone's stuff still in the apartment, but what exactly made him dress her up and did herself (though it probably seemed to be doing unconscious)? After his spooky imagination in the bathroom, the last part of the movie (where all the Adjani disappear) is almost anti-climatic - especially the scene where the landlord and the other tenants testify to suicide attempts as if it were an opera night, a concept that used to be 46 years ago Jean Cocteau in the Circle of Poetry (1930)! The end is immediately predictable and unresolved: exactly what made the two people leap out of the window from this particular apartment! I remember that this factor also listened to me on the first tour, and I'm sorry it is no longer clear! Keep in mind that the first two-thirds of the film are quite solid, but I wish Polanski was less reliant on dark spots.
