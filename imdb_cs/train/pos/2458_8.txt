When I sat down in the cinema, I was in a cold mood and did not plan to change it. But this movie is a dramatic power plant. I was all in sweat and I needed a shower. So what are we? Theoretically, the story of a teenage adult Turkish girl living in Copenhagen, Denmark. It soon occurred to me that the conspiracy seemed to be borrowed entirely from "Bend It Like Beckham," where we had an Indian girl playing football and spoiling her sister's wedding. Here we transferred her to a Turkish girl who ruined her brother's wedding by doing Kung Fu. We also have a love story and, of course, a competition. After I accepted it, it actually turned out to be a breathtaking, emotional drama and shows some beautiful Kung Fu (I'm not an expert). The lead actress Semra Turan is not only a champion of Denmark but also a great performer so it seems safe to assume that we have a lot of autobiographical impressions when we consider it her first film and she has no education as an actress. The rest of the support cast is fine, the camera is good, Kung Fu intense. Sidenotes: - A male Turkish audience showed respect, so they had to do something right. - The spectators ran when our heroine finally fought and attacked the boys who brutally took revenge on their brother. - Xian Gao, Chinese cinematographer / actor Kung Fu (Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon), played the major role of the major <br /> <br /> If you can see it in the cinema, a good and intense experience and I do not know if it works even on a small screen
