Who votes in these ratings? "Jacknife" is a beautifully played, well-watched piece of work with actors at the top of the game, especially Ed Harris and clumsy Robert DeNiro (do not mention Marlon Brando in the same breath of this man - see "Taxi Driver" to confirm this point). It's a "secular" film because it does not have sex / meaningful activity / nudity. This film is about the complexity of the characters. Ed Harris feels you with every moment and his emotional blast at the end is heartbreaking. The part that the young man in the bar is ordering to wear military clothing is a magnificent greetings as fashion and movies use tragic situations, and how frustrated real men must feel to see young sportswear. While we are on this, "Casino" 7.8 out of 10? One of the greatest films of all time, from one of the greatest directors of the greatest film actor ever, with the worst film psychotic gangster ever to guarantee above-average? PŘÍJEME !!!!!
