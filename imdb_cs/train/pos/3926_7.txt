Plotwise is a rather silly little whodunnit camouflage as a drama / biopic period. However, the only reason I wanted to see it in the first place was because I was curious what a great Henry Fonda was really at his peak. I was not disappointed - it produces a really warm and charismatic performance. Moreover, I can honestly say that I was never boring at any stage during the movie, so strong *** 1/2 of *****
