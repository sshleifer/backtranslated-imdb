I saw this movie when I was about 8 years old and I liked it, but it was not until I at the age of 13 saw that I really understood it for what it was; a cartoon about criminal dogs with a real heart of gold "accepts" a girl to use it for her talents to talk to animals. Dog star Charlie B. Barkin is murdered by his formal business partner Carface (who is, by the way, totally devilish). His soul then goes elsewhere except the sky just to find a gold watch, which is really his life, which Charlie, who is tricky but lovable to steal and return him, and sent him back to Earth. Once Charlie returns to Earth, he tries to avenge the evil Carface. This is the young Anne-Marie, a lone, orphaned orphan who can talk to the animals Charlie plans to make for his talent to get back to his enemy Carface. But the villain Charlie is actually worried that young Anne-Marie and his plans are not scattered because she has to decide to do what's right after Anne-Marie discovers what her "best friend" really used, to make money a new and better casino. Now he has to save her from the dreaded Carface. I still love this film at the age of 22. The idea and plot are really completely different and original from many other animated films. I especially like the idea that a dog plays the role of a villain. Carface was even better than he was in All Dogs go to Heaven. In this film, he seemed very dubious about his role as a villain.
