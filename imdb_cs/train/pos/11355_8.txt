I was surprised how fascinating this film was. The performances were exceptionally good, especially Rea as a compassionate detective regardless of nonsense. In spite of the low budget, no big FX or glamorous Citizen X camera somehow managed to overcome most of similar big Hollywood movies simply. Narration. The. Story. True stories tend to end up rather than a bang, and this is the case, but besides, it is a highly recommended detective yarn.
