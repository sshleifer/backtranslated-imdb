I loved it because I love dinosaurs that are the biggest animals but I loved the show because it was not copied from another show and it was originals and it has a good story and great for little children (if they like dinosaurs it is) I have a few downs too it's not all that the big cause of dinosaurs look a bit mutated so i had but 7 but right now it's a bit late to yay 4 other lines to go it's great for a fantasy show even though a warning that it can spoil part for u so if u do not want it to be spoiled did not read on the plz near the end it's a little strange to cause all they need to do is get dang I forgot what it was so nvm guess it's not a spoiler so do not mind that i'm he loved it and his opinion and I apologize for any misspelled words if any
