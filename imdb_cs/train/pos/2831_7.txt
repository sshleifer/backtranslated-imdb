I came to this film when I was the eBay'ing Caesars Palace because I am fascinated with the rich history of Vegas as the last of the original luxury resorts that are still in good condition (unless you count Bally, the original MGM Grand). In this respect, this film brings full strength. You will have a great tour of the Caesars property, which, despite all the repairs and additions it made during the 40 years that were open, looks alarming similarly. As a total movie, the plot is somewhat difficult to watch, largely due to terrible editing. And when I say terribly, I do not use this word easily. There is a lot of stuffed, long vegas snippets, the casino crowd, and even the scene where Robert Characterista, with an interview with his father about how much he has grown up, and without any explanation (Drivas) goes (in those infamous excerpts) alone, to a child, to a little boy, and then back to himself while talking back and forth with his father. (It does not provide details of history if something like this can be prepared for them and maybe they will not be as harsh as I was in editing.) The film was born differently and has good news about the natural differences between father and son, Most boys could have some form or fashion.
