Just as others commented, I checked it after Siskel and Ebert said it was one of the top ten films of the year. What present. Then I went to buy it just to borrow. <br /> <br /> Best Quote? Dwight Yoakum stops his car when he realizes that someone (Cage) is in his cabin. When Cage looks down, he apologizes. "I'm sorry if I'm afraid of you." Yoakum pulled a gun in Cage's face, "Does it look like I'm afraid?" Great humor after an exciting (and temporary) escape. <br /> <br /> In fact, it was fun. The constant observation of the sign "Welcome to Red Rock" gives rise to a moan and a smile. The music created the hunting, mysterious quality of the movie, reminiscent of the "Twin Peaks". Unlike "Twin Peaks", however, it does not spoil things by going too far to strangers, needing "alone". I admit that I track credits 15-20 times. You see, Yoakum had "thousands of miles from anywhere" (perfectly selected) playing as a freight train curved down into the desert. . with snowy mountains in the distance. It was an incredible, fluid framing. Furthermore, I have never seen a better alignment of vision and sound in the movie. It also perfectly suits the story.
