BASEketball is really a really fun movie. David Zucker will manage to laugh at us all again, in a really stupid, but very clever comedy. Two South Park creators, the main actors in this movie play very well, surprisingly good, but it's the first time I see them as an actor. The film has often reminded me of South Park - one of my fav shows. <br /> <br /> It's a really good and fun movie, so do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Vote: 7.5 out of 10.
