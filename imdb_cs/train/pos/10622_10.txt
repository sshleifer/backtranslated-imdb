"Hate per minute" is a terribly beautiful movie. A psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of serial killer Eric Seaver. Strong performances and excellent cinematography make this film "must see" for every movie student or horror fan. The reality of the story and Erica's human side separate this film from other psycho-murder films. Some cries to film producer, Bruce Campbell, as well as the film "Evil Dead" add some humor to anyone who knows this genre.
