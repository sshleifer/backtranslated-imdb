That's just the best movie of all time! I'm sorry, Hollywood! I saw it in the early 1970s when it appeared on Bulgarian television and I immediately loved it (I was 14 years old). 25 years later, I bought it on a videotape and a few months ago it eventually appeared on DVD here in Bulgaria. I have been living with this film for 35 years, as have all my friends and my family. My son was a teenager when he saw it for the first time, and he immediately loved him (and that's a generation that developed by watching just Hollywood movies and did not even understand or understood Russian!). What makes this masterpiece of Danelie so special? It's hard to say because it's hard to describe what beauty is ... But the fact is that you can watch this movie ten times with the same pleasure as it was for the first time. I can not remember any other such film, no matter how many million it cost, or how big the cast was ... Chapeau, Maestro Danelia! Bulgaria loves you!
