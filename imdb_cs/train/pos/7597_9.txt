Lost has something interesting for everyone. We can say a lot about this line, and it was a huge amount, so I'm not gonna take it for it all again for you. Just read the people who love it and you will know why you want to look. The nice thing about this series is that it's brand new. There is not a lot of movies - and even less - a series based on the topic just tension, but Lost lives on a theme with pride. It's all about unexplainable, and if you combine it with an exotic position, nice drawings, excellent casting and a good format (current and past combined in each episode), you'll have a series where each episode is a story but part of a bigger story. You want to have all the knowledge about the characters, you want to see the overall picture and you want to know where the writers take you. The result is that his series does not let you go. On a more complex note, the series succeeded in season 2, probably due to their own success. It is well known that Lost was originally written for only one season, and when there was tremendous success, the writers were also surprised. In my opinion, they made a mistake when they added more mysteries and a higher pace in Season 2, then solve those (or at least part of) Season 1. At the end of season 2, you ended up with a big blur of mystery, plot of conspiracy and unexplained phenomena, but it's just so much the viewer can take. The difference between season 2 and 3 was, however, huge. Season 3 passed a lot of knowledge and partly replaced them with new questions. And so they should write; you want to go from one plot to the other, do not accumulate the tsunami of secrets scattered around you, and then pick up a couple to explain to the audience. They got it in season 3 and bring a promising serial future for season 4. Its good to see that such a different format of the series can be so immensely popular.
