When I watched the movie, I was very careful. How jonny could keep that hope, and the faith was amazing. so many people care about what they want, and the uproar of all the things they do not have. and they are such small things as clothes, money and a new car. I saw people in tears because of a fault. this film brings everything back to the foundations. love, the hope of the beauty of simple but important things in life. this makes our day-to-day problems seen as being small and really unimportant. You look at this boy and realize how long you've been blessed with food, the roof above your head and those close to you. You are really blessed. And the speech of the scent and the smell of roses really has a new meaning. you know jonny will see it and I would like to thank him so much for sharing such faith, strength and humor with me. Thank you, Jonny, I know you are climbing the heavens and bringing a lot of love and laughter to the heavens above.
