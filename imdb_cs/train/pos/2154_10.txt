I've seen this movie many times and I never enjoy it. It is a classic in every sense of the word. The film is hysterically entertaining and yet pretty much touches everyone at the same time. For those of you who are not fan of "subtitles" or foreign movies in general, open your mind. It's a great movie for beginners because the story is so fun. Do not get me wrong, it's 100% Japanese (and it does that works) but each one gets some of it (although it's just a great laugh at one of the main characters, called Mr. Aoki - one of the most fun characters I am <br /> <br /> I can not even think of this movie without a smile !! I love it ... and I think most people will be too.
