I really enjoyed the performance of the main cast. Emma Lung is courageous and interesting. The director developed a performance where the characters are not one-dimensional. A complex story with a change between seasons. He also appreciated the basic story of courage that loses the power and influence of a large employer who has closed down to a small town. I disagree with the remark that the older man must be attractive. There are many relationships with older men and younger women - without the man looking good. The depth of the character may be appealing to be not so superficial. The film has a good look and cinema is also good.
