this short movie trailer is basically about the fact that Superman and Batman are working together to form a turbulent alliance. Obviously, the two figures are very different about how to deal with crime and what constitutes punishment. to get there. They will not go in for a story here. But I get into acting, which is terrible. Everyone is well occupied. These two actors who play Superman and Batman are fit for their characters. this is the smallest movie but I still thought it was done.for me, the world's best is 7/10
