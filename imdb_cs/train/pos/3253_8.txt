It's not a movie to be taken seriously, but a great little movie. It's definitely not just a piece of fluff. Actress, IMO, is great. One of those movies that you would not go for your journey but brings a smile every time it comes on the cable. Just like an old friend. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth seeing if you have a chance. <br /> <br /> - - - - - - - -
