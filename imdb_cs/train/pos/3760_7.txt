Maybe it was not awarded for academic prizes and it's certainly pretty, but it's just fun! Nothing makes me smile like Bill and Ted. Dear, optimistic and entertaining, Bill and Ted are a great way to relax. Although I like the Excellent Adventure, Bogus Journey is more fun for me. Death is flippin cheerful and Bill and Ted are even more cute. People are saddened by the fact that they love this film, but only really demanding filmmakers say it's not even funny. If you like that, you'll probably be a fan of Wayne's World, Dude, where my car is dirty and crappy. Admit it, though stupid, cause you to smile and turn your scratchbox. So watch them for kicks and giggles!
