Forget the religious films that monopolized the TV and film market ... this movie has a real feel. While it can be considered a movie that has cheap emotional draws, it also has a message of forgiveness and overall good morals. However, I did not like lighting in this movie ... for the film that dealt with such a subject was too clear. I felt it took away from the overall appeal of the film, which is almost unforgivable for sin, but a recognizable cast and their performances against this oversight. <br /> <br /> It is definitely worth seeing ... buy DVDs.
