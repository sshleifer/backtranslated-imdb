Thanks to Jymn Magon for creating the best 2 Disney cartoons. This show has greatly improved over the years. As a child I did not like it because I thought it was the tearing of Ducktales, which was my favorite Disney thing at the time (like Grandmoffromero). Then later, although it was good, but not great. But after reading the reviews, I decided to give another chance, bought a DVD set and followed the whole pilot the first day I got it and was very pleasantly surprised. It's still my favorite episode, though the show has lived it. And at the end of disk 1, I knew it would be the best dime. <br /> <br /> The characters are so intricate and charming. My favorite must be Wildcat. She is totally cheerful and sweet to learn. My other favorite is Baloo, the best show pilot. I see why Jymn built a show around him. Then it's Kit Cloudkicker. He & Baloo has the best relationship in the series. After that, Louie. Jim Cummings did the perfect job of pretending the original voice. After him, Rebecca. I divorced quite a bit, and I believe he will eventually marry Bala. And finally (for the heroes), Molly. Although she is my favorite, I still like it. I think he is a very cute figure (much better than Webby of Ducktales). And the villains were very original. Don Karnage and his air pirates always distract me, Kahn is cold and ruthless, and Thembrians are always funny. As has been said, Time Waits For No Bear (Romance of Red Chimp) for anything that does not touch (The Old Man & Seaduck, Paradise Lost), for fun, fun and exciting adventure and my favorite For whom Bell Klangs). These are just some of my favorite episodes. Talespin's Disney's Best, Except Gummi Bears Some Reasons For This? GB had a decent amount of my favorite character (Cubbi), while TS did not have enough Wildcat. But in the end, Talespin remains a classic. BOTTOM LINE - 10/10 6. best cartoon ever.
