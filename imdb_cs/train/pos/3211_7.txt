this movie is fine if you like ruthless action, horrifying acting and a very little plot! Special effects are decent due to the fact that this film comes from director "Event Horizon". Costumes are like something out of crazy maximum film. None of the soldiers say so the others tell them what to do. Eventually it will end up like a big shoot'em movie with explosions all over the place. Personally, I liked Russell in "tango and cash," "escape from la / new york" and "executive decision". You have to see this movie leave your mind at the door behind any movie that can not get through science fiction movies!
