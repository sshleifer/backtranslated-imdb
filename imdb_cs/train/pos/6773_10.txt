I caught this movie on TVV the last night and you know that Danny Masterson was a pretty good actor in the movie, and his great to see in something other than the 70s show. The film is not rated, but in my opinion I would rate it (R) just because nudity and lots of adult content. But everything in everything I loved, I thought the Wisecracks dirt was quite fun. It's just basically a guy who does not have any work, girlfriend or money and eventually gets a job as a private investigator (more message really.) He got framed for murdering a rock star and rock star girlfriend is one of the people who really need to helped him. I give it .... *** 3 stars.
