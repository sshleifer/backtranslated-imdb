This movie had no parts that were funny, mostly average entertainment units, but they had no parts that would be really bad. The worst was Sida's voice. His altercation was too big for me. After about 5 minutes, I was sick that I heard him speak. In addition to the unpleasant voice, the film was good. There were plenty of side jokes that, if they catch them, make the movie much better. This is a good movie for kids. It has enough to make adult content and enough fun in it for kids. It's definitely worth the rent if you have kids and want to watch the movie with them.
