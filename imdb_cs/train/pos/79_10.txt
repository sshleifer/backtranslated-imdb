I Loved The Real Mc Coys (1957-1963) It's too bad that Lydia Reed decided to be forgotten and did not appear. The show was excellent. Of course Walter Brennan was as good as Tony Martinez. I loved it when Amos Se√±or Gramp called. I bought Season I on DVD and I can not wait to buy Seasons 2-6. If more TV shows appeared on TV than this one, everything would be better. This show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999, but then disappeared. God bless all the outgoing members of the cast, and please, Llydia Reed, re-tell the public again. You are loved and respected. Real Mc Coys will live forever.
