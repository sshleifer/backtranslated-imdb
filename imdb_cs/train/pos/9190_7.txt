There are two things with Tony in an induced coma: Tony thinks he's living the life of a business convener while his family and friends are going through hell and trying to cope with the loss of a big man. The snake sequences are right in the old episode of TWILIGHT ZONE because Tony turns into an average Joe who tries to cope with a missing wallet and mixed identity while on a business trip on a cross country. His intonation like schnook and khaki wearing schnook is rather a medium American and less than an Italian thug by Noo Joisey. Nice touch. The shocking, long-haired, hippie-dippy AJ (Paulie called "Van Helsing" in one place) has a nice scene with his comatose old man. The best moment is the big boys who try without Tony to talk about a life that immediately breaks into a territorial dispute. Vito will step out of the line about a new dead gene that might be a case, which is interesting in light of what we are about to learn about Vito.
