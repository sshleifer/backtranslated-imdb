It's one irresistible great, cheerful and technically well-created movie! The film contains some of the greatest prospecting sets you've ever seen in the 1930s movie, though it's quite obvious that they are more than real places. Often if the character falls or shakes the door too aggressively, the whole set would, of course, move. The best moments of the film were silent, ancient, spooky moments. It shows that the real heart of Ren√© Claire was in a silent film. Overall humor is really great in this movie. Of course, musical moments were more than great. This is a really pleasant light and a simple pleasant early French musical. Though the best moments are silent moments, it does not mean that the film is not filled with some great humorous dialogue that is very good for the main actors who all looked like theater actors, which in this case worked very well for the film's overall style and pleasant the atmosphere without worries. No wonder it worked so well, because this film is based on the Georges Berre theater play. It's a technically great movie, with some great innovative cameras - working on it and some really great edits that create some quick and enjoyable entertainment sequences. This movie is never a boring moment! Rene Clair was such a clever director who knew how to build and schedule comic moments in movies. It's a very creative film, which, despite its simplicity, still felt like a completely original and cleverly built film that never works to entertain. The last half hour is a particularly memorable fun without spoiling too much and is really one of the greatest and most creative moments in the early comedy film. The film is filled with some really nice characters, who are of course all very stereotypical and stupid and obviously busy because of their appearance. All this contributes to the pleasant, comic atmosphere and cuteness of the film. <br /> <br /> One of the most enjoyable movies you've ever seen! <br /> <br /> 8/10
