I am amazed at the negative comments I've read, and I can only assume that the people who made such comments were less than honest. This is the most moving and real view of Joseph Smith I've ever seen. It was well thought out that I sometimes forgot to watch the movie. He brought Joseph's life of suffering, good-natured optimism, lasting faith in people and God, and the final sacrifice of life in such a way that he sincerely let me talk and was silent in amazement. If anyone from any Christian religion can watch this film without touching it in any positive way - I have to say that it is the reflection of the individual and NOT the film. I give the movie "10" and encourage honest souls to see it. In the least it is extremely heart felt the image of a person who gives everything he has for what he believed ... In a world where values ​​and beliefs are ridiculed, this film stands as a permanent reminder of what kind of people we suppose , what religious beliefs we have. - Ann Pruitt-
