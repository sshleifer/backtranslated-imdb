I rented this movie last weekend, switched off the surround sound system and got great sound from special influences. This movie is a great movie rental, strange has an impact on where there is so much to scare me, but I noticed some looked surprisingly a computer. I did not go to the cinema and saw this, but her scary late nights do not feel like it's a movie. I would recommend it!
