Well it's time. I really did away with any hope that this seasonal event would be an exceptional episode. While Hohum's contributions were still too much, at least the episode proved good. It's a bit funny that director Rob Schmidt, who has only a bad Wrong Turn to his credit, and writer John Esposito, whose only script works to date include Tale Of The Mummy and Graveyard Shift, should be those that give us the best writing and the most thought-provoking episode of the season. In "The Right to Die" we are dealing with the story of Cliff and Abbey. At the beginning of the episode they have a few conversations. Abbey captured Cliff's cheating and he desperately tries to get her back. While they speak, they find themselves in a car accident where Cliff is left with scratches and bruises, but Abbey is thrown out of the car and trapped in a fire when a spark and gasoline drops into her catches. And these are just people who settled down. Once in the hospital, Cliff has to decide whether the Abbey should be in this state without skin and only nervous reflexes. There is also a side effect. Each time she flatlines the abbey walks like a ghost and causes problems for all kinds of people. Hands down is the best episode of the season and is definitely one of the best episodes in history. From terrible effects to the thrilling script that threw a couple of twists, I have never seen the arrival and tension so tangible that you can barely touch him, the Right to Die should have the right to go forever.
