This story is a complex and amazing story of the last hare of the Ottoman Empire, well said and provoked, we see the inner workings of the world that has now gone, and learn about those who lived there. <br /> <br /> I praised the story, the characters, the actors and the scenes. Several scenes suffered from rapid editing, and subtitles sometimes disappeared too fast, otherwise it would be a wonderful work. The main character of Safiya was great played by Marie Gillain, with whom I am pleased to have told me a fantastic job without doing it. Scenes with her and Alex Descas (Nadir) are charming and beautiful. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to watch a little Hollywood and the more authentic world they emulate.
