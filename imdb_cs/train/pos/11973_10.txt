Full House is a great sitcom that concerns a dancer, Danny Tanner, whose wife has just died in a car crash. Danny asks his brother, Jesse Katsopolis, and his best friend, Joey Gladstone, to help raise his three girls, Donna Jo 'DJ' Tanner, Stephanie Tanner and Michelle Tanner. This is my favorite show at all and I can watch it all day. And something in Full House has always made me laugh and there are also sad parts. Full House is never a boring moment. The main characters are Bob Saget (Danny Tanner), John Stamos (Jesse Katsopolis), Dave Coulier (Joey Gladstone), Candace Cameron (DJ Tanner), Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie Tanner) and Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen Michelle Tanner.
