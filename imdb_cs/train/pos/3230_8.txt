OK, so the soldier is not deep and meaningful like the Blade Runner or as a big budget like Terminator 2, but overall I found it quite nice. The fact that Kurt Russell remained in the character of not speaking and being practically without emotion did moments when his humanity changed more. I found out that his portrayal of limited emotional development is much more eager than Arnie in T films (and before I get the comments yes, I know that Arnie was a cyborg and Kurt was a man, but the assumption that both films were the same)> < br /> So to the film itself, a sensible American / British cast is able to tell this little story. I was not sure if Gary Busey and his two deputies were bad or good, so he could not decide whether I liked it or not. The colony was a bit more realistic, or unconvincing, group of loving merciful / furious / cowardly hicus who had been destroyed, nor a group of subversive aggressive terrorists paranoid about aliens and among themselves. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is good and, unlike other commentaries, I do not feel that it will have a negative impact on his career (as opposed to the LA Escape - the sequel is such a shameless creature!). Sean Pertwee really made his late father proud by continuing the family of noble sci-fi rows. And the rest of the cast has helped these terrible groups of people who do most of the bad situation and do not do too badly. If you see it in your TV schedule, I'd recommend giving it a chance. I think you will not be disappointed.
