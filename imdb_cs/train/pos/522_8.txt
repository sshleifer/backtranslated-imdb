The fabulous film Powell and Pressburger, whose work now I want to explore more. The film is about what we perceive as real and what is real, and how both can be difficult to distinguish. He shot and played beautifully, although David Niven does not appear to be 27 years old, as his character claims. Fun to see the very young Richard Attenborough. This movie was thinking about me when I watched it and then.
