Very interesting fun with the magic of old movies. Tarzan, without hesitation, faces the greatest difficulty if the moment demands, and we all enjoy his success. The most important thing for me is a man without special powers to face problems and beat them only with human skills (he was a great swimmer and he had a great scream)
