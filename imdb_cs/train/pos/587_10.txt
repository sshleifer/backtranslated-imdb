One of the things about the movie that heated my heart strings was that dry fly fishing was the main part of the scene. Occasionally, I was practicing my dry fly muscles when I bind my own flies and accompanied by my brother and my father, we spent one day on one or the other river that tried to try the fragile trout offered to them. When we had such opportunities, all our differences disappeared, and all the pressures of the world have faded away to be replaced by the glory of being absorbed in the activity and surroundings of the place where we were. It was one of the amazing things that was portrayed as a minister in the film, and his two sons, Norman and Paula, made this ritual. For there is something of a knight with fishing on the flies, for there is something that is so many fun ceremonies. You can not just start casting your fishing line and hoping it will be the best. You have to adapt to the place you are in, you have to scan the water surface with respect to how it flows and where the best point is to place a fly and depending on your level of skill you can even get your flying there to get enough time to do it to catch the fish and hit it. "Artistic Fishing" was filmed and represented so well that they themselves can be classified as artists. The name of the film could not be chosen more appropriately, because the river actually launched over the life of the father and two sons. However, this film spreads wider than the family and community in Montana, near the Blackfoot River where the film takes place. It has the ability to attract you, to enchant you, to capture you, as it evolves the history of your family, community and time. The narrative story is not just family history, but history of life. What can be considered a "river of life"
