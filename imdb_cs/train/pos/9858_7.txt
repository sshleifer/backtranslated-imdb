I'm not going to go so far as not to recommend this film because the only problems I have with it are because of the excessive exposure of the fence equipment used in the movie - what's going on along with every child's movie it ever seems. That does not mean it's bad, it's just not something that I'd go far. It's a bit of saccharin, so I could say that most people looking for something with a little more could be disappointed in, of course, for kids movie like this. However, it all comes out of the window when the squirrel (that in all trailers) appears on the screen. His time is limited, but it seems obvious that those who decide to have the wisdom to tell these guys hey, could you stick to a little squirrel? "Every time it gets inconspicuously boring, this film does not save, but you can say," At least there was one aspect where I could not laugh. "And of course, it will not disappoint it, but it is almost with Pixar's motion. of all things I put it down ... but that is not bad in itself.
