If you've gotten into the movie with anticipation, throw it away now because no amount of hype will do this movie of justice. Putting this film into one genre would be criminal. It's an espionage thriller, it has elements of noir, bits and events, sci-fi and cyberpunk that are associated with a brilliant narrative, a bend of fence bending and gorgeous cinematography. comments have focused here on the fact that they are derived from good and bad ways of other films. But as they say, every story makes of Shakespeare, so once you get around, you're in a hell of a ride. <br /> <br /> You will have to suspend your disbelief at some points, and while the set will never become incredible, there are parts (read: lift) that suffer from low budget and somewhat raw visual. Do not think this would mean it's on the same level as Sci-Fi Channel Sci-Fi, because it's on a much higher level. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an action, you should turn away. This is pure psychology. But if you're willing to sit down and devote 90 minutes of your life to a new movie experience, do it anyway! Watch this movie now before it gets cool.
