The thing I most remember about this film is that every seasons of the 70s have passed since the last century, mainly due to the fact that the real story was on Christmas Eve. It was always a little worrying to see this girl go through because she is a lonely survivor of a plane crash in the Peruvian jungle. The graphic scene of this young girl, who drew leeches from her infected leg, was quite impressive for this young spectator. It's not such a Christmas cheer I saw. It's definitely not the Rankin-Bass production.
