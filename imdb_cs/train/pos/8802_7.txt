This is a very interesting project that could be very brilliant. Assembly of 11 prominent international directors and each of them allocated 11 minutes, 9 seconds and 1 frames to create a segment of their choice; every short global reverberation survey of September 11th. Without spoilers, I would say that a piece of Ken Loach is a jewel in the crown, and the short Mira Nair ("India" segment) based on a true story deserves to become a full-fledged film. One is also aware that Alejandro González Iñárritu is one of the best directors of the world in the world when watching his short film? he is just a media master who has a deep understanding of the subject. Unfortunately not all 11 parts are also made. Youssef Chahine, in his "Egypt" segment, takes over the Arab position of suicidal collective guilt, which could potentially be the most interesting. Unhappily fails. Chahin's short is badly written and badly executed, at least so as to stand out among others, the better chapters of the film. Despite the imbalance in quality, I would still put a 7/10 movie for the concept, if not for the execution.
