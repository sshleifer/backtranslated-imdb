Yes, it's my love, it's Mario Lanza, which has become a great success and is still popular. His voice was strong and steady, so strong that MGM decided to use him in The Great Caruso. Lanza himself thought it was Caruso's reincarnation. After reading the book by Kostelanitza, who wrote the Lance, he explains that Caruso Lanza, visionary Carla Lanza, became a constant practice and voice lesson. There is no doubt that Lanza did a great job in the story, but the story is not entirely true; blame on Hollywood! I used to sing singing my songs years ago, and it was pretty good myself until I lost my voice ten years ago because of emphysema / asthma. Achieving the high note of Be My Love is not easy; but beautiful!
