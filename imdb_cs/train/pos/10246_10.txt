This film must be my favorite. It did not have a conspiracy because the creators wanted people (Charlie Sheen, I think) to believe it was a real sneak movie. This was the exercise of visual effects and did not cut when the action is happening like any other movie. Movies these days are about sound effects, leaving visual images on computers, making it easier to work with CGI blood. Still there are filmmakers who still can not get fake blood to look like a real thing. There is no rape scene because it was not the reason for the film to be shot. Did you see hills with eyes 2? The rape scene was rather funny than shocking. Although I'm sure there are some producers of pornography GONZO who tried to get married porn with horror. But since they are likely to be able to shoot movies, they probably would not be able to pull it off. The film "Baise Moi" has a disturbing scene because actresses are actually porn stars and show everything even when the whole movie is upset. It's too bad that a movie can not be thoughtless about all aspects of money, especially when we talk about rating AO or NC-17. I'm sure Eli Roth has the ability / talent to make his movie series a lot better, but he too tricky her to get a rating of R ... or at least hope his movies suck up due to these limitations. <br /> <br /> Look at the traces of death or more than the broken pumpkin if you do not want any ornaments real shots (accidents and scenes / shots). Remember that this film was made in 1985. The fact that this film can still stand up against most of the crap that is being produced today says a lot about this film. It would be like someone says that 8bit Super Mario Brothers is upset because the PS3 has better graphics.
