There's so much in this movie that it's hard to know where praise comes from. Let me start by expressing my admiration for the perfect portrayal of Reese Witherspoon. The fact that her performance excels in excellent cast is really praise. Robert Mulligan seldom disappointed those of us who admired his work. Each shot of The Man on the Moon is proof of making the film at its best.
