Here is another beauty in a series of beautiful movies by director Eytan Fox. The film presents a story of stellar lover (one Israelis, one Palestinian) in modern Tel Aviv. The effectiveness of the film comes not only from ethnic conflict but also from personal and political conflicts within ethnic groups. For example, there is a story where one of the secondary characters, openly gay, is visited by a friend in the hospital who is bringing flowers to him and trying to kiss him before his family, and suddenly we can see a wave of unpleasant discomfort. It is obvious that the young man is not as open as it seems, and the family is not as acceptable as he wants to be while a friend is confused and rejected. A lot of complexity is wrapped up in a gentle moment. As we know from Yossi & Jagger, Fox is the champion of effective packing of emotional and psychological complexity into short sequences. The film is also effective for an equal way of representing the mutual brutality that the Israelis and the Palestinians have in common. If you are not heartless, you will cry for the last third of the film. Although the conspiracy is melodramatic, it is so intelligently written and it acts to remind us how satisfying melodrama can be.
