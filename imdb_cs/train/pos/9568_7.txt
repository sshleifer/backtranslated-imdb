Some comments here about IMDb resemble Dog Bite Dog to classic Cat III films of the 1990s, but although it is undoubtedly brutal, violent and very unfavorable, this film from Pou-Soi Cheang is not really dirty to get that comparison. However, it's still wrapped punch that makes it worth the watch, especially if the rough, hard-edge action is your thing. Edison Chen plays Pang, a Cambodian hit-man who travels to Hong Kong to murder a wife's judge; Sam Lee is Wai, a ruthless cop who is determined to watch him, no matter what the price. When Wai closes on his target, Pang stops in nothing to secure his escape until he meets Yue, a quite illegal immigrant who needs his help escaping her abuse. Tough, tough dramatic path with great cinematography, awesome sound design, breathtaking score and solid performance by Chen and Lee (as well as Pei Pei's novice as Pang's love interest) Dog Bite Dog is for fans of hard Asian hyper-violence in the spirit of the Chan-wook trilogy Park's Vengeance). Stabbings, shooting, ruthless beating: Everything happens in this movie regularly, and director Cheang is firmly captured. <br /> <br /> Of course this is a story that is meant for the unfortunate conclusion of all the participants, and of course, almost everyone in this movie is dying (rather ugly death). Unfortunately, there is a wonderful line between tragedy and (unintentional) comedy, and in its final moments Dog Bite Dog crosses: in a sadly dramatic final scene, Pang and Wai are blocked in battle as the pregnant Yue. Finally, after all three suffered heavy stab wounds during the fracas, the wounded Pang makes DIY Ceasarean on (now dead) Yue, delivering his baby a while before he himself dies. Although this film would not be the "classic" end of the Hong Kong surplus, its delirious OTT activity and stylish visuals, it is still worth looking for.
