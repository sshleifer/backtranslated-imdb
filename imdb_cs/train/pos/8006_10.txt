That's a great game! Well, maybe it did not have some features to be, but Digital Anvil still comes with a good game. There is a certain similarity with Elite (you can trade, pick up weapons and shiploads of destroyed ships, go to missions), however this game contains a highly sketched mission. It's a great mission. The control system is different that uses the mouse! Basically, you fly around the spacecraft around the system and work on the way up! The game contains some good graphics, even in 2003. It should work on a modest computer. The story includes some great voice acting from John Rhys Davies, George Takei, Jennifer Hale (appearing in every computer game). Keep a story about how it happens. There is even a racing part where you and your opponent have to race the spacecraft around the course (that is, you are going through the rings). This part lasted for a while before I defeated. Adds a variety to the game. Some troops are a bit difficult, but overall you can beat this game. The game has an active mod scene on the internet. Take some mods to extend the game. I have not played any way yet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this sequel was canceled, pity!
