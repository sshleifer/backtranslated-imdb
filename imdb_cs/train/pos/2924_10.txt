Nominal value NR (would be rated as R for the ubiquitous strong language and raw sexual humor). Quebec Rating: 16+ (Can be 13+) Canadian Home Video Rating: 18A <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy Delirious is Eddie's first comedy routine.This came out in 1983.Back then he starred in the movie 48 Hours and commercial places and he was on Saturday Night Live.Eddie did two to build comedy films.Delirious and Raw.I preferred Raw because I just found the subject to be more humorous.Delirious however is also very funny with Eddie talking about his childhood and do fun of celebrities such as Mr.T and singers such as Michael Jackson. Every fan of standing comedy films should see Delirious Eddie Murphy.
