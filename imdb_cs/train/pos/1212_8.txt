Care Bears Film 2: The new generation is not a bad movie at all. In fact, I like it very much. Yes, I admit that the dialogue is frantic and the story is sometimes wrong. But Darkheart, although very dark, is a sufficiently convincing shape, and Hadley Kay did a great job. Speaking of voice acting was great, nothing wrong. The animation is colorful and some of the visual elements were breathtaking at first. Songs and scores are beautiful, especially Growing Up and Forever Young, he was always my personal favorite of both. The bear care that I like is delicious and the human children are also well prepared. And the end is a real tearjerker. Overall, it's harmless to children's fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox
