At first, I was not sure if I wanted to see this movie when it appeared on my guide, so I looked at IMDb and thought the packaging looked pretty good, so I thought I'd try to watch the movie as Elephant. <br /> <br /> As soon as I overcome the fact that I do not like the character of Alicia playing brilliantly Busy Phillips, I realized what a good job this film is doing in relation to creating a relationship between Alicia and Deana. Alicia is such that Deanna played Erika Christensen for almost the entire movie, but in the end we find out that despite being polar opposites, they have one thing in common, except that they are present when filming. They share loneliness and to what extent it reveals how the film progresses. I just said how much I loved this movie and I was glad to see all the positive comments on it. I could not even get through Elephant because it seemed to use the tragedy in Columbine. On the other hand, this film was convincing and realistic. Busy Phillips is OFF CHAIN! That's a good thing and I'd like to see her in more advanced roles.
