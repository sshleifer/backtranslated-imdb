Let me make one thing clear: for the most part, the mentality of those who lead an exhibition in Hollywood has frankly excluded me, and even more specifically, in relation to her treatment of the very beloved iconic figures of the pages of comic books. Why? Let's look at the typical scenario of the Hollywood Board of Directors Summit to illustrate that we will be ... Executive No. 1 "Hey, it's a lot of dollars that are going to get out of the superhero today." <br /> <br /> Powerful # 2 'Good point, we'll do it with a heap! ??? We'll be lucky in the hat and randomly choose a superhero to set up a movie! "(Damp takes place and the famous name of superheroes is pulled out) <br /> <br /> Powerful No.1 'Great! Who can play this role?' <br /> <br /> Powerful No.2 'Who is at this time a big star bank? ' <br /> <br /> Powerful No.1 '* The name of a big actor * is in the matter this week.' <br /> <br /> Powerful No.2 'But does it really fit? I do not think he is at all like the character. <br /> <br /> Powerful No.1 'Who cares? It's a big name, we'll have that kind of movie with him. "<br /> <br /> Powerful No.2 You're absolutely right! Besides, we fill the whole movie so it is full of brilliant special effects to soothe crazy masses that nobody will ever ask. "The above scenario clearly illustrates one of the reasons why I generally do not want the most modern superhero movies, any style, no substance, and simply pathetic casting of iconic stories, of course they are fair, there are exceptions to the above rule when Hollywood does it right? Take the original casting (and still best!) Superman, Christopher Reeve and recently Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen in the X-Men movies. But back to the general negative features displayed by Hollywood today ... it would not be great if our studio leaders were Always choose actor who really suits the role But in this less ideal world, one filmmaker just believes it or not by taking an actor based on their real similarity to their comic books, called Sandy Collor, sadly (but typically) Hollywood still did not allow Collor to drive the whole movie, but fortunately for gave us mysterious insights into how the end result might have looked like two (yet) famous super hero short features. One is an excellent Batman: Dead End and the other is a fake trailer for a completely fictional film called Worlds Finest. Well, do not we think of our words first? it's absolutely amazing stuff! Casting champion Mr. The universe and the male model Michael O'Hearn (which looked similarly amazing but was totally useless in a dim barbarian) makes the most appropriate choice to play an iconic steel man. In fact, in terms of physical similarity, it undoubtedly has never been close to the comic approach. <br /> <br /> Added to this Clark Bartram is back fresh from his beautiful portrait as Dark Knight in Batman: Dead End; Again, another particularly reasonable piece of casting! What can I say? ??? If it was really real, feature film! Hollywood Studio Directors? note! This is what should be done! <br /> <br /> As a last remark, I am again attracted by the vastly divided reactions that this short film has brought from fans. Let's say the strongest and most violent reactions against him are clearly coming (like Batman: Dead End) from a younger, less experienced audience; a fact betrayed by their somewhat grammatically primitive rants and the liberal use of basic diction. Such an unfortunate state of closed mindset is indeed a sad phenomenon, even though the one we have already mentioned of the Hollywood studio leaders undoubtedly brings a great deal of satisfaction. After all, these very misleading individuals are most likely exactly the same kind of CGI addicted, popcorn-filled enemies that are reflected in most of the crap that Hollywood snakes after the flood these days.
