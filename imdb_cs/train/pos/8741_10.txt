"Life of Bugs" is like a favorite candy - it's full of great little pieces that can be added to something really tasty. The story could not be better; it's smart, it has a "heart" (emotion) and every character has a nice "arc" (growth or change). For comparison, the only characters in "Toy Story" that have an "arc" are Buzz, who learns to love as a toy, and Woody, who overcomes his resistance to Buzz. There are lots of laughs and cute moments in "Bug's Life". All actors turn to great voice work and animation, movement and detail is excellent. This serious movie fan does not throw lightly around "10", but this movie certainly deserves the "10" I've given.
