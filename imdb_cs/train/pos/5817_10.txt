If you want to remember MJ, it's a good place to start. This movie contains sweet melodies, MJ as a robot and a crazy, confused plot. I remember many nights when I got into this great feature film at college and I was thinking about the utmost wonder of the one who decided to green this illusory piece. There's a lot of singing. Lots of dances. There is plenty of singing when dancing. The MJ will kill him as you would expect when it comes to these things. But there is much more to this movie. There is a claymation. There are fat children (clay). There is an anthropomorphic rabbit that Michael Jackson must fight in dancing off (apparently also clay). There's also Joe Pesci (not from clay). RIP - we love you Michael! It's a sad day for all of us.
