I was looking for this film in typical fanatical obsession. I just wanted to look. I did not expect much. After all, a musician, actor and script writer? It is not possible for so many talents to live in one person. Right?? <br /> <br /> Wrong! Obsessed aside, quickly became one of my favorites! Story lines and characters are not lost in typical Hollywood special effects. The story sticks to your emotions and attracts you. When the credits move, you suddenly realize that you have been stuck to the end. Sometimes acting seems a little over the top. I think, however, that this is done with a comic intention and very character adaptation. Otherwise, I would not expect the level of acting to be a witness. It is worth seeing more than once. Suddenly I feel hysterical or suddenly groping for something I missed or forgot the first time or two for the first time. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this movie. Do not be afraid to go with your doubts, but I'm sure he will find a place on your field.
