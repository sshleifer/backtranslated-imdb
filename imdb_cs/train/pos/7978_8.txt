This movie contains one folder that all filming films should have, and that's true. Sadness, love, laughter, anger. There is so much emotion in this movie. From the beginning to the end, this movie is enormously charming. Storyline on paper sounds like usual garbage, which is mostly thrown on the faces of the audience, but can not be mistaken, this film is strong. As always, Washington is doing great performances. Impression: a person suffers from depression, a young girl brings life to him, children kidnap, a person wants to avenge. It does not sound like something special, but it is much better than any other similar movie. For a moment you get a similar movie, but when you compare them, MAN ON FIRE will win. Characters are interested and they all give great performance and the direction is great. Mexico City feels alive, looks like Mexico City, smells like Mexico City. Everything is brilliantly rendered. the style of direction was something I enjoyed and brought the best of Mexico City <br /> <br /> This is one of the films you take once a year to watch again or a movie that you will ask your family and friends . From beginning to end, rooting for the main protagonist, which is the way the roller coaster. There are plenty of measures to keep you happy, you have the character to please, and then Washington is here to bring you a smile. Watch this movie, you will not be disappointed
