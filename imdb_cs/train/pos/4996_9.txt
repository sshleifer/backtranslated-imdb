I've seen a lot of HK shareholders and this is just at the top of the genre. Action scenes are as exciting and kinetic as anything you've ever seen in the action movie. Kung fu is spectacular, the pyrotechnic of the eye jumped, stunt work stunted. The adjustment is perfect, increases tension and adds to the fluid. This film is directed by old professional Corey Yuen, whose biography is full of the finest works of the genre, including the Jet Li The Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk. If there is one thing missing in this film, it's a three-dimensional character, though Martin, male lead, is approaching him. This movie is full of archetypes rather than characters - a sexy killer, a thief thief and his dreadful girlfriend, sprinkling villains. That means Shannon Lee has a wonderful presence on the screen; is great with fighting, cascades and weapons. When it's on the screen, it's hard to take her out of her sight. It's so good. Why is this woman not a star?
