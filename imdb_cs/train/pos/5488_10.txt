The case that you are in the right place at the right time. What a fascinating film. It's easy to understand why Chavez is so popular with people. Makes things done. It is accessible. And it's also easy to understand why the West hates him so much. He has control over the means of his country and gives back to the people. Mostly poor. And it's easy to see how television stations can plot misleading pictures to put the case there. Just like the war in Iraq or the war on terror. Or missing weapons of mass destruction. Or about the Axis of Evil. People need to wake up. And get different opinions. Stop the rebellions that rule the world. Watch this movie with an open mind. And make your own opinion. Then I suggest that you see Aaron Russo: America: Freedom of Fascism. They are not people of America who are a problem. It's the government.
