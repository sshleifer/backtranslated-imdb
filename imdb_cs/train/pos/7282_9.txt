It was a very good movie, and it is totally unfair to judge her regardless of the time he was released. There are some movies that will not age, but that is clearly outdated. But I saw this movie when I was a boy, and for more than twenty years, both pictures as a story were for me and most of my friends, until we could once again appreciate it on DVD. In fact, I remember this film as a topic of several interviews and meetings where old boys talked about things we have in common. That is why we finally had a little feeling of disappointment and even sadness. First, there was a theory of how naive our generation was. Secondly, I think there is something more. I would like this film to have something that should be of interest to all modern filmmakers, especially those who are focusing on a hot prank. This is the mutilation, the idea that gives the film coherence; the fact that a human being is crippled generates deeper terror than death and torture. I remember how bad it was when Kurt exhaled. And finally; when the creature bites the doctor's neck to take a piece of vein. Another notable thing is the morbid atmosphere that prevails without worsening the intensity in all scenes, whether it is a secret lab, a lonely street where the man in the car is looking for a female body, and so on. There may be reasons why it is not a good movie, it's just technical stuff. For example, on the accident scene and the man who saved the fianc√©e's head, an interesting job could be more accurate for the next and modern director of the second unit. The same with all action scenes, including Kurt's arm. In addition, something to do with the creation of a monster. Some remodels were good; I think in that case it would be worth trying. Black and white tones should, however, be preserved.
