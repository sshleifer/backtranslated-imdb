I love Claire Danese and Kate Beckinsale looks amazingly immature in my role. The film is flawed just because it seems that both charges seem to be in a monastery, they work as monks in the grass and under strict discipline almost as martial arts. Actor and filmography and the amazing colors of what Thailand is supposed to be charming, but Claire Daines steals the whole movie and is unexpectedly deep in learning the hard lesson of life itself to the very end, amazing insane, unheard of and completely unexpected in the real world . These mistakes are insignificant and I recommend a film that seems sadly buried on a rare TV show. I for one want a movie for my collection - a collection of only "10" rated films. Look at it, you will be very touched.
