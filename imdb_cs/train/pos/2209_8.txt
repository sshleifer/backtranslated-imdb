In my opinion, this is a pretty good show for celebrities. I talked to Greg Kinnear as a host. There are many reasons why I said so. Although Hal Sparks was fine, I sometimes wish Greg Kinnear did not leave. If you ask me, no one seems to stay with a TV show anymore. Still, I enjoyed seeing different guests and other people who invented celebrities. If you ask me, it was quite funny. Before I wrap this thing, I must say that I definitely miss this show. Now, in conclusion, I strongly recommend this show to all you are dying - the hard sketches of the fans. You will really like it.
