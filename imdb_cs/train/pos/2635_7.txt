My Take: Funny take LION KING, representing the sequel. Surprisingly funny. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, "Lion King 1 1/2" is actually another fun straight-to-video, it is worth the theatrical treatment. I do not understand why Disney released this video directly and released theatrical films like "Chicken Little" and "Return to Neverland" theatrically. These films are better seen in video rentals (in the "newly released" area), rather than see their theater posters outside the theater. This is only a spoof of the first film (although the events in "Simba's Pride" have not yet happened), Timon (expressed by Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa (expressed by Ernie Sabella). We see how they make fun in the first film. Original voices from the first film, such as Matthew Broderick, Woopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin and Robert Guillaume, are back from their first film, while Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give some fun comedic relief like Timon's mum and a ragged uncle. /> <br /> So this sound is not fun. Maybe not now, but watch it yourself. The fact that it is not so serious in your conspiracy makes it more pleasant. It's like MST3000 with Timon and Pumbaa. <br /> <br /> Rating video clip: *** 1/2 of 5.
