This is, in my view, much better than one of the two versions of 1990, but it is still not so good. He feels dated, probably because he is, but stands in good standing compared to other BBC 1980s such as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. The length of this adaptation allows a much better adaptation of the book than any version of the 1990s and St John Rivers is at least covered, though not very well. Timothy Dalton is very good as Rochester, but the actress plays Jane is too old. There is certainly room for a TV adaptation of this length that has more than a dime spent on it.
