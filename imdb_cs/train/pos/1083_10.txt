Another example of Cary Grant's unique talent. The performance that deserves the Oscar's attention but again avoids the academy. Mr. Grant is in this wonderful comedy about a man who decides to move from a big city. The pitfalls of building the house are well recorded and have become the basis (loosely) for the more modern vehicle Tom Hanks "The Pit Pit". If you like a good old-fashioned comedy without a curse and free sex, this movie needs to be seen.
