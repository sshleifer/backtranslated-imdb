One of the most exciting films to be classified as "blaxploitation," Bakshi's "Coonskin" is a rich text full of gorgeous insight. He wrote it in collaboration with Scott Crothers and Barry White, who also appeared in the film. Radio images can often be disturbing, but the message of the film was so strong that NAACP gave her approval (but only reluctantly). I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in exploring the intense atmosphere of racism that Bakshi is attempting to deconstruct. Amazing things.
