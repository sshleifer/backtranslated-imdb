When I rented this movie, I thought I'd see a horror movie. However, in this typical seventies, the mysterious drama directed by strange James T. Flocker is a little horror. Nicely looking Matt Boston bears the picture with his gentle performance and the typical strange atmosphere of flocker movies is ubiquitous.
