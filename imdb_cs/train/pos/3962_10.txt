The amazing James Stewart, the Vera Miles vehicle. What makes this FBI-like historical film so good is a family element that takes part in Stewart's 35-year career in the film. The film shows the history of a large agency for investigations. These are land with bombs from aircraft, the killing of the Indians in Oklahoma for the acquisition of real estate, the fight against organized crime, the Nazis and the Communists in that order. The human element is never far away as Stewart married Vera Miles. They raise 3 kids, because Miles's heart goes out every time Stewart goes to work. Look at the short, but unforgettable performance of Murray Hamilton. A few years later he appeared as Mr. Robinson in 1967 "The Graduate." The film has nothing but a praise for J. Edgar Hoover. Certainly he brought the FBI to par. True, it can be considered right-wing propaganda, especially Stewart's real Republican views, but it is well-done, historically informative, and a family view so well represented.
