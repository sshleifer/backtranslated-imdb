Wow! The kind of movie you can watch ten times and still enjoy your nuances. Absolutely Unbelievable! If this was the debut movie of Visconti, I would like to think about what happens if he gets better from the film after the film. The only one I saw (at the time of writing) is Death in Venice - which was totally unbelievable: visually much more brilliant than Ossession (Obsession). One of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen, but her story was not like Ossession. If you click "different" on the link of this page, photos from the movie will appear on this site. They really will not have a fair experience with the film: such elegant camera movements, such a beautiful composition, such amazing faces, such amazing characters, such a great story, the first film adapted from James M. Caine "The Postman Always Rings Twice." I can not believe it was made in 43, eight years before Brando was to introduce realistic acting with a traveler named Streetcar Named Desire (1951). The actors in this case did not have to use the method of technique, ie they do not really have to feel everything themselves (I do not know anything about it), but they are some of the best, most probable and most realistic performances up to this date in the cinema. Eight years before Streetcar Named Desire brought a new sense of sensation to the screen, Ossessione was electrifyingly sensual! The most sensible thing since the beginning of cinema! Yes, I'm excited, but Ossession was just so amazing. The reason why Ossessione had failed to hit Streetcar was that it was made in fascist Italy and banned by Mussolini in America. American audiences have not seen their full glory in 59 years, eight years after a tram car. I'm not going to say that - just writing to tell you it's one of the best, most beautiful and interesting movies I've ever seen and tell you to go out and see! Just like another reviewer, I'll buy it as soon as I find it!
