I really like this movie. Bozz is ultra-cool, you do not have to be an intimidated soldier who does not want to go to war. His personality is similar to Yossarian in Catch-22, Joseph Heller's classic novel about men and war. This film, however, is not located in the war zone, but in the prewar warfare. This wonderful film is about the unfortunate realization that the Vietnam War was a mistake, and those men who were commanded to be sacrificed for the lost thing. Colin Farrell is brilliant as Bozz, a soldier who showed a lot of true love and sympathy with his fellow soldier when he tried to kill him because he was contemptible and disrespectful. Bozz is totally cold and unprotected, tests and improves his military superior and gets his goats on every occasion. He is a figure of Jesus Christ with a psychological degree, "rescues" his companions and shows those who are in real need a way out of this man's army. Playing and acting is sharp and believable, and as a "Sleeper," Tigerland is, in my opinion, with Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket as one of the first three Vietnamese movies. Five stars, the best selection.
