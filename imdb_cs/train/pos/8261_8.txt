Sentimental and naive, but undoubtedly interfering, emotional request for human help, in this case personified as German and French miners forced to be closed after World War II thanks to a new frontier, which led to disillusionment on the German side because the French are bosses. But when the fire begins on the French side, the common grace of German men leads to help, security, and even friendship. It was a plea that would fall upon the deaf ears for decades because a man from Pabst's party would break this piece and turn the Great War into a mere overture. But I'm pretty sure Pabst really trusts or at least hopes he hopes for this type of basic humanism, because this film radiates with this optimism, while his more flippant, cynical adaptation The Threepenny Opera has missed a bite. Also, promoting his sincere conviction is the fact that the characters are not a simplistic lust for positions, but real people, with real families whose home lives are also confidential. They are ordinary, working people who only believe in being cared for and treated properly with their neighbors, and on this day of individualistic opportunism I will be a bit less tainted in my conspiracy to get a positive message, which is an opinion we can all strive. <br /> <br /> (Note: Apparently, the ending is over on most of the prints, where the French is reminiscent of a mine gate and re-closes a man, a brutal change of events, and perhaps the film was a better overall movie, but I would like it if it were, (Grade: 8/10 (B) / # 7 (out of 11) from 1931} I'm sorry to say that I've experienced a positive vibration of the last sequence, so I'm glad it was cut.
