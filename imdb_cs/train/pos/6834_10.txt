Let's go straight to the point: it's a movie I would take with me on a desert island (with a DVD player). It's perfect. If the reason you see the movie is that you love the actors, you like to see them loose in space and feelings, this movie is for you. Look at the scene when Myrtle (Rowlands) arrives on the podium drunk and Maurice (Cassavetes) has to improvise because she is no longer following the script. If you are sensitive to camera movements, you will be fascinated by the way the camera moves on stage, a particular flow that gives you the impression that the camera is watching the actors as if they were guided by the theatrical principle of "private space" ... amazing. And the story is just a brilliant mix of story and realistic drama. Cassavetes again argues with Hollywood and the politics of great politicians, but this time he does it over Broadway, one of the most interesting films about the theater. Well, this movie is bliss.
