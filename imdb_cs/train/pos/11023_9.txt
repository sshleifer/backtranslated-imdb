The choice of Sylvester Stallone, who plays protagonist Renny Harlin, is praiseworthy because Stallone is such a hard and rocky person who has previously provided the necessary all-round aura to the characters of Rocky Balbao and Rambo. But comparing the Die Hard series with Cliffhanger is an obvious concept. An excellent opening scene brings the audience the excitement, tension and intrigue that engulf them in the subsequent bloody and dangerous encounter with mercenaries. The puppet and high altitude of mass money in suits from one plane to another is something that was not shot. <br /> <br /> Biting cold snow-covered Alps and developed scams and betrayal between power antagonists make one shake with fear. The forces of awesome adventure and ruthless murders kick the run to the end. Good movies are not produced every year and people do not have a feast to get together any minute. In addition to the dirty language / language, which in some scenarios delivers deep excitement, the film can be considered a film that will not wipe out its enchanting appeal even after so many years.
