Surprisingly good initial effort by Alfred Hitchcock. One of the only original scripts written by Hitchcock himself, this film shows a remarkable narrative structure. It starts with a disturbing box in which the "One Round" carnival champion will lose to the challenged spectator who will become a professional winner. The film then slows down character development and presents a love triangle between Jack, his girlfriend, and a professional boxer. The rest of the film is a dramatic increase in the rematch between these two men, this time for a heavyweight crown. Even in this early film, Hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and prop. The tape the boxer bought for a girl still appears throughout the movie as a symbol of her infidelity. The only major task of this film is that the art of shooting a boxing match has not yet been improved in 1927. The final match therefore ends somewhat anticlimactic. The story, however, brings this film.
