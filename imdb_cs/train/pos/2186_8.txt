and what combo. Two magnificent singers from this century are playing together in this underestimated musical. He writes music, writes lyrics, and works for Basil Rathbone, who can not write because his wife died (in fact she just froze!). The best scene is a pawnshop where Bing sings the impromptu number, while the swing band gets their tools from the spine. Just great. And this is a rare major role for Broadway legend, Mary Martin, and she's pretty good. Charley Grapewin, John Scott Trotter, William Frawley, Oscar Levant (again manic pianist), Charles Lane and Helen Bertram. And who knew Rathbone could be funny?
