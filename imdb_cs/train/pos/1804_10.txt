At first, I never feared the fear of this underestimated jewel like a child ("Little Mermaid" on the other side ...). As my title says, this was one of my children's films I still loved as a teenager. It's a beautiful, bitter film about Charlie's unfortunate German shepherd (fantastically expressed by Burt Reynolds) who is killed by his boss / partner in crime (this is the name ha, ha is Carface). Charlie is sent straight to heaven because "all dogs go to heaven, because unlike humans, dogs are naturally good, loyal and kind." Chalie is sent back to Earth because he has concealed his life, where he has become even more confused with his best friend, Itchym and the little orphan, Anne-Marie. I have been looking at it all the time as a child, and I still look at it sometimes. Anyway, it's a beautiful hot-and-cold movie, as I said before, it could just leave a tear in your eye ...
