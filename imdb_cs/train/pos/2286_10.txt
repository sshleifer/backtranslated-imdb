The people who produced this masterpiece have done a great service for the novel, which is perhaps the best fantastic work on human guilt and human responsibility ever made public. Nolte plays the role of Howard W. Campbell, Jr. and makes it his own, remains faithful to Vonnegut's depiction of a man who has lost ALL (for a) Love. <br /> <br /> No weaknesses in this fine fit.
