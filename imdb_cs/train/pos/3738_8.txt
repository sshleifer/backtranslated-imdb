TIGERLAND / (2000) *** 1/2 (out of four) <br /> <br /> Blake French: <br /> <br /> Over the years, viewers have seen and understood war films with each point of view of possible and sometimes producers and writers always come up with new and innovative ways of displaying different soldiers on the battlefield. Joel Schumacher ("8MM," "Time to Kill"), easily one of the worst directors currently working, coincides with a "thin red line" in the way his new drama "Tigerland" advances in soldiers' shoes. This movie, written by Ross Klavan and Michael McGuther, has more courage and irony than "Thin Red Line" or even "Private Ryan Saving". Although the dramatic impact of the film is somewhat diminished due to the perversion of the material present, it will surely illuminate us about the new perspective of young men who are practicing war. <br /> <br /> I would like to know Joel Schumacher's experience with the army. Are men really incredible and brutal? I'm sure some of them are, but the film sees its uncompromising world through the eyes of a young man named Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell) who is rebellious against the thoughts of war. His personality immediately opposes several other characters who become his best friend, Paxton (Matthew Davis) and others, Wilson (Russell Richardson), whose fiery mood often upset Bozza's tension with the idea of ​​war. The war depicted in this production is not on the battlefield, but on the training sites of a Louisiana-based training camp between concepts and concerns about soldier training. This film is about preparing for the war, nothing more. It ends when the soldiers finally go to war, a little disappointing, for witnesses of character events would serve as a paycheck. <br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher shot his spot in 28 days using 16mm stock and with a tiny budget he accurately portrays a glamorous, perverse, cruel and hostile atmosphere with handheld cinematography, unique light techniques and direct sound. Schumacher's grainy and blown images make the film feel like a documentary. This unusual style of filmmaking contributes to the hard core of film realism, quite graphically in the use of a tongue, perhaps a bit too worrying. Words of four letter words lie in the audience, some in shock from what they hear. Even the extreme amount of vulgarism does not maintain dialogue that is predominantly heartbreaking, true, and emotional. If anything like that, "Tigerland" gives us less appreciation of how many of our soldiers are going for our countries in the early stages of the fight. Such bravery must be taken into the army in times of war, knowing the hardships and risks that are being undertaken. Such thought-provoking thoughts are possible thanks to the heartfelt performance of young aspiration actors who display different practitioners. This film is not for all audiences, but young men should look before joining the army ... and the adult audience should watch if they appreciate the courage to do it. <br /> <br />
