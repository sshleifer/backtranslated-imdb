Saving Grace is a nice movie that you can watch on a boring afternoon when you're looking for something other than ordinary scripts and want to have fun. I think the whole idea of ​​this movie and all marijuana in it is such a foolishness! It was the first film I watched on this subject (drugs / marijuana), which really does not criticize it, just about jokes. Grace Trevethyn is a widow who lives in a small town in the US and has a lot of financial problems because of her dead man who committed suicide because he was full of debt. The problem is that Grace, who thought she had some money for her, would find she had to pay all her debts for her debts, not to lose all her belongings, especially her house that loved her so much. She had never worked before, and is in a tragic situation until Matthew, her gardener who is very happy with the smoker's pot, decides to cooperate extensively with her to sell marijuana.
