It will break my heart that this film is not appreciated as it should be. its very underestimated. People have forgotten what are really movies, today they think only about bumpy movies that can be quite fun to watch with popcorn and friends like transformers, movies oriented, hyper-mega high budget like 300mln or even higher for special effects and which are stupid films without a plot. It's kind of a movie that despite most. Of course, it's fun when we look at the big CGI, but we do not get anything of a kind from this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> I honestly think the performance was excellent. Especially Busy Philipps, along with Eric Christensen and Victor Garber (who I respect) made this film at an Oscar prize. Busy Philipps's emotional performance was stunning, her pity that we can not see an Oscar in her hand that she deserves.
