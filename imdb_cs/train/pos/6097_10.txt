I do not see how you could say Freddy's nightmares are shabby and torn. You probably do not know the good TV when you see it. Episodes are full of drama and blood. Freddy is creative in the way he kills people. I like Freddy's nightmares and I hope we'll see all 44 episodes on DVD. The best episodes are: Saturday Night Special, School Daze and Love Stinks. If you think this series was soakable, you are entitled to your opinion, but remember that it's just your opinion and that does not mean anything. Freddy's nightmares will always be one of the best series and come so early. If you do not like it, then do not look at it, but do not forget it's a shine.
