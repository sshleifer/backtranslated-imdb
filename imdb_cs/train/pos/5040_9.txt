For the first time, I saw a Frailty trailer on Yahoo movies back in the day, after listening to Stephen King, praising it in the high sky. He's not even a fan of one of the stars, I still wanted to see it because I'm a huge thriller fan. I was not disappointed. The game was excellent, especially from two young boys. Usually I was angry with child actors, but young Adam and young Fenton were excellent. Bill Paxton was really trying to drive it too. He was beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that the fence rests. Three twists at the end hit hard and fast and I did not see them coming. The ending of the film, coupled with the gravity of what has just begun, gives me freezing even today, even though I've been watching the movie so many times. <br /> <br /> A true gem.
