I love this film like no other. Sometimes I try to explain his virtues to the uninvolved, but for now let me quote a few pieces of remarkable dialogue, which, please remember, is all on his face. Aussies and Poms will understand everyone else - right? <br /> <br /> (song title song) "He can sink beer, he can choose strange, in his latest Bondi twin kit." <Br /> <br /> (The next lyric song) "All pommies are bastards, bastards or worse, and England is the e-hole of the universe." <br /> <br /> (during a TV show interview): Mr. Mackenzie, what did the artists most interest you from when you were in England? (Barry's answer) Flamin's bull-artists! (While you're talking to a naive young girl): Mr. Mackenzie, I suppose you have hordes of indigenous servants in Australia? (Barry's reply) Abos? I have never seen Aba in my life. Mom does most of the hard yacky (ie hard work) around our place. <br /> <br /> This is just the taste of the cheerful farce of this Bonser Aussie movie. If you can get a copy, check out and enjoy yourself.
