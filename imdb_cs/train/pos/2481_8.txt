I admit that I saw only three Shakespeare games (Romeo & Julie, Macbeth and of course Hamlet) that I liked, the other I found so (Macbeth) and Hamlet I just found a masterpiece. I am pleased to tell you that this adaptation is just as good as an intense and dramatic game. The actress is extremely strong (with the occupation that includes Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, how can you lose?) And the change in the time period (looks somewhere between 17 and 1800) plays beautifully as the characters move and say their infamous lines directly from the script itself that every fan of the Shakespearean game gets cold. If you get into this popular drama, I urge you to watch this powerful adaptation in 1996 by Shakespeare's admirer Kenneth Branagha.
