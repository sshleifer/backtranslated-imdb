It's not a deep film; most aspects of the plot are quite predictable and "tried and true," but they were well developed and made interesting points about what we might regret (our "mistakes" as the movie calls them) when we look back at our lives. I did not read a book, so I knew nothing but a story of a dying woman who had long had a strong memory of not sharing with anyone. Luckily, they got a top cast ... Meryl Streep's daughter Mamie Gummer plays a young Lila, and then at the end of the film Meryl appears like an old Lila ... except the young actress did a great job (maybe not quite enough on her mother's calculator, but who is she? ) Everyone else in this movie was fine, though I wish there was more Glen Close and he thought Buddy's character was too dramatic. <br /> <br /> It's more like a girl's film than a boy, but it's a good look to get together with your mom or daughter and maybe some kind of dialogue. How hard it is to really know your parents as a "person"!
