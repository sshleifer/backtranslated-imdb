A random encounter between vendor and hitman changes his life. It's a special film that works, an impressive effort for writer and director Shepard. In a boldly stunning role that is distant from James Bond, Brosnan is surprisingly effective as a lone hit-man who begins to work under the pressure of his work but is unable to join him emotionally to help him cope. Kinnear is as good as a merchant, a decent man with the emptiness in his life. Davis is as cool as Kinnear's coquettish wife. Mainly a study of attitudes, the film is enriching because it feels fresh and unpredictable, extremely dark comedy.
