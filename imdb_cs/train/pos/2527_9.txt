That's what I say the movie "For Sci Fi, Sci Fi". It's no better than Lugosi / Karloff in this incredibly good "mood" movie. These two real artists are at their best, as well as the story. <br /> <br /> Karloff does a terrific job as a scientist who sees himself captured in a vice of futility, pride and scientific competition. I was caught in the idea of ​​watching a man drowning in three of these concepts. I was saddened and fascinated by two stars as they do themselves. This is the kind of movie that asks for a remake. This time he gave Harrison Ford in the Karloff section and maybe Kieffer Sutherland as the role of Bel Lagosi. It could be so easy. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best made by Hollywood EVER. As I said ... it is not better. In any case.
