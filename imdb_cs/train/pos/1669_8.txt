Artemisia Gentileschi, the daughter of Orazio Gentileschi, has shown an early promise as a painter. Artemisia was taught by her father, who was born when he was denied to talented women the right to have their work seen side by side. Her tragic life is recorded in this biographical film directed by director Agnes Merlik together. After reading the novel "The Passion of Artemisia" by Susan Vreeland, we examined more about the woman's life, her work and heritage. We also read Mary Garrard's "Artemisia Gentileschi", which should be a book that all art lovers must read. <br /> <br /> "Artemisia" represents the fictitious facts we have read about, starting to paint. She was clearly influenced by the work of her father, Caravaggio, Agostino Tassi and other Florentine painters of that time. Her relationship and love affair with Tassim is the basis of the film. Artemisia, unfortunately, could not go as far as she could because of prejudices against women in art. Nor did it help to cause a scandal where she was charged with Tassi's rape. She has to go to Rome to separate from the unhappy time of her life. Valentina Cervi makes beautiful Artemisia. It is a wonderful creature that has created a passion for men. Michel Serrault plays Orazia, his father. Miki Maojlovic is seen as Tassi, the man who wanted Artemisia, but ended up in jail. Emmanuelle Devos appears for a moment. The film has a glossy finish that the Benoit Delhomme camera captures in its beauty. Scenic film locations offer an idea of ​​what inspired this painting school in canvas. Krishna Levy's music works well for what we see. Agnes Merlik showed her own visual style with a hand.
