The Chinese story of Chinese ghosts Ching Siu Tung and Tsui Hark, besides being one of the biggest wuxia pian movie ever made, is a beautiful and romantic love story as well as an impressive choreographic film about martial arts that should be part of each film lover. Pious Missing Hong Kong Superstar Leslie Cheung plays a tax collector who spends the night in a haunted temple. During his stay in the temple, he meets colorful characters, including swordsmen Yin (Wu Ma) and Hsiao Hou, tree devil and the beautiful spirit of Lit Sin Seen, who plays beautiful Joey Wong. <br /> <br /> To free her from the clutter of the evil tree devil, she must regain her body and travel to the underworld to defeat an even stronger demon. <br /> <br /> We can not say a good thing about this movie. Moving is perfect, with a great combination of romance, action, fantasy and humor, and the feverishly developing finale should have a small chance of breathing. Chemistry between the beautifully tragic Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung (whose legendary career ended too soon) really allows the viewer to feel for both. The whole meeting is so lively and full of life, I think it's one of the funniest tracking experiences I've ever had. Much of the credit goes to Wu Ma in his portrait of the mysterious Sheer Yin. His supernatural personality, a frustrated cheerleader who bent on suppressing evil, leads to great moments of humor and traditional HK drama. Amazing scores, fresh cinematography with eye-catching eyes and frenetic action bits with Ching Siu Tungem capture this wonderful film. Find a copy anywhere. 10/10
