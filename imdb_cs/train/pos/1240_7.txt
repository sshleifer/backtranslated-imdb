Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who spends time searching for lost children. When beautiful Kee Nang {Charlotte Lewis} enters into life, tells him that he is the one who is chosen and must find the Golden Child. Skeptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue, Jarrell joins without realizing that he is about to embark on a fantastic journey that involves the dangers and the worst of all, the demon Sardo Numspa. Is the Golden Child a product of my time ?, I mean, was Eddie Murphy and Golden Childhood Popularity Exclusive for the Late 1980s Audience? Because I can lively remember how much this film has been talking to people about this decade, it was a $ 79,817,937 cash box, the 8th largest winemaker in 1986, but Eddie Murphy's image was lost from the 80's. comedy awards they had in the past. The Golden Child is not right with more of the 80s of Murphy's commercials, like Beverly Hills Cop, but when I revisited the movie, I recently discovered that Murphy had been involved in his quarrels, lamentation and fascination best! ! > <br /> Flush the fantastic action formula that was revived in 1981 again and raged by Raiders of the Lost Ark, the Golden Child hit all the genres you wanted. A nice girl, a courageous shameful hero with a scream in his arms, a lively villain {Charles Dance so anglically I could kiss him}}, a beautiful color and a cute guy with mystical powers, the film just asks you to join the fun, not the to disentangle and divert its value as a cranial fantasy image. Yes, the CGI daemon looks embarrassed and yes, the genre had much better shots in the 80s, 90s and beyond, but really, if you agree with the shameful rating 5 here on this page, you can take this genre a bit seriously, seriously. 7/10
