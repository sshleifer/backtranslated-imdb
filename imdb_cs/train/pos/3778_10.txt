The first film had little ambition, so nothing happened on the screen. It was a bad version of "Back to the Future" with zero charm. After Bill & Ted has accepted that it's nitwits, the joke can only get to the audience for as long as it breaks. This is a surprise. This is your only spoiler warning ... <br /> <br /> According to today's standards, it's more fun. It was banished after the release, sadly considering that more talent is involved than the first time. We will receive "Face / Off" photographer, editor of "Fugitive," a production designer from Burton's early work and "Matrix" sound designer. Writers were preparing for their shallow first excursion with something deep. Since it has been banished by fans and the public, the director has probably decided that the style is too extreme. It's not, it fits the material. Like "Death Becomes Her" and "Catch-22," this dares to be clever, but we like our movies "simple," so we do not buy it. Probably because it dared to be different is the reason why it took 12 producers to pull it out. What is good? <br /> <br /> - Or refer to Keanu; from Airheads to the Messiah. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br /> <br /> - Joss hates his creations just as he hates his counterparts, he does his own hatred. Evil B & T and "right robots" have the same vocabulary as their originals: smaller copies and degradation of language. <br /> <br /> - the theme of "duality". Nowhere else is it obvious than in the style of photography, a lot of high and low angles. They even use Roy Brocksmith of "Total Recall" to emphasize the point. <br /> <br /> - The theme of "choice". I do not know where it started in the genre (maybe "Ghostbusters"), but it's pretty good here. It even reduces to 7 games against Death - Battleship and Club. <br /> <br /> --Film self-reference, even in the game against death (Clue). It's smarter than Tarantino or Brooks. Note that the cover of the Premier magazine at the end: "Bill and Ted: Movie." Ironically, as were Death and Nomolos villains in the sequel 'Die Hard' and 'Lethal Weapon'. <br /> <br /> I still have some little things but nothing compared to the original ones. Music and the film are different media, so there is no point in why many scenarios turn around the first - especially the adolescent market. Carlin is a great comic, but he is useless in these films. Also, for all brave this effort shows, even cracking gay jokes, can not kill a cat? So, even though they look like Nickelodeon's production, it's incredibly interesting. We got Beavisa and Butt-Head from this movie. "We are in heaven and just spit three people." <br /> <br /> Final Analysis = = Medium Material
