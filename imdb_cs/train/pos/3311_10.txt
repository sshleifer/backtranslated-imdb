A common plot in films is made up of the main characters who leave the hustle and bustle of the city and find themselves in peace of nature. In the power of the Kangwon province, we managed to show two stories of individuals who are doing it and trying to find a way on the way to popular Korean parks in the Kangwon Mountains. However, rather than epiphanic moments, we have two characters whose trip to nature was just another form of escape. The pace of this film is slow, contemplative. Finally, we learn what each has actually brought to the Kangwon province and learn how they are interconnected. For those who want Hollywood glam and for the film to give them a definitive answer, this film will not satisfy. But for those who want a movie that lets them think, think and influence them after a few years, this movie will be more than satisfying the desire.
