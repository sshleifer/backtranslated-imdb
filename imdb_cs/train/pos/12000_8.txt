I think the film is educational. However, it has not been able to deal with the problem that caused so much controversy: plural marriage. The film also fails to reveal what the LDS church is taking over. A great opportunity has been omitted from the world what it really believes. I could not get a clear idea of ​​what LDS views about the central themes of religion. I have a lot of LDS friends and they are nice people. It would be nice to get a clearer idea of ​​how they look at their controversial statements. Perhaps these statements are too controversial to be treated in the format of the film, but it would be great to hear the whole story of Joseph Smith's really interesting life. After all, it gives an insight into the American thinking of religion in the 18th century. I hope they will do some documents on this fascinating theme, which will allow historians to comment on Smith's life. Maybe we have a Mormon president sometimes. After all, Smith ran for president.
