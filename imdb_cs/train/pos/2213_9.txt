Wow it was the movie was totally charming I could not believe I woke up so late to watch it but it came late at night I started watching I could not stop it had a whole bunch of very good cast members Wow even Eartha Kitt and Ruby Dee Forrest Whittaker and James Earl Jones, and many other well-known actors and actresses, it was more than just a glimpse into history, it was the eye of opening into another part of society that people do not know and may even be ashamed of talking about. I've never heard of a book or a movie about it before, and that's something black history never solves only looking down on because they were privleged and mixed race, I highly recommend this movie
