It's easy to really make general comments about such a movie. The fact that it is one of the only remaining Japanese films of that time causes people to say that "it started Japanese cinematography" and was "unlike anything it ever did in the West." The second of these two comments is particularly untrue, as Kinugasa himself admitted that on more than one occasion he was "Caligari". But the style was to be imitated and did not turn away from the meaning of this film. What we have here are experimental themes and compositions built on already established visual styles that open the door for truly brilliant layering of stories and facts. For this purpose, the madhouse is the ideal environment, and the writers knew it. This is a landmark movie and every effort should be made to keep track of it. <br /> <br /> 5 of 5 - basic
