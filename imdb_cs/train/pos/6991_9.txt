It's an excellent movie. Cast is a great combination of characters and the story is decent. The film is essentially a perfect physician who steals the bodies of the dead bride and takes them to their home. Once the bodies are in his house, he removes things (I hate to use such a general term, but I forget how it was removed) and puts it in his wife to keep his youth. Then the reporter Patricia Hunter investigates the situation and begins to find answers to the question of why the brides are dying. They go to the Doctors' House and start to do interesting things. Be sure to watch this old one, but good if you can.
