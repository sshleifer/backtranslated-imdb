<br /> <br /> Robot jox is a great little movie ok some of the series are bad and playing is not so great but special effects are very good for a movie of this size and age. You have to realize that this film is over 10 years old and was made very cheaply in the first place, so you can not moan a lot about the bad parts. So just sit down and watch a great movie with big robots in it.
