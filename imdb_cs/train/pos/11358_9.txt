Poor DVD quality is the only reason why I made this movie 9th instead of 10. This could be much better, this movie deserves it. This is really a movie that covers several themes at the same time. If you do not like movies about serial murders but are fascinated by the amazing bureaucratic culture of the former Sovjet, this film is just as necessary. I can not compare it to "Lamb's Silence" for several reasons. The way the serial killer is depicted is much better in Citizen X. You see a few details about his private life because you "travel" along with the killer, giving you a clue about the source of his constant anger and sexual frustration. The only other movie I've seen is as realistic as this one was "Henry - a serial killer portrait." If you're fascinated by this movie, you definitely have to look at Citizen X.
