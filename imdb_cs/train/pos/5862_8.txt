In this story many things are happening - just two men using very different ways of dealing with memories of Vietnam. But what he misses is more than just what he does in acting and realism. It's a silent film about the friendship of friendship and shared experience. We even get romance (invalid - just another very real piece of this story). It's worth seeing.
