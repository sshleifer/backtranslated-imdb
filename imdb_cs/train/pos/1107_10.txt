In the classic sense of four humor (not specific to the concept of entertainment or even entertainment), Altman's "H.E.A.L.T.H." it treats all the humor and in fact very entertaining and entertaining ways. There is Phlegm, as is the very slow, protective and protective character of Lauren Bacall, Esther Brill, whose mission in life seems to be an appearance, protecting the secrets of her age and beauty more than her welfare. There is cholerician Paul Dooley, Dr. Gil Gainey, who as a fish from the water (maybe more like a seal) encircles frantically, barks and encourages crowds to sign up to his water madness. Isabelle Garnell's melancholy from Glenda Jackson embraces Shakespeare's trap and suicide Hamlet - even offering one or two soliloquy. And do not forget the White Character of Henry Gibson, Bobby Hammer ("The Breed That Feeds The Child Drives The World"). Then the characters are Harry Wolff and Gloria Burbank (James Garner and Carol Burnett, respectively), relatively healthy characters striving to find a balance between all the companions and the extreme humor that were convened for H.E.A.L.T.H. - a type of World Trade Organization specializing in H.E.A.L.T.H., which means something other than health. It's Altman in his classical best.
