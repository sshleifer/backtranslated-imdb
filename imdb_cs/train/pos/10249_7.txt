This is the first of the Guinea Pig series and is one of the most famous films in the collection. <br /> <br /> It took me a long time to finally get into my hands and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of films. I bought a set of seabirds and decided to track the collection in order of release date. So I jumped up to my shit and sat down. From what I read on the internet and realized the content that concerns this movie, I expected to test my nerves in full strength. That did not happen at all. The film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and start torturing her in the hope of discovering a human breakpoint and how long a person can tolerate pain. <br /> <br /> Sounds like one wrong click on the right? Poorly. The film does not want to shock. This may be because I've become desensitized over the years to my obsession with horror, but I think it's safe to say that every true gorehound could sit easily. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, a person who does not have sufficient knowledge of this type of movie will most likely be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images he sees on the screen. Although it did not make me shock, the film contains some pretty dirty and graphic scenes of violence. Including nail tearing, intestines thrown by unconscious women, and eye needles. Overall, I think for most of the gorehounds on this album you should get your hands on a copy of this movie for its novelty, but I suggest that all new guides for these types of movies should go up to this.
