Antonioni tried another masterpiece, this time on the other side of the Atlantic, rather than "Blow up". It was not a success with critics and teenagers first. Why? Perhaps because it was a European view of America, filled with clich√©s that did not work and did not get well. (Revolutionary students are embarrassed at the beginning.) <br /> <br /> Maybe when big movies were released and those specifically targeted at the youth market seemed dated. If it was released a year before, perhaps the hippy desert would seem fresh ... It is a very interesting tho movie, very beautifully shot with some brilliant and Antonionian scenes between itself, like love in the desert, peace of desert mansion and explosive end. .. That two amateurs did not help. They were beautiful but inexperienced. Mark Freshette is a bit better than Daria Halprin. It would be much better with the right actors! Perhaps Michelle Phillips or young Jessica Lange ... Dialogue is really quite entertaining and occasional that you would not know how the lines are delivered ... A very interesting documentary at the end of the sixties is definitely worth a look at the photo and the soundtrack ... .
