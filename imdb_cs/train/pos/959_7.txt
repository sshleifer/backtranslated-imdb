There are many police tracks that make bikes. I'm not sure why. It is probably related to the old basic theme of good versus evil. This film has a documentary style when we watch the difficult initiation of Anna, raw recruiting, into a police unit located in the Baltic Sea. No attempt at the police is spectacular. They are really on the ground, harsh and stubborn, Anne on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition. Against all rules, he sometimes detains incriminating information that occurs during her crawling and other investigations. It's not a nice movie. Not one that would release you. This is not too optimistic. The police seem to be participating in the lost battle. Tomorrow will be more mad, more murders, more family breakdowns and more children in need. Let's look at it. This is the world in which we live. As the days go, Anne gets more involved with the police and the families they are investigating. The only real warmth in the movie is that it is provided the character of Benny, 12 years old, of a broken family. Anne has her own way to stretch things. He's going to Benny's theft and he's trying to help him the best. I was surprised she went so far as to seduce Benny's father. I was wondering if it was a father or her own needs. After all, the film clearly shows that he desperately needs a partner and loving children. <br /> <br /> Well occupied, but not my idea of ​​evening entertainment,
