I had no idea what this movie was about, or even knew it existed about a month ago when I came across when I was looking for other movies that were watching Dominic Monaghan. I thought this movie was a strange insight into the mind of a sleeping man and what his mind could go through in the hours they spent awake when the rest of the world around them slept was an interesting film and a good role played Dom ....... I believe that although you can not buy this movie anywhere (I have not seen it anywhere) you have to see that if you ever get a chance because it really will think about those around us who can not sleep and have to suffer night after night they were unable to sleep or just got about one hour of sleep each night, so overall it was an interesting film of good substance.
