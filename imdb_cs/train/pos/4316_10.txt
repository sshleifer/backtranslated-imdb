I must say that the Grand Canyon is one of the most influential movies I've ever seen. I've been looking at it a couple of times and still feel like I first; that this film itself can create the entire curriculum of postgraduate study in the film. Long ago, movie trailers had promised: "It makes you laugh, it will cry." This is a very trite and abbreviated method of describing what the Grand Canyon does. He will bring you to the best places in human experience, and in the next moment he will take you to the gate of hell. <br /> <br /> Most of the film moves back and forth between people close to happiness and the same people who are close to horror. It is also always a short step. Just mastering the swing with grace and without being fake or exaggerated is overhead genius. <br /> <br /> Spoiler (sorts) is coming. After the audience gets used to rocking back and forth through the emotional spectrum, the film throws a curve with a sequence that does not go from good to bad and back, but instead escalates from a simple marital crotch, a random suicide knife that may or may not require stitches , the earthquake that has the characters running out of the house. At the moment of their relief, the forgotten argument of their forgotten finger, the earthquake survived, the neighboring woman calls her older husband to collapse. The couple is about to help. I cried when I saw this sequence. I cried every time I saw it. I'm crying now. It's not the sadness that makes me do it. This is not a particularly sad sequence. What frightens me is that these few minutes of the film were PERFECT. That's great! Stunning. (end spoiler) <br /> <br /> There is still a lot of information about the Grand Canyon. It depicts relatively ordinary people experiencing the epiphany and allowing the viewer to experience their deputies. There are no flamboyances or exaggerations, and there is no long pause for a careful examination of this moment. The film moves at the pace of life. Even if those characters try to understand what has happened, they are sure what to draw from their experiences. <br /> <br /> Grand Canyon is a very human film.
