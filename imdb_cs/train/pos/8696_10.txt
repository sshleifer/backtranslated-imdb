One of the unsuccessful gems of the eighties, The Scenes ... contains sharp satire and exceptional performances from Arnetia Walker (how did she not get a roll of roles after that?) And Wallace Shawn. It is an excellent reinforcement of class struggles and people in these classes. The font is merry and the characters, though delicate, are nuanced. And I'm sorry, but the Asian gangs (if you can call a Japanese guy who scared one of the other "gang" characters) were not included in the "sociological value" category, as other reviews would mean they should be. The value here lies in what makes the film fun and in a sparkling bad way it does. I found it creative, fun and idiosyncratic.
