What a funny movie! If you are a fan of Giallo, Red Queen Kills 7 Times is a true winner. First, it's hard to be wrong with Barbary Bouchet and Marina Malfatti in the same Giallo. Both are amazing - especially the broad-minded innocent Bouchet as a blame woman who worries her life. Red Queen Kills killing scenarios 7 times are especially nice and have enough blood to make most fans happy. One of the first murders comes rather unexpectedly and really discards the film. The killer, the Red Queen, is one of the most surprising and interesting murderers I've seen in the Italian film. The 1970s and fashion are wonderful. In fact, all the visuals are interesting when the laughing Red Queen crosses the bridge overnight and is one of my favorite moments in the movie. The conspiratorial conspiracy kept on my whole interest. Finally, Bruno Nicolai's score may be the best I've ever heard from the composer. The main theme is so memorable that I could not get her out of my head for two days. The only two questions I have with the Red Queen Kills 7 Times come in the final of the film. Firstly, the person responsible for the murder is too easily discoverable. If you have seen more than a few Gialli, you will have no problem in determining who is behind the murders. Secondly, the end feels a bit too nasty and as a result is a bit confusing. I'm certainly not the one who needs every point of conspiracy for me, but I confess I explained it all. The second tracking could only resolve.
