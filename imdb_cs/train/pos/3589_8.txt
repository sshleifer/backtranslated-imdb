I enjoyed this movie and, after watching it, I was wondering how much Caitlin Rose is in the world. How many other girls have been exposed to this sexual abuse and torture by classmates and were too scared to open their mouths around? How terrifying and cruel can teenagers be to each other, because, as this film demonstrates who is right, it is not the most important who is popular and afraid of manipulating the minds of youth and affecting them to allow this kind of immortality. Tiffani Amber Thiessen gives powerful performance as a victim of rape and Brian Austin Green is convincing as a man torn between the girl he thought he loved and his best friend. This is the kind of movie that does not get into the Exposition, It's worth it, and brilliant, too good to be just a movie made for television.
