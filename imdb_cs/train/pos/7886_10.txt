Okay, I'm a fan of the Nightmare series and everyone says this is the worst! But it is not! Did not you see Freddy's revenge ??? WTF! It was the worst of all !!! Now this movie is quite decent and kept the story of Freddy and it's great that he had a daughter etc. And then I found it was in 3-D !!! I was so excited, I remember when I saw it on the box of a DVD box that I immediately jumped to the 3-D sequence. There was a lot in 3-D, though like Lisa Zanes's hand, Dream Demons, Freddy Claw (more than once), Lezlie Dean holding a knife, Lisa Zane with a baseball bat, Doc's hand, Freddy's head erupting. <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie because it was in 3-D, but I wish the whole movie was in 3-D not in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> The journey is 15 minutes NOT TEN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
