An excellent film that reveals how people are associated with the common beads exchanged during Mardi Gras. The film is much more than a commentary on globalization. In fact, he is humanizing Chinese workers, factory owners, bead distributors in New Orleans, and even guests in New Orleans. What is most outstanding is the director's ability to tell a storyline with complicated details in such a simple and seductive way. His amazing access to the factory is another aspect that is interesting and I just wanna know how he got inside. It is a beautiful story without sentimentality or guilt associated with it, and the conclusion provides hope without people leaving the feel of alienation.
