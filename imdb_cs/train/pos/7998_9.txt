I loved this movie. I am a Mexican, and I was the least disappointing. Actually, I think this movie should be shown in police headquarters throughout Mexico. It's a sad truth that our police system is just as rotten as a three-month-old corpse. He calls me to read in the news how killers, hijackers, and other promises are free by paying a ridiculous fine or living as kings inside prison cells. We should have someone like Creasy, the character of Denzel Washington. The warrior turned his revenge. Hijacking is the emerging industry here (at least in big cities). Actually, I would like the real life of the hijackers to suffer the same fate that Creasy did his good job. It would be so great (I'm sorry, I'm nasty!). MAN ON FIRE is a gripping film that you can not miss. Some of you may find it difficult if you're not used to reading subtitles (Mexicans do it all the time watching American movies), but the effort will be worth it. Some adjustments are a bit messy ... like TRAFFIC, remember? (another great shot of how spoiled Mexico is). The film starts a bit slow, but the pace rises furiously in the second half. I swear you'll be glad to see how Denzel Washington is sending out the wrong factors. His performance is not good. End (no spoilers, OK!) It's a little sad, but you'll definitely like it. MAN ON FIRE is one of the best movies of the year. And "must own" for a DVD collection! 9 * of 10
