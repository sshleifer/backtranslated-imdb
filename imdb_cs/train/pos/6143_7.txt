He never saw this film in 1971 and was very entertaining with this great production created by Walt Disney Studios and great animations. Angela Lansbury (Eglantine Price) played an excellent role as a woman in a witchcraft craft and was a disciple who had begun to fly on a broom and had a lot of trouble to take off. Eglantine discovered many tricks and managed to travel to different parts of the world. Eglantine, however, missed final examinations to become a perfect witch. Mr. Emerlius Browne (David Tomlinson) was the person who sold Eglantine this course in witchcraft and tried to help her in all possible ways to find her solution. Eglantine has a sense of her madness and this is to prevent the Nazis from escaping England. Great family fun and today we need other similar movies.
