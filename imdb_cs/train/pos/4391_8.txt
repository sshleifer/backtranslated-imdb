You're waiting for the remake to be better or worse. I rated Audie Murphy movie 3 (I'm a hard grader), the second I ever gave Audie (the worst is "Battle at Bloody Beach" if you're curious). I give this movie a rating of "8" (and I'm a hard cutter) It's a civil war story of renegade "soldiers" if you want to call it against the North. People like Quantrell, and the men who went with these defendants. The original original was a watery, very clean cut while still showing the horror of what these men did. In fact, movies like the older version are best seen by mature audiences who can recognize this story. I would have liked to judge the original "R" and this, with its terrible character, GP, because the newer film gives a very honest version, a message easier to decrypt juvenile than older versions. <BR/> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film makers have boasted "realism" since the early 1960s, but only a few have succeeded. Instead, they give colorful scenery, expensive costumes and small events, but with stereotypical characters from a cardboard box, the weakness of spaghetti. Modern filmmakers have realized this mistake. Obviously, the Western style, which we usually see today, is obvious. This film is an example. It gives realistic settings, but it also gives us the characters we can trust to exist at that time. He has some peace of mind, which makes him sit up a little hard and has some inexplicable situations. But the inexplicable situation is fine, how long the film is held and the characters are interesting. <br /> <br /> It's getting a little camping, but it's really getting better. The main character is one we can identify and at least some sympathy. Audie Murphy's character of the first film really does not make any sympathy and is too self-confident without motivation. The character in this film follows the lines of a real anti-hero. There is motivation and the method of his madness. We never feel it is "right", but we can understand where it comes from. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action in the movie. There is also some humor. One good scene is when a hero tells a hero he will not lie to, and he exaggerates. <br /> <br /> This movie has succeeded in what the filmmakers are trying to do for decades. This team of directors and writers did it right. <br /> <br /> Recommended. Complete success.
