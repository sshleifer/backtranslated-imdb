I've always been a fan of the show, so I admit I'm impressed. When the show ended, I felt that too many questions remained unanswered. This movie seemed to me to be a closure. Seeing all the people I've watched over the last couple of years has been enriching. I heard it's probably the only murder movie we can expect. If this is the case, it is a good way to go out. This movie is sometimes painful, sometimes disturbing, but always satisfying. If you are or have ever been show fans, check out this movie.
