"Kolchak" was a television series that really did not fit into any category. Part of the horror, part of a comedy, some social awareness and what we have is something I think people were not ready to do. It's really shame because I started watching these shows in the Chiller network (I never saw the originals), I realized how different and interesting it is. <br /> <br /> Darren McGavin plays as Kolchak reporter of the International Intelligence Service and Simon Oakland as his always angry boss, Tony Vincenzo, the show followed the exploitation of the Chicago news reporter, which more often became part of the story when he searched the windy city for today's modern creepies that will come across at night. The underwater spell of MacGavin really splits the show. Somewhat fucking guy who always wears the same suit, you can not love him. His jokes are great, and back and forth between him and the skeptical editor, Oakland, are totally merry. <br /> <br /> Stories are largely good and acting is very good. The 1970s were not a great season of special effects, and the show suffers for it, but if you stop mistrust, what you have is a fun series that was ahead of us.
