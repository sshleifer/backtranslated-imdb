This movie surprised me. Some things were "clich√©s," and some of the technological elements reminded me of the movie "The Enemy of the State," in which Will Smith played. But largely amusing - a good combination with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and two stupid heroes Julio and Ramundo (providing comic relief). This is a movie you can watch again - say ... sometimes in the middle of the night when nothing else is. I gave her 9 fun.
