There are enough sad stories about women and their oppression with religious, political and social means. Do not cut movies and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights, as well as wage inequality and marginalization in society, all in the name of Allah or God or some other ridiculous justification, but sometimes it is useful to simply take a different approach and a little light on the subject. <br /> <br /> The match is a match between Iran and Bahrain in 2006 to qualify for the World Cup. Her passion is high and some women try to mask like men to get into the match. The women who were caught (played by Sima Mobarak-Shahi, Shayesteh Irani, Ayda Sadeqi, Golnaz Farmani and Mahnaz Zabihi) and detention for criminal prosecution provided fun and enlightened views of the country's customs and, most likely, all Muslim countries. Their interaction with the Iranian soldiers who guarded and transported them, both the towns and the villagers, and the father who was looking for his daughter, provided several merry moments when we thought why they had such unwritten rules. This is above all a paternalistic society that feels that it must save their women from the brutal behavior of their men. Rather than educating the male population, they deny privilege and rights to women. Seeing changes in responsible soldiers and the reflection of Iranian society is a surprise that this film will have no Iranian game. But Jafar Panahi has the winner in his hands for those who can see him.
