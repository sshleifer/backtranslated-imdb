In Mexico, this film was only broadcast on PayTV. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life is a real example of a good German and a particularly good man. Interviews between the Grown-up Nature and the Nazi Prosecutor are particularly interesting. The War of Real Thoughts: Two different Germans, both believing there. Bonhoeffer was a very complex person, a freedom fighter, a friend, a church, and a great intellectual; Ulrich Tukur is as good as Bonhoeffer. I have recommended this film a lot, especially in this difficult time for the planet. In Mexico we do not know much about Pastor Bonhoeffer's life and reference, it's a great job to save a forgotten hero.
