Acting This film is a very well-played film. I say that performances are sometimes weak; but for the most part acting is very good. The only actor who fired me was Jude Law like Harlen Maguire. It was incredible! Tom Hanks seemed certain in several places throughout the film, but he was incredible. Paul Newman, good as always. Cinematography This is what makes the film a masterpiece (and I rarely use this word). Conrad Hall is a real genius. If you stop at any time, you will see this man's finely crafted work. Sets each shot to avoid anything. When the camera is quiet, the character is on the screen like quality. When the camera moves, each frame is planned for undervalued perfection. But it does not stop there. Contrast of color choice and contrast between light and dark setting is a work of art. The way the set is shining is one of the most amazing lighting work I've ever seen. His work on this film did what it was. This movie is at the top of the list for best cinematography with LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge and Vertigo. Story People will say that this movie is the thirties of the gangster film, but I think they lacked the point of the film. It's a love story about a man who failed in an attempt to protect his son from the life he chose. It is a wonderfully crafted story that develops in a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but everyone else. The screening screen is worth the Oscar. Thomas Newman's music makes a sad but hopeful score to amplify this sad but hopeful story. Music is one of the most beautiful and most popular scores I have a herd. Director Sam Mendes is a new director with the feelings of an experienced director. The symbols he uses and the performance he gains from his actors are rare in today's film world. I'll watch another Sam Mendes movie. 10/10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies I've ever seen.
