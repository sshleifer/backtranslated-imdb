It's a bit long (2 hours, 20 minutes), but it has a lot of the famous Pearl Buck novel in it. In other words, plenty of space to cover. It was a soap opera sometimes, but it also had some visually dramatic moments, also covered by the attack of the grasshopper at the end of the film. It was stunning. Since this film is about 70 years old, the crew of special effects on this film has done a great job. Paul Muni and Luise Rainer were award-winning actors in their time, and they did not disappoint here, both providing powerful performances. The only problem is credibility, because all Asians play Caucasian and some of them like Walter Connolly just do not really look. I would like to see re-make this film with all-Asian actors, not from PC reasons, but simply make the story look and sound more credible.
