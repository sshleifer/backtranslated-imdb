Of all versions of Odyssey (or of any Greek mythological story), in my opinion, the best of them is everything. Almost true to the original story - with some minor variations and omissions, such as the absence of Scylly & Charybdis and the fact that Eumaeus Piggy recognizes Odysseus in disguise in his cottage - realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes contribute to making it a truly memorable masterpiece not a Hollywood sword and a B-flick sandal. Regardless of the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are entirely in Italian, if you are familiar with the story, you can still do the heads and ends of what's happening and what the actors say (assuming you have a good handy Odyssey text). At least I did, and so much that inspired me to study the Italian language to appreciate the film even more.
