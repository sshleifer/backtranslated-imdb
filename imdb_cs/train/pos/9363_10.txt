This movie was awesome, it's the kind of movie you're watching, and rather than looking at other movies from an actor you look at other film director / writer. Sandler did a good job working outside of her comfortable zone and always good Cheadle did a great job. This movie is great for an advanced intelligent audience. The game was fantastic and can only be overcome by writing and directing the film. This film focuses on real Americans, the past generation, no stereotypes, or racism only people who have come together and realized the real meaning of life. This film is about losing and balancing. Instead of choosing psychiatry, it defines it, not as someone who treats you magically, but rather through the necessity to speak your feelings to an impartial person you can rely on, it will not judge you, but it will rather guide your thoughts. This movie is amazing!
