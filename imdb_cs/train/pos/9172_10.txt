I studied Charlotte Bronte's novel in high school and left me with a stunning impression. Here was a beautiful novel about the struggle of a young woman to find love and admission in the dark times of Victorian England. This young woman was Jane Eyre, a poor and simple figure with a strong mind and her own will. Her story, which Bronte narrated through his own eyes, was sad and inspirational. <br /> <br /> As part of our study, we watched the adaptation of the 1983 story and threw me away. Ministries not only tried to stay in line with the original Bronte text and the essence of the story, but actors who portrayed characters were simply great. Zela Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's mistress, Rochester) capture the essence of their characters. I can not imagine anyone else in their roles. (Other performances of Rochester in other versions like the 2006 version lack the passion, energy and tenderness needed to portray Rochester accurately.I say that Timothy Dalton is at the top because he has all of these features in his portrait of Rochester.Clarke looks not just like Jane Eyre , but she rescues Jane's tranquil, but strong and passionate nature, and at the appropriate moments of the story she keeps her emotions like Jane's books, but allows her fire to go out in Jane's behavior that Clarke and Dalton portray along with their scenes, is also trustworthy and true to devotees Jana and Rochester's relationship.) Supporting actors are also perfectly suited to their roles, and the set fits in the Gothic form of the story. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this version of the classic Bronte story. If you have not read the book yet, you can watch this production as a true introduction to this beautiful story.
