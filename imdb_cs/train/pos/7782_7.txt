the photo was beautiful, but I had trouble understanding what was happening ... there was a lot of symbolism? ... 2 goldfish - Does it mean something in Thai culture? there is not much conspiracy, it does not happen much and just happens. no real start, no real means and no real end. rather unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> It was hard to get into the characters because you never felt you know them ... it was hard to find out which scenes are imaginary and that were real. This movement was messy and incoherent. I do not know what brother brothers are hoping to achieve. Perhaps if I were Thai, it would make sense ...
