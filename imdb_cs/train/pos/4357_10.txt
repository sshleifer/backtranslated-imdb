I saw a movie at the Nashville Film Festival. It was beautiful, from cinema to acting. It is a father and son story and how to appreciate it in a family crisis. Beautifully written with a dialogue that never goes fake, the film performs Paul Reiser and Peter Falco's acting performances, among other things in this excellent cast. The film starts with aging father (Peter Falk) trying to find out why his wife (Olympia Dukakis) has left him. Father presents himself, unannounced, at the threshold of his son and daughter. Father and son take off the next day to look at some property and end up with the classic path. They fish, play the pool, watch the baseball game, get drunk, fit into battle and dance with strange women. But more importantly, each of them faces unspoken tensions that can affect any family. It's a kind of movie that touches the heart and makes people appreciate those closest to them.
