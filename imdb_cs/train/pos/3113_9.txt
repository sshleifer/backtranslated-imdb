Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in his best role ever), the latest spy on the block, brings his search for identity to the end while he is also striving to end the latest CIA program "Blackbriar" to make super assassins like me. <br /> <br /> I was so psyched for this that I watched it as an ancestor yesterday and today. Identity was as brilliant as I recall, and superiority remains a weak (but still pleasant) link in the chain for the weakest plot, and in addition to the automobile pursuit pursuing this film, it lacks action and tension. <br /> <br /> Hoo boy, does the Ultimatum have the tension? Even if you know that Bourne escapes the authorities (and the boy makes these films alert to the police as awkward), it's still great watching how he does it. I think two guys with pistols and mopeds can create 10 times more strain than anything Transformers did in huge robots of $ 150 million. <br /> <br /> Calculate this to Paul Greengrass, who has this idiosyncratic style of documentary film shooting even though he shoots characters that are far from ordinary in places like the CIA headquarters where nobody would be allowed to use a cameraman within 10 miles I seem to be listening to my various complaints with the Superiority because the action in the Ultimatum is nothing but awe-inspiring, with various instruments used as a candlestick, a hardcover book (I will never come back to these things again) and an electric fan (Do not ask). Music also helped trigger a lot of tension, and it was hard for them not to accumulate. <br /> <br /> Playing well and the evolution of Julie Stiles' character, Nicky, puts her in a new, highly appealing light. Damon plays his signature role with a reserve, but the competence (which sounds negligible, but really looks like Matt Damon could avoid the CIA and Interpol, is something) but noticeable moments of behavior when he is still trying to find mankind. This desire for his real life could be boring and almost done in supremacy, but he works better in the Ultimatum (better screenplay). <br /> <br /> I recall the scene in "Goldeneye" (the only good film movie by Pierce Brosnan Bond), in which the character of Sean Bean asks James if Martini never silences the cries of all the men he has killed. Bourne regrets all the people he has killed and thinks (or at least thinks) about the meaning of action without purpose, life without meaning and how the government has changed people to resources. Although it is superzpy and is persecuted by the CIA, Interpol and the police, almost ANYWHERE he says Bourne never thought to do even the smallest attempts to mask his features or create new passports. Sunglasses maybe? <br /> <br /> If you have pulsating and loving action movies, than the Bourne Ultimatum is for you. Hell, it's probably the best action movie that came out this year. Of course, you'd be crazy to see it without first watching others. It's a little touch at the end, but I almost feel tempted to overlook it. This is the first "3" movie this summer to match at least, if not crossed, the original and says something. <br /> <br /> A-
