Fortunately, for our Real McCoy fans (probably all of the Baby Boomers who grew up in the late 1950s and 1960s), three adult actors / actresses appeared when they made a reunion show in 2000. Tony Martinez and Richard Crenna died shortly afterwards. How pleasant it was to see Luke, Sugar-Babe and Pepino again, was it so mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of Lydia Reed and Michael Winkleman? I know that in 1999, little Lukas died, but I'm not sure how. There is no information on Hassie on the Internet that I find. Very curious why they were not even mentioned? It was so remarkable that their absence from the reunion show that I suspect that the family of Michael and Lydy (if they are still alive) 1) asked to be omitted from the discussion and therefore their desire was given; or 2) TNN could not find any Traces of either Michael or Lydy (like the rest of us) seemed to have disappeared. Therefore, the safest rule would be to leave them together. <br /> <br /> It would be great to make a retrospective on Walter Brennen. There were no bones ... he was a grandfather who made such a success. I remember as a child when I imitate a grandparents' walk, and my parents laughed (as I'm sure they still gave a million children at that time). One unpleasant feeling that bothered me a bit was Richard Crenny's tendency to dominate the debate ... occasionally interrupting Tony and Kathleen to mention it. In fact, even though Tony Martinez seemed totally capable of contributing to the interview, he was not allowed to talk and say too much during the reunion show. Unhappy because I wanted to hear all three of them as well. Overall, the Reunion Show was really great. I watched it on DVD several times, and I always enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Dodgerdude
