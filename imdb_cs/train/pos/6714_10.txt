Why did I like the show in the last episode? Because of true talent, Melissa Joan Hart and her supporting actors should demonstrate that a tiny, comic, humorous and profound idea can actually exist. What I enjoyed most was the fact that I could come home from hard work and grab a smile ... I was inspired ... and why? She was inspired to watch because this magical person was so happy to help others. <br /> <br /> Sabrina was, in my opinion, a hero ... even though it was vulnerable in a way that was not so different from our ... to very different; had the power at the tip of the fingers, the wishes and the command that could be used for the good or for the bad, which can only exist in many of our ideas. Most of what we see, we know about our own, or even desire ... can be used as good or bad, and as we decide to define it, it defines the person we are. <br /> <br /> She traveled around the world and other areas with these constant and reluctant thoughts ... learning, living, laughing and loving. They always learn how to improve their skills for the benefit of all people around them; she made mistakes when she lived through life, she walked through different growth paths, as she, her aunt and Salem (underestimated, yet imperfect hero) proved well that despite the mistakes you can still be noble, gifted and wonderful. <br /> <br /> She also showed many selfless, learning and loving deeds when she was on her way. If there is no reason for the 10 stars in this war world, where people are so hostile to each other, they do not know how the differences are more of a life than a reason to kill ... then I do not know what it is. This show was surely a trip to a better world as well as inspiration to be better ourselves and we gave ourselves a gift to smile at our kettles ... I have heard from the doctor that everything I mentioned above leads to a healthy "hart" ... and is not that what we all need? :)
