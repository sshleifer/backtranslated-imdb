I usually do not like real estate shows, especially those who profit from the success of "American Idol". But with this I can live. Comedians from all over the world make a short routine for the talented boyfriends and if they like, these guys will be sent to perform a routine for a real audience. Then, ten or twelve comics are selected to co-exist in the house and conduct "Survivor" competition using comic tactics. Then it will be designated as "The Last Comic". I like to build a comedy, so this is one reality show that has to do with my interests. Typically, some comic book comics are selected. He began a career of such talent as Alonzo Bodden, Ralphie May and Josh Blue. My negative criticism is the fact that there is a possibility that many of these comics were chosen for their contribution to the reality of the show drama. Initially, they lived together in a house like "Big Brother," but now they've done it, thank God. And there's a lot of comics I felt were elected only because they did not. they are funny, but because of race, ethnicity, attitude, sex, etc. when it is necessary to reveal other comics. But overall, it's a well-executed reality show, two deadlines so far, I thought it was an oxymoron.
