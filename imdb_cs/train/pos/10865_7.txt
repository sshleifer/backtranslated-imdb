This movie is great fun if you love movies organized by criminals. Those looking for a film of a criminal who plays charismatic leadership and dreams of taking the wrong way can be somewhat disappointed with the film's retreat. It's a fun story through a criminal underworld, but if you're not familiar with Hong Kong movies, then this will be a pleasant surprise. I was somewhat disappointed with some of the choices made by the story, but overall a good crime film. Some things did not make sense, but it seems to be a norm with movies in the east. People just happen to do things no matter how their personalities were set before. It is a slightly annoying formula that penetrates even in this movie.
