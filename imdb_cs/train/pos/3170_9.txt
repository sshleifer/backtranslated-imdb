Writer / Director / Co-Star Adam Jones is heading for big things. That's the idea I had after seeing my feature film "Cross Eyed". Rarely, an independent film allows me to feel as good as his. Cleverly written and masterfully controlled, "Cross Eyed" keeps you from start to finish. Adam Jones may not be a well-known name, but he will. If this movie had one or two "named actors" it would be a box office feeling. I think he still has a chance to see the mainstream audience if only a film distributor spends time working on the film. No matter where it ends, if you can see, you will not be disappointed.
