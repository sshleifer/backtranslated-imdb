"Groove Tube" was one of Ken Shapiro's two films, the other being "Modern Problems". This is just a parody of the entire television. In addition to Shapiro, who apparently did nothing after "modern issues" - the film also stars Chevy Chase and cousin Henry Winkler Richard Belzer. Three cast members (plus some other people in smaller roles) appear in different sketches. One of the most entertaining is Chase in Geritol-spoofing, in which he describes this medicine as his wife, and ends up swinging him. There is also a pornographic news program, an irritating cooking show, and the epic story of some drug dealers. The whole thing is really hot. In my opinion, these are the three best TV spoofing films and "Tunnelvision" and "Kentucky Fried Movie" (although I can also include "The Truman Show"). Really funny. I wonder what happened to Ken Shapirom.
