I admit I did not like Oliver! like a little kid - it's long and the story is a bit slow - due to all the musical numbers. As a teenager I found that the fun of this film is the experience itself. Rather than think of it as an adaptation of Oliver Twist, think of it as a celebration of a classic story. Adaptation is at best released, but really, if you are looking at a musical instrument, you are not there for the story. <br /> <br /> Music is at the heart of this movie and the vast majority is stellar and very catchy. Most or all of the cast members took part in the stage version of the musical work and show it in their performances - and I think it is a plus. Performances are in a more "scenic" style of acting typical of much older movies and are very entertaining. The exception is the boy who plays Oliver whose work seemed to look cute and stay out of real artists. <br /> <br /> Fagin and Dodger are the real stars of this movie. Oliver Reed is also doing a fantastic job keeping an intimidating screen as a threatening Bill Sykes. Even Sykes's Bullseye dog gives good performance. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. People who hate musicians despise that, just like those who play musicals too seriously. Pouring over defective historical details or misinterpreted scenario acting for bad gambling eliminates one's enjoyment. Just sit back and enjoy yourself - it's much better when you remember that as a musical instrument the fantasy is loosely arranged around the book, not a strict adaptation.
