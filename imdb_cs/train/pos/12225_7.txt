I saw this movie, and even though I knew who was a killer from the beginning, I still watched him. I would recommend it to other people. She comes to lifetime quite a lot. And I think they can play more from the moment they are close to Halloween. So please be careful if you are interested in watching it. I believe that Alicia Silverstone played her part very well. I really like an actress and a person. It looks so nice and on the ground. Kevin Dillon was so for me. I'm not trying to get it, or anything else, but I think his brother Matt would be able to improve this bad serial killer. Kevin seems too kind to me. But I think he did it right.
