Every time you think you have a handle on Deathtrap, there is another plot. The best thing to do is sit down and enjoy your ride on this. Best known for his bisexual between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve (unfortunately, cut off from the television version I've seen), this film has a lot more to do than recommend it. Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is a very unhappy person. Once a successful playwright, his last few plays on Broadway have collapsed. And while his wife Myra (Dyan Cannon) is nothing but supportive, both in monetary and emotional terms, it does little to make Sidney feel better. To add insult to injury, young playwright Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) has just sent Sidney a game to look at. It's Anderson's first and Sidney sees the young man as a gifted writer. He kisses his wife to invite Anderson to kill him and present the game as his own. He laughs at first, but when Sidney actually invites Anderson to dinner, he is afraid he can actually put his plan into practice. And her fears may be justified ... <br /> <br /> It's a great script. Throughout the conspiracy there are reversals and turns, and the approach to the end is faster and more furious. It's the movie you have from the beginning at the edge of your seat and keeps you there all the time. The absolute masterpiece of tension and mystery. It works great. Caine gives his usual outstanding performance, and he shows talent for playing cultured, refined and intellectual men. Reeve also gives an excellent rendering of a man who is not as broad, neither vaccinated nor innocent as it seems. Cannon's fury works well for Myra. And Irene Worth gives a nice performance as a supporting neighbor, who is also psychic. This is a movie you never expected to end up with, and repeated observations will help pick up things past past views. An unforgettable classic, unfortunately just remembered on a scene that at that time caused some sensitivity - and that's really a shame.
