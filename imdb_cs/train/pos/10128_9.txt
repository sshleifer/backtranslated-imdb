Here is the first EVER episode of friends, where we come to Control Freak, Monica Gellar (Courtney Cox), the new divorced Ross Gellar (David Schimmer), Hippy Pheobe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), an unknown actor and a ladies man (Matt Le Blanc and very (Jennifer Aniston). <br /> <br /> The episode is better than most people think that, like each other, the new sitcom first episode is not always fantastic. The action in this episode is not great because the cast can not identify and arnt really believe in their new attitudes (except Kudrow and Perry, who shines). <br /> <br /> Matt Le Blanc-Man , his acting was quite terrible, because later he gets more confident, but I think he's trying to be funny, but he usually fails. David Schimmer - Why is he pronounced EVERY WORD? but he has become one of the most entertaining figures in later times, but he is not sure. and I can not sympathize with him Jennifer Aniston - Looks hot and does a good job like Rachel Green but we see real Rachel later in the first season, Courtney Cox - She looks quite anorexic, worrying, looks completely different (healthier) she's a little sketchy, but everyone is in this 20-minute pilot! Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry - I'm doing these two together because their comic timing and acting quality was excellent and for Lisa it was one of her first roles and is as natural as Pheobe (Pheebs) and Matthew Perry is just Matthew Perry playing basically ! Episode quality will improve later, such as Sets, in this episode they look dark and spooky, and they seem to be hostile to the fact that the acting is OK, the characters gain certainty with each new scene and I'm proud to be a pilot! I hope we'll see friends come together! because they will always be for us!
