I was trapped for a while, focusing on watching independent and foreign films, and liking it. Fatty Drives bus is an exception. It is true. It's the best "bad" movie ever. <br /> <br /> "The badness" of this movie seems natural. At the beginning of Satan's monologue, the word "hell" appears at the bottom of the screen. The charming Bridget is a neo-sizable man in a wig and friendly shops. It's an eccentric couple who is still trying to kill FOREVER each other to go up the stairs. Jesus goes to a functional soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Fatty gives the impression that someone has lost his role as a consultant to a senior film project. But it is the sincerity of how bad it is that it is so beautiful. You get the impression that the producers knew it would be bad, but never forced it. He is never surprised to add Fatty. Highly recommended.
