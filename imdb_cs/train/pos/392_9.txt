Legend of Zu, as I saw it, was a very interesting story. I think many of those who did not like did not see the basic mythology behind the film. They expected something similar to Star Wars, and it was not. Joseph Campbell, in my opinion, would love this movie. There were a number of metaphors and hidden meanings that the average viewer could overlook. We all have a sword hill inside us. We all have to go to our own cave of blood sometime in our lives. We all have to face our insomnia. I made some narratives a bit confused, and some of the events sometimes got into hockey, but I think other movie points have been easy to solve. I looked at it again. <br /> <br /> I do not know if there is a difference between the legend Zu (I saw in Mandarin with English subtitles) and Zu Warriors (called the American version). an audience that would really get lost from this movie.
