That's why I'm proud of being an Englishman. This is by far the most fun thing on TV. The league consists of Jeremy's Dyson, Steve Pemberton, a well-known guy and a beautiful Rees loop. A completely underestimated horror comedy is perfection. Characters are symbolic and bizarre phrases, "Hello Dave". It's a comedy that everyone just needs to watch. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the League of Lords is that it's always fresh and always pushing the boundaries. He does not have to rely on catchy phrases (unlike small Britain) to make it fun. the fact that the League is willing to kill probably its most famous and iconic characters shows us that they have steel balls.
