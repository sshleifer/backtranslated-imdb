Anyone who has never seen anything like the battle scenes in The Matrix has never seen this movie. The battle scenes were choreographed by the action scene of the psychopath Yuen Woo Ping, who also fought in the Matrix. And battle scenes are something. Li plays a supersoldier who does not feel any pain that now lives as a pacifist librarian (you have me). When other evil enthusiasts start killing local drug gentlemen to take over the drug trade, Li is going to meet his cop with his policeman to help stop them. This movie is going on some absolutely crazy things badguy has his hand cut off a glass sheet and hardly notices). Combat scenes are full of flying kicks and strikes; counting the body is up there. Li is seldom better and surrounded by a beautiful female costume (Yip kicks up some serious ass like a supersoldier). Anthony Wong even makes a portrait as a drug of the Lord (not there, he is, he is in every HK movie). It's unfortunate that he does not make such action movies in the US; I would not have to sit down with all these terrible dubbing tasks to see what I'm doing as much as I want. Recommended.
