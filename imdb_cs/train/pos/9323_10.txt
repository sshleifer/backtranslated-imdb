For me, this movie was strong. I do not want to be a spoiler, but a few years ago I had a friend; we were like brothers. This film has brought some vivid memories. For some reason, I could not vote for this movie, which would be 10. I still got the message like "No votes were placed ..." And yet I saw in the statistics that they exist. It will try again tomorrow (Monday). <br /> <br /> Tiny mistakes I've overlooked. It was the relationship between the characters I got. Beautifully solved and real situation. I was a couple of them. <br /> <br /> A small jewel of the film. Just like "Spring Forward" is another overlooked gem. I am very glad that films such as these are still being done; about human relations, well written, sensitively developed with first-class behavior and direction. After all, is not it about what?
