In spite of all the efforts of Disney, it is rather a pleasant film about watching your dreams. I was surprised that he did not consider me too sentimental; this movie was fair. Dennis Quaid was very, very good in a role that says something for a sports movie. I can not remember how many sports films had the few peculiarities that bothered me; here they all look. This movie is surprisingly good and I predict it will be a surprising business because it's a movie G that does not require the viewer to stop thinking. On the contrary, Ebert, this film is a success.
