It is amazing that actress P. J. Soles did not become a big star after playing Riffa Randall, a fan of punk rock band Ramones, at Rock 'n' Roll High School. The sock is so lush, you do not mind being too old to be in high school (this is offset by all the kids looking 24). The film is a fast drummer who does not match; everything is finally stretched at the end, and that's how it should be. Mary Woronov, an inundantly yelling and humorous presence as a Nazi-like chief, gets a great, unique bit where Frisbee is flying dangerously close to her head (how many shots she used or was it a jerk?) And Dey Young is very fond of Soles' best, Kate Rambeau. The weakest article, ironically enough, in this "high school" chain is Ramones. They can not act, they are not fun and their concert segment takes too long. One song by Ramones, "I Want You Around", is considered fantasy and is well captured; other random songs are good, especially the rare Paul McCartney ballad she heard at the beginning ("Have we ever met?"). Great fun! *** z ****
