Eddie Murphy is one of the funniest comics at all - probably the most entertaining. Delirious is the best comedy I've ever seen, and it's a must for anyone who loves good laughter! I watch this movie a hundred times and every time I see it - I still have barriers on the side. This is definitely one for your video library. I guarantee you will have to watch several times to hear all the jokes because you laugh so much - that you will miss half! Delirious is cheerful! <br /> <br /> Although there are a lot of fun comedians - after watching this standing comedy, most of them will look like second-class citizens. If you've never seen it - get it, look at it - and you'll love it! That will make you holler! :-)
