Nobody better do the job! Amazing film! Experimentally written as Ira Levin and carved with Christopher Reeve's best performing career and one of the best in Caine, it's just great. I wish I could catch a scene somewhere ... maybe one day I will. I hope this grossly underestimated overlooked movie is not too difficult to find because it's "necessary" for all Hitchcockian, Agatha-phile, or a great movie lover. One of the very few films that I could not immediately solve or anticipate and second or even third look is worth it, "Deathtrap" gets 9/10 and earns each of them. We need and deserve other such films!
