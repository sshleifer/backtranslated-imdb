I believe they say the truth all the time ... I can not believe anything in the wild ... The family has passed through hell. Those poor boys who are too young to understand what's going on around them. But they still had to deal with the rumors. Just like dealing with the loss of their little sister. I can not believe that this case has continued for so long. Looks like the jury does not see the truth, even if she bites her ass. I feel behind this family, and if I could let them know I hate what they were, I would. I have no idea what they passed, I can not imagine it. After watching this movie I was in tears and I had to look at my little girl in bed ... I think everyone should watch this.
