Michael Jackson is not very popular in the US, but there are still many fans in Europe (especially in Germany). Many people will say it's a bad movie and it's: it has no plot, it's full of clich√©, Michael is constantly praising. But you do not know in this movie! It has fun visual effects and music is perfect. Smooth Criminal Fragment - the biggest song, full of Moonwalks, group dance acts and even the famous "Michael Jackson's Bench-over" - makes this film one of Jackson's masterpieces with even a handsome (and white ...) Michael Jackson! It must be a fan of dance events for Jackson fans, a must for fans of music. However, since I'm a fan of MJ, I should warn everyone that Jackson hates outdoors: DO NOT KNOW THIS film, you should just raise your hatred ...
