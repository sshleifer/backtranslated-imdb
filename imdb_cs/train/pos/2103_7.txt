I do not know "Largo Winch" as a comic book (or is it a graphic novel? Actually, I do not know), but I have to admit that when I heard the movie agent / hero, I expected something completely different from what I actually got. <br /> <br /> Although it was amazing to watch it at the beginning, it was nice to follow this step along. You could never really tell where it is going (some predictions are predictable, but in general you can never tell if it's over). More than stellar performance by the acting actor and really good support, it makes him a pleasant watch. Not as packed action as anyone could hope for or expect for such a film but a really good mix.
