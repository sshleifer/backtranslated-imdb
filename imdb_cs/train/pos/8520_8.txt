I thought the movie was really good. I enjoyed acting and moved well. The director seemed to understand the story he was trying to say. I have to see the big budget that comes out today, of course, they had a lot more money than to throw it, but it was very attentive. When you see such a movie for a small budget, you have to take it to your account when you charge it. There were some things that could have been better, but most of them related to the budget. The game was pretty good, F / X and stuntmen were well done. Several shots were the guy who played the camera. and the boy who played the baby. These films kept LA at work and this proved to be OK.
