The film starts like a less hyperkinetic, more trap dead or alive: strange activities are done strangely, while the bodies appear policemen. But when a policeman is killed, one Tatsuhito is involved ... and when he finds out that his brother Shihito is also involved, things get bloody quite quickly. Miike's earlier work, the Shinjuku Triad Society is still full of its usual in ol 'ultraviolence and sadistic sexual acts, though it is not one of its more eclectic or spectacular pieces. Rather, it's a pretty well crafted piece of pulp because Tatsuhito goes through the underground, a maze that leads him to a homosexual triad leader who sells illegally acquired body organs from Taiwan, and keeps almost a mess of young boys, especially a character who kills a policeman in the beginning) . Tatsuhito's brother begins to engage with this company, and Tatsuhito is forced to become a dirty policeman and a similarly violent and sadistic tactic to penetrate this sordid sphere. What is particularly interesting about this small piece of work is the relationship Tatsuhito with his nemesis Wang. Tatsuhito is a Japanese who was born in China, later returned to Japan and was estranged. Wang is a Chinese who felt alienated in China, killing his father and developing a criminal wing in Japan. Wang is also surprisingly a Shakespearean figure that is pretty weird and is far less than you would actually begin to justify it at the time of his final settlement with Tatsuhito. And Tatsuhito himself is likewise a tragic figure when he is forced to struggle with a lack of ability to control his brother. While it would be harsh to say that Miike's films are successful mostly at their shock value, it is true that sometimes it's easy to lose track of how well Miike can create hot, uncomfortable characters. <br /> <br /> - -PolarisDiB
