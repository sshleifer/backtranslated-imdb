I have seen almost all of Miyazaki's films and they are all beautiful and captivating. But this one rises above the others. This movie made me totally amazed! <br /> <br /> I fell in love with Paz and Sheet and their sweet, caring friendship. It was the film that made the film for me. Of course, animation is also excellent and music captures feelings in the movie perfectly. But characters are a radiant point in this movie: they are so developed and full of personalities. Now let me clarify: I am really talking about the Japanese version of the film (with English subtitles). While the English dab is good (mostly) it simply gets rid of it compared to the original language version. Voices are better, dialogue, everything. So I recommend seeing (and hearing) the movie as it was originally.
