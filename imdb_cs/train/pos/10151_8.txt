Beautiful postcard from New York. The thing I enjoyed the most was to be able to watch it with my whole family and I did not have to wait until a stupid joke appeared. It has never been. My teenagers also liked it. My son for Natasha Henstridge and my daughter for Michael Vartan. My wife and I realized we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and enjoy everything. This film narrated a story that felt comfortable, but not old or finished. The end appeared with a twist that we all liked. If you are not just a cynical person and you are willing to let the story unfold, then it is for you. Like a guy, it takes a lot to be interested in romantic movies and this one. I recommend it and we need more films.
