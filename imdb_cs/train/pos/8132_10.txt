I do not remember when I first heard about this movie, but I rented it six years ago and still remains one of my favorite comedies. I admit that you probably despise this movie if you do not know anything about rap music. But if you are a fan of rap, even informal, you will love inner jokes and links. One of the best lines in the movie is about the difference between b **** and h **; I still use this line and make a lot of laughter with it. One of the best performances comes from Larry Scott, who did not play Lamar in "Revenge of the Nerds". It's unfortunate that this movie will probably never have a DVD release.
