In this movie, we have a wonderful opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumba in the movie when they are not shown - which is a lot! This movie even returns before Simba and (probably) just after Kiary's birth. <br /> <br /> Quite true to the first movie "Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 in Other Places)" is a fun, fun, exciting and surprising film (or a sequel if that's what you want to call ). Although Timon and Pumbaa are watching the movie in the theater (with remote control), Timon and Pumbaa have an argument about what point "The Lion King" is going to follow because Timon wants to go to that part when he arrives with Pumbaa and Pumbaa wants to go back . They have a very fair compromise watching the film of their own story, which is what's waiting ... It starts with Timon's first house ... <br /> <br /> For everyone who has a good sense of humor who liked his first movies almost any age, enjoy "Lion King 1/2"! :-)
