Mel Torme and Victor Borge, in his younger age, make this film interesting - and especially when he saw the young Sinatra on the sunny side of the thirties, and he definitely said it was his "yes, I'm a popular singer but hardly actor ". Michele Morgan is an unpleasant, unpleasant presence, and Jack Haley is an actor whose appeal has always been totally lost to me. Leon Erroll is stupid, as always, but overall quite funny. 7 star stars 10 is probably the right "grade," because the combination of its positive aspects and the lack of storyline and stupidity in that and the above-mentioned harassment is generally at best. Most of the fascination is from viewing three entertainment icons in their early years.
