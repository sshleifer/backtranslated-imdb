This movie happened to happen when I mentioned all the films I wanted my sister to record when I was on holiday and I'm so glad to have included it. These are the problems that most directors avoid, my only problem with this movie is that it was made for television so I could not buy a copy for my friend! It's a moving story about how people with eating disorders do not necessarily have to avoid everyone and how much they really have dietary friends. I point out that although bulimia can maintain a fairly stable weight, it has more serious consequences for their health, which many people do not know.
