A smart, undoubtedly entertaining romp starring with Peter Ustinov as a career embarrassment with his view of the American conglomerate in London. He is subconscious foxes (and deceptively sharp) Maggie Smith and threatened to expose the jealous company of Bob Bob Newhart. This is a heist movie with many brains. Ustinov is exceptional, just like Smith and Newhart are quite fun. The real surprise is Karl Malden, when the pill looks like "Executive Vice President". Malden was rarely so free. Cesar Romero and Robert Morley appeared in several entertainment cameras. Outstanding music score is Laurie Johnson. Director Eric Till is sharply, and the Ustinov and Ira Wallach scenario is first class and very clever. Swing good time!
