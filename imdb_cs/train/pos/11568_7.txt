One of the many Merrie melodies caricatures that entertained American audiences during the Second World War, Bob Clampett's "An Itch in Time" portrays a hobo flea spotted by Elmer Fudd's dog. The little boy turns into a real sadist when he makes a dog home on his back, but Elmer warns the dog: "One more spank and I'll give you a bath!" Meanwhile bleach sets the dynamite to a dog! * And it's not over! I noticed that Elmer reads in one scene a comic book with Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig. Obviously, Elmer and Bugs have often played together, but Elmer has never played alongside Porky (unless you count the very short "Any Bonds Today?"). For me, however, the idea that Elmer reads these other famous figures of the same genre emphasizes the metaphysical nature of his world as if he knew of their existence within his universe, even though he is not in this cartoon. > <br /> Of course I probably went too far in my analysis. I'm sure the cartoon is meant to be pure fun and definitely enjoy it. As to the line, "I may have liked it," it sounded as if it were something that did not censor, but somehow escaped; I, for one, actually do not know what it should sound like. Was it something sexual? As for the end, I thought I had seen everything, I would be tempted to look for more than what a cat did (though it was a clean trick). <br /> <br /> * The guys behind these cartoons were surely TNT, right?
