This stupid film is really fun for the young audience. Her heroes are two detectives whose sophomoric attitudes lead them on very silly roads. Chasing a major murder case, you will see that these detectives are going every day to solve the crime. No nudity, but lots of sexual consequences, stupidity of stupidity ... all teens. Low budgets, but very fun. Classical potential of culture.
