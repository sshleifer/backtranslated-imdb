Zero Day is a movie that few people have learned and what a pity. When I saw the end of the two main characters descending into the room and killing people sadly, they commit suicide, and it took my stomach. I was pulling, it's so strong the movie. The movie is amazing. It's too unbelievable to get the perfect ten. It is sad that so few people will understand the true beauty of this film. It's not the budget that makes the film good, it's a lot of the feelings of the creators who put it in, which is good. <br /> <br /> It leaves a constant impression in your mind that you just can not get out. You realize that I really do the horror of shooting - especially if you want to know the man, and this movie feels like you know these people. I recommend Zero Hour to those who feel they are mature enough to look at them. I have fourteen and I feel that this movie is just too awesome to put words. You feel that you are looking at something that has actually happened.
