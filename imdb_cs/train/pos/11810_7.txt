I still liked it. Warren Beatty is as fair as the hero of a comic book. What saves this movie is a set, incredible cast, and deviates the average script. I really waited for something more relevant in terms of dealing or plotting, but I have little. The main reason for watching this movie is to watch some of Hollywood's greatest stars at that time in such an unusual film. <br /> <br /> The only person who did a terrible job and was not in this movie was Madonna. She did not belong to this film and her acting work was pretty bad. The film just stood at some points. You expected something more and you had nothing. Al Pacino plays a really bad guy and is pretty good. He and Beatty are doing a good guy and a bad guy. <br /> <br /> Interesting are also Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty in a film other than Isthara. I did not see Ishtar, but I heard bad things. The thing about this movie is good, but it could have been much better. I liked it as a child because I thought it looked great, and visually, it's amazing, the sets are incredible, writing is fair, and I'd expect a bit better with such a cast. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> I think the final was not big enough. It was interesting, but for such a spectacular film I just thought it might end up a bit more. The reason for watching this movie is the atmosphere. The film uses only 7 colors of comic books, making them even more visually outstanding. <br /> <br /> Costumes and make-up were also flawless. Makeup for the villains was great. Beatty is simply not as strong as life. Still, it's a good movie that could have been a lot more. It's better for me than Batman, another comic adaptation that came out just about the same time. Of course, the movie was much bigger in terms of gross.
