I like this movie, because it's a great cinema work, made by people who have taken care of it so they can do it, not just home movies. It is filled with home movies by Super-surfer Greg Nollo and an amateur video boat from others who adapt to their 50 years of passion. Yet it has spread to the extent that aesthetic glamor is approaching. It is full of artistic talent and athletic talent, although you would think surfing is athletic. Surfers are neither astronauts nor experienced pilots. They are not surgeons (perhaps) or PhD's (maybe, maybe). They believe in looking for a surfer. He believes in the beauty of the human beast. He believes in the great gift of peace that comes from the end of the war. Surfers celebrate the end of the war on the north beach of the Hawaiian island, attacked by Japanese zeros fifteen years ago. It celebrates the break of the country that fought for the Cold War - instead of the hot war - with the Russian Socialists. Surfing is ultimate narcissism. It's dangerous, but little historical. I suspect that Alexander the Great will not be celebrated by his surfing technique. He had to go out and conquer dozens of countries to get the favorable press he received. This film has no military heroines. He has no weapons. The only surfers on the beach have a surfing shop in the cellar. It is not a problem. Peace is not desperate. It's a joy of exhalation.
