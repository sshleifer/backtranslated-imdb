My comment would be added to RELEASE DATE, but I could not find a place for him. I was really surprised to see that this film was released in the US in February 1955. I saw it at the "first run" theater in Washington, DC in March 1958. I wonder if it was re-released or a problem? In my opinion, this film is a very light entertainment, but it has some classic characters. John McIntyre does a bang-up job as a corrupt judge / entrepreneur / thief. Walter Brennan is essentially doing the same role he did in Red River a year ago. And, in my opinion, James Stewart gives such great performance he has ever done. I've seen this movie half a dozen or more and I never had to see its parts again. Pictures and sceneries are wonderful and offer a remarkable amount of entertainment per hour and thirty-six minutes.
