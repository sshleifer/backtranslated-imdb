A fabulous movie that you can watch with amazing scenes and talented actors such as Misa Shimizu and Nagiko Tono. After 15 minutes of watching, your eyes lock on the screen and you do not do anything, but you breathe in the atmosphere of the movie and expect what fate will bring to these characters. This movie leaves you your standard audience, takes you, makes you part of the story ... Costumes and settings are great; especially okiyas is gifted. It's definitely not too much Akira Kurosawa, but it's still very good for the master, especially the stylish narrative story tells us that we are in an extraordinary country cinema that is far from the Hollywood flamboyance.
