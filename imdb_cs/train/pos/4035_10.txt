In a word ... awesome. At first, I was not very happy to watch Pinjar, because I thought it would be another film that was upset over us and the prejudice against India and Pakistan. I was so wrong. Pinjar is a hearty, emotional and intelligent film with no apparent flaws. After what I was looking at, I was interested. It took me so long; themes, pain, loss, emotion - everything was so real. This is really a masterpiece that we rarely see in Bollywood today in Bollywood. He has no prejudices and prejudices, and has given a division of the human story. Here no country is displayed as good or bad. There are evil Indians, bad Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistani. Cinematography is excellent and the music is melodic, meaningful (thanks to Gulzar sahib) and spooky. Everything about the movie was amazing ... and acting just took my breath. Everything was perfectly occupied. If you are interested in watching an intellectual and truly wonderful movie ... look no further. This film gives everything. I recommend it with all my heart. Amazing can not describe how excellent it is.
