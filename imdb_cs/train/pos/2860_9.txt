It was between 1959 and 1973. It's more than his longevity, which says a lot about this series. His also survived the changes in fashion and taste since the 1950s, the psychedelic 60th and remained popular in the 70s. I remember repeating this series. It was a successful combination of all of its elements from stories, casts and productions that made it extraordinary. Lorne Green had his defining iconic character from this series. Her challenge has been for generations. All family members could enjoy it. She equaled morality with violence, humor with seriousness. The cardboard series was created as a reflection of it as a result of its impact. The bad thing is that this series is no longer repeated and many of them will not know what it means.
