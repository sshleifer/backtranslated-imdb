well "Wayne's world" is long gone, and for years it has been difficult for snl off-shoot movies. from such film cribs as "It's Pat" to the recent 80-minute yawning "Night at Roxbury," many of them undoubtedly lost the belief that some other snowmobiles will ever make a successful transition to the silver screen. you're afraid because Tim Meadows is going through the spades. a well-written plot maintains interest in the audience until the very end and while it remains the true character of Leon Phelps introduced in five minutes of skit, the story allows awareness of development. humor (consisting mostly of jokes about sex) is fresh and interesting and made me laugh harder than I have in a movie in recent memory. it's just a great time if you do not feel like taking too seriously. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen of fame "Saved by the Bell" appears in the movie and looks incredible. eventually Billy Dee Williams, who revives his Colt for 45 days, gives the movie a touch of class. and for those who are powerless movie blossoms like me, you will find this movie that is extremely sensitive, "ooh, that's a lady!"
