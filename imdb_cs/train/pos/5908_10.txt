This is one of the best movies I've seen recently. It transcends any international film of any reputation. I am really surprised why he did not get the recognition he deserves. Sonali Kulkarni, who won the national prize, may be the only one. Renuka Daftardar just amazes when he's talking over his eyes. There are several scenes that stand out: When Gauri returns from the city to the Krishna wedding, she and Krishna meet for the first time for many years. Krsna records the change in Gauri, but not a single line of dialogue. Many emotions are transmitted by gentle manners and eyes. There is another end when Kṛṣṇa calls Abhay Kulkarni to take Gauri instead. If you do not move this scene, you do not have a heart. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie to get the perfect brilliance and the ability to play movies.
