Extremely tense thriller in city chaos São Paulo, the largest and deadliest third world nightmare in the Brazilian city. To make it easier for anyone who is curious about this interesting and really well-shot film, the sand of the Mexican song "Amores Perros" with a character not too far from Max Cady of both Cape Fears, although it is not a film about a psychopath . Two partners (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca) in the construction company paid the Anisio (Miklos) guardian in this building outfit to launch their third partner (and majority shareholder). The murder is blamed on the city, but things really start to look terrible when the witty and charismatic nightmare Anisio decides he wants to be around the increasingly nervous partners in crime, not just unjustifiably, but more importantly, deconstruct the strict social codes that is a Brazilian society. Anisio turns poverty into an attitude and wants to join. The view is almost exclusively a hand-held, grainy, extraordinary performance, especially as the first actor (and a member of the classical Brazilian pop band Titos), Paulo Miklos, glare and deflector of the viewer with his fairly humorous social terror. I saw the film on the Brasília Fest in November 2001. Since then, Sundance and Berlin have been very successful. Kleber Mendonça Filho
