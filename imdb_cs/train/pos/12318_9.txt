Although I'm not the biggest fan of wire-based martial arts-based movies, when the film is more fantasy than fighting, I'm making it much more fun, and this movie is one of the best fantastic drawings and crazy flying shenanigans. Ching Siu Tung has created a charming entertainment with gentle power and a very ethereal beauty. The spectacular, tragic Leslie Cheung plays a collecting tax hero who stays a night in a haunted temple and engulfs an amazing, pale, spiritual and frantic Taoist. Cheung's performance is filled with a naive but dignified spell, and Wu Ma is a pleasant wall like a Taoist monk who performs a sword and even gets a musical number. Perhaps best, Joey Wang is like a fox spirit, really pleased when I look at every movement and gesture with a delightful seduction. The film captures the elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, which are projected into a constantly fun package. Ching Siu Tung, directing and manipulating choreography, gives pure exciting excitement and fills the film of fog, shadows and exciting fascinating forest colors, giving each forest a splendidly charming atmosphere. Also noteworthy are the elaborate hairstyles and the gorgeous flowing clothes of female characters, and when I'm not mistaken, Joey Wang's sporty hair, which sometimes goes like fox ears, has a wonderful touch. Although the film has relatively few events and sometimes poorly recommended pop songs at times, it is a great fun, with exciting characters and rendering, even a special pure arc character, an almost constant offer of visual delicacies and a rich, dreamy atmosphere. A highly recommended etheric treasure.
