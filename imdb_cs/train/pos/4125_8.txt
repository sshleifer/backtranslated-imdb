I loved watching sea hunting back in the day, I was in gymnasiums and at home I would have done my homework and by 4:30 am she was ready to watch Sea Hunt and Mike Nelson in his undersea adventures. I loved it! He took a place that was not available at that time, under the great blue sea. For "Thunderball," or before Cousteau became common, Mike Nelson was an imaginative child. I would like to bet that more than a couple of children have developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the sciences to watch this show. Underwater photography has also progressed, the fascination for exploration is easily stimulated by watching this show. Watch and enjoy !!!
