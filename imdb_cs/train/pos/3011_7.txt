One of the better movies, Vance, is more successful on an interesting plot and art direction than anyone else like Michael Curtiz. This time, a generally hated financier is found dead - shot dead in his head - in his closed and screwed upstairs bedroom. Philo Vance, when going to Italy, decides to end his vacation and try to solve what he thinks is murder and what others are considering suicide. William Powell is just as convenient as Philo Vance, as you can find. She never seems to be pushing and is always very smooth in what she says and does. Powell is helped by a number of talented actors - some acting acting actors and actresses like Mary Astor as a niece who hated her uncle, Ralph Morgan as secretary of a dead man, Paul Cavanaugh as a competing dog, Arthur Hohl a mysterious butler, Helen Vinson as a minor girl, two really good performances of James Lee as a Chinese chef and a portrait of Eugen Palette as a wise police detective. Add a wonderful comedy from Etienne Girardot as a public coroner who is still missing his meal. It's this depth of suspicion and a story that has many drawings of twists and turns that make Kennel Case Murder a quick and fun secret.
