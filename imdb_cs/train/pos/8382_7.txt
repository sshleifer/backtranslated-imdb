If you like mech war games it's pretty good. Some of them are cheap, but robot fighting is worth seeing. I've enjoyed a little military field and it's probably the only movie I've ever seen that comes close to what it feels like if you pilot one of those huge mosses. If you love the family, then the games you like are Mech Warrior Three and Four and if you have an Xbox and $ 350 for a spare steel battalion. The film is worth seeing at least once. More films must really be on the same topic. Less remake and original works. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
