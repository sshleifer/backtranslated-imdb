Henry Hathaway was courageous, equally enthusiastic about his love for people from the beginnings of the history of the United States. However, criticism of the historical inaccuracies of his film about Brigham Young and Mormon Humans is not necessary or helpful in commenting on this film. In my view, Hathaway did a great direction expressing what the Mormon people were in the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the period since the beginning of the martyrdom of Joseph Smith at the time of the film's release. In his gentle filming and dialogue diary, Mormon's philosophies and teachings covered many segments and scenes. I remember watching this movie on many Saturday wounds during my youth in the early 1950s. It was only 10 years after the release of the movies and before the Los Angeles Temple that I watched when I was built and inspired another curious wonder about who are the Mormons. I recently bought this movie and will look forward to the following news that Hathaway has interpreted in her film. Love to all people, regardless of their personal convictions, 2. Love to those who need it or not, 3. Family is of great importance, 4. Listen with respect and care, because even contradictory messages have important points to be considered and accept; Work hard, both individually and in the community 6. Prepare and keep for future days needed 7. Hope is a bondage to the higher being and to our everyday life 8. And that, and to appreciate those who are considered to be beneficial.
