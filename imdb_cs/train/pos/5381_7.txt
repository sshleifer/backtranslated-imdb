For a low budget movie, it was really good. I got it a lot over the average B-movie action. Sean and Corinne added in this movie, and they did not seem to be scared. Watch out for the portraits of Jeanne and Jared. I did not think the producers were even thinking, but the second place deserves it. <br /> <br /> I'm going to look forward to Sean and Corinn's greater involvement in the film industry. Sean's character looked very original and the sexy Corinne's character was quite dirty and in place. She got in touch with the action sequences and she did it with confidence. It was a great idea to make Billy Zane a clever and witty villain. His charisma on the screen is always a pleasure to watch. The chemistry between Zan and Sean was pretty good. The action sequences were not cheesy and seemed to be linked throughout the film. Of course there were mistakes, but it comes with territory. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a good movie in terms of budget and the fact that it was made for television. Sean and Corinne have done a good job because they think they are new to the game. I hope Jeanne, Jared and other Next Action Star players will get a chance to join their star companies as well. "
