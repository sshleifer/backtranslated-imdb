I saw the movie on TV when he went out and never saw her. For my life, I did not remember the title and I only met him in the film credits of Roy Thinne. Excellent, dark and haunted TV horror in the same class as "Crowhaven Farm"; "Do not be afraid of the darkness"; and "Satan's School for Girls," all lost Satanic classics. I also think he has a lot of parallel with the classical Clint Eastwood "High Plains Drifter". Why not make these great movies, especially when you're thinking about all the newer garbage that's filling Wal-Mart DVD Discs? Most of these films have a culture, so sales should not be a problem.
