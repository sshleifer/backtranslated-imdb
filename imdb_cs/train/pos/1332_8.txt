In 1594 in Brazil, the Tupinambas Indians are friends of Frenches and their enemies are Tupiniquins, friends of the Portuguese. The Frenchman (Arduino Colassanti) is captured by Tupinambás and despite his attempt to persuade them that he is a Frenchman, he believes he is Portuguese. The French became their slave and vainly living with Sebopep (Ana Maria Magalhães). Later, he used the powder in the channels the Portuguese left behind to defeat Tupiniquins in the battle. To celebrate victory, Indians choose to eat. <br /> <br /> "Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês" is another great low-budget film by Brazilian director Nélson Pereira dos Santos. The script is very original and Tupi tells the story. The film is mostly shot with natural light and is very realistic. Actors and actresses play naked and Ana Maria Magalhães is magnificent, showing a beautiful body and giving amazing performance. The sound is produced by Brazilian musician Zé Rodrix. This film shows the beginning of the exploitation of my country by the Europeans, focused at that time on Portuguese and French, traded with Indians and exchanged combs and mirrors with our natural resources. The film was awarded at national festivals, such as the Brazilian Brazilian Brazil Film Festival (1971), Best Screenplay (Nelson Pereira dos Santos), Best Dialogue (Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Humberto Mauro) and Best Cenography (Régis Monteiro); São Paulo (Associação Paulista dos Críticos de Arte) with the Best Revelation of the Year (Ana Maria Magalhães) and other prizes. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês" ("How tasty my Frenchman was)"
