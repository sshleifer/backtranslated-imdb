I like it because of my recent personal experience. Especially the thoughts that everyone is free and that everything is final. The characters in the company really did not enjoy their "real" lives, but they enjoyed themselves, that is what they were. The film did a good job, thanks to which this simple day remembers. A good memory involves not only the romantic feelings of a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but of course a deeper discussion of their values ​​of life. Many movies are like this when it comes to discussing the definitions of life or love or relationships or current issues in life or about any kind. Before sunrise, he treated himself nicely, which prevents the spectator from thinking and thinking and adjusting his breath and continuing to watch the film. Do not try to put a special idea in your head before sunrise. It just encouraged you to think about some of the problems in your everyday life and give you some alternative options. This caused interviews between characters to be interesting, not just typical complaints or foolish thoughts. You would still think about these issues for yourself and curiosity about the next line of the story. The ending was not quite important. You could skip something and feel something good or positive after the movie. Movies should be enjoyable. It's a nice movie and it's worth watching. I'm also on my way. The film somehow represented some of my part and answered some of my questions.
