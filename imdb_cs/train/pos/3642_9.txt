I first saw this movie 3 years ago and was introduced to the then Disney Eisner and Jim Morris. He returned back to television about a month ago, and this time I shot him. Since then, I've had to watch her at least three times. It's a wonderful, inspirational, good film that is intelligently written and believed to be true by anyone who cares about it. He refuses to go to every sentimental trick in the book, just like any other clich√©. <br /> <br /> It is refreshing to see a movie where children are not poisoned and have a variety of behavioral problems, and jocks are not portrayed as testosterone-driven muscleheads. They are just normal people who have dreams like you and me. In my opinion, Hollywood as a far-off other extreme to what they call "harsh realism," to make movies where everybody curses and has problems with aggression. This movie is about a man who has a dream and is encouraged by friends and family to strive for this dream. The people in the big TX lake seem so good luck that I want to move there. <br /> <br /> As I said b4, the film does not try to overcome sentimentality. Dennis Quaid, as usual, never fails. I have been watching it since the end of the seventies and are underestimated. But this movie has excellent performances from all those involved, and kudos writers. <br /> <br /> And the gem in the movie is coming to an end when Jim is practicing in the dugout before the big game, and his wife calls him out of the stands. He collapses and gets to his family. Appearance on the faces of the three other jugs sitting on a bench in a dugout is invaluable. If you are looking for a change in pace, select this movie upwards.
