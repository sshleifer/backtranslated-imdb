SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I just watched the extended version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I liked the extended version, I wish they left the original version on DVD. Portabello Road could be truncated to its original length. It was too long and stretched the movie. Although the dance is great, it would be much better left on the DVD as the Eraser scene. Overall, it's a great movie. I liked my 5-year-old. And it is amazing that the movies I enjoyed as a child are passed on to a new generation. This and Mary Poppins are added to my collection. <br /> <br /> Just like I remembered! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
