After seeing the terrible, terrible, terrible BATMAN: DEAD END, I knew I had to see it as soon as I heard about it. By pushing the game, you are looking at a trailer that I thought I was for another terribly short of what looked like another bad filmmaker trying to bring a new depth to the present character. But he was instead greeted with a GREATLY assembled trailer for a movie that unfortunately does not exist because I would like to see the finished film, even though it was only 30 minutes long. <br /> <br /> for BATMAN: DEAD END and then pair. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the next short!
