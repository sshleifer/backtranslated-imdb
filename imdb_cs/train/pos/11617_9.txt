The assumption is simple. This movie starts to look like your average lame chick flick around two attractive young people meeting each other at the airport, then things with 180 degree turn ... I for one, really do not like the kind of mind of the exciting love story of nonsense that pollutes the average cinema. And that's my modest belief that Wes Craven, based on his previous meta-horror movies (Sceam) does too ... <br /> <br /> According to this logic, it's no wonder Craven sardonically devotes his time to building an exciting sweet the story of "sependipity love" just to have the murderous Cillian Murphy the wreck that the whole sweet color of dreams ... The scope of his character Jackson Ripner (Jack the Ripper, get it lame that?) in this film is impressive, he goes from totally glamorous that it is twisted nihilistic sick, which is a plus in my book. When it comes to sacrificing her victim (Jennifer Garner looks like Rachel McAdams, which I found quite uncomfortable), you can not help but sympathize with that guy ... This is Wes Craven, embodied in Jackson Ripner, over Cillian Murphy, mindless feline flicks ... <br /> <br /> Craven, I'll greet you. <br /> <br /> Best quotes: Jackson Ripner (after defeating Rachel McAdams in the footbridge): "Thanks for the fast!"
