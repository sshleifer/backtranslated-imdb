Just looking at this movie on DVD and thinking that the acting was very good, but the whole story left much to be desired. This film has the same structure and appearance of Panic in a Needle Park or Cowboy Pharmacy. It is hard to believe that human beings can live this type of lifestyle; on the lower abdomen of a society in which their overall existence is based on hard use of drugs, crime, violence, sex, and total lack of self-esteem towards anyone or anything, including oneself. <br /> <br /> Val Kilmore is excellent in his role of "burnt" former porn star John Holmes. The support cast is just as good. It is a dry, dark, disturbing and depressing film. The murder was brutal, but the everyday life of these people was also brutal. If you are not interested in these murders or you are a fan of John Holmes, it's not really a movie you would see. If you want to see a docu-drama about murder, Truman Capote's 1960s in cold blood plays Scott Wilson and Robert Blake is much better.
