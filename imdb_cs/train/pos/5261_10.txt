You really like inventive comedy or love "wedding crashers" if the answer is the last stop reading now. I can not believe this movie is not higher. Basically Meadows plays a character that does not resemble Austin Powers. There are so many inventive moments in this gagorama. From rawness - Leon played with him on the porch, a former friend cheated himself to eat. . Oh, okay. To inspire sex with a loving clown, a Broadway routine, overcome your voice. Meadows is great as a childish but very sweet character of Leon. Some great links "do not hesitate Wang" "mad deaks sex world" too much. . . Why this movie was not huge is a mystery. Great comedy.
