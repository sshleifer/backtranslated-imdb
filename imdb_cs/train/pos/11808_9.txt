On the one hand, Warren Beatty created and played in epic red literacy about the founding of the Soviet Union, as seen by the eyes of the iconoclastic radical John Reed. It was a deep film, both fun and the news he introduced star cast. At the end of the decade, Warren Beatty created another kind of epic in Dick Tracy, which does not mean anything but fun with a group of the finest actors who only had a very old time who tried it in makeup tones. <br /> <br /> The fact that both Reds and Dick Tracy can come from the same person talks about the extent of this man as a player. In this movie, Beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters from the tape and put them in one original script. The Big Boy Caprice's ghetto makes a move that really eliminates competition. The film opens with him as Lips Manlis's followers roam in the shooting of the valentine massacre, and then Lips himself recalls the cement coat. But Caprice's movements are a target for him. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the third mysterious and helpless individual tries to look Caprice himself. Will our hero solve this clutter of crime? <br /> <br /> The spirit of entertainment is truly infectious. When people such as Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Sorvino, William Forsythe, R.G. Armstrong is horribly prepared to look like a cartoon crest of Chester Gould's belts, and then enjoy exercise by carving the largest piece of ham. You must love this movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino won a nomination for Best Actor, but one of them could have it, it's just that Pacino as Big Boy Caprice gets the most time on the screen. Only Beatty plays absolutely straight, everyone else seems to play it. Dick Tracy won Oscars for best artistic and design series, the best song written by Stephen Sondheim and introduced to Madonna, sooner or later. The fact that he even managed to get someone like Sondheim to write scores for this movie shows that Sondheim wanted to get into the fun. As for Madonna, the material girl has more than her own, when all these actresses act as a Breathless Mahoney club brethren. Before this movie, Dick Tracy's films were sent to B pictures and worse as Saturday afternoon serials. The only thing that rivals this stellar extravagance is the radio broadcast that vinyl has been achieved for World War II for the armed forces. Can you believe cast as Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Jimmy Durante, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan and Andrews Sisters? Try to find a record of this jewel. <br /> <br /> Until then, Warren Beatty's classic comic book will love it.
