Yesterday afternoon, the audience was not a dry eye after I left the cinema when I saw this film a jewel in a house sold at this year's Hamburg Film Festival. And the lazy shack was all laughing. This movie was cheerful, there is no other way to say it. There was no boring piece in it, I laughed over her and with all the other of us three hundred lovers of French cinema. Alain Chabat was absolutely amazing. Big clown, if needed, and serious if the situation requires it. The performance was, of course, completely over the top, but it was exactly the story he needed and what did so well. Charlotte Gainsbourg was so great, and I was very happy to see her, and her mother was also very powerful. The sisters could have been somewhat more detailed in scripture, but there was nothing to be moaned. I had a great afternoon when I saw this movie while Hamburg drowned out in the rain outside and I wish films such as France would get to Germany regularly. But the distributors of this country obviously do not understand that the French are doing good movies. At least I can not wait to find a DVD that offers subtitles (Hello Australia, please?), Because the movie I need at home so I can watch it several times!
