The John Van Druten Broadway musical hit is brought to the screen with the utmost stellar performance in this romantic fantasy of a modern witch that surprises a successful publisher in Manhattan. James Stewart can get top-notch bills, but Kim Novak, who shows the show as one of the most tempting wizards who have ever had a spell on the kinetic screen. Leading pairing is actually one of the few weaknesses of the film: Gray-haired Stewart looks a bit old on the role, and while it's easy to understand why Novak is going hard, it's a little harder to understand what she finds attractive on him because he seems to be disparate in temperament and outlook. (It's one of the stories is a fun assumptions that witches and warlocks are portrayed as Greenwich Village beatniks and bohemians.) Curiously, Stewart-Novak pairing would generate much more heat in the "Vertigo" released in the same year as this movie, but then "Vertigo" had a compelling story about the tension and the advantage of Alfred Hitchcock's direction. Movie comic moments are mostly provided with starboard support, including young Jack Lemmon (like Kim's Warlock brother), Elsa Lanchester (their aunt mother) and Ernie Kovacs (!) As a frantic writer. Hermione Gingold appears even in a merry portrait like something like the Great Witch. There are lots of movies in this movie - joke, romance and great cast - that means if you can take a look from the charming Miss Novak. I've seen the movie half a dozen times and I can never.
