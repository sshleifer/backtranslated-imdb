Most Stoogephiles think it's not the best stooges short bar, and they're right. Curly is a scream, dressed in a stroke like Senorita Cucaracha, and Moe and Larry are in peak form like "Senor Mucho" and "Senor Gusto" respectively. Christine McIntyre's beautiful opera voice got full rein - she was a really trained opera singer - and it's wonderful. Big Gino Corrado is cheerful as a pompous Italian singer terrified by Stooges on a social party. Some really funny gags, good direction and very narrow editing make it happening on the very top of Stooges' fertile exit. Even more amazing is that Curly had serious health problems at the time, and in the short shorts that he did during this time, you can see he's clearly sick; his timing is on the right, he speaks very slowly and slowly and has trouble getting around. Fortunately, his health was rising when he made this film and it shows it. The classic Stooge comedy and fans who did not have the Stooge (I had a girlfriend who could not stand Stooges, but she laughed). You must see.
