I remembered seeing this movie when I was one day in the wonderful world of Disney. This movie has been in my memory for over 30 years and I've been looking for it. I have to say that out of all the children's films I saw at that time, this was lost more than all, and after seeing it only once I really hoped to come back. The story and pictures of this film were burned into my memory. Until today, I have never seen it since this day in the 1970s, in fact, I have never forgotten the title until I can see it today on the Internet. I loved it and wanted my kids to see it. Does anyone know where to find it?
