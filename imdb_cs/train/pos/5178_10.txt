Before Tuscan Sky, I saw Diane Lane's unspeakable performance in this other puppet of the film. The campers are invited to the camp of their youth and experience it as adults. Each of those returning seems to be looking for something they lost, which is so realistic. Perhaps you had to be a campfire to really get it, but according to the words of one character, he noticed that all her clothes were wet "that's the camp!" From practical jokes and fights over buddies, to scary lunches and morning bells ... it's amplification. Once the exciting activity now appears to be secular. An amazing file cast makes the best of one dimensional roles and makes them incredible. Bill Paxton, Diane, Elizabeth, Mrs. Brad Paisley (probably when she first fell for her!) Beautiful scenery, bright colors, comic music (including variations of Hello Muddah) You can take the movie again and again like looking at an old friend.
