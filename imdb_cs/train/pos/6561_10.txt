To be honest, this is the best real estate show he ever came up with. To make money, you MUST really be INTELLIGENT. Not only do you have to be brave, athletic, cunning, etc. In fact, it requires skill. Not like some crazy shows that are these days. And yet they only have two seasons! Bull .. you need to make this show back! <br /> <br /> Although they will have a hard drag Anderson Cooper away from CNN. Was great. But it was a great show. You never knew who would go. And it was so funny that you tried to find out yourself! It was a show in which you could actually play alone if you wanted to! <br /> <br /> BACK THE MOLE !! RECEIVE BACK MOLE !!!!
