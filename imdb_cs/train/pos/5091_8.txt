He looked at both parts twice. He enjoyed the story and enjoyed the older Patrick Swayze as a hero. He was very trustworthy as the hunter Alan Quartermaine, and he certainly won the performance of Richard Chamberlain. I admit that I'd rather see someone else like "Lady in Need". Alison Doody should stick to modern and not periods. She did not have the look of a woman from the eighties. The rest of the cast was amazing and followed the plotlines very well. I am glad that actors of this generation are not afraid to try different characters and are not afraid they will be considered older. Age is inevitable, but we must not hide. A man at the age of 50 can be much more sexier (and Patrick is really sexy), then green youth, no matter how nice. Hoorah for character lines go along with a big smile.
