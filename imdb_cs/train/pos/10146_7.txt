As we all know, romantic comedy is a genre whose end is already known. Both scientists must always come together. Late in the third act I tried to find out how it would wrap it up and how it would end up together. From the very beginning a trace was given, but you never realize it until the end. It's a simple hook, but it works. You needed to cover a lot of usual terrain, but whenever possible, you would have fresh spin. I liked all NY characters and I loved places. It's a postcard from NY. It was also nice to watch the movie and not find anything insulting about it. So if you like a good old romantic movie ... then it's for you.
