The real anomaly in French cinematography, this desperate work has no equivalent in current production. One would rather have to look at Louis Malle's "le feu follet" (1963) (fire inside) to find something completely different to Harell's effort. Heart and cynicism, when he lost all his illusions, a hero, a computer scientist, no longer has a reason to live. Painlessly none. Deposed from the human race, it seems to be living like an entomologist, studying his colleagues. One of them draws his attention: Tisserand-Jos√© Garcia plays the most humiliating part of the decade -. Then Tisserand becomes a prey: all pessimism will face this poor man. the club will culminate in a strange relationship: the hero tells his victims that his life will always be unfulfilled if he .... Well, now the film takes a more traditional turn to talk (maybe Clouzota's mantanthropy) but only for a moment. <br /> <br /> <br /> The form is strange to the comment, and that is for the narrator who always refers to the main character as "our hero", one for the hero mentioned above. The story is now in Paris, now in Rouen, Guy de Maupassant. his hero, the hero says writer's madness is just an expression of his disgust for man, and he draws a parallel between his despair and Maupassant. <br /> <br /> This depressive film is only suitable for an informed audience. Not for very short excerpts from X rated films, but because after watching it you can feel down in the landfills.
