Excellent plot of land inside the plot. It's a shame that two of my movie heroes have a good grasp. It has to be my upbringing :) <br /> <br /> Everybody was very well. You never know who's going - who. The last little procedure at the end allows everyone to get their desert. <br /> <br /> We recommend everyone. A harmless language in the likelihood thriller that has some mistakes is probably Michael Caine overexposed the word "bloody," but that's his signature, right? 9/10
