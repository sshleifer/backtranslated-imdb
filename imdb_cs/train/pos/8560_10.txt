Drew Barrymore was great in this movie. This role is a type of role you do not normally see. Her typical role is like a woman who seeks love. The story is also great. When Holly was involved in murdering her mother, she moved to L.A. She comes with a guy who becomes her mistress. But her brother, who is in a hospital jail hospital for what he believes to be murder, is almost killed by being wrongfully accused. Then her lover is revealed to have a personality disorder. Then another woman becomes paranoid when she is around her. Eventually, however, he will find out the truth.
