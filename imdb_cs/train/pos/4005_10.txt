Although I thought it would become a graduate, I must say that Mother does an excellent job of explaining the sexual desire of an elderly woman. I'm so fond of the British film, because Hollywood would never do it, and even if they did, they would destroy it by not having the time to develop characters. The story unfolds slowly and realistically. The game is excellent, the characters are credibly faulty and the dialogue is sensitive. I tried to predict many times what happened and I was always wrong, so I was very interested in the story. I highly recommend this movie. And I have to admit, forever I look at Mom in a different light!
