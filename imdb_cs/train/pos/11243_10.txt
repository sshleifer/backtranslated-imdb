I first saw "Breaking Glass" when he was released in England in 1980. I loved it then and I just caught him in the Canadian station in August 2005, it's still great. The only thing I regret is that I can not find a sound track or a DVD in the shops ... ... someone who wants to fly some light, or I have to order it from an internet company with a higher price. But to return to the movie when the music is set for the test of time, Hazel / Kate had something to say about 80th Britain. In fact, it was the same decade that I moved to Canada for the same reasons, one of which was "Thatcher" and what she was doing at that time in the country. Please, if you have the opportunity to watch this movie, you will not regret!
