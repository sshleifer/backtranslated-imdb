This is a warm docu-drama that does not cover any new ground, overworks all clich√©s and is unlikely. For example, Munich is a very flat city. So why is the film hilly? For example, the end of the Great War in 1918 was not a surrender, but a truce. Yet it is reported as surrender. For example, European rapporteurs did not represent (and not) squeaky subtitles as they stocked papers. Still, the film uses this strictly American custom. For example, the Nazis did not accept the German eagle after they had gained power, but there is a counter, while Hitler supplies one of his winders. Most of this unsatisfactory production consists of little more than Hitler's oratorio. The film also preserves the myth that the beer hall putsch was poured out at the Munich Hoffbrauhaus. It was not. Robert Carlyle makes a fine look at his theme. But his supportive cast is at best adequate and very often it is not. These comments are based only on the first episode. One can hope the other will be better, but you will not mind.
