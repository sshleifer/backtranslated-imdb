Joseph H. Lewis was one of the best film directors of the noir. This is certainly the best. <br /> <br /> It does not have some standard features of what we now call movie noir. Although American-made, it is set entirely in England. Missing gangsters. He misses femme fatale. There is a crime. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is very happy to make some money as a secretary. Instead, they wake up days later as a pawn in a frightening conspiracy. Only a very strong person could survive such a terribly restless suffering. And Nina Foch makes sense for a strong woman like Julia. Part of the excitement comes from molding: Mrs. Foch has an elegant way. She is not screaming, sacrifice. In fact, it's a bit icey and patrician, though tiny. This makes her character more difficult and more credible. Dame May Witty is certainly the most interesting feature. She was (and is) probably the most famous for the charming title character in "The Lady Vanishes." It has a sweet and innocuous, easy eager way. But here he is not far from the heroine. George Macready is excellent as her extremely troubled son. The whole cast is really great. It seems that this famous and great movie was almost a coincidence. Undoubtedly, the director knew exactly what he was doing. But he did it with a low budget. This is the excitement and charm of the film noir, the real movie noir: It is a small, convincingly low life and in this case unforgettable.
