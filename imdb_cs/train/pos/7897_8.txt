At first glance, this movie does not look as strange. After all, Bette Davis films with only 166 votes on IMDb and rating 6.5 must be bad. But the film proved to be a wonderful and original surprise. First of all, you would expect it to be a typical average 30-year-old film with a love story, but the film is surprisingly well built and has an unusual and original story that also helps make this movie a very enjoyable one. <br /> <br /> The story is borne by his two main characters, played by Bette Davis and George Brent. They have helped them occupy mostly entertaining figures, but the film is mainly about two. Their character engages in the most unusual and clever writing love story, which also works as humorous. It makes this movie a wonderful little comedy that you can watch, that's absolutely fun. The film is relatively short (shortly an hour), which means that the story does not waste time on unnecessary fence lines, development, and characters. It makes the film also quite fast, which helps make this movie perfectly observable by current standards as well. Maybe it makes a slightly simple film, but it never falls to the detriment of its entertainment or entertainment. Lovely pleasant simple romantic comedy that deserves to see more! <br /> <br /> 8/10
