I used this film in the class of religion I taught. A goldfish swims happily in a bowl in an apartment on the top floor. The young boy and his mother are away from home. The boy got money to buy milk. On his way home he stops at the carnival and plays the game. Next to him stands a man in a black suit that looks a little frightening. The boy drops a bottle of milk. It breaks. The man in a black suit gives him money to replace the milk. This scene alternates with what is going on at home. A black cat rises after a fire and enters the flat. He (?) Discovers the bowl and watches her. Fish swim vigorously and slip out of the bowl. We learned a lot of teenagers in this class and I fell in love with the fish. The cat takes the fish in the mouth and we all hold our breath. Cat catches fish into a bowl. The twin story includes a suspicious man in black and suspicious black cats. Both inspire prejudices. Both are innocent. It was a great class discussion.
