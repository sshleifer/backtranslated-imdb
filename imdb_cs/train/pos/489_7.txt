After walking home after the movie I was buzzing with the famous Waltz music recorded by Natalia and Alexandre. I heard it before - where? Oh, from Kubrik "Eyes Wide Shut" ("Track 2)," he got it the same way I got to the door, "Waltz No. 2 from Jazz Suite No. 2" composed of Dimitri Shostakovich, who performed at the HI Philharmonic Orchestra Yes, I went and I picked up a soundtrack from the tower What kind of medicine Alexandr Desplat's film score was fulfilled - there are fifteen songs next to two songs of a wonderful waltz These days, we often do not get soundtracks, a remake of my favorite score Maurice Jarre, Ennio Morricone (the initial notes of track 6 have traces of "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso"), Georges Delerue and John Barry, there are fine triangle nuances and notes from strings, celeste, piano and harp. /> <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and John Turturro have made credible concerted performances. <br /> <br /> The love story, their intimate connection, is between Alexandre and Natalia - his childish, yet torturing inner world, and The director Marleen Gorris from "Antonia's Line" (the best prize from Holland in 1996) gave us a delicately sensitive film - without disturbing human conflicts, intrigues, obsessions, family interventions, love and respect. The front theme is the mind-game and the mathematical logic of chess. Below it, it may be a modest tearjerker of drama set in the late 1920s. Cinematography captures the tranquil beauty of Lake Como in northern Italy near the Swiss border. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend a soundtrack if you do not feel like going to the cinema. Alexandra Desplat has a lyrical movie score "The Luzhin Defense" is complete.
