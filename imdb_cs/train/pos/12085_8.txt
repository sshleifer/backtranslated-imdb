Shirley MacLaine in a different role. As a aunt to one mother in the 1962 working class in Chicago, the veteran actress gets more training as a courageous woman who will not let any set-backs beat her soul of success. Children, a preschool boy and a girl, are attracted to their lively aunt Zoe, though she has learned many magic tricks and practical jokes and applied it on all the wrong occasions, eventually dropping them out of school. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Give them a cleverly hidden Cuban missile crisis with all the social consequences. Men who build shelter bombs, people watched news programs about what seemed to be the only television receiver in the dining room and the general fog of unease and fear in the air. When the miracle is "innocuous" thrown out of proportion, the ultimate conclusion nevertheless makes the viewer good. Yes, Virginia, tomorrow the sun will come out! It is obvious that it is a small budget, it is still a sweet little film, filled with the spell from which the Sunday Matinees were made. With a few "Oldies" choosed in an effective soundtrack, the whole family will surely enjoy this. ****
