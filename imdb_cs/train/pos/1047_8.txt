It may or may not be considered interesting that the only reason I really looked at this movie was because I wanted to see the performance of a man who beat Humphrey Bogart in his CASABLANCA (10/10 role for Best Actor Oscar I would have given Oscar to Bogie, but Paul Lukas did a great job and at least deserved a nomination.) I'm glad I checked this movie because I enjoyed it immensely I think the film was a bit preaching but not only did not mind me, (Luke Watson), Bette Davis (unjustly not nominated), George Coulouris, and Eric Roberts, who have been nominated for an Academy Award nomination, and have never been bored with them. who played a middle child, I really liked: a strange guy who speaks like a kind (Bodo) is fun. Endin g, in which Luke's character was forced to do something he thought was bad, even though he did it for all the right reasons, he worked for me as well. I agreed with him why he felt he had what he had done, and I understood why he could not explain it completely. The message that this film makes is good and noble, the landscape (house) is beautiful and the acting is excellent. Watch this movie if you ever have a chance. <br /> <br /> 9/10
