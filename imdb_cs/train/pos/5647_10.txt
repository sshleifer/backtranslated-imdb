I do not want to be bored by repeating what has been said, but it's one of the best series at all! It was a great shame when it was canceled, and I hope somebody will have good reason to pick it up and start the series again. The good news is that it's OUT ON DVD !!!! I jumped into the store and picked up a copy and I'm glad it's as good as I remember it. Gary Cole is a gorgeously dark and haunted figure and all the actors were very good. It is a pity that the network does not continue. Shaun Cassidy, this is a masterpiece. Anyone who likes the genre and who did not see it must do so. You will not be disappointed. My daughter, who was too young to see her when she was on the television (she's 20), is becoming a great interest and will soon be a fan. She seems to be "very twisted" and looks forward to the episodes she has seen. I can not wait to see episodes that have not been broadcast. <br /> <br /> This rock demonstration !!!!
