This is just above my list of the most hysterically entertaining shows I've ever seen. So I laughed, I'm sure I lost half of the jokes. This shows Izzard as a gifted comic. I especially like that it seems she will never be a "stupid" material for her audience. His timing is impeccable and the routine is tied up as a powerful piece of work rather than just a series of gags. Thumbs up.
