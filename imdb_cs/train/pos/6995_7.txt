A rather unfortunate business that introduces Bela Lugosi as a mad scientist (yes, Renfield's assistant and his mother, dwarf and yes, female scientist) (sounds like Greenaway's movie actually lol). bride (why is it? Who knows?) so his wife could look beautiful when he managed to get brides after doing a pretty clever trick with several orchids that made the brides collapse at the altar. only HAPPENS gets behind the scoop and decides to talk about the story. He uses some traces of orchids and Lugosi. He knows where the police are. The idea is soon to Bella's Lair when he meets some kind of strange search physician who it may or may not be eeeevil. It all gathers in a far-reaching plan to have a fake wedding capture a mad scientist, but it seems the scientist has an x-ray vision while he plans his plans, Oh no! What will happen? this film is a little bit of a pleasure. Lugosi is great here, its curtains are very strange, the story is in some places really nasty, making it all the most observable. A fun little look.
