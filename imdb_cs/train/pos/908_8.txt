I can not believe that this movie is now rated as 6.9. Anyway, this movie was probably one of the most moving real Indian movies I've ever seen. It was really refreshing to see a movie that showed a traditional family cinema. As for the story, I thought it was great that the shahid kapur was preparing for an amrita rao marriage. It's a bit happy to go a happy guy while Amrita Rao is a traditional Indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle but the only problem is that her cousin does not seem to receive as much attention as she does so her aunt does not like Amrita with passion. This disturbs Amrita because she wants her aunt to love her. He was also very eager to see that although Amritin's family was not so rich, perhaps only a middle class in the lower class, while the Shahid family was a top class, she still treated her family and did not even give her a nerve. It's because I really saw people being very rough to people who are not so good that they think they are below their standards, which I think is very shallow. This film showed that the family shahids were willing to look at the great values ​​Amrita had brought up, and she closed her eyes that she was not the wealthy daughter of business magnates or anything else. The whole movie deserves 8/10. I wish more and more films were filmed.
