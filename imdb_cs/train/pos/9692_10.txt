I do not know who could find a mistake with just a humorous and fun movie like this, with lots of joy for your heart. Every minute I enjoyed and hit the end of half the movie - but that did not disappoint me at all. It will not just touch your heart, but it's such a good film fit for the family - we need a lot more!
