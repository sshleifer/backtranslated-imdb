I was a very horrible story, and because I was going through something similar with my parents, I really joined. It's so easy to forget that someone whose body is failing was once alive and passionate. And then there are the mistakes they have made and must live with. I loved the performance of Ellen Burstyn and who is Christine Horne? It's fantastic! Actual Finding. It is likely that the most erotic scene I've ever seen in the movie has not been shown - it was so beautifully done. The overall look and feel of the film was an amazing, real emotional journey. Cole Hauser is very good in this picture, humanizing a person who is circling down. I liked how the film director approached the woman's life, never sentimental, never too much - just enough to interfere with us, but it was not enough to get there.
