I thought this movie was great because Corrine and Sean are new to business. It was full of action and a bit of romance, but there were a few things when Corrine did not say too clearly (when Shane was threatening a gun) and she gripped her teeth ... maybe it should be? I think the roles of Joseph and Sonny were rendered very well and there was a clear contrast. Also, because I watched another action star, I'm sure Corrine and Sean have made their own bits that have been done very well. I'm looking forward to another two-pair movie because they're doing a great team or a sequel to rely on your life - maybe called "make it big in a big apple" - it could be Carmen ... Either your life is excellent!
