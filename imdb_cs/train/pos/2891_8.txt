We watched last night on "The Wonderful World of Disney" on ABC, and I came to the conclusion that "mice" must be tighter than usual. <br /> <br /> Because this film lasts only 74 minutes and had to take it off for 2 hours of television broadcast time, it did and did not make advertising breaks lasting 6 to 7 minutes. During these advertising breaks, they had another "TV show" ad hosted by Oh-so-annoying Kelly Rippa, who reportedly announced the magical miracles "Cinderella 2: Dreams Come". <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Once again, break after a break, Disney took the time out of a real movie to tell us, faithful spectators, that we needed to get a copy of the sequel. Thank you, Disney, for making us the creator of the continuation of your beloved precious film. Anyway, this commercialism and the ringing in cash made it difficult to get into the real Cinderella movie, because in the times when the ads ended, I forgot where the story stopped. The original "Cinderella" of course still retains its charm and the story is still good, although we've all seen it countless times. It's a pity that they had to make it cheaper with all the marketing for what seems to be a lame follow-up.
