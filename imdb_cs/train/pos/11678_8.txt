Clara Bow (Hula Calhoun) is the daughter of the owner of Alberta Gran (Bill Calhoun), who is mainly interested in playing cards and acting with friends. He is interested in riding in the countryside until engineer Clive Brook (Anthony Haldane) who builds a dam opens. One of her father's friends Arlette Marchal (Mrs. Bane) then competes for his attention. His wife Maude Truax (Margaret Haldane) will appear at the conceived final. Lots of "pre-code" elements like swimming naked. <br /> <br /> Beautiful place to shoot in Hawaii.
