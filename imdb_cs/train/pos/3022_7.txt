He never realized that Charles Boyer (Luis Denard) appeared together with Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen) in a joint film and enjoyed a great deal of joint action. Even Peter Lorre (Contreras) had a role in this film and had a bad misfortune in his bathroom that made him faint. This story deals with a Republican courier, Luis Denard, who visits England during the Spanish Civil War and is trying to break the coal mining treaty that causes great damage to other nations. Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen) comes to help with Luis Denard by lifting him and falling in love with him, and then helping him escape from an angry mob of English miners who threaten his life. The real bad guy in this movie is Victor Francen, (Licata) "Beast with Five Fingers," which gives great performance. Great classic 1945 film without Humphrey Bogart.
