When I first read the story of this drama, I assumed it would be like Sex and the City, but this drama is nothing like that. Story characters look more realistic and you know more situations. The concept of drama is similar, forty thousand women lead us through their friendship and relationships with problems and conflicts on the way. Katie GP is a dark and squeaky figure that you also find it hard to concentrate on, and you are best with Trudi's widow. Trudi's character is heart warming because you can combine the difficulties she has with her being the only mother of four. Jessica is a strange girl very independent and knows what she wants and how to get her. She is a sympathetic figure and is closest to Siobhan's new memories, which even though she loves her husband, she can not help with her wandering to her co-worker. It's surprisingly addictive across the track, and if BBC continued to produce the series, it could do well. This is unlike other female dramas such as sex and city, or desperate wives. If it plays properly, it may be another cold leg. In addition to male cast, the eyes are not bad.
