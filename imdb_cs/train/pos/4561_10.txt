I have seen this movie three times and every time I see it, it becomes more personal and emotional. <br /> <br /> The performance is amazing, which is not hard to believe because it is Daniel Day Lewis, who is a wonderful actor. Brenda Fricker is a surprising miracle in her. She will capture your heart like a mother of a physically disabled boy who is unable to walk or talk until he is in the late teens. I can not say enough good things about the movie, but I'll stop here. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies that are based on real events or simply enjoy good dramas in general.
