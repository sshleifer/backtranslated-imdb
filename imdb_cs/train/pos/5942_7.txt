I really liked BATMAN: DEAD END, I thought it was a theater feeling and the chance that Collora would make a great movie. This trailer did not give me the same impression. The story of the line, or potential story line, was pretty good, but because of acting and special effects it felt like it did a good TV movie or TV show. <br /> <br /> First, Michael O'Hearn is not so Superman. Actually, I thought Clark Kent, in his short look, was a good one. I'm sorry, I just do not think Superman is crazy. The cage that Kent wore masked his size. Batman may have a Bodybuilder body, but not a Superman. Supers are undoubtedly toned, but not bulky. Anyway, I did not care about all his poses, and his transformation from Kent to Superman seemed to be frantic. Now it may not just be O'Hearn's fault, Collora may have to take some credit for bad scripting and direction. <br /> <br /> Second, the special effects for flying were furious. Superman flies in the sky. If it was obvious that this Superman flew close to the ground, with telephone cables and buildings above it. I think there is no full body flying Superman. Obviously, the harness and equipment that O'Hearn supports had to be placed on his lower body. Overall, it was a good trailer. I probably would have liked to see a movie if he ever did, and he would have caught him on television. The story line, an alliance between Lexcorp and Wayne Industries, Superman is jealous of Lois's attraction to Wayne, Lex, and Twoface, who are about to defeat Superman, and the combination of Batman and Superman is good. I'm sure that with more budget and the approval of Collor's full film and company, even O'Hearn could provide a decent film. It's definitely better than most of the comics that have come from Hollywood lately.
