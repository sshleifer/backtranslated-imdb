I've read a lot of commitments when it was in theaters, and that was all bad ... I think you have to be a certain type of personality to enjoy these movies. If you are not a man who likes Waltons or Little House ... U will not understand or enjoy these films ... Now about Love Abiding Joy ... I knew it was a bad news from the beginning of the movie ... I wish it showed more than the end rather than simply thinking. This movie has a lot to do with Jeff ... it's 6 years later, so you know she's going to be interested. <br /> <br /> I want to say that I have enjoyed all four films so far. ... he was not crazy in books ... Cant wait for another movie. The way Clark speaks will always get you. I'd like to see Jan Janse appear ... Maybe it's happening in the family.
