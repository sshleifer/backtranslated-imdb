This is one of the smartest, most awesome and most heartfelt horror film EVER! Dr. Creed (Louise) and his family are moving to a new home with their wife (Rachel), daughter (Ellie) and little son (Gage) Everything seems normal until Dr Creed loses his patient, a terrible head injury, as he knows when Victor takes him to Pet Sematarty and shows him where the dead will live. Louis did not know if it was all dream and talked to Ellie, who feared her cats that could be killed by a truck and later Rachel tells Louis that it's really hard to talk about death because of her sister Zelda who was really sick As we can see in the memory, how sick her sister really was, and that's one of the worst scenes ever!) The next day Ludwig calls from the Jedi that the cat was killed by a truck and Jed took him to a place where Victor Ghost said he does not want to go! And to bury the cat, his wife and the kids are going to see their grandparents and Louise is shocked at home when she sees the cat back and now it's like the evil in his eyes so he goes to see Jed then Jed tells him he's also buried his there is also a dog (as we have seen other memories). Later in the movie Family out with a picnic, Gage plays with a dragon, and Gage says I'll drop it ", Wind blows a rod near the road where the carriage is near, Gage approaches the road, Louis dives to get it. HEARTBREAKING in the horror movie went with your jaws on the floor, or Shivers returns when you hear Louise. He soon misses so much, Louis then buries Gage in the same place where the Cat is buried. The worst thing in the movie is that some scenes in This movie is not too far from real life. <br /> <br /> This movie is just amazing and the acting from everyone is great!
