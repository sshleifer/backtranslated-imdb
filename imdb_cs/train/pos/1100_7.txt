- When Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) became tired of a diving race and confined living conditions in New York, he found land for his wife and children. He hopes to find a simple life. But the building of the house proved to be something other than simple. As headaches and bills begin to accumulate, it laughs. Does Mr. Blanding always dream his house of dreams? <br /> <br /> - What makes this movie so special is the three main actors - Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas. Any one of them is able to wear the film on his own, so when you harvest their talents, almost every scene is odd. Grant has always been popular in this type of role. She is so good when she plays her husband. Loy is always happy to watch. The thin films she made with William Powell are almost perfect. And Douglas has become my favorite in the last two to three years. Douglas also appeared in The Old Dark House, which is my favorite movie. The film is definitely a product of its time. I think you can imagine the time when you could build two-storey, three bedrooms and four bathrooms for $ 15,000 a year. Note that your two children attend a private school and have a living service and become almost fantastic. <br /> <br /> - But for anyone who bought or built a house, the many situations and problems that Blanding finds are so easy to date. And that's where the comedy comes. How many people did some of the stupid things the couple did in this movie just to end up spending more money than expected? - The biggest complaint I have about Mr. Blandings is the whole podplotka "wife in love with a friend". It really is not necessary to make a plot and feels out of place and very unpleasant as stated.
