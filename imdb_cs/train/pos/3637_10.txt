It was really a great movie. I loved Dennis Quaid and the whole baseball team. Jay Hernandez is also a very nice actor who is very pleasant to watch. The chemistry that the team has gained is magnificent, just to show what you can achieve when the mind connects as one with one goal. This team has returned from the edge and had several lossy seasons and won almost everything. I love such movies because they are really very inspiring. In addition, the character of Dennis Quaid becomes a place in the main leagues. You can do nothing, but the root for the guy. It seems that if someone has something to do, they will do it. Things just happen to fall into place and they do everything they click. Based on a true story, this movie really makes you think that "nothing is impossible".
