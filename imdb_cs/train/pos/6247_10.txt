Stories of this film may show scenes of violence or non-mainstream sexuality, but these scenes are rare fragments, chosen to engage the audience. They are, of course, showing the main message of the film: People who are constantly kicking their heads in their work and life, using the power they can have somewhere else, notoriously oppress others. And at the lower end of the oppression, mostly women. The film, which shows it brutally like Hundstage, is definitely hard to face, but it has to endure such lives, it is even tougher. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film resembles short cuts but consists of episodes of documentary style featuring people like your neighbor playing as they are. Without any glitter and most disturbingly without any hope. His documentary style makes the film even more disturbing because you realize there are people there, and there are many of them even though our company focuses on a nice exterior. Somewhere in the porn industry, it has to do business, somewhere to talk about domestic violence somewhere hoping to break. You surely know such people. If you want to see a movie without any fun scenes (some may think that a disabled woman who repeats ten supermarkets is funny, but that's really going on) and without any melodramatic, go watch this movie. It's lost, however, when you focus on the subtitles I'm afraid, because the subtitles can not carry any emphasis.
