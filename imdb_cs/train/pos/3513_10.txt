Actor Herman Jos√© plays the role of football entrepreneur soccer who gains the passage of two African players and tries to sell them for very little money to Benfica's club FC Porto and therefore these players did not play well and wanted FC Port to be with situations are damaged. But what happens is that these two players are good after all, and FC Porto sells them for big money to a foreign club, which is a good deal. The film for a small country like Portugal, without big antecedents in great movies, is a very good and fun comedy that shows all the rivalries between Portugal in the north and south of Portugal (FC Porto / Benfica). Highly recommended
