If the The Girl From Missouri themes sounds familiar, it should be. That's because Anita Loos, who wrote the script, also wrote classical gentlemen. Unlike Marilyn Monroe in this film, Jean Harlow will accept any kind of jewelry from the men's means. And these are men from the means Jean Harlow watches. She left the house where the hash building was, her mother and stepfather, because she decided that the best way to get an easy life was to marry her. Her talent as a choir girl is limited, but she will be able to deal with this beauty. Odyssey begins with her and her friend Patsy Kelly, inviting her to a party bestowed by millionaire Lewis Stone. Unconscious Jean, Stone only has a little wild job before he goes alone for the money he does not owe. Still, they are arguing about anything that Millionaire Lionel Barrymore will notice. <br /> <br /> Lionel is amused until Jean takes his son, Playboy, Franchot Tone. After not having fun and he seems to be shaking Jean from climbing to a pedigree. The Missouri girl went into the middle adaptation of the Code, so it was under strange censorship. I feel we'd see a much more dangerous movie. Still, Jean Harlow, as the younger and more gentle version of Mae West, is always appreciated. What a wonderful comic talent the woman had when she saw The Girl From Missouri is a sad reminder of the great loss the movie world suffered with her when she was three years later. It is ironic that casting Patsy Kelly Harlow was undoubtedly influenced by the successful shorts that Kelly made with another well-known platinum blonde Thelma Todd. Harlow and Kelly have the same simple chemistry between what Patsy and Thelma had. Todd would also die a year later in a strange accident / suicide / murder that no satisfactory explanation was ever given. <br /> <br /> Do not Miss Miss Girl Missouri, it's clear and clever, it must be all of the sparkling jewels.
