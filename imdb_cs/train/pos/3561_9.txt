At least something good has resulted from Damon Runyon's incorrect attempt to sentiment the mafia. Guys and Dolls, a seemingly indestructible stage musical, was portrayed in 1955 by Joseph L. L. Mankiewicz ("All About Eve") in a colorful and entertaining film that included a feature cast including Vivian Blaine's Broadway show), Jean Simmons has a peculiar appearance with Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday") and two of all leading executives Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brand, both of whom have recently won Oscars as the Best Supporting Actor ("From Here to Eternity") and Best Actor were at the top of their game. One to listen to Brando, who sings "Luck Be a Lady Tonight," talks about where Dylan soon got his voice. Stubby Kaye steals the show as a pretty little Johnson that brings home "Sit Down You Rocking the Boat". The ubiquitous Sheldon Leonard adds another page to his gangster screen. The film has a clear, caricature look that Pop Art predicts in the early 1960s. The characters speak in a stylized patois, apparently based on Yiddish idioms. Although the philosophical attitudes and sex roles are dated, it is very fun and even the fine fun of the Salvation Army is harmless and does not reflect any real hostility towards organized religion. Just seeing Sinatru and Brando in the same movie is a good reason to watch this movie, but he has a lot of other attractions to offer during his 149 minutes.
