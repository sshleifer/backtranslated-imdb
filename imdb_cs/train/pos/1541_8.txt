He had just seen this film at the Seattle International Film Festival and enjoyed it thoroughly. <br /> <br /> Great writing and direction, excellent and credible interaction between cast and great comic timing. <br /> <br /> This film touches on topics that are universal families and separations. As a result, I can see European, Asian and American audiences when they find similarities between this movie and their own lives. If this is not enough, it has the potential to be the best underground film of the year ... someone distributes it in the US, please! <br /> <br /> Finally: thank you Maria Flom! It's really a great movie.
