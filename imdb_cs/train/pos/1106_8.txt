If you're a fan of the large cast of the Altman group, as seen in big movies such as M.A.S.H., Nashville, Gosford Park and lesser-known movies like Wedding, you will no doubt have fun at HealtH. Around HealtH, focusing on a health treaty in which two women run for president, many of the last 70 years of regular people, such as Paul Dooley (who helped in writing the film), Carol Burnett and Henry Gibson, as well as newcomers from top star Altman as Lauren Bacall, James Garner and Glenda Jackson. Like many films in Altman, there are many films in this movie, but it's not as overwhelming as movies like Nashville or A Wedding, but rather has a more focused feel, maybe as M.A.S.H. or Gosford Park. The whole thing is the obvious satire of the Health, filled with supernatural, impassable, contradictory characters, guest stars like Dick Cavett who comment on this. Stressing the entire electoral process is Altman's characteristic pessimism about politics and public appeals, but what is most appealing to this film is the ultimate pastime most people seem to have. That would be one of Altman's movies like that after a while!
