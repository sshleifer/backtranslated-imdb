For the first time, I have seen this film as a pre-teenager, the age when children begin to think their identity. I was very struck by the scene of a man and a child that he highlights as his own. The oldest boy is doubtful that his mother is a prostitute and none of his siblings have the same biological father (which Kurosawa reveals by having children that do not look like everyone else). The man still persuades the man that he is their father according to the only definition that counts. A man is recognized as the father of all children, but one who still prefers his brother. Each of the vignettes is the same for their own stories and conclusions. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, though it's not the biggest Kurosawa movie.
