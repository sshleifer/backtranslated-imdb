I was in the old theater in northern California when this movie came out. Just as well as a DVD, it's even queer and frightening on the big screen. Although it was about nine years since I saw it, it's still one of my favorite times. The risk of sounding a tritu: "They will not do it any more!" If Sixth Sense has ever scared you, this movie is definitely for you! Big story, incredible cast of characters, ominous setting; even the soundtrack has a breathtaking quality for her. I strongly recommend that you do not see it yourself. Which apartment in 1977 rented a brown house will have heat (it would be at least ten times that price today).
