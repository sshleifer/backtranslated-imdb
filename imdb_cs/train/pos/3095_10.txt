What is the reason? Is there any vendetta against this AWESOME show or somebody involved? Why should the best show I've seen in years be canceled? I am addicted. I saw this show accidentally last fall and immediately loved her and watched it every week. Then she left and tried Tivo, but it was not broadcast. So I forgot about it for a while until I found an episode on the ABC website. Now I want more. I agree with everyone else - with the rest of the junk on TV today it was refreshing to see something so well rounded and developed like this. I'm looking at Boston Legal for my eccentric comic fix and House for my intellectually mysterious repairs. My wife loves Gray's Anatomy for her "realism," and I love / hate the show, but that could not be done for me. PREPARATION too dramatically. Everything that can go wrong is. But once there is a drama that really is real. Real people, real problems. Sure, there are certain extremes, like the former gangster has changed, the girl ran out of the crowd, etc. But these people (especially in the NYC) are really out and I relate to each of them. I can not get enough. I just hope that ABC gets their head off their beans and continues this show. Get some respect for being in a certain quality. This could be one of the best performances of all time. If anyone leaves it.
