Personally, I think the film was very professional, I loved choreography and acting. The plot is also breathtaking and mysterious. The film itself is very emotional and what I liked most about is that she thinks you later. Antonio Gades absolutely has lived his part to the end and I have to say that it's one of my favorite shots and Saura is a great director.
