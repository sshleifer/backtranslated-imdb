I am 60 years old, guitarist (lead / rhythm), and in the last forty years I have been in four bands, it's all there, fighting, faul-up, spoiled food, worse accommodation, always traveling, little or no money and everyone was drunk or high. But clubs, fans and music all worth it! Just like Strange Fruit! I'm pretty damn old now, and arthritis in the hands and hips does not mean more swing, but it's all come back to the whole length of the video and it's all! Birds, brawls and booze! And again I was young! It's just like Billy Connolly's voice, God likes so many things! Rock On Forever!
