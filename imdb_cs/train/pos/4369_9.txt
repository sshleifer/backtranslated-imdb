I loved this movie. The landscape was breathtaking, the conspiracy had some nice twists and turns and the figures were well rounded. On two fronts, however, "Rob Roy" far more than average. First of all, I have rarely seen a "popular" film in which the quality of the dialogue was so high. There have been many verbal quarries and pushing to accompany a splendid choreographed swordplay. I could give many examples, but why should I? Just watch the movie. Secondly, this film understands the principle, which is rarely recognized. In order for the drama to succeed, it needs not only a hero, but a truly credible villain. If you do not, you do not have the pleasure of having good boys. And "Rob Roy" does not have one, but three - Count Montrose, his friend Kilairn and Archie. Not one-dimensional villains, nor completely complete and very ugly. It takes a bit more patience than "Braveheart" - there is more dialogue and the accents are a bit heavy but it's a smarter and smoother piece. (As I said, I loved this movie!)
