Kurt Russell IS Elvis, simple and simple. His commitment to this role has resulted in what I think is the best film bio. If you're a fan of Elvis, you'll see if that's possible. The film made for television was made two years after Elvis's death. <br /> <br /> One advice, there are two versions - one in 180 minutes and one in 117 minutes. The only one to look at is longer. The shorter has more than one hour of shooting. It just does not work because the scenes in it are often dependent on the scenes that were cut. This masterpiece will take you from the childhood of Elvis through its creation as the greatest star of entertainment. Shelley Winters and Bing Russell (Kurt's real father) are excellent Elvis parents. And Pat Hingle supplies a very competent Colonel Tom Parker. <br /> <br /> Long live the king!
