In 1996, "101 Dalmatians", Cruella De Vil was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police (God blesses them) for an attempt to steal and kill 101 Dalmatian puppies. Everything covered with mud and hay, she spent another four years in a "can." Now, four years later, unfortunately, she was released from prison. I said it's about 28 years old - in dog years !!!!! So in 2000, Disney decided to continue the successful live version of the classic film and is called "102 Dalmatians." This is the 102th Dalmatian (Oddball is a name, I think I should know because it was just on TV recently) and the puppy had no stains !!!!! Also, while Cruella (again played by Glenn Close) once again escaped, she wanted a bigger and better coat - those of those puppies !!!!! I especially liked the theme song - I'm sure everyone loves the song "Atomic Dog" from the 70s. And now we've heard a little about it in this movie !!!!! 102 "Dalmatians" is such a great movie that I have continued with - WHAT WILL "103 DALMATIANS?"? LOL <br /> <br /> 10 stars
