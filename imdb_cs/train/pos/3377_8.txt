Soylent Green is a classic. I was waiting for someone to do it again. It seems like today's world war is transforming science fiction and I hope some director / producer will make Soylent Green again. With today's computer animation and technology it could be a great image. Anti-utopian films may not be that far. The human race behaves like cockroaches without external influence to limit them. We, like humans, have the ability to give kibos to breed smaller species if they get out of hand, but nothing can be controlled by human breeding, except for ourselves. Despite all the diseases, wars, abortions, birth control, etc. The human race is growing like bacteria in the Petri dish. The classical Maltese economy states that all kinds, including humans, multiply beyond their means of life. 6 billion and growing ... it's obscene.
