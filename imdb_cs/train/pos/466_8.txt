This was an exceptionally good historical drama. John Turturro is excellent as a tortured genius Luzhin and he superbly portrays manic character characters, like his strange dances. Emily Watson is great in her supporting role as Sensitive Lover Natalia. Relatonship between chess and near insanity is well explored by Gorris and the well-known Naboc interests as "eternal innocence" (ie "Lolita"). are visible in this movie. I think I will continue to read this novel now. It was a touching and tragic end and it was hard to keep a dry eye. Brilliant movie!
