A very nice film that contains characters that make bad things and that leave emotions like anger and a desire for vengeance. Cast is very good, there is a lot of action, and Stewart gets the girl and his revenge (with a twist) at the end. I've seen this movie several times and always watched when it's on an AMC or a cable. Highly recommended ...
