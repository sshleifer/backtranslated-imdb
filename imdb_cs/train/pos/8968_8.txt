This movie was like every Jimmy Stewart movie, funny, charming and very pleasant. The performance of Kim Novak as Gillian, the beautiful witch who longs to be human, is beautiful, her fine expressions on the face, every movement and gesture that make Gillian a unique and somewhat haunted character, let us hang on every word. I must not forget Ernie Kovacs and Elsa Lanchester's highly praised idea as a Scottish loving writer possessed by the magical world (Kovacs) and the other as a dear aunt who may seem to stop using magic even if it is forbidden. The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are beautifully finished and the chemistry between them is great, but then again when the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and some top lady is wrong!
