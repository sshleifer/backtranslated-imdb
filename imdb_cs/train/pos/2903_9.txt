Tiempo de valientes is a very fun action comedy. After his great fiction, El Fondo del Mar and the spectacular Los Simuladores television program, Damian Szifron did another great job. Tiempo de valientes looks after the Hollywood movie after a while. Diego Peretti and Luis Luque are two great actors and have great performances here. The film is very fun and fun and has great moments. Tiempo de valientes is a very fun action comedy that I strongly recommend to you if you want to have a great time. And I have to congratulate Szifron for all the talent she has. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9
