A boy and a girl are persecuted by a local warrior because the boy killed (by chance) the father of the fighters (or who he was). And they travel through the nature of Africa's most embarrassing areas. <br /> <br /> He plays in this movie not so good (except the elephant child). But it is a very good adventure and is not censored, there is some blood, body and nudity (which makes the film a little easier). I give this film 7, because it's an image of African nature and its action.
