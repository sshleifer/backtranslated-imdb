We found this movie in a video recorder, it cost $ 2 a purchase. The whole movie smells really bad! The so-called Colonel, who might have a trusted cover for the hero, must be in the eighties and barely able to walk. He even shoots some of the deepest ninjas in the world. Then the story leaves the Colonel, which makes sense due to the inability of the old man to do something to be mentioned, and now they become two terrifying men who must become a story. I lost a hundred times, but it did not matter because the movie is so bad, it's really fun to watch. Zero-Budget waste with actors who do not deserve this name. Go on it!
