William Hurt no longer had to be an American matine idol, but he still has a very good taste in B-movie projects. Here's a tragic past trap removal specialist trapped by a trapped loser on the run - played by a handsome old boy Weller - who was polluted by a deadly poison. The current handsome boy Hardy Kruger Jr - apparently prettier than his dad - is cited as Weller's arrogant boss in a terrible succession in the chemical plant that transmits the story. Natasha McElhone is a slightly annoyed government agent who is looking at an incident that gives the hero Hurt an inevitable and loving affectionate interest. Michael Brandon will appear when he plays a slick type without prisoners whose chance you can not wait. Coca-Cola has been awarded Product Placement in 2000, as a soft drink is presented throughout the production, filmed lovingly on the spot in the winter picture postcard Hungary.
