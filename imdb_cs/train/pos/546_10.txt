I thought it was one of the best sequels that I had just seen. Sometimes I felt like I wanted someone to die, Stanley's killing of poisonous characters was great. It was such a great movie that you were happy when he died so. My only problem was that in some scenarios it seemed that someone with a home camera was shooting and it was strange. Judd Nelson is cute, at least in my opinion, and was excellent in the role of Stanley Caldwell. Brilliant film.
