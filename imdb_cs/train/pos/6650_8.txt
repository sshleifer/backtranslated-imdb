I would not like to comment on how good the movie was or what were the mistakes because I'm not a professional film critic and I do not have enough knowledge about filming movies. What I know is that filming this movie in your first slide is a great success and I would like to congratulate the directors for that. However, in some reviews I read, critics complained that the relationship between Hiralal and his brothers was not highlighted, and his siblings were completely erased from the story. Now I would like to point out that, as the title of the film suggests, it is not a film about Hiramal brothers, it is a film about the relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his son, Hiralal Gandhi, much less. If we start complaining that some movies will not be retained in the movie, it would be a little unfair because these characters are not shown in the picture no matter how relevant they are in real life. So I think it would be better if we kept the main idea and stopped satisfying the criticisms within. <br /> <br /> Enjoy !!!!
