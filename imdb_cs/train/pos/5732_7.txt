Since September of last year, I borrow four to six films each week from the Harold Washington Library, which boasts an impressive collection of DVDs. (HWL is a circulating library: three quarters of his films are at that moment!) I was so excited to find David Lynch's The Short Films. Yesterday, when I knew little about the animated series, I picked up Dumbland. I'm here to report that David Lynch's fans are watching eight episodes spent half an hour. The most striking feature of these short tracks is their soundtracks. Each episode has its own rhythm. Respiratory and digestive systems provide percussion. An unpleasant voice accent stops. Physical violence adds beats. Bird flu and buzzing sockets shudder at the edges. Many other elements will fill the orchestra. The movement of coarse animation often synchronizes with sound, but the soundtrack itself struck me as Lynch's primary interest in creating and spreading this work. Indeed, these eight shorts are unique Lynchian rhythms. <br /> <br /> That being said, the situations are strange, ugly, deep, silly and funny like hell. And there is plenty of room to think about how absurd we humans are. I can not say that I will follow the collection again, but for anyone who has appeared in a movement that is a suite of inland empire, Dumbland stands for half an hour.
