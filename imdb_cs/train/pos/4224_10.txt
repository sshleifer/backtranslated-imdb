I love this Columba episode. Maybe it's because Ruth Gordon is in it, and she is an amazing successful mysterious writer, Abigail Mitchell, the American version of Lady Agatha Christie. She is great when she looks at how catchy, dear, author who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died in a drowning accident. She blames her niece's nephew, nephew. She plans to kill him to avenge her death because she has left her to the police. I would love someone other than Mariette Hartley to play Veronica. I never like Hartley at all. And, of course, with Columbus, they sometimes ridicule, as if Veronica is questioning her belly dancing class. Ruth Abigail is alone intelligent and she coincides with the conscience with Columbo, who always played greatly Peter Falk.
