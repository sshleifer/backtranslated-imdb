Okay, this movie probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars, but I voted for "10" to help refute misleading ratings from a bunch of bozo who gave this movie zero or one star. Each of these segments for this anthology shows great talent and talents to talented artists, three of which have achieved remarkable success in major Hollywood productions. The performances range from harsh to impressive, with remarkable turnovers Bill Paxton, James Karen, Vivian Schilling and Brion James. Martin Kove can be a great melodramatic psychotic hypnotist with a bizarre stroboscope lamp, and Lance August seems to be deliberately silenced as an unsuspecting laboratory victim. But overall, it's a couple of great laughs and really terrifying moments. It's definitely worth seeing, so judge for yourself!
