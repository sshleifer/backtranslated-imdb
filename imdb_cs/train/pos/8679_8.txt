If you are a fan, you will probably enjoy it. If you do not know who Misty Mundae, Darian Caine, Ruby LaRocca or Seduction Cinema are, it's not a movie that you should start. It's very cute, stupid, the girls are hot and fun to watch. There is no sex until the very end of the 45-minute movie, but the score is deep-trippy and the plot is not a total hole. Misty Mundae is bad in this movie and her hair is in inconvenient cops, so this is not as hot as in others. But her panties are pretty cute (just see the movie so it does not sound really weird). If you like it, you'll probably enjoy "To 70's Girl", "Vampire Vixens" or "Erotic Survivor" (which is a bit more sexually graphic). If you prefer to watch Misty or Esmerelda in less sexual, more horror / exploitative (but lower budget) movies, check out the Factory 2000 website.
