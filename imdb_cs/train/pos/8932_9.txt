The film is not visually stunning in a conventional sense. There is no series of nice pictures. Instead, it's a visually interesting movie. Force the viewer to constantly process or imagine the context of different shots. This kind of thing is easy to try but hard to succeed. The film refuses to use the color of the genre to help the less willing audience get what's going on. Instead, the film touches and moves with several different genres. A film-loving trick can enjoy this playfulness. I suspect that 99% of North American viewers just will not get it. If you are attempting to portray this story, philosophical message or symbolic structure, etc., you will waste time. There are none of them. Film only occasionally to these genres and others. The only unifying force in the movie is that Claire Denis has a sense of what fits together. There are so few feature films that are close to fulfilling Kant's description of what art is, namely, the use of the power of judgment itself, rather than simply incorporating concepts based on concepts. Usually, the film is easier and decides for a simpler enjoyment of understanding what's going on. Most of the film is not art. Most of the film is about art. When the film does what it does, and it is still a pleasant spectator, it's a miracle. My negative commentary is that sometimes I find a movie that is too much for the various narrative fibers that go through. Tahitian father-son of narration, though not quite conventional, eventually makes things a bit clear and simple. Dominance too much.
