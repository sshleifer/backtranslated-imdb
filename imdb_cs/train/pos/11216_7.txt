The story is extremely unique. These are the two pilots that save the country from strange creatures but have to use a special speed that makes everything around them grow fast. The whole series concerns pilots dealing with time wasting, friends and mentors. <br /> <br /> The end of the COULD was fantastic. She started off with the overall down note and left a real mark, but instead she ended up with a super lucky Disney, and it made me very sick. <br /> </ p> <p> The animation is decent for 89, but it can not compare with today. I've also heard many complain about the nudity of nudity. I actually found it to be a bit decent. Nudity was mostly guaranteed, with the exception of episode 2, where there was surplus. <br /> <br /> Overall, it deserves a look, but it keeps it from classic.
