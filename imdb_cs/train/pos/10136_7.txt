This is one of the best episodes of the second season of the MOH, I think Mick Garris has problems with women ... Kills everything, they're often victims (Screwfly, Pro-life, Valerie on the stairs, I do not remember Argento's episode in season 1, etc., Of course Imprint). I think she likes to be careful that women have burned, tortured, crippled, and I do not know. Never "Right to Die" is one of the best, with good maneuvers and graphic scenes and tensions (especially with photos from the cellular scene, wonderful). The game is like a whole series, I could be the worst of regular ones like "Pro-life" or "Screaming for ice cream". I also think it could be done for the movie, not just the episode. The series' ideology is terrible, killing and ending women, animal abuse, and more ... in the first season it was better than the other with episodes such as "Cigarrette burns", "Homecoming", "Imprint" really shocking).
