Dark Angel is a futuristic sci-fi series that originated in post-apocalyptic Seattle and focuses on Max (Jessica Alba), a genetically upgraded young woman running away from her creators. The Dark Angel universe (not Buffy, but absorbs it) with an interesting and credible set of characters. Sure, it's not for everyone, but those who give it time find themselves in one of the most enjoyable shows. Dark Angel is criminally overlooked and underestimated and was unsuccessfully canceled in just two series. Which was a great shame because it had the potential to become a great series, though her 42 episodes are just ten shy long BBC science fiction comedy Red Dwarf. As Dark Angel is left unfinished, look at it, and if you want more, Lobo Fox will do another series.
