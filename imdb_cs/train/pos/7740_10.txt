It is rare that the film strikes a flawless film. It's really one of the most effective, most tightly structured films I've ever seen. Each dialog line can be interpreted in several ways that relate to each of the three main characters differently. The film captures the inner network of motivations and double crosses that capture and refuse to let go. Add to that the slow burning of novels between Kevin and Fay is as mobile as anything ever dedicated to celluloid, and you have ingredients for perfect film. It exposes the romance of movies such as "Titanic" as the trite clich√© that they are. If you're looking for the movie you want to watch while folding, it's not like that. You must sign up for this movie. You can not have an interview when you start and leave the room. This movie requires your attention. Treat with the respect you deserve, and you will get a lot of it. If you think "Titanic" is the biggest movie ever.
