Rohmer expelled from the usual French middle class portraits to tell this costume drama about the difficulties of the aristocratic lady during the French Revolution. What is more attractive to "La Anglaise ..." (apart from the story itself) is the wonderful aesthetics Rohmer has achieved. The images were digitally decorated to look like Baroque paintings. At some point, you can not really say whether you are watching a movie or a series of shots in the Louvre Musseum. Every picture is like a work of art. <br /> <br /> * My number: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ---------
