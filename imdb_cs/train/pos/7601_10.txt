The Lost is unique ... it is so charming and full of tension, excitement and emotion at the same time. I've never seen any TV series like before. It is full of jungle excitement and has a good script. The actors in life have revived the island on the island in such a natural way that I feel lost on the island as I look at it. It is an excellent job narrated in a very intelligent form. The series is like a film depicting life survivors lost on a deserted island. I've been trying to watch one episode for the second and I highly recommend this series for all TV show lovers. Watch it to see the magic lost in nowhere.
