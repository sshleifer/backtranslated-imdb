This movie can be interpreted at many different levels. Do not listen to the other comments that attack the movie and say it's a playable story or not, and it's just drugs. He has very obvious superficial metaphors about drugs; however, the rest of the film (and why I think it was personally made) is not at all about it at all. It's really a mock psychology and conditioning society. It shows for a fraction of a second that the main character's brother is watching this online sick video. Why? My explanation is that it has to be proven that all the damage we are exposed makes it easier for us to be in our professions mechanically than to see people as humans. As for the scene of logic, he also addresses people who were in the federally charged 1% of intelligent classes who are confused and frustrated, because life is not as predictable, mathematical and logical as it may seem at a macroscopic level. You must use the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle (along with all other laws and principles of uncertainty), not only for physics but also for life, and leave room for changing your plans and adaptation. One of the best movies I've ever seen. It could have been over your head; it's not for you, it's for those people who have trouble coping with life that does not work out as a math problem. When you critically analyze a movie or write critical reviews, try to read the back cover first (written by merchants and parapsychologists)
