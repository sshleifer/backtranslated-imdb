It's very handy for all 60 years when we look at the movie. Humor is fairly gentle, but it grew much more than I expected. Cast is first-class and seems to have a great time. Ustinov goes through the filter and mumbles quite funny things under his breath, and that is very unimportant; I buy a movie once it appears on DVD. It seems that Ustinov, as a perpetrator released from prison, presented himself as a computer whip and misappropriated money from an American company with an office in London. Maggie Smith is his secretary for a while and watches it from a lot of different work tasks, it's part of the fun. Bob Newhart is his usual name, and Karl Malden is amused as a dense and dirty executive head of the London office. The end is funny and pretty cynical.
