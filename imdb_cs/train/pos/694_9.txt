Insomniac's nightmare is the story of a man who has plunged into madness. Chronic insomnia, Jack suffers from hallucinations; which causes them to try to find out what is real and what is not. We found interesting things about Jack at the end and we think we will have "happily ever after the end of Hollywood." This is New York City, a place where no one is sleeping Tess Nanavati (writer and director) has a good film in the series "Insomniac's Nightmare", a talented filmmaker and writer (filmed this film right after graduating high school), has real potential and will be watching in the future. <br /> <br /> When I was watching this short film, I was constantly unpleasant, between music, bleak scenery, and the realistic insomniac depiction of Dominic Monaghan (like Jack), I desperately wanted to turn it off sometimes just to get out of it.
