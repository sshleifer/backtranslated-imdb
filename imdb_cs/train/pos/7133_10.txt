Absolute masterpiece of the movie! Goodnight Mr Tom quickly became one of my favorite films of all time. No one should miss this movie, it's just good! Mr.Tom is perfectly portrayed by John Thaw as a harsh old man who becomes a soft father when William Beech (Nick Robinson) was sent to evacuate, almost like the "Mouse of the City and Country Mouse". True heart movie. The director knew exactly how to make the book a movie, and he did it extraordinarily well. The film was so greatly shot that the emotions of the character and what was happening made the audience feel a whole lot of emotions, from love to fear, and these emotions could turn to six pence. In times of turmoil during the Second World War, this film also shows the difference between cities and nature, they are almost like different countries. Absolutely, we must see that those who are not lacking in a really amazing and brilliant film.
