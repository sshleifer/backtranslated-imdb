This is a nice little horror that fans of indie films really appreciate. He has good acting, a lot of gore, and a good conspiracy. One will remind movies like The Hills Have Eyes and Pumpkinhead. Obviously, the budget was not that big, but the movie really does it with the atmosphere and solid performances of actors that seem to be missing in many of today's big budgets with special effects. The film really moves and there's an excellent direction and good camera work. There are no unnecessary scenes, so the length of the movie is a bit short. In addition, it seems that the end leaves the opening for continuation, which would also be very interesting. So grab some popcorn, put off the lights and enjoy it.
