Though it's not as creepy as the classic predecessor (ZOMBI 2), I actually like it. It's because of the faster pace, better setup and soundtrack in the 1980s. It's loaded with action and has sweet gore effects by Lucio Fulci. The zombies do not look as nasty as ZOMBI 2, but they still look good. That was pretty good, but it definitely has its share of cheese; for example, some zombies are moving very slowly, while others are as fast as ninja. some are nasty, while others say funny lines, but who expects consistency when it comes to Italian horror? It's even a flying zombie head! How is this advice? Surely he must see for gorehounds and zombie fans. is likely to satisfy even the majority of action film fans. Also look at Zombie 4.
