I'm 10 out of 10. Why? <br /> <br /> * It offers insight into something I barely understand - surfers surf because it's all they want to do; Nothing else seems to matter like surfing; This is not a temporary thing - it's a life for these guys * Buried in the movie is a great surfing history; I've never surfed but I love surfing movies and seeing a lot. Nobody taught me what this movie was doing * The film was very well adapted. It was good. The interviews were excellent * It's interesting from start to finish <br /> <br /> Overall, it's probably as good as the document I saw, so I have to rate it when it comes to it. So 10/10
