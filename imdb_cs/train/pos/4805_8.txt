when I first heard about this movie, I thought it would be like the Duchess (2008), but when I saw the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria, I knew it would not just be a solid movie. Almost everything in this movie is great, the costumes are really amazing and settings are also beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really left me is the performance. Emily Blunt is the star of the film, bringing Victoria life and with this film she shows she is a great actress and may have chosen her first Oscar nomination for her performance. Rupert Friend is almost like Prince Albert, but he has a great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is as solid as Lord Melbourne, even though I expected more. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson have supportive roles, but they are forgotten. <br /> <br /> The film seems to me unfinished. Perhaps the screenwriters have changed too many things in the script, I do not know, but that's how I feel in the movie. But overall, it's a great movie about early years Victoria with great performance from Emily Blunt.
