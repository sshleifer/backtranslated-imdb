I was lucky to have captured this film during volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival. I've always been a fan of classic horror films and especially the tricks of William's Castle, so it was absolutely necessary for me. It's about the life and work of William Castle, which, in my opinion, was the director of undervaluation. True, he did some cheap cheap movie horror films, but he added something to these films: real theater tricks you no longer see. For example, he had sisters if someone had a heart attack in his movies and put vibrators on the bottom of chairs at THE TINGER. This is a really good documentary and brings this shadowy director into the light and celebrates his contributions to horror film. It also pains the castle as bigger than the life character, which was very popular and had a smile on its face. Unlike most documentaries, which are mostly shown by film historians, SPINE TINGLER! shows interviews mostly from his family members and directors who have been influenced by his work, such as John Waters, John Landis, and Joe Dante. They have to see classical horrors and sci-fi fans.
