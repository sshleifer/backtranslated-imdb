This movie was nice, but for improper reasons. The coordination of action sequences is ridiculous and the film has some funny tattoos. Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson put together an unforgettable scene at the end, where Williamson says Ginty: "You'll surely get around the guy!" I enjoyed the film only for Ginty and Williamson, but not for a story that had to be written on the back of the napkin in four rows, and the rest most liked it. A movie with more than 30 parts has only a credit list for ten. It seems strange that no one else in the movie, maybe they had a look at how the final product would look like. The only thing this movie does is that he's quite violent, so he's tripled with Fred Williamson and Robert Ginty for a movie that's worth seeing.
