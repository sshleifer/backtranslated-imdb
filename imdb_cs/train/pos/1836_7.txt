Time for a Hit! Waqt Dir - Amritlal Shah Cast - Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Shefali Shah, Rajpal Yadav and Boman Irani. Posted by Aatish Kapadia Rating- *** <br /> <br /> Eureka! We have it! Yes, ladies and gentlemen at Vipul Shahu "Waqt", we have probably found this year's first bona fide hit. Filled with all the necessary ingredients of Bollywood's commercial fare, 'Waqt' has everything he needs for a movie to hit with an Indian audience. It's such a film that makes the distributor feel happy and is considering his next visit to the Phoenix! In this "series of Indian emotions" then we have a happy family (not always?) Of the three. Ishwar (Amitabh Bachchan), a post-millionaire postman (do not ask how ... is something about selling toys while delivering letters and all that seriously - who is damned!), Married to Sumi (Shefali Shah) is father of father Adityy (Akshay Kumar). Ishwar has to make a serious decision about his son's careless approach to life's responsibility. His love for Aditya, however, leads to his opposition to the grave. However, when faced with a situation that will test his race against time, Ishwar has no alternative but to take Adityy out of the house - and hopes the new situation could make him more conscientious. This anticipated solution, however, in itself becomes a problem as the rupture between the loving father and the son rises, and the fences are still growing. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such a story provides ample opportunity to fulfill comedy and drama. So before the interval there is a funny, later unpleasant comedy by Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav; and a post-interval is to go to your moments of a scarf between Aby and Akki! Writer Aatish Kapadia (he also wrote the original Gujarati game "Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu" on which the film is based) makes a good job of keeping the narrative fluid. Dialogues are sometimes inconsistent. It does not help the songs appear as acne on the teenage face and are disturbed. Obviously, a couple of numbers could be removed. On the steering queue, Vipul shows that he has a natural taste for telling stories. "Waqt", as well as his earlier debut effort "Aankhen", managed to keep interest until the last reel. On a personal note - the swing of emotions was a bit bitter for me. But based on the reactions of the audience, he works on the handle. Finally, "Waqt" is about its performances that reach one whole in the overall rating! Amitabh Bachchan is as reliable as ever. His energy is visible and so is his age! Shefali playground in a finely staged performance and struggles with the superstar at every turn. Boman and Rajpal bring their house with their history. Priyanka has little to do to fill the superficial role of the heroine. When everything slows down, "Waqt" is Akshay's car. I've always said that Akki is as good as his role. Put it in "Mujhse Shaadi Karogi" and it's fantastic, but in "Bewafaa" it's badly bad. Here Akki is probably the best. Whether it's his comedy timing or his emotional rendering, he's almost perfect. There is also an action scene for your fans! Ironically, his previous best effort was in 'Aankhen' - with the same director and Big B on his side! ' Waqt 'is by no means an unforgettable film. It is not the one that would appear in the better films of our industry. But it is for the masses. And at a time when the industry is desperately waiting for a universal hit, Waqt can just make a trick! Abhishek Bandekar Trivia - This is the second Akshay Kumar concert film after "Bewafaa," in which he performs on stage during the climax! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> April 22, 2005
