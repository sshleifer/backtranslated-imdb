Maybe it's me and my perverse ways or the fact that I have a very bad mind, but I accidentally rented the film for a very weird night, and I enjoyed my great surprise. <br /> <br /> Yes, I read a synopsis on the back of the DVD Box and read that it's forbidden for 25 years and I thought I was ready for something to offer it. I was clearly disappointed after seeing ... well ... everything to cut a long story. I see why it was forbidden, not just for such sexual scenes, but for bliss. <br /> <br /> Of course, because it is loosely based on the classic fairy tales Beauty and the Beast, my personal favorite, tells the story of the sexual awakening of the girl over the dream of persecuting the Duchess anything co-hell-that-thing-was-like beast with a huge erection and a significant part of ejaculation. Of course, the beast gets what she wants, and the duchess decides she likes them and they're still moving in the woods. <br /> <br /> But that's not all. Oh, there is much more! <br /> <br /> Not only do we look at special sex, but also on a swinging horse, a watchman who slams and dies with a slave when he does not move on the bed to get her ... satisfaction and maiden day masturbation with rose petals. <br /> <br /> Creative and pleasant, but it took a while for my father to talk to me again after watching it after I went to bed ... I was 15. Words of advice while watching this movie : Make sure you are the only one who knows you have it and watch it with closed curtains. It may be fun, but I doubt there are other pornographic movies like this one.
