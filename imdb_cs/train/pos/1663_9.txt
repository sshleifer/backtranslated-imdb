Every moment of this beautiful movie I enjoyed and I was impressed by this female painter I had never heard of before. So I went to explore her life and work later. As you can expect, I found out that the film was not accurately accurate. But I was a little overwhelmed by the very negative comments on the film due to this inaccuracy. Come on, boys, the film is not and should not be a biography (not a novel!). Every historical film distorts reality, because it should be an artwork in itself. The film director is fully entitled to use elements from reality and history to create his own world. Artemisie is a wonderful film, and I think it has brought many people (including some who now give negative comments) to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist.
