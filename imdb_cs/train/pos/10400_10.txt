Probably the best film ever made. Top color, spectacular series, unbelievable, Miklos Rosza score point that is perfect for every scene and mood. Acting is also excellent in what could be hard and demanding in smaller hands, but here the poetic dialogue is meaningful, sensitive (humor is also gentle and gorgeous). <br /> <br /> Doubtless Spielberg and Lucas were enchanted by this. Together with "The Four Feathers" (1939), one of Alexander Korda's best films and London movies - and one of the best films ever made. classical!
