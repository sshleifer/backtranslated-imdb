A funny musical, where Nathan Detroit needs $ 1,000.00 to get into an exciting game, and attracts Sky Masterson to try to get the salvation of an army girl played by Jean Simmons to go with Masterson to Havana. Five years later, Simmons would again be in a mission mission in the magnificent "Elmer Gantry". There was Sister Sharon, and here is Sister Sarah. Same temperament, another story. Frank Sinatra is the devil Nathan Detroit. He has been dealing with Vivian Blaine for 14 years and she is devoting his habit to habit. In a real change of speed, Sky Masterson played Marlon Brando who actually did his own singing here! <Br /> <br /> The film is rescued by superlative choreography. Those dance and singing routines are wonderful. Stubby Kay is particularly well aware of him as pretty (Johnson). Overall, it's a very nice production.
