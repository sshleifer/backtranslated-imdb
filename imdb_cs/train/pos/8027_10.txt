When I saw it for the first time, I was really impressed. The director made such a mysterious atmosphere, especially in the end. All the story audiences can expect Richard to actually kill Thomas, or he will do it first. But the main point was not a conflict, but ... REFEREE! The elder and the mature prayed to save a young man who lives all his life. It's amazing. Every time I look at it, I like it! Of course, it's really violent like any action movie, but I think it's acceptable. Thanks so much to Louis Liose and Tom Berenger! Amazing film! I encourage all to see it. I'm sure people will not regret and will have a really good time.
