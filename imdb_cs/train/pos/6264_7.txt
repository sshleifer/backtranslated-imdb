Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack have created a document of 50,000 Bakhtiari and their animals on summer migration for winter pasture. The basic value of today's film is like the time capsule of "forgotten people" and how they lived during what we knew in the West as "disturbing twenties". It was impossible to imagine a drastic contrast. The furious river and bare mountain ranges are brutally realistic, and animals that disappear underwater will actually die. To make sure that the audience of time believed that the story was taking place, a signed certificate of authenticity is offered at the end. The version I saw had fascinating Iranian music that can stand alone and appreciate without a movie. After all, the film is probably much larger for an anthropologist than for an occasional spectator looking for good entertainment. The crew barely had enough stock to capture the pictures they recorded, and there is no imaginative work with the camera that would result from several repetitions. The Western Inter-Titles reflect from experience, but they are actually part of the record as they demonstrate how Hollywood has sought to turn its lives into the lives of indigenous people to be valued by today's audience. The dysfunctional fun of the desert police is becoming a "policeman ball". Producers continued in documentary drama Chang (1927) and Commercial King Kong (1933). The subject of migration is again used in Wind Wind (1976) and the Himalayas (1999). We recommend to those who know in advance what they will get - and then they are highly recommended.
