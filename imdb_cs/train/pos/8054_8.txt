"Enter the Fat Dragon" is one of the most entertaining martial arts films I've ever seen. Sammo Hung shows Chinese farm boy to visit my friend. Just like Tang Lung of "The Dragon Path." Where Sammo goes, trouble begins, so he has to rely on his martial arts skills to solve the differences. Fortunately, Sammo's character learns martial arts by imitating and imitating his idol, Bruce Lee. He even stretches his nose exactly as Bruce Lee does, and he also frees his shouting cry. He also uses nunchucks in the scene. It was like watching a fat Bruce Lee. Close to the end of the movie is a great showdown, which consists of foreign fighters. Sammo must meet each opponent one by one. Something like "The Death of Death," where each fighter possesses a different martial arts discipline apart. <br /> <br /> This is one of the films I really like to watch, and the first Sammo Hung I movie I've seen. Outstanding combat scenes and lots of laughter. Rare classic Sammo Hung film I recommend all martial arts fans. 8.5 / 10!
