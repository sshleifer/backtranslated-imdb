Before I saw it, I was postponed, but it is not your average triumph over the story of the adversity. Although it is technically about blind Tibetan children climbing Mt. Everest, there's so much more. This film shows very strong, often contradictory figures of two highly successful blind adults who led children, Erika and Sabriye. Erik is an American blind climber and athlete, and Sabriye is a blind German academician who founded a school in Lhasa, Tibet. Both are exceptionally in their own way, but they disagree with what really builds trust in children. Erik wants them to get to the top while Sabriye wants to enjoy Erika as a formula and immediately enjoy the joy. Nuances are complicated, and one leaves without being sure who is right or if the whole climb was a mistake or a great idea. The deepest scenes are the Tibetan children themselves and the difficulties they faced before going to school. I was most interested in the story of Tashi, a fragile teenager who grew up on the street after his parents left him. I could watch the whole film about his life, and I like to learn that he is already doing a successful business with some of his classmates. If you like Spellbound or Murderball, you'll like it.
