In the near future, an ordinary person is hired by any Morgan Sullivan suspect (Jeremy Northam) to Digicorp, a huge company to be assigned as a spy and steal a secret from its Sunways competitors. During the training, Morgan is brainwashed, takes on the new identity of Jack Thursby and travels to boring lectures. One of them is addressed by the beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster (Lucy Liu) who tells him that there is nothing like that. Morgan recognizes a new reality where he does not know who can be trusted. The unknown "Cypher" was a great surprise for me. This movie was not released in Brazil, but the exciting and exciting story is quite complex, it has lots of points, with a big screenplay, direction and performances. In the last step, I remembered Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Total Recall". This film deserves to be watched more times and I really did not like the last scene when an independent spy has a disputed disc in the sea. I only know director Vicenzo Natali from the fantastic "Cube" and this second job I see is also amazing. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): Not available
