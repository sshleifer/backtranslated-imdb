My left dog is, in my opinion, a great biopic about one of the most talented authors and painters in the world. The show broke down, the soundtrack was great and the casting was perfect. I thought Christy (Daniel Day-Lewis) was a very talented person, even though I did not know what he was saying most of the time. Besides, when I threw tantrum, I'm a little scared. It's also so sad that he suffered from cerebral palsy. Finally, if you are a nice Daniel Day-Lewis fan or as a biopic, I recommend this great biopic about one of the most talented authors and painters in the world. You are in a real experience and in good time, so do not miss this.
