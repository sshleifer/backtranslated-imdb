Jörg Buttgereit goes a long way with his films and themes occasionally, even for my taste, but his films are always something special and difficult to classify. They are artistically created and often have a deeper meaning for their motifs. This film is a perfect example of his work. <br /> <br /> It is also really hard to mark this movie. It's not really a movie with a story, in the sense that it has a beginning, a medium and an end. It also does not have the main character, but instead focuses on 7 different suicides and killing on 7 different days. All different stories are spoken with many classes, although some of them are of course more "interesting" and realistic than others. They are not necessarily linked, but they still tell the story. The film does not feel unconnected at all. All the different stories have a different feel, and Buttgereit tells the story without even using words (also typical of his style), but instead leaves the pictures and obvious sensible emotions of characters telling the whole story. It helps to make this film an effective piece of work. <br /> <br /> Again, all production values ​​are not too high and it could be something that could scare some people. It helps the film to set the right tone and atmosphere of the film and its dark, disturbing and depressing motives. Buttgereit, which I liked. <br /> <br /> <br /> 7/10
