"Matador" star Pierce Brosnan as a burned-out murderer. He's James Bond off on the seed, in too tight, deep dresses, gold chains and ugly hairstyle. Our fighting killer, Julian Noble, is in Mexico and tries to regain his nerves. Staying at the same hotel is a decent, happy businessman Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) who is also trying to get his balance. Danny is desperate to make a deal and return to his wife in Denver (Hope Davis) with good news. Noble and Wright became unexpectedly friends. Wright convinces Noble to reveal certain techniques he demonstrates in fighting bulls. Noble finally focuses on employers and appears in Denver. Writer and director Richard Shepard made Q & A after this wonderful film at the Austin Film Festival. Shepard was also lucky. After losing his agent and rejecting recent scenarios, he decided to write a story that nobody could buy and create a character nobody wanted to play. Then he called Pierce Brosnan. Brosnan regains balance in this film. (It's Life After Bond!) She has a wonderful taste for a suicidal comedy. Do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Stay on the final credits to read what the filmmakers say about bullfighting. I look forward to Richard Shepard's other projects.
