Ko to tamo peva is the best comedy of all time. Believe me, I've seen a lot of movies and comedies, but tell me which of you will smile at you every time you watch. But the truth is that humor in this comedy is strange. It is for sericulture serbia. And all the former republics of Yugoslavia know it very well! So I think other audiences (like: In Europe) do not like it so much. Because the subtitles destroy a hole. But they should try at least !!! Yes, that's ironic! This is the best story in Serbian history and the world does not understand! :-) If you have a chance to see this, do not blow up OK!
