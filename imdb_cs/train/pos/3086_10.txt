Here Italy (I write from Venice). Why is it canceled? ABC should give her a chance to build an audience. Cast (with Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Eric Christensen, Zoe Saldanou, Jay Hernandez and Bridge Moynahan) is one of the best I've ever seen. We need more such shows that make viewers feel like intelligent individuals who have no soulless drones. I hope the ABC will reconsider its decision or another station will pick it up.
