This film is based on the art of Frank Frazetty, a mythical fantasy illustrator. Some of the characters are directly from his paintings (Death Dealer is the best example). Surprisingly, animation will keep the feeling of original art. Bakshi is well known for his heavy use of rotoscope (a technique of watching live action sequences) and this film is no exception. However, since the subject of the film is quite realistic (all characters are people), it works quite well. <br /> <br /> But what I really like is a plot: for once we have a story with interesting characters and nice action sequences, a really terrible villain and a beautiful child. This movie has the feeling of the best comedians Conan, not surprising because Roy Thomas is the writer of the Marvel series from our favorite Cimmerian! It's far from crunchy live Conan action, not to mention all the B-movie genre. We definitely recommend!
