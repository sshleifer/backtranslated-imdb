This film takes you so deeply into two main characters. I pushed him into my notebook without reading an envelope (let alone a review), and he was taken with two good hours. Two lost ships from two different worlds collide. The sexual tension between the secretary and the criminal is almost tangible even without physical contact. At the end I could not decide what I wanted more: our hero and the heroine to pull out the capers or simply the perfect passion. RML could do it without a wonderful subplot and the traditional 100 minutes would be enough. But I am disgusting. After the series of Netflix, Blockbuster and local libraries, this movie has restored its belief in great filmmaking.
