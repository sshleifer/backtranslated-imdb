Sidney Stratton has difficulty maintaining jobs in various textile factories, mainly for experimenting in textile laboratories. Stratton is experimenting on a formula for a new substance that would create the finest substance that never gets dirty, never avoided or depleted. When Stratton finally creates a fabric, he creates enemies in all the textile workers (who lose their jobs) and the owners (who lose money because one mill has exclusive rights), so Stratton in his white suit becomes Britain's most loved man. The film is perfect, and it's just what Ealing did. Guinness's performance (and great support like Greenwood, Thesiger and Parker) and Mackendrick's direction makes the film joy, but the real hero is the story itself, a nice satire in business and industry with other elements of drama, romance and tension. Rating, 8.
