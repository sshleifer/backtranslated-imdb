"It was not me, it was my brother Rupert!" Bobby tells Dugan when he is confronted with being in Sally's place. I've used this line a dozen times over the years (no one has ever believed it). This movie is one of the best times for fun and disbelief. Steven Oliver was perfect for Dugan, so in 1978 he was "Malibu Beach" as the same figure (not nearly as much time on the screen, though). "No one called Dugan shit!" is another sentence for ages. This classic movie is definitely worth the price.
