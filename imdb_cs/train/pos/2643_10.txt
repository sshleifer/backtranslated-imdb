I really can not say too much about the plot of the film that has not been said yet. I did not see the movie in about 25 years, and the memory of it never left me. I've been looking for it anywhere. I've done a clean search in the past, but I'm empty. Last night I thought about the movie again and tried to remember who was in it but I was only about 10 or 12 when I last saw and I was not sure if I had the correct movie name so I decided to do another searching and finally I found this view. I was right. If anyone knows where I can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with my family, could you please leave me at tawnyteel@yahoo.com, I really would realize it. And to anyone who has not seen this movie and has a chance it's worth it.
