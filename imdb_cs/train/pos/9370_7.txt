I've never heard of this movie before I saw it, I was wondering if it was an independent film and I was right, but with good occupation, I decided it would be a coincidence. In fact, drifter, Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in Red Rock, Wyoming, is looking for a job and meets bar owner Wayne Brown (Pleasantville JT Walsh), receives a large sum of money, confuses himself with the man he has hired to kill Sister Lara Flynn Boyle. He does not repair him, he takes the money and goes to warn Suzanna and, after being contradictory, decides he needs to leave. When Wayne knows his true identity, Michael plays a big pistol until he gets in the car with Lyle of Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realizes that Lyle is the hit-man he's wrong with and makes a quick stop. They return to Suzanne and know they are both in danger, they plan to leave town and add more complications by falling together. Before leaving, Suzanne insists that they go and steal a lot of money in the vault. Of course things will not go smoothly and Wayne and Lyle catch them, and Lyle makes them, and Wayne is now bound to go and get the money to be buried. Eventually, Lyle and Wayne get what they deserve, Michael and Suzanne get on the moving train together, but it's obvious that they care about the money and get what they deserve. Also starring Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as Deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. Performances, except maybe Boyle Boyle, are fine and dandy, and it has a pretty good movie noir feeling for the black comedy thriller. Very good!
