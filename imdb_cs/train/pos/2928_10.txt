EDDIE MURPHY DELIRIOUS is perhaps the most entertaining contrast film I've ever seen. Most stand-up events are usually quiet but not this. In 90 minutes, there is no moment that would not be laterally detachable. From the moment Eddie makes a funny dead impression of Mr.T, laughter is continuous. Unfortunately it was in 1983 and Eddie did not do anything so sad. it is unbelievable that the one who wrote this phenomenally brilliant show wrote a film called HARLEM NIGHTS, which was not fun at all. Eddie, if you're out, please go back and the concert of the movie in DELIRIOUS. Believe me, your fans will love you. And I think you know that.
