Damn ... this show was fine and today is still shooting cartoon. I can not wait to find some DVDs to share it with my little guy and see the same sparkle in his eyes. I've already introduced him to Voltron (5 lions, not the 15 vehicles) and I laughed when he said someday: "Dad ... you've been watching some amazing cartoons when you were a kid!" How cool is it? . <br /> <br /> Come on Hollywood, empty this and make a live hit. It would be no worse than Spiderman 3 ... Man oh man ... 2007 was pretty nice for summer movies. <br /> <br /> OK, I'll be horrified now <br /> </
