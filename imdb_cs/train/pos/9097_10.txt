I gave this film such a high mark because it was really cute, really fun, though it was unpretentious. I went to see this movie when playing in the Philly area and it was a great evening with friends. The film is well written and effective, and although it feels a bit like a sitcom, it's like a movie that will not be removed from the movie. You just can not find such comedy as it is where you do not have to shock people to be funny. The film centers around a Ukrainian housewife trying to work for a young couple who needs help. Although it first assists, it will soon bring more foolishness to their lives, after which a couple are negotiating. Things will go on and on out of control until ... you have to see! I was laughing to laugh even after leaving the theater. This movie just gave me a good mood. I can not wait to be released on DVD because I want this movie in my collection.
