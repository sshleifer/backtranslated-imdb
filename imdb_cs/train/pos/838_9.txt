*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott, Philip Baker Hall. Director Richard Shepard. A well-done story and a film all together, Brosnan has never been better in a movie role outside his "Bond" films. After 2004, "After Sunset", his latest role brings laughter and great time. The professional hit-man, so to speak, Julian Noble to work in Mexico City's wind, met exactly the opposite of himself tall string businessman Danny Wright (Kinnear, perhaps one of his best roles) also on the business there. The two duo on the screen produce a comically charged, funny revolt and do not get laugh. Davis in one of the best roles since "American Splendor" gives another charming and funny performance. One of the best and best movies. My final rating 9/10
