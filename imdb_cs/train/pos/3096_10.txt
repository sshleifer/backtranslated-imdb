Six degrees occurred to me. I was looking forward to coming and was completely disappointed when the men in the trees had replaced their time. I thought it was just a break and it would be early in 2007. What happened? All my friends were really surprised that it was over. We could connect with characters who had real problems. We talked about each episode and had our favorite characters. At a show I did not like, there was nobody and he felt that acting was great. I have always seen programs that are recorded in cities where you can identify local areas. I would like to protest against the cancellation of this exhibition and ask you to return it and give it another chance. Give her a good time, do not move from this day to this day and advertise it so that people know it is.
