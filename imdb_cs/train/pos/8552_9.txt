This is by far one of my favorite American cakes, especially because in most others the main character (one of the young Stiflers) is always unrealistic. <br /> <br /> For example, AP: Naked Mile. You have a teenage man surrounded by naked girls from colleges and has one particularly hot on his path to get rid of his "problem" of virginity and he ends up stopping the middle night and rides the horses to sleep with his girlfriend holding his mind gave him a weekend "a free visa ". I can appreciate the romantic aspect of the whole thing, but be realistic; most people who watch these movies are not primarily a romantic story. While the freshest lot eventually seems to be aware of who the audience is and the good old Erik Stifler seems to wake up and smell the roses and as always Mr. Levenstein sells his "perfectly natural" humorous eyebrows equation and records a landing with this new film.
