Fortunately, as a student, I've been studying "Diagnostic Murder" for several years. Basically, he is a doctor who deals with murder through his son LAPD, a young doctor and a pathologist. DM provided 8 periods of exceptional entertainment. What was different from many other police shows and which many times saw was its cast and quality of writing. The main actor has done good performances and Dick Van Dyke's entertainers roots shone through magic, dance and humor. The best aspect of DM was fast pace, funny scripts and, of course, the top score. Unfortunately it was unjust compared to "Murder, She wrote". DM is far superior and can deal with more difficult mysteries and varieties. Now it's gone TV is a worse place. Gone are days of honest, family friendly police shows. Now they are just depressing "harsh".
