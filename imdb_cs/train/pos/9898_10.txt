My rating of 10/10 is just a fun factor, and you are supposed to have decided that you liked "Slaughter High" before watching it. Yes, it's a typical revenge - a few years after a dirty story, but how do you dislike some of the stuff that's going on here? I could not predict that the war scene in a million years. Okay, so maybe we could be cynical and say that this film does not offer anything new. Well, it does not pretend. It's such a movie that probably watched the characters in "Scream" and contributed to their rules of surviving horror film. After all, who does not want to watch people suffer from doing these things? Obviously, he has a reactionary undertone because people are punished for doing what the 1960s have been pushing for. Yet you have to love this thing! So, with Don McLean's justification, this clown did not sing King and Queen!
