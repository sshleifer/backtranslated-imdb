Several factors make it easy for me to say that I still think it's the most important sci-fi movie ever shot, though it was some kind of acting, outdated dialogue, etc. <br /> <br /> First, the imagination in the description Krell, the humanoid race of the original planet, now all the dead, who were 1 million years more advanced than the humans on Earth and their technology, especially machines weighing 8,000 cubic kilometers. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there are musical and sound effects that are inseparable from each other. It creates a terrible supernatural feeling, unlike "2001", which has traditional classical music. Thirdly, his "monster" is not only the most powerful and humblest ever introduced, it is also based on real science and does not violate the laws of physics and biology. Finally, and most importantly, the Forbidden Planet is the only film ever made, which attempts and incredibly succeeds in making a fair, intelligent and ruthlessly logical statement about the limits or the ceiling of human development (or any other biological subject) regardless of how long we will survive as a species. In other words, he predicts our inevitable destiny.
