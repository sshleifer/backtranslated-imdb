I work in a movie store and as such I've always been looking for a great movie. I decided to explore Nothing like sitting in the Canadian section and trying to support the film industry of my country. I was surprised. The film features David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a very fun story that looks like he's immersed in so many of our minds and relationships ... without working hard. It's always comic through the interaction of both characters, as well as some fun exchanges ("We can not be dead, we have a cable!"). What else can I say without noticing that it is worth the shot, even if you leave it during the first half hour.
