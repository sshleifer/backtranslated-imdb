*** SPOILS *** Zach Provo, James Coburn, has passed through the hatred and revenge of half of the breed, spent the last 11 years on a chain gang that planned to escape. What Provo wants more than freedom is even a score with a man who captured him and during a wild shootout killed his wife Navajo: Former sheriff from Pima Sam Burgada County, Charlton Heston. <br /> <br /> Running his flight after killing two prisoners Provo leads to Yuma knowing that it's not just the place where Burgade lives, but also where his young daughter, Susan Barbara Hershey, lives. By using his fellow prisoners he escaped convicts to attract Burgundy into the vast desert of Arizona, and promising them $ 30,000 in the gold coins that he enveloped here, Provo plans his bloody revenge on Burgade. But only after he testifies that his daughter is brutally raped by his colleagues convicted or is when he is not a woman with a year as horny as a rabbit at the time of mating! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston, as Sam Burgad in his felling, was somehow responsible for killing Provo's wife, and then had to face the fact that the same thing could well happen to her daughter Susan is perfect as an aging and retiring sheriff. Charles Coburn as the vengeful half of the Zach Provo breed is also in his best position as an obsessive hatred and the murder escaped the convicted. The man who has fled Provo is really not interested in his personal affairs but has no choice but to know the territory as the back of his hand but to go with him. It's just the idea that they have a way with Susan when Provo gives them green light, just like a funeral $ 30,000 in gold coins that prevents them from breaking and making their own way. along with Burgada is Susan's friend Hal Brickman, Chris Mitchum, who finally proved he was as good as Burgade, who felt he was simply not in him, both in watching the kidnappers of the criminal, and in using common sense, which in this the case of Burgade lacks when it does. *** SPOILERS **** An incredibly brutal and bloody showdown between Burgade and Provo is almost too much to sit down. The Provo, who hated Burgado, bordering on true madness, wanted to suffer a slow and unbearable death. that was the hatred that Bugrade used, and after taking a few five dozen balls, he ended up crazy and blood thirsty, just like a soulless, crazy away for good!
