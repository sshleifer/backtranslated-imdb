I did not expect too much for this film, which surprised me. The story is sometimes a bit weird, but overall I think it has acceptable credibility. Action scenes are rather nice, and accompanying music is used to evoke a bit of patriotic feelings to American films. Perhaps this is not the best film ever, but Sweden is unusual and I hope we will meet more similar ones in the future.
