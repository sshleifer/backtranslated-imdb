New York, I Love You is a collective work of eleven short films, with each segment running for about 10 minutes. Shorts do not apply exactly, but they all have something in common, love. Every short one is about finding love, whether it's a couple or just two foreigners who want to play. Starring the cast, including Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricci, Irrfan Khan, Robin Wright Penn, Julie Christie, Ethan Hawke, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson and Anton Yelchin. With such stellar occupation and such an interesting premise, I was expecting a huge film; The problem is in New York that I love you do not. It still remains the sum of its parts. Some segments are fun, original and interesting, but others are so absurd (Orlando Bloom / Christina Ricci and Ethan Hawke / Maggie Q segments) that it's terrifying. The film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone. Story-wise, it seems that something that would bring together several students of the film. After the film has some great moments, one of the best is the old couple segment, played by Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman, walking in Brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary. And these are moments that have made me a viewer, I wish the film was much more consistent because there is plenty of potential. But as dissatisfaction, as the whole story ends, for me, cinematography and soundtrack saved everything. Editing was perfect, filming was a very impressive and ethereal soundtrack, it could not be more appropriate. In the end, New York I Love You feels like an experimental film and, as in most experiences, there are the highest and lowest values. It's like watching a movie as a whole, who decides whether he likes it or not. It could be useful for some and waste time for others. <br /> <br /> 7/10
