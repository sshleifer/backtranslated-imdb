This film is about a man who was too interested in conventional success, trying to keep up the mobile, working hard to be proud of his own home. He assumes that it's all for life until he happens to be dancing, all because he wants to look closer to the beautiful girl he sees every day in a dance studio as he goes to the subway on his way home. <br /> <br /> She first started talking to her, going to the dance class to pray, but eventually he went and danced. In the end, he reveals that there is a lot of life to make up for. There is a set of oddball characters also to learn in the studio, giving the movie a lot of laughter and some sense of connection between the depressed. There is also a revelation of various characters, including the girl he admired at first and gave them some depth by showing their damaged past and their endeavor to overcome it. Dance also played with great competition at the end, but it's not the usual story that our unsuccessful win goes upstairs. Instead there are downfalls, revelations and redemptions. It all makes it a moving and entertaining movie.
