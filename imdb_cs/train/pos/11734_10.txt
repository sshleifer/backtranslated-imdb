It must be one of my favorite movies, unlike the weak "Haunted Hills Elvira" ... I still love the way the goth / com 'Wizard of Oz' movie ... <br /> <br /> Elvira is goth Dorothy, who after the death of Good Morning Sorcerer (Elviras Aunt Morgana) in an unknown town ... inherits the "Ruby" Ring, which is extremely strong and sought after by Bad Wearkem (Uncle). Spin four characters that inadvertently help to grow throughout the dog's long-distance movie. There is a show with her uncle (evil wizard of the West), where Elvira realizes that she has the power inside her and eventually defeats him. Eventually, it drops off urban people after winning their hearts and eventually gets to the Las Vegas destination (Dorothy's home in Kansas). There are many references to a guide from oz movie ... she and her uncle both quote lines relevant to their parallel characters. Elvira: "You must be Aunt Em, and you must be Uncle Remus ... There is no place like home, no place like home!" Bad Uncle Vinny: "I'll get you your beautiful and your little dog!" There is a mark that Elvira will pass when she first appeared on the road that mentioned the state of Kansas. /> <br /> But besides, the fact that one of the sequences that "ripped, um ... I think she was inspired by flashdance" is pure genius ... and if you do not turn around laughing her titties are spinning at the end of her "Very 80" Las Vegas show then you do not have camp bones in your body ... This movie is Cult / Camp Classic
