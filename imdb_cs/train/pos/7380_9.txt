The three main characters are very well portrayed, especially by Anisio rock musician, who became the first acting actor, Paulo Miklos. He is extremely persuasive as he was a lower striker / striker. The film shows very well the effect of the snowball on engaging in ever darker shops, contrast and similarity between lower and upper classes. As they all escape from greed and ambition. 9-9,5 of 10.
