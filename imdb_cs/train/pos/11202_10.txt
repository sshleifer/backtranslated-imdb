At first I thought the ring would be more than a normal film with its common conspiracy. How am I surprised? Of course, the story is simple - one girl is in love with two men - but Hitchcock brings her to a silver bowl, laughing and fearing, with compassion and anxiety. The way the popular crowds of the fair show, the strength of the attraction of the girl to both men, the tragic elements that combine with the techniques that open the mind to most of their greatest films (north of the northwest, a rope, etc.). Master did it great thirty years ago!
