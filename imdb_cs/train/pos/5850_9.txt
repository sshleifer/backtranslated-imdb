It's been 16 years since it's an original run, and I hope that sometimes a "marketing wizard" has already released a live actress version of this classic or at least tried to re-release the original 65 episodes. I can not understand why this science fiction or cartoon has not escaped. The Galaxy Rangers actually had well-thought-out drawings and even better scenarios. Animation was an above average quality for the time and excellent compared to the spoken presentation of today's Japanese animation. This was preceded by a heavy toon-toy tie on the market, it may have sealed it's doom too. I will willingly spend money on a DVD GR, if available.
