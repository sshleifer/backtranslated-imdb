I would not dare say that this movie is better than the original, but it is very good. The comedy in this movie is just as good as the original, but there are so many scenes that make me laugh just about thinking about them. The story in this movie is even more bizarre than the original, but that's what's so great. Peter Hewitt does a great job of managing the film with great engagement. The core of the original film returns to their characters in this film and they all do fantastic work with their roles. I do not care what someone says, I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor! I really liked his portrait of Ted in both of these films, just like Bill Winter. I was very glad that George Carlin returned to Rufo, very cool! Hal London Jr, who plays Ted Logan's role, does a really good job. The scene in which Ted owns his body of fathers and Hal London Jr begins to act as Ted's a great scene, and he pulls out impressively well. I can not forget the mention of William Sadler as Death, he completely made the film for me. The rest of the cast is also quite good. If you liked the first installment of the Bill and Ted series, then I would hope that you would like this movie as well. But do not expect it to be as good as the original. I really hope you like the movie, thank you for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
