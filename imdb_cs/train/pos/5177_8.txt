I saw it last night after I have not seen it for years. It's a really fun little movie, with lots of faces you did not know were in it. Arkin shines as usual. Look at it; you will not be disappointed. By the way, it was just released on a DVD and, unlike its packaging, it is widescreen. The conversion is rather bad, but at least the entire movie is visible. ;-)
