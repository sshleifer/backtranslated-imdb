A great screenplay and some of the best actors the world has ever produced. Montand makes the concept of a police detective a "lone wolf" a whole new dimension of intensity and, above all, credibility. When a typical Hollywood cop hero loses his family, friends and pets to murder, he usually gives his minute of grief. But, after sixty seconds, he gripped, wrapped himself in a gun, and gladly took his enemies one by one. However, Marc Ferrot's Montandy is really destroyed - by murdering her friend, of course, but also by finding out that she has another lover. In his confusion and anger he does not seek revenge, but he has to go on looking for a real crime perpetrator, where his fingerprints are on the whole scene. So all his actions become inevitably logical. This is the main reason why this film sticks to our seats, but certainly not only.
