Burlinson and Thornton give excellent performance in this film together with Dennyhym. Though it first seems to be just about love, it really goes deeper than that. The beauty of nature captures this film and ranks among the best I've ever seen. Horse scenes are absolutely fantastic! Every horse lover will love this movie! <br /> <br />
