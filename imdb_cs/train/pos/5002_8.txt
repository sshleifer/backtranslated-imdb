I was privileged to have seen some excerpts from the original run of this show in the UK. It was always fun and always fun. None of the charm was lost in translation - it's as fresh as the people they are asking - whether it's written or not, as they say, besides. It's always fun. Aardman Animations shows a great imagination in the characters used for each voice, the only aspect I most likely love about the show and its concept (pandas hostility, needle-fearing porcupines, painter's monkeys). Regularly grow up, such as the teenage horse and Maryland donkey, most of the spouses (parrots, insects and cats that are just a few) and a child's voice, and I really came to kick the ferret! Monday finally becomes the day you can look forward to.
