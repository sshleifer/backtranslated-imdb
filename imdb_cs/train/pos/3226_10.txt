I do not remember the film's cinematography. I only saw it when he came to the cable. The film is devoted to dehumanizing children into murderous machines. In particular, one person, the way he gets to the place and throws (literally) into an out-of-world community, where he finds himself unable to cope with who really is and what he feels. It seems that many people expect Rambo to be in the universe, and I would be happy if it were. I'm happy it was not - Kurt does a great job of showing emotional cripples. The scene on which it sits outside the folder shows it, even though the decision of two slow repetitions worsens the moment. <br /> <br /> This is not a classic SF movie in the way Bladerunner, Alien, Silent Run, Logan's Run or THX1138 was, but it's unfortunately the closest thing I've seen for a long time. He changed the movie to a credible degree, did not make Arnie an insert, he does not become Snake Plissken and there is no definitive happy ending. That's why this movie did not do well. It does not touch the pattern and it is unforgivable for the 18-25 year-old American audience, as it was, was not what they expected. <br /> <br /> Fear and discipline. <br /> <br /> Always.
