I loved Dan in real life. A fabulous story of love for a journey of love like you got mail or slept but not ridiculously full of glance and rough jokes and not so romantic that they want to throw you away. <br /> <br /> Dan Burns (Steven Carrell) is a popular advisor who can not seem to be in a position to balance things in his own life. Until one day, she meets Maria and Julia (always beautiful Juliette Binoche) as a glowing sample of a woman who seems to be framed in a foggy filter that returns to old classical cinemas. Chemistry is happening through a cup of tea and muffin, but Mary must be for previous intervention and must divide. <br /> <br /> Later, we treated Dan's narrow-minded, fun loving relatives who not only have a great breakfast together, but also use the intelligent and sweet little Dan as the back of many bachelor jokes. What I liked so much was that although family qualities may be considered unpleasant to some, I thought it was a great view of a large family that would not endanger parody or gross exaggeration. The Burns family is just a close, loving group of people who are most interested in Dan. There are amazingly inappropriate family moments that are not unrealistic. The family is excited, but never means that she likes or kills; but never unconventional. And then Dan falls in love with his brother's girlfriend, whom he brought to the family gathering. And so the roller coaster begins with a steady tone and fun love. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I just thought this movie was just amazing. It's not "hip" or "clever", never too seductive and obsessed with dry humor or bit, because there is a lot of comedy in modern cinema. There is a nice balance of visual visuals and fun but real dialogue. In fact, soon in the movie, the initial spark of love starts with a moody conversation in a classic Hollywood conversation where the characters say what they think aloud. <br /> <br /> So I'm probably going out and I've been repeating myself, but I really recommend "Dan in Real Life". It's a great movie, believe me, you laugh and only when you're a geek like me, you get a little tearful eyes. Filled with fun and magical love, "Dan in Real Life" will not disappoint. <br /> <br /> =================== 3.5 of 4 stars Grade A
