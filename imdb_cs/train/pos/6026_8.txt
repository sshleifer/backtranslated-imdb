This film has a strong philosophical ending. But this end only makes sense when you look at the film from the beginning. <br /> <br /> A young man's and young woman's offense of youth in the late sixties is an obvious subject of Zabriskie Point. Neither Mark Frechette nor Daria Halprin had much of an acting experience, a fact that actually sent the message of the film. Having untrained actors expresses a sense of realism, as both players look emotionally detachable from the riots around them. <br /> <br /> It's not a script movie. In addition to the first ten minutes, it's mostly visual, with amazing cinematography. Beautiful naturalistic images seem to be other secular and perfectly synchronized with the emotional departments of Mark and Donations. <br /> <br /> I would replace the theme song Pink Floyd with the more polite music The Doors. Many scenes shout "Riders on the Storm". <br /> <br /> I still like this movie. It is different; it's unique; it is artistic and imaginative. And the desert badlands are beautiful. As the years approach, "Zabriskie Point" seems to be getting more and more attractive. It raises the mood of the late 1960s in America. It is an amazing artistic, bohemian way. And the last eight minutes of the film is philosophically charming.
