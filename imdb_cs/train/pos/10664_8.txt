Does anyone have a shout of tears of joy when they watch this movie? I love it! One of my Top 10 films of all time. It just makes me feel good. I'm looking at the final serial number with all the cast members over and over and over again !!! Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is a child from IMHO! I've never seen the game, but I'm angry when I read reviews that say the game is better than the movie. Both are like apples and oranges. The film making process seldom delivers a finished product that is faithful to the original piece. I believe it's just because of fear of alienation from the public that many well-known works adapted to the screen do not change more than they are. It's a very good movie, it's very satisfying. That's all you need to know!
