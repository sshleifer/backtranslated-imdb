Brilliant film, another best movie for The Drunken Master (Jackie Chan). I recently bought it on the original VHS and I have not seen this movie for 15 years but still as good as it was. The game was terrible and the dabing was even worse, but the features that make this movie (and many other old Chinese kung-fu movies) great. The choreography is amazing and the story is basic. I have never seen the 36th Chamber of Shaolin, but I know it's the same movie, but Gordon liu plays San Te, but San Te in Thr Returns to the 36th Chamber has a different character. It has a lot of comedy and brilliant kung-fu.
