The return to the lost world was backed up with the Lost World version of 1992. In this sequel, the same five Challenger-led people return to the plateau where the group began drilling for oil that threatened to destroy the country. Gomez has something to do with it. They manage to beat the drills and the plateau is saved, much to the pleasure of the natives. Just like in The Lost World, which is seen only a few dinosaurs, they are made of rubber and include T-Rex and Ankylosaurus. John Ryhs-Davies and David Warner repeat their roles as Challenger and Summerlee and three other actors are also back. Despite reading a few bad reviews and those cheap-looking rubber dinosaurs, I enjoyed the Return to the Lost World. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars of 5.
