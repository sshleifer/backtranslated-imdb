As a rule, the full moon production logos are a warning sign to prevent the film. But because I enjoyed Jeffrey Combs in other films, I gave him a shot. That's not bad. It's not great, but that's different. The film involves fighting a mysterious (bad) "brother" who wants to dominate the worlds and the title character. Dr. Mordrid also has to deal with people and authorities in the secular world who are doing well. <br /> <br /> Maybe spoilers follow. <br /> <br /> Mordrid can travel between "dimensions" to find a companion who guards the fort; But the guard was blind. His eyes are destroyed by the pit. So the wizard goes through his hands through the other eyes and hey, still! His eyes were restored! This kind of healing seems to work only with the eyes. Later Mordred and his "brother" animate a few animal skeletons in the museum to fight. Guess which one will win. However, since the picture is not bad at all, though like a comic book. Dr. Mordred's "human" adventures are all right, and Combs plays the role convincingly. I've seen a lot worse.
