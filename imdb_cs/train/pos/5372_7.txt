From the first five episodes of Hammer's short-running Hammer House of Horror series, this fifth episode, with the wonderful name "House Bled to Death," is probably the smartest. As a great fan of Gothic Horror, Hammer Studios has been wondering for so many years that it takes me so long to finally start watching serials recently. So far I've only seen the first five episodes and I have a strong feeling that the best comes, but even if the series were fun as the first five episodes, I will be happy. While the second and third episodes were great to watch their morbid and brilliant dark sense of humor, this fifth record is definitely one of the first five to bring the most likely horror. The episode begins when an elderly man kills his wife with unknown motivations. A few years later, William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) moved to the house with their little daughter Sophie (Emma Ridley). Soon after the raid, the family must find out that there is something terribly wrong in the house, which is seemingly creepy ... Francis Megahy's second episode is much better than his average previous record, Growing Pains (Episode 4), and relatively unknown actors provide good performances. The film is also great in terms of effects, cinema and score. "House Bled to Death" is a solid episode that brings elements that my fellow Hammer fans would like to see in Short Horror. The film brings a spooky atmosphere, true rescue moments and intelligent twists and is thrilling and very entertaining from start to finish. Overall, it's highly recommended for Hammer fans.
