One of my favorite films with a very nostalgic ending. The film is about Sullivan's family, apparently Michael Sullivan (father) is one of the major members of the mafia, a killer who calls it and expert. One of the kids wants to know the work of their father (a terrible mistake), so he's hiding on his father's car and well, Tom Hanks sees in action to say that. <br /> <br /> Mafia is not driving, mafia no one wins when they want you, they will bring you out. Of course, you can see anyone working at a mafia with a huge house, the best car in the world, whatever you want, but doing bad work or doing something your "boss" does not want, and you are thrown away and killed. You can see what I mean in the movie, Sullivan Jr. sees something he should not see, and well, almost all of his family are killed for his "bad thing" by his son. The movie is really fun, you see Sullivan live after a Mafia or something like that. The movie is a bit sad, shows us revenge, you dirty work people do, almost everything you like. Let's hope this guy reads this comment, does not work for the mafia, and if you work with the mafia, do a favor and leave the country before your boss and their laborers kill you. <br /> This movie gets: 10/10
