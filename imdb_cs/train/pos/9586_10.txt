The film really challenges your ideas about the identity and society we live in. It is well made and very strong. The characters in the film are sincere and reveal the world that exists outside the normative ideological perspective. I believe it gives a great insight into the subculture that shakes the very ideas the audience has about society. It is sometimes shocking and, for that, stronger. Some parts were difficult to trace, because most facts are, but are not complete. It's good when you watch it for the first time, but it's better second or third time; because you had the opportunity to wrap your mind around the topics they are discussing and turning to you.
