An ugly, ugly, ugly retroactive thriller, about a bodyguard who is determined to find (and destroy!) The killer of the girl he was supposed to protect. This film is almost anachronistic in today's politically correct atmosphere. Director Scott has no desire to justify himself as an inherent immorality behind the dramatic structure of the film. Scott is either unaware of or does not care about 30 years of social advances. I really do not think we will see more violent film in the near future, so it is better to go and see this as long as possible. Despite my inexorable gloom, I think film is a powerful example of the film most sinister, exploitative, and effective. Scott is hard to sell, but I think I'm a buyer. The extraordinary technical aspects of this film are too uncomfortable for me. Scott's directing choices are just amazing, and he pulls a great performance from Denzel Washington. Sensitive souls need to stay away from this, but I have recommended them to those who are looking for great action movies.
