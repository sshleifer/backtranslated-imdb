I must say that the worst part of the film was the first half hour. I was really confused who was who. For example, Bill Paxson had long hair and had jackets. Then, when all the men arrived at the camp, it turned out that there was a character who looked like Bill Paxson, but it was not. I said where is Bill Paxson? Then he was with his girlfriend a guy. He said she was 21. She was the 20 year old camp director (Alan Arkin) who was the most memorable. Later that same girl communicated and talked about her experiences from the camp. It did not make sense. It should be one year. That means the movie turned out to be pretty good. Kevin Pollak was a nice guy who was always irritated. One person was a complete narcissist and eventually lost his beautiful girlfriend. Alan Arkin was interesting as an old camp director, who admits he did not touch the young youth. The best thing was that none of the adult camps were successful in life. None of them had a big career. It seemed very real life. The film was compared to The Big Chill. In some ways it was not as exciting as Big Chill, but it was much more realistic. So, although the beginning is not promising, the movie eventually turned out to be pretty good.
