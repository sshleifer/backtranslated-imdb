Does anyone know where this movie was shot? The flight scene on the cliff is beautiful. It seems to be England. However, Ivy's apartment house looks like Brill Building with fascinating lifts. Charles Mendl is featured as "Sir Charles Gage". Maybe I blinked but I never saw him. Maybe she was a husband's lawyer, but I do not know again that there's anything other than the fact that I mentioned that I called. Maybe he was on the air scene? Or the hall scene? Has anyone found it? <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall was 57 years old when he shot the film.
