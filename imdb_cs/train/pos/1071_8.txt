definitely needed little work in season 2. Such as the Virus between Max and Logan, and Ames White along with his ancient super cult. During the second season, however, I was the only one who was following me to see if Max and Logan ever get rid of an unpleasant virus that infects Max. Very good track in the second season. But, of course, like all TV shows, if something is wrong about it, the sending company will take it out of the air. I was really promising for the third and final season. Season 2 lets you hang out if you do not read Max Alan Collin's books, then you'll know what's going to happen. Dark Angel should be back in the air for another season, though it can cost a lot just to get all the original actors back. because the sky of carrier Jessica Alby accelerated after the performance. If so, then the movie should be completed. as well as the Firefly show, which of course canceled FOX as well.
