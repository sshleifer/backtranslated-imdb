I enjoyed this movie very much. I've always been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg, and this film just highlights it. She is displaying a woman in an African-American family who moves along the social chain for the success of her husband (Danny Glover) as a lawyer. It moves into the entire white neighborhood where people are friendly but a little scary to her. Various events that occur during the movie cause some laugh but mostly appeal to other emotions. This movie is not as comedy as drama. I give it a strong 8/10. I strongly recommend that you catch her on TV or hire her soon.
