I just saw this movie the other day when I rented it, and I thought it was just another movie with a girl trying to prove it, but Diane joined the box because she wanted it. I thought this movie was good. I gave him 8/10. That's good. Plus the movie with Michelle Rodriguez is always good. It's only six.
