Diego Armando Maradona was and still remains the best player to play. Not just an athlete but an artist. This documentary, if the World Cup in 1986 will forever live in the memories of all football fans around the world. Because of his huge and incredible goal, which scored against my own country (England). There is absolutely no reason to reduce this star. Though I have no subordinate Spanish, I can appreciate the Argentinian narrator. He actually shouts happiness and barely can express his emotions ... Everything I've written can be absurd and difficult to understand, but readers ..... you have to watch to know what I mean.
